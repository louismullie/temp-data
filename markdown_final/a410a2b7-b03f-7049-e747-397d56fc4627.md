## Question

Vit d for SAD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin D supplementation helps for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and diagnostic criteria for SAD. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about vitamin D for SAD. Next, I will examine direct and indirect evidence, including RCTs and meta-analyses, and appraise their quality. After that, I need to consider mechanistic plausibility and confounding. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline what to do instead of vitamin D for SAD, with dosing and safety considerations if vitamin D is used for non-SAD reasons.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. SAD is a recurrent major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern, typically autumn/winter onset with spring/summer remission, and prevalence varies by latitude; first-line treatments include light therapy, antidepressants (especially SSRIs), and CBT, with bupropion having the strongest preventive evidence, so any consideration of vitamin D must be weighed against these established options [^aebb9c15] [^c4eff10a] [^fb5407b7].

> Wait, let me verify what authoritative guidelines say about vitamin D for SAD. The VA/DoD MDD guideline explicitly recommends against using vitamin D for treatment of major depressive disorder, including cases with a seasonal pattern, citing low-quality evidence and potential harms from high-dose supplementation; this is a weak-against recommendation and applies to MDD with seasonal features as well [^6f14cefe] [^7c5d12b6]. Hold on, I should also check bipolar guidance; the VA/DoD bipolar guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend nutritional supplements, including vitamin D, for mood symptoms in bipolar disorder, reinforcing that vitamin D is not a recommended mood treatment in this broader context either [^2a867104] [^cae892e4].

> I will now examine whether there is direct RCT evidence for vitamin D in SAD. I need to check carefully: multiple SAD-focused reviews and guidelines consistently state that evidence for vitamin D in SAD is limited, inconclusive, or insufficient, and I do not find high-quality RCTs specifically targeting SAD with vitamin D supplementation; instead, the literature emphasizes light therapy, antidepressants, and CBT as evidence-based options, with no endorsement of vitamin D for SAD treatment or prevention [^aebb9c15] [^c4eff10a] [^fb5407b7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be a small SAD RCT, but on rechecking, the SAD trials and meta-analyses in the packet address light therapy, bupropion prevention, and agomelatine/melatonin, not vitamin D, so there is a lack of direct SAD-specific vitamin D RCTs here [^c4eff10a] [^fb5407b7] [^9f298ea3].

> Next, I should review indirect evidence from general depression populations. Meta-analyses of RCTs show mixed and generally modest effects of vitamin D on depressive symptoms, with some dose–response signals but substantial heterogeneity and low to moderate certainty; importantly, many positive signals emerge in subgroup analyses (e.g., deficiency, shorter duration, specific populations) rather than consistent, clinically meaningful effects across MDD, and several analyses find no benefit on remission or in replete individuals [^d913351e] [^a4119154] [^641ead50]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even where effects are seen, they are small on average and often not replicated in high-quality, adequately powered trials, which tempers extrapolation to SAD [^d913351e] [^a4119154].

> I should double-check mechanistic plausibility. Vitamin D has biologically plausible pathways relevant to mood (serotonin regulation, neurotrophic effects, anti-inflammatory actions), and observational data link low vitamin D with depression, but these associations are vulnerable to confounding by sunlight exposure, outdoor activity, adiposity, and reverse causation; moreover, seasonality itself complicates inference, and some epidemiologic data show stronger associations in summer rather than winter, suggesting deficiency may be a consequence rather than a cause of mood symptoms [^0232d570] [^bfda6961] [^8b554cb6]. Let me reconsider: this means mechanistic plausibility does not translate into proven clinical efficacy for SAD in the absence of targeted, high-quality trials.

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. High-dose vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia, renal impairment, and drug interactions, and guidelines caution against routine high-dose supplementation for psychiatric indications; if vitamin D is used for documented deficiency, repletion should follow standard endocrine dosing principles rather than psychiatric dosing claims, and daily lower-dose strategies are generally preferred over intermittent high-dose boluses in older adults [^6f14cefe] [^bf897c4c]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies even when meta-analyses suggest higher short-term doses might show larger symptom changes; yes, those signals are hypothesis-generating and not practice-changing given heterogeneity, short follow-up, and safety concerns [^d913351e] [^a4119154].

> Let me synthesize the evidence quality. Direct evidence for vitamin D in SAD is essentially absent in this packet, indirect depression evidence is heterogeneous with small average effects and low certainty, and high-credibility guidelines recommend against vitamin D for MDD with seasonal features; taken together, the overall quality of evidence for vitamin D in SAD is very low, and any potential benefit is unproven and likely small at best [^6f14cefe] [^7c5d12b6] [^d913351e]. I should confirm that this aligns with primary care guidance; yes, contemporary family medicine summaries list light therapy, antidepressants, and CBT as first-line, with vitamin D not recommended for SAD treatment [^aebb9c15].

> Now, I should translate this into practical recommendations. For SAD, prioritize evidence-based treatments: bright light therapy (typically 10,000 lux for 30 minutes in the morning), SSRIs or bupropion as indicated, and CBT tailored to SAD; bupropion has the best preventive evidence if recurrence is predictable, and light therapy has supportive guidance for mild to moderate MDD with seasonal pattern [^c4eff10a] [^fb5407b7] [^a65d0c8b] [^bed7311d]. But wait, what if the patient is vitamin D deficient for non-psychiatric reasons? In that case, treat the deficiency per endocrine standards (commonly 800–2000 IU daily, or 50,000 IU weekly for about 6–8 weeks if severely deficient, then maintenance), monitor 25(OH)D and calcium, and avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day chronically without supervision; do not frame this as SAD treatment [^bf897c4c] [^6f14cefe].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Vitamin D supplementation is not recommended for the treatment or prevention of SAD given the lack of direct, high-quality evidence and guideline recommendations against its use for MDD with seasonal features; manage SAD with light therapy, antidepressants, and CBT, and reserve vitamin D for documented deficiency or other medical indications, not for mood outcomes [^6f14cefe] [^7c5d12b6] [^aebb9c15].

---

Vitamin D is **not recommended as a primary treatment** for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) because evidence for benefit is limited and inconsistent [^aebb9c15]. While some observational studies link low vitamin D to depression, **RCTs have not shown clear improvement** in SAD symptoms with supplementation [^d913351e] [^2aa2eb94]. Light therapy, antidepressants, and CBT remain first-line therapies [^c4eff10a] [^fb5407b7] [^bfcfc674]. Vitamin D may be considered only if deficiency is confirmed, with typical doses of 800–2,000 IU/day or 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then maintenance dosing; monitor for hypercalcemia and drug interactions [^bf897c4c] [^6f14cefe].

## Evidence for vitamin D supplementation in SAD

### Observational studies

Observational studies show an association between low vitamin D and depression, including SAD, but **cannot establish causality** [^8b554cb6]. For example, a large German survey found lower vitamin D was linked to more depressive symptoms in summer, suggesting the association may reflect lifestyle or reverse causation rather than a causal role [^bfda6961].

---

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

RCTs provide the highest-quality evidence; however, **results are mixed** and generally do not support vitamin D as a standalone treatment for SAD:

- A 2014 meta-analysis of six RCTs (1,203 participants) found no significant effect of vitamin D on depression scores overall (SMD = -0.14, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.13) [^2aa2eb94].
- A 2020 meta-analysis of 25 trials (7,534 participants) reported a modest reduction in negative emotions with vitamin D, but with high heterogeneity and limited applicability to SAD [^daeeebc3].
- A 2024 dose–response meta-analysis suggested potential benefit at higher doses (e.g. 8,000 IU/day) in the short term, but the evidence remains preliminary and not specific to SAD [^d913351e].

---

### Clinical guidelines

Major guidelines do not recommend vitamin D for SAD: the VA/DoD MDD guideline advises against vitamin D for MDD, including seasonal patterns, citing **insufficient evidence** [^6f14cefe] [^7c5d12b6]. The AAFP notes that evidence for vitamin D in SAD is inconclusive and does not list it as a first-line therapy [^aebb9c15].

---

## Mechanisms of vitamin D in mood regulation

Vitamin D may influence mood via several mechanisms, but **clinical relevance remains uncertain**:

- **Serotonin regulation**: Vitamin D may modulate serotonin synthesis, which is implicated in depression and SAD [^0232d570].
- **Circadian rhythms**: Vitamin D may influence circadian regulation, relevant to SAD's seasonal pattern [^f6b942b7].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties that could theoretically benefit depression, though clinical translation is unclear [^f6b942b7].

---

## Comparison with established SAD treatments

Vitamin D has not demonstrated efficacy comparable to **established SAD treatments**:

| **Treatment** | **Evidence level** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|
| Light therapy | High | Effective for SAD; first-line [^c4eff10a] [^a65d0c8b] |
| Antidepressants (SSRIs, bupropion) | Moderate | Effective for SAD; first-line [^5701ee7d] [^fb5407b7] |
| CBT | Moderate | Effective for SAD; first-line [^bfcfc674] |
| Vitamin D | Low | Inconsistent; not first-line [^2aa2eb94] [^aebb9c15] |

---

## Safety considerations

Vitamin D is generally safe at recommended doses, but **high doses can cause hypercalcemia**, renal impairment, and drug interactions (e.g. thiazide diuretics, digoxin). Routine high-dose supplementation without deficiency is not advised [^6f14cefe] [^15419e47].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Deficiency screening**: Consider testing 25(OH)D in patients with SAD who have risk factors for deficiency (e.g. limited sun exposure, dark skin, malabsorption).
- **Supplementation if deficient**: If deficiency is confirmed, treat with 800–2,000 IU/day or 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then maintain with 800–1,000 IU/day; monitor calcium and renal function if high doses are used.
- **Adjunctive use only**: Use vitamin D as an adjunct to evidence-based SAD treatments (light therapy, antidepressants, CBT), not as a substitute [^aebb9c15].
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for hypercalcemia symptoms (nausea, polyuria, confusion) and drug interactions.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Vitamin D is **not recommended as a primary treatment** for SAD due to limited and inconsistent evidence [^aebb9c15]. It may be considered only when deficiency is documented, with dosing aligned to endocrine guidance and close monitoring. Light therapy, antidepressants, and CBT remain the evidence-based mainstays of care [^c4eff10a] [^fb5407b7] [^bfcfc674].

### Seasonal affective disorder: common questions and answers [^aebb9c15]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Seasonal affective disorder is a mood disorder that is a subtype or qualifier of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is characterized by depressive symptoms that occur at a specific time of year (typically fall or winter) with full remission at other times of year (typically spring or summer). Possible risk factors include family history, female sex, living at a more northern latitude, and young adulthood (18 to 30 years of age). With the temporal nature of the mood episodes, diagnosis requires full remission when the specified season ends and two consecutive years of episodes in the same season. First-line therapy for seasonal affective disorder includes light therapy, antidepressants, and cognitive behavior therapy, alone or in combination. Commercial devices are available for administering light therapy or dawn simulation. The light intensity and duration of treatment depend on the device and the patient's initial response, but 2,500 to 10,000 lux for 30 to 60 minutes at the same time every day is typically effective. Lifestyle interventions, such as increasing exercise and exposure to natural light, are also recommended. If seasonal affective disorder recurs, long-term treatment or preventive intervention is typically indicated, and bupropion appears to have the strongest evidence supporting long-term use. Continuing light therapy or other antidepressants is likely beneficial, although evidence is inconclusive. Evidence is also inconclusive for psychotherapy and vitamin D supplementation.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d913351e]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our dose–response meta-analysis of randomized trials demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation may result in a large improvement in depressive symptoms at follow-up shorter than 24 weeks. The greatest impact was seen at 8000 IU/day, and higher doses had no added value in reducing depressive symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation had no effects on depression remission and anxiety symptoms. More trials with high quality are needed to test the long-term efficacy of vitamin D supplementation, considering baseline vitamin D levels of individuals, on depressive symptoms, as well as on depression remission and anxiety symptoms.

Vitamin D and psychiatric conditions — "Adequate vitamin D levels in pregnancy are associated with decreased risk of schizophrenia"; conversely, "low levels of sun exposure are associated with seasonal affective disorder and mood disturbances." It is noted that "Vitamin D–sufficient states in the mother and infant are thought to be associated with a lower risk of bipolar disorder," and that "Low maternal vitamin D levels may have an impact on fetal brain maturation, given that vitamin D is also involved in development and functioning of the nervous system."

### Effect of adjunctive single dose parenteral vitamin D supplementation in major depressive disorder with concurrent vitamin D deficiency: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial [^4f83676c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Adjunctive vitamin D replacement is a theoretically promising strategy to improve outcomes in major depression. Our objective was to assess the efficacy of a single parenteral dose of vitamin D supplementation at baseline as an adjunct to treatment as usual on change in depression symptom ratings (primary outcome), quality of life and clinical severity of illness (secondary outcomes) at the end of 12 weeks when compared to treatment as usual in patients with major depression and concurrent Vitamin D deficiency. Eligible participants were randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU; n = 23) or TAU plus single parenteral dose of 3,00,000 IU of vitamin D (n = 23) at baseline. Rater-blinded assessments of depression (primary outcome), quality of life (QoL) and clinical severity of illness were obtained at baseline, and end of follow-up (12 weeks). Intent-to-treat analyses were performed on the entire randomized sample. The intervention significantly improved depression symptom ratings, quality of life and clinical severity of illness at the end of the treatment phase. These findings indicate that a single parenteral dose (3,00,000 IU) of adjunctive vitamin D replacement at baseline is an effective and well tolerated intervention in major depressive disorder with concurrent Vitamin D deficiency. Additionally, it points to a possible role for vitamin D in the pathophysiology of depression and supports personalized approaches for treatment of major depressive disorder.

### Efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in depression in adults: a systematic review [^2aa2eb94]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of vitamin D (Vit D) in depression provided inconsistent results.

Objective

We aim to summarize the evidence of RCTs to assess the efficacy of oral Vit D supplementation in depression compared to placebo.

Data Sources

We searched electronic databases, two conference proceedings, and gray literature by contacting authors of included studies.

Study Selection

We selected parallel RCTs investigating the effect of oral Vit D supplementation compared with placebo on depression in adults at risk of depression, with depression symptoms or a primary diagnosis of depression.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data from relevant literature.

Data Synthesis

Classical and Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool relative risk, odds ratio, and standardized mean difference. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool.

Results

Six RCTs were identified with 1203 participants (72% females) including 71 depressed patients; five of the studies involved adults at risk of depression, and one trial used depressed patients. Results of the classical meta-analysis showed no significant effect of Vit D supplementation on postintervention depression scores (standardized mean difference = -0.14, 95% confidence interval = -0.41 to 0.13, P = 0.32; odds ratio = 0.93, 95% confidence interval = 0.54 to 1.59, P = 0.79). The quality of evidence was low. No significant differences were demonstrated in subgroup or sensitivity analyses. Similar results were found when Bayesian meta-analyses were applied.

Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of Vit D supplementation in depression symptoms, and more RCTs using depressed patients are warranted.

### Vitamin D supplementation for premenstrual syndrome-related mood disorders in adolescents with severe hypovitaminosis D [^13acb0c4]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) might become severe enough to interfere with normal interpersonal relationships. This study was planned to assess whether administration of vitamin D (200,000 IU at first, followed by 25,000 IU every 2 weeks) for a 4-month period might lessen the appearance and the intensity of mood disorders associated with PMS in young girls with severe hypovitaminosis D. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One hundred fifty-eight young girls (15–21 years old) with PMS-related severe symptoms of the emotional and cognitive domains and low serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D) levels (≤ 10 ng/mL) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups and treated for 4 months with vitamin D (group 1; n = 80) or placebo (group 2; n = 78). Clinical and hormonal effects were compared between the two groups.

Results

In patients from group 1, levels of vitamin D reached the normal range (35–60 ng/mL) after the first month and remained stable throughout the whole study. At the end of treatment, anxiety score decreased from 51 to 20 (P < .001 vs baseline); irritability score declined from 130 to 70 (P < .001 vs baseline). Crying easily and sadness decreased by a score of 41 and 51 to a score of 30 and 31, respectively (P < .001). For disturbed relationships, the score decreased from 150 to 70 (P < .001). Conversely, no appreciable changes were noted in symptom intensity from patients of group 2. The frequency of adverse events (nausea and constipation) was not different between participants of group 1 and group 2.

Conclusion

On the basis of the present findings, vitamin D therapy can be proposed as a safe, effective, and convenient method for improving the quality of life in young women with severe hypovitaminosis D and concomitant mood disorders associated with PMS.

### The effect of vitamin D supplement on negative emotions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^daeeebc3]. Depression and Anxiety (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The several meta-analyses of the effect of vitamin D on depression have produced inconsistent results and studies dealing with anxiety were not incorporated. There has been no comprehensive analysis of how results are affected by the nature of the sample or the dosage and duration of supplementation. The study is aimed to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces negative emotions and to analyze the possible influence of sample and regimen.

Method

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of vitamin D and placebo on negative emotion. Databases were searched for relevant articles published before February 2019.

Results

The analysis covered 25 trials with a total of 7,534 participants and revealed an effect of vitamin D on negative emotion (Hedges' g = -0.4990, 95% CI [-0.8453, -0.1528], p = .0047, I² = 97.7%). Subgroup analysis showed that vitamin D had an effect on patients with major depressive disorder and on subjects with serum 25(OH)D levels ≤ 50nmol/L. The pooled data from trials of vitamin D supplementation lasting ≥ 8weeks and dosage ≤ 4,000IU/day indicated that vitamin D had an effect.

Conclusions

Our results support the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation can reduce negative emotions. Patients with major depressive disorder and individuals with vitamin D deficiency are most likely to benefit from supplementation. But to interpret the results with high heterogeneity should still be cautious.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^2a867104]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — vitamin D supplementation indicates that evidence from two RCTs within two SRs found no difference between vitamin D and placebo for improving manic or depressive symptoms in individuals with BD, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low because of small sample sizes and imprecision.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bb2580ef]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Our primary outcomes were (1) the anxiety and depressive symptoms and (2) remission of depression. Moreover, our secondary outcomes included quality of life and its domains and total and serious adverse events.

Data extraction

The full texts of potentially eligible trials were examined separately by two investigators (SG and SZM). From studies considered eligible, the same two reviewers independently extracted the following characteristics from each trial: author and year of publication; population location, study design, and duration, characteristics of the population (% female, mean age ±, baseline body mass index, and health status), total sample size, intervention characteristics (dose of vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group), comparison group, vitamin D deficiency (yes/no/mixed), use of antidepressant medication (yes/no/mixed), dropout, baseline depression risk, outcome measures and main results for the outcomes included.

Risk of bias assessment

Version 2.0 of the Cochrane tool was used to assess the risk of bias of the eligible RCTs (Higgins et al.). Two authors (SG and SZM) independently performed risk of bias assessment. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (SS-B).

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial of vitamin D augmentation in major depressive disorder associated with vitamin D deficiency [^a3bf8944]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D (VitD) supplementation for depression have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted the first RCT of VitD supplementation with multipoint serum 25(OH)D assessments in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with concurrent severe VitD deficiency.

Methods

We randomized antidepressant-free depressed adults with mean baseline 25(OH)D of 11.5 ng/ml to VitD (60,000 IU every 5 days; n = 31) or placebo (n = 28) for 12 weeks. All patients also received escitalopram (10–20 mg/day). Patients were rated at baseline and at the end of weeks 4, 8, and 12. Serum 25(OH)D was estimated at baseline, week 8, and week 12.

Results

In an intent-to-treat analysis, mean Hamilton Depression Scale scores dropped from 25.7 to 5.7 and from 25.8 to 5.0 in VitD and placebo groups, respectively (primary outcome; P = 0.92). VitD and placebo groups did not differ on other objective and subjective ratings of depression, or on global ratings. Similar findings characterized completer analyses. No significant correlations were observed between 25(OH)D levels and depression ratings across the course of the study. Importantly, endpoint escitalopram doses were 4 mg/day higher in placebo than in VitD patients, and 4 mg/day higher in VitD deficient than in VitD sufficient patients.

Limitations

A ceiling effect with escitalopram may have prevented the discovery of benefits with VitD supplementation.

Conclusions

VitD supplementation does not improve antidepressant outcomes with flexibly dosed escitalopram. VitD deficient depressed patients may require higher antidepressant doses to experience benefits similar to those whose deficiency is corrected by VitD supplementation.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on primary depression: a meta-analysis [^af8554d5]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses reported inconsistent results on the effect of vitamin D on depression because of different baseline concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], highlighting the need for a more accurate subgroup analysis of previously published findings. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression in adults.

Methods

A systematic search in numerous databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed. Randomized-controlled trials comparing the effect of vitamin D on depression in adults were selected.

Results

Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria in the retrieved citations. The meta-analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation had a significant effect on overall reduction in depression symptom scores (SMD = -0.15, 95% CI [-0.26, -0.04]). Sub-group analysis showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced depressive symptom scores in patients with serum 25(OH)D levels higher than 50 nmol/L (SMD = -0.38, 95% CI [-0.68, -0.08]).

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation has a benefit on improving depressive symptoms in adults with primary depression and 25(OH)D levels higher than 50 nmol/L but has no effect on improving depressive symptoms in adults with primary depression and 25(OH)D levels lower than 50 nmol/L. Relatively high levels of 25(OH)D maybe required for alleviating depression.

Limitations

The randomized studies included in this study were designed and completed at different times and countries, the variability in duration and dose of vitamin D supplementation may have introduced significant heterogeneity and have militated against observation of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^50668568]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Depression is the most common psychiatric disease worldwide, with an immense cognitive, social, and economic burden (Malhi & Mann). Currently, approximately 280 million people are affected by depression (GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators,), making depression the leading cause of losing years of life due to disability (Friedrich; World Health). The World Health Organization ranked major depression as the third leading cause of disease worldwide and predicted that it will be the first public health concern by 2030 (World Health). Anxiety is also one of the most common mental health problems, with global estimates ranging from 3.8 to 25% across countries. Since 1990, there has been a 50% increase in the absolute number of patients with anxiety disorders (Z. Zhang et al.). Additionally, research around the world has reported an increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak (COVID-19 Mental Disorders Collaborators).

During the past decades, many prominent basic and clinical studies have been carried out to elucidate the underlying causes of depression (Saveanu & Nemeroff). A variety of factors including genetic predisposition, cognitive dysfunctions, stressful life events, interpersonal dysfunction, biological differences, and inherited traits are implicated in developing depression and anxiety (Altemus, Sarvaiya, & Neill Epperson; Hammen; Morssinkhof et al; Penner-Goeke & Binder). Studies in nutritional psychiatry have suggested some evidence of the role of dietary factors in developing depression and management of depressive symptoms (Marx et al; Pano et al.). Furthermore, some studies investigated the effect of single micronutrient supplementation such as folate (Altaf, Gonzalez, Rubino, & Nemec; Jin et al.), zinc (Yosaee et al.), alpha-tocopherol (Lee et al.), iron (Huang, Bilgrami, & Hare,), and vitamin D (Parker, Brotchie, & Graham,) on depression management. Of note, due to its possible role in the function of the brain, vitamin D has received much attention among micronutrients (Anglin, Samaan, Walter, & McDonald).

### Vitamin D and the risk of treatment-resistant and atypical depression: a mendelian randomization study [^8aab3792]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

MDD is a heterogenous mental health condition with several subtypes, implying diverse biological underpinnings and potentially diverging requirements in therapeutic approaches. One such subtype is treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Common treatments for MDD include antidepressant drugs and psychotherapies. Approximately 30% of MDD patients do not respond to antidepressants or psychotherapy and are referred to as having TRD. Vitamin D deficiency may be involved in the persistence of depressive symptoms despite antidepressant treatment, in these MDD patients. Another subtype of MDD is atypical depression (AD). The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) defines AD as depression that comprises mood reactivity and at least two of the following symptoms: hypersomnia, increased appetite or weight gain, leaden paralysis, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Approximately 15–29% of patients with MDD have AD, which is associated with more chronic course of disease and poorer response to treatment. Currently, there is a critical need for new treatments for patients with TRD, and treatment guidelines for AD are lacking.

In the current study, we use both observational and genetic information to evaluate the effects of exposure to higher vitamin D on the risk of TRD and AD, in order to assess the case for potential trialling of vitamin D supplementation in these patient groups.

### Vitamin D supplementation to prevent depression and poor physical function in older adults: study protocol of the D-vitaal study, a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial [^3f68d1a1]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Methods/design

Design of the study

The D-Vitaal study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that is carried out in the Netherlands. This study examines the effect of a daily dose of 1200 IU vitamin D 3 versus placebo on depressive symptoms, functional limitations and physical performance. We included 155 participants aged 60–80 years. The duration of the intervention is one year. The D-Vitaal trial was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Centre Amsterdam and is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register under. The D-Vitaal study adheres to the CONSORT guidelines for randomized controlled trials.

Participants

Potential participants were screened for presence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms, functional limitations and low serum 25(OH)D levels (≤ 50 or ≤ 70 nmol/L in winter (October-March) and summer (April-September), respectively). In this way, we recruited a vulnerable population at high risk of subsequent mental and physical function decline. As severe 25(OH)D deficiency can be associated with bone disease, persons with 25(OH)D levels of < 15 nmol/L were excluded and referred to their GP for treatment. In addition, persons with a current MDD diagnosis were excluded, as the aim of this study is to prevent depression. Furthermore, persons who use antidepressant medication were excluded at screening because of possible interference of antidepressants with the effect of vitamin D on depressive symptoms. Persons with sufficient concentrations of 25(OH)D (> 50 or > 70 nmol/L in winter and summer, respectively) were also excluded, as it was expected that the effect of supplementation in these persons would be negligible. The summer/winter cut-off difference of 20 nmol/L was based on the observation by Van Schoor et al. that the seasonal variation of vitamin D levels in two cohorts of Dutch older persons was 14–24 nmol/L. The Health Council of the Netherlands advises a supplement of 800 IU/day vitamin D for institutionalized persons. Therefore, only community dwelling persons were included in the trial. Table 3 lists the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the D-Vitaal study. All participants provided written informed consent prior to the start of the intervention.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^641ead50]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to investigate the dose-dependent effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults. Our results presented evidence of moderate certainty of the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms in adults. We did not find any significant effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression remission and anxiety symptoms. Vitamin D 3 supplementation had no effects on quality of life.

Evidence from population-based epidemiological studies is consistent with the hypothesis that low serum vitamin D concentration is associated with a higher risk of depression (Anglin et al; Ju et al.). Furthermore, our findings are consistent with existing evidence presented by meta-analysis of RCTs about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms. A recent meta-analysis of 11 trials indicated that vitamin D 3 supplementation improved the Beck Depression Inventory score in patients with psychiatric disorders (Jamilian et al.). The results of another recent meta-analysis including 29 trials with 4504 participants indicated that the use of vitamin D 3 may be beneficial to decrease the incidence of depression and improvement of depression symptoms (Xie et al.). Moreover, another meta-analysis of four trials with 948 participants showed that vitamin D 3 supplementation positively impacted depression rating in patients with major depression (Vellekkatt & Menon). However, there is some conflicting evidence, suggesting that oral administration of vitamin D 3 did not have a significant effect on the reduction of post-intervention depression score (Lázaro Tomé et al.).

### Vitamin D supplementation to prevent depression and poor physical function in older adults: study protocol of the D-vitaal study, a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial [^f867554c]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Depressive symptoms and decreased physical functioning are interrelated conditions and common in older persons, causing significant individual and societal burden. Evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for both mental and physical functioning. However, previous randomized controlled trials have yielded inconsistent results and often had suboptimal designs. This study examines the effect of vitamin D supplementation on both depressive symptoms and physical functioning in a high-risk population of older persons with low vitamin D status.

Methods/design

The D-Vitaal study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effects of a daily dose of 1200 IU vitamin D 3 versus placebo for one year on depressive symptoms and physical functioning (primary outcomes) in older adults. Participants (N = 155, age 60–80 years) were recruited from the general population. Eligibility criteria included the presence of depressive symptoms, ≥ 1 functional limitation and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 15 and 50/70 nmol/L (depending on season). Secondary outcomes include incidence of major depressive disorder, anxiety symptoms, health-related quality of life, cognitive function and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

Discussion

With this study, we aim to elucidate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms and physical functioning in older persons who are at high risk of developing more substantial mental and physical problems. If effective, vitamin D supplementation can be a preventive intervention strategy that is easy to implement in the primary care setting.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a4119154]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The impact of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the dose-dependent effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive and anxiety symptoms in adults. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to December 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults. Using a random-effects model, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each 1000 IU/day vitamin D 3 supplementation. The GRADE tool assessed the certainty of evidence. Our analysis included 31 trials with 24189 participants. Each 1000 IU/day vitamin D 3 supplementation slightly reduced depressive symptoms in individuals with and without depression (SMD: −0.32, 95% CI −0.43 to −0.22; GEADE = moderate). The effect was more pronounced in those with depressive symptoms (SMD: −0.57, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.44; n = 15). The greatest reduction occurred at 8000 IU/day (SMD: −2.04, 95% CI −3.77 to −0.31). Trials with follow-up ≤ 8 weeks (SMD: −0.45, 95% CI −0.70 to −0.20; n = 8) and 8 to ≤ 24 weeks (SMD: −0.47, 95% CI −0.70 to −0.24; n = 15) showed stronger effects compared to those lasting 24 to ≤ 52 weeks (SMD: −0.13, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.02; n = 5) or longer than 52 weeks (SMD: 0.14, 95% CI −0.16 to 0.44; n = 3) (p group difference < 0.001). Vitamin D 3 supplementation had no significant effects on anxiety symptoms. In summary, this study suggests that vitamin D 3 supplementation may effectively reduce depressive symptoms in short term. Further high-quality trials are warranted for a conclusive assessment of its impact on anxiety.

### Vitamin D and depression [^0c0f6ae7]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency is associated with depression and whether vitamin D supplementation is an effective treatment for depression.

Method

Empirical papers published in recent years were identified using three search engines and online databases - PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane Database. Specific search terms used were 'vitamin D', 'depression' and 'treatment' and articles were selected that examined the association between vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and depression, vitamin D supplementation and Vitamin D as a treatment for depression. Our review weighted more recent studies (from 2011), although also considered earlier publications.

Results

Empirical studies appear to provide increasing evidence for an association between vitamin D insufficiency and depression, and for vitamin D supplementation and augmentation in those with clinical depression who are vitamin D deficient. Methodological limitations associated with many of the studies are detailed.

Limitations

Articles were restricted to those in the English language while publication bias may have weighted studies with positive findings.

Conclusions

There remains a need for empirical studies to move beyond cross-sectional designs to undertake more randomised controlled longitudinal trials so as to clarify the role of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of depression and its management, as well as to establish whether currently suggested associations are clinically significant and distinctive.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cf00b509]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

However, there were also some limitations in the present meta-analysis. First, other factors may act as a moderator in the association between vitamin D supplementation and depressive symptoms. Although we did several subgroup analyses by participants and study characteristics, several unknown variables can affect the results. Second, we had limited evidence about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression remission and severity of anxiety. In addition, a subgroup analysis by intervention duration suggested that vitamin D supplementation was no longer effective in reducing depressive symptoms at follow-up longer than 52 weeks. Also, we included adults regardless of their depression, anxiety, and health status. Finally, despite efforts to identify all relevant studies, publication bias may have influenced the findings, as studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published. Therefore, more trials are needed to test the long-term efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms, as well as on depression remission and anxiety symptoms.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^b92e6c0c]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

One study reported the effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on the odds of depression remission (Marsh et al.). Vitamin D 3 supplementation had no significant effect on depression remission (online Supplementary Figure 4 and Table 3).

A total of seven trials with 332 individuals in the intervention group and 309 individuals in the control group provided data on the effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on the severity of anxiety (Choukri et al; Dean et al; Fazelian et al; Ghaderi et al; Khalighi Sikaroudi et al; Zhu et al.). Our analysis showed that every 1000 IU/day of vitamin D 3 did not significantly reduce the severity of anxiety (online Supplementary Figure 6 and Table 3).

Secondary outcomes

The effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on secondary outcomes is demonstrated in online Supplementary Figure (7–20) and Table (3). < TE: Please check this is supplementary table citation or actual table ciation?. Opening bracket missing here. > Vitamin D 3 supplementation had no effects on secondary outcomes including adverse events and different aspects of quality of life.

Grading of the evidence

The GRADE evidence rating for primary and secondary outcomes is presented in online Supplementary Table 8. The certainty of the evidence was rated moderate for the effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depressive symptoms due to a downgrade for inconsistency and an upgrade for the dose–response gradient. The certainty of evidence was rated very low to low for other outcomes (× Table 3). Of note, the effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depressive symptoms surpassed the threshold set as large effect size (SMD: −1.2 to −2) in the nonlinear dose–response meta-analysis, suggesting that supplementation with vitamin D 3 at a dose of 8000 IU/day could lead to a large improvement in depressive symptoms.

### Vitamin D and schizophrenia: 20 years on… [^4dea9692]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation in patients with schizophrenia

In keeping with the poor general health status of patients, osteoporosis is highly prevalent (~52%) in patients with schizophrenia. As vitamin D supplementation is the recommended treatment for osteoporosis, there exists the opportunity to assess whether vitamin D also affects schizophrenia symptomology. To date, three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation either in conjunction with probiotics or maintenance antipsychotic treatment have been conducted. One study showed that vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU vitamin D/week for 12 weeks) improved positive and negative syndrome scale scores and metabolic profiles including reduction in fasting plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels. The other two clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation (300,000 IU intramuscular injection twice within 3 months, or 14,000 IU oral drops per week for 8 weeks) in patients maintaining antipsychotic treatment did not find any significant improvement in symptoms. Other small open-labeled studies also show inconsistent outcomes. One study had shown that 12 months of vitamin D supplementation in schizophrenic patients without hospitalization is associated with lower depressive symptoms and lower rates of current anxiety, whereas earlier studies using either 2000 IU orally daily for 8 weeks or low dose dietary (ergocalciferol 400 IU daily for 7 months) did not observe any improvement in symptoms (Supplementary Table 3). So until the results from large-scale, randomized, doubled-blinded placebo-controlled trials intentionally designed to assess the therapeutic effects of vitamin D in patients with schizophrenia such as the DFEND trial are known, at this stage vitamin D supplementation should be recommended for the prevention of osteoporosis, but not the treatment of schizophrenia symptoms.

Is developmental vitamin D deficiency a biologically plausible risk factor for schizophrenia?

### Vitamin D does not reduce depressive symptoms on primary depression: critical appraisal and re-analysis of Wang et al [^6880d75a]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In this critical appraisal of a meta-analysis on vitamin D for primary depression, we uncovered several methodological issues, including deviations from stated eligibility criteria, questionable analytical decisions, and the omission of a high-quality clinical trial in the subgroup analyses that supported their main conclusions. Our revised meta-analysis found no evidence of subgroup differences and no statistically significant effects within either subgroup. Moreover, we identified two influential outliers that overstate the effect favoring vitamin D. These findings suggest that the conclusions drawn by Wang et al. were influenced by an incorrect interpretation of a flawed analysis. Our findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation does not appear to confer a clinically meaningful benefit for reducing depressive symptoms, regardless of patients' baseline vitamin D status.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f6b942b7]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Our subgroup analyses also highlighted a significant subgroup difference by intervention duration, where trials with an intervention duration of ≤ 8 weeks and 8 to ≤ 24 weeks indicated a stronger effect than those with 24 to ≤ 52 weeks. Of note, an increasing effect was seen among trials with an intervention duration of > 52 weeks. Regarding the length of the intervention, '8 weeks' was identified as the window of time that may start the vitamin D response, whether in the prevention or therapy of depression (Xie et al.). The decline in the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in reducing depressive symptoms can be explained by attrition bias, lower compliance, and higher dropout in trials with longer intervention durations.

There are several possible physiological mechanisms to explain why vitamin D 3 supplementation is effective in treating depression. These mechanisms include its impacts on cellular signaling, neurotropic and immunomodulatory processes, serotonin synthesis, expression of mitochondrial proteins, increasing the expression of vitamin D 3 receptors in important brain regions, and decreasing levels of C-reactive protein, as an inflammatory marker linked to depression (Geng et al.). Moreover, oxidative stress can be a contributing factor to depression. Vitamin D has important antioxidant properties and thus, may have therapeutic effects against depressive symptoms (Penckofer et al; Thurfah, Christine, Bagaskhara, Alfian, & Puspitasari; Vellekkatt & Menon). Vitamin D may also affect the serotonin system and maintain circadian rhythms, which are linked to depression (Casseb, Kaster, & Rodrigues; Ceolin, Mano, Hames, Antunes, & Moreira).

### Management of seasonal affective disorder [^ef0f5861]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Low mood associated with a certain season (usually winter) is very common. For example, in the UK, up to 6% of adults have "recurrent major depressive episodes with seasonal pattern", commonly known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). People with SAD consult in primary care more often than age- and gender-matched control groups; patients also receive more prescriptions and are referred more often to secondary care. Around 6–35% of patients require hospitalisation for SAD at some point.5 Here we discuss the management of adults with SAD, and in particular light therapy.

### Low vitamin D is associated with negative and depressive symptoms in psychotic disorders [^afac1c9a]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are indications that low S-25(OH)D is associated with increased disease severity in psychotic disorder. Our first aim was to investigate the relations between low S-25(OH)D and positive, negative and depressive symptoms. Our second aim was to explore if associations between S-25(OH)D and symptoms were influenced by levels of inflammatory markers.

Methods

Participants (N = 358) with a medical history of one or more psychotic episodes were recruited. Current symptomatology was assessed by The Structured Interview for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scaleanalyzed by a five-factor model. The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia was used to assess depression and suicidal ideation. Blood samples were analyzed for S-25(OH)D, CRP, sTNF-R1, IL-Ra and OPG. We performed bivariate correlations and multiple regression models to evaluate the effect of S-25(OH)D on the outcomes.

Results

Low S-25(OH)D was significantly associated with negative symptoms (adjusted R 2 = 0.113, F(6,357) = 8.58, p < 0.001) and with depression (adjusted R 2 = 0.045, F(4,357) = 5.233, p < 0.001) when adjusting for possible confounding factors (i.e.g.ender, education, diagnose, hospitalization status, ethnicity, season and thyroid status). CRP was correlated with both S-25(OH)D (rho = -0.13, p = 0.02) and negative symptoms (rho = 0.14, p = 0.01), but did not act as a mediator. The correlations between S-25(OH)D and the inflammatory markers sTNF-R1, IL-Ra and OPG were not significant.

Conclusion

There is a strong association between low S-25(OH)D and higher negative and depressive symptoms in psychotic disorders. Randomized controlled trials should be performed to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation as adjuvant treatment strategy in patients with prominent negative or depressive symptoms.

### The protective effect of vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants on brain structural and functional connectivity of patients with major depressive disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^07960809]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Growing evidence points to the pivotal role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the brain of MDD patients.

Methods

We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial in 46 MDD patients, who were randomly allocated into either VD (antidepressant medication + vitamin D supplementation) or NVD (antidepressant medication + placebos) groups. Data from diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, serum vitamin D concentration, and clinical symptoms were obtained at baseline and after an average of 7 months of intervention.

Results

Both VD and NVD groups showed significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms but with no significant differences between the two groups. However, a greater increase in serum vitamin D concentration was found to be associated with greater improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms in VD group. More importantly, neuroimaging data demonstrated disrupted white matter integrity of right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus along with decreased functional connectivity between right frontoparietal and medial visual networks after intervention in NVD group, but no changes in VD group.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants may not only contribute to improvement in clinical symptoms but also help preserve brain structural and functional connectivity in MDD patients.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^2631c36a]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary outcomes

A total of 31 trials with 12 098 participants in the intervention group and 12 091 participants in the control group provided data on the effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on the depressive symptoms (Alavi et al; Alghamdi et al; Bertone-Johnson et al; Choukri et al; de Koning et al; Dean et al; Eid et al; Fazelian et al; Frandsen et al; Gaughran et al; Ghaderi et al; Hansen et al; Jorde & Kubiak; Jorde et al; Kaviani et al; Khalighi Sikaroudi et al; Krivoy et al; Kusmiyati et al; Marsh et al; Okereke et al; Omidian et al; Rolf et al; Sepehrmanesh et al; Sharifi et al; Vellekkatt et al; Vieth et al; Wang et al; Zhang et al; Zheng et al; Zhu et al.). Every 1000 IU/day vitamin D 3 supplementation slightly reduced depressive symptoms (SMD: −0.32; 95% CI −0.43 to −0.22; I² = 98%; P heterogeneity < 0.001, GEADE = moderate) (online Supplementary Figure 2). Of note, vitamin D supplementation resulted in a larger improvement in depressive symptoms in those with a history of depression (SMD: −0.57, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.44; n = 15 trials) (× Table 1).

### Vitamin D supplementation in bipolar depression: a double blind placebo controlled trial [^f413d761]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Bipolar depression is difficult to treat. Vitamin D supplementation is well tolerated and may improve mood via its neurotransmitter synthesis regulation, nerve growth factor enhancement and antioxidant properties. Vitamin D adjunct reduces unipolar depression, but has not been tried in bipolar depression.

Methods

18-70yos with DSM IV bipolar depression and Vitamin D deficiency (< 30 ng/ml) were randomized in a controlled double blind trial of 5000IU Vitamin D 3 po qday supplementation versus placebo for twelve weeks. Change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), medication, and tolerance were assessed q2weeks.

Results

16 VitD vs 17 placebo subjects did not differ in baseline characteristics (mean = 44 yo, SD = 13), VitD level (19.2 ± 65.8 g/ml vs 19.3 ± 5.5 ng/ml respectively) or mood ratings (MADRS 21.3 ± 6.4 vs 22.8 ± 6.9 respectively). At 12wks, the placebo group VitD levels remained unchanged, while the VitD group levels increased to 28 ng/ml. MADRS score decreased significantly in both placebo (mean = 6.42 (95% CI [2.28 to 10.56]) and VitD groups (mean = 9.54 (95% CI[3.51 to 15.56]) (p = 0.031), but there were no differences between treatment groups (time by treatment interaction estimate: 0.29, t (23) = 0.14, p = 0.89); VitD and placebo groups had similar reductions in YMRS and HAM-A. Vitamin D 3 was well tolerated.

Conclusions

In this small study, despite a greater rise in Vitamin D levels in the VitD supplementation group, there was no significant difference reduction in depressive symptoms. However both groups' VitD levels remained deficient. Vitamin D 3 supplementation vs placebo did not improve reduction in mood elevation or anxiety symptoms.

### Melatonin and agomelatine for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^da4ede41]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD in the United States ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We conducted a search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR) to 11 August 2015. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (to 26 May 2014). We conducted a grey literature search (e.g. in clinical trial registries) and handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

To examine efficacy, we planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant (SGA), light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. We planned to pool data for meta-analysis when participant groups were similar and when studies assessed the same treatments by using the same comparator and presented similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment; however, we identified no studies for inclusion.

Main Results

We identified 2986 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 2895 records during title and abstract review and assessed 91 articles at full-text level for eligibility. We identified no controlled studies on use of melatonin and agomelatine to prevent SAD and to improve patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Authors' Conclusions

No available methodologically sound evidence indicates that melatonin or agomelatine is or is not an effective intervention for prevention of SAD and improvement of patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Lack of evidence clearly shows the need for well-conducted, controlled studies on this topic. A well-conducted RCT of melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of SAD would assess the comparative benefits and risks of these interventions against others currently used to treat the disorder.

### Melatonin and agomelatine for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^9f298ea3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.

We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus any other type of psychological therapy, placebo, light therapy, SGAs, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias. We planned to pool data for meta-analysis when participant groups were similar and when studies assessed the same treatments versus the same comparator and provided similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment; however, we included no studies.

Main Results

We identified 2986 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 2895 records during title and abstract review and assessed 91 articles at full-text review for eligibility. We found no controlled studies on use of psychological therapy to prevent SAD and improve patient-centred outcomes in adults with a history of SAD.

Authors' Conclusions

Presently, there is no methodologically sound evidence available to indicate whether psychological therapy is or is not an effective intervention for prevention of SAD and improvement of patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Randomised controlled trials are needed to compare different types of psychological therapies and to compare psychological therapies versus placebo, light therapy, SGAs, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes for prevention of new depressive episodes in patients with a history of winter-type SAD.

### Second-generation antidepressants for preventing seasonal affective disorder in adults [^fb5407b7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the Chi 2 statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I 2 statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots. We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^6f14cefe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD guideline — omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D for major depressive disorder (MDD) — We suggest against using omega-3 fatty acids or vitamin D for treatment of MDD (Weak against | Not reviewed, Not changed). Evidence for omega-3 fatty acids reports no significant overall benefit for depressive symptoms, with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) having no effect and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) showing a small effect, and the quality of evidence rated as poor; even though EPA may have a small benefit compared to placebo in adults with MDD, the evidence base was not sufficient to recommend prescribing EPA instead of other validated medications or psychotherapies. For vitamin D, available evidence does not support supplementation as monotherapy, including one systematic review (SR) of mild to moderate MDD in adults with normal serum vitamin D that included nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) randomly allocating 4,923 patients and indicating a non-significant difference favoring placebo. In severe MDD with deficiency, one RCT randomly allocated 109 participants to 300,000 IU vitamin D3, 150,000 IU vitamin D3, or no treatment and followed participants for three months; investigators reported 300,000 IU vitamin D3 was more effective than no treatment, with no significant difference for 150,000 IU versus no treatment, but the study quality was poor with lack of ITT analysis and double-blinding, and the dosage and route of administration were atypical for most clinical practice, which generally recommends 50,000 IU orally weekly until vitamin D levels normalize. The recommendation remains Not reviewed, Not changed, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5bd59aee]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is a neuroprotective hormone, representing important roles in immune system regulation, promoting cell growth and differentiation, and anti-inflammatory pathways (Holick). It also regulates many essential genes involved in the brain function (Sultan et al.). Several meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have suggested a positive relationship between vitamin D deficiency and risk of developing depression (Anglin et al; Ju, Lee, & Jeong).

Although some review studies have presented suggestions of a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms (Anglin et al; Cheng, Huang, & Huang; Mikola et al; Shaffer et al; Xie et al.), none of these reviews have examined the potential dose-dependent effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms to determine the optimum dose of intervention. Some of the available reviews, owing to the limited number of trials and methodological biases, were of low quality (Anglin et al; Cheng et al; Li et al; Shaffer et al.). Considering these uncertainties, we aimed to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) to determine the optimum dose and shape of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults regardless of their health status.

### Effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep in the healthy population: interpretations from the serotonergic pathway [^0232d570]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D insufficiency is common in the healthy population. Recent insights addressed the role of vitamin D in serotonin and melatonin regulation, suggesting that increasing vitamin D status may be helpful for improving mood and sleep. This literature review covers the current state of evidence regarding potential effects of vitamin D on mood and sleep indicators in healthy people. In total, 11 observational studies were found for sleep, and 54 studies on mood (including ten RCTs). These studies revealed mixed results for both sleep and mood. The findings were interpreted based on the previously proposed serotonergic pathway of vitamin D. Implications and challenges for future research regarding the timing of blood sampling, timing and dosage of supplement intake and investigating the response dynamics are discussed.

### Effect of vitamin D3 supplementation in the first 2 years of life on psychiatric symptoms at ages 6 to 8 years: a randomized clinical trial [^a6110b1c]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D is associated with neurodevelopment, but causality, critical windows, and potentials for modification remain unknown.

Objective

To determine the impact of high-dose (1200 IU) vs standard-dose (400 IU) vitamin D3 supplementation during the first 2 years on psychiatric symptoms at ages 6 to 8 years and whether the impact is different in children with lower vs higher maternal vitamin D3 levels; lower vs higher levels were defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) less than 30 ng/mL vs 30 ng/mL or greater.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study was a long-term follow-up of the double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) Vitamin D Intervention in Infants (VIDI) conducted at a single center in Helsinki, Finland, at 60 degrees north latitude. Recruitment for VIDI took place in 2013 to 2014. Follow-up data for secondary data analysis were collected 2020 to 2021. VIDI originally included 987 term-born infants; 546 of these individuals participated in the follow-up at ages 6 to 8 years, among whom 346 individuals had data on parent-reported psychiatric symptoms. Data were analyzed from June 2022 to March 2023.

Interventions

There were 169 infants randomized to receive 400-IU and 177 infants randomized to receive 1200-IU oral vitamin D3 supplementation daily from ages 2 weeks to 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were internalizing, externalizing, and total problems scores, with clinically significant problems defined as T scores of 64 or greater in the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire.

Results

Among 346 participants (164 females [47.4%]; mean [SD] age, 7.1 [0.4] years), the vitamin D3 dose was 400 IU for 169 participants and 1200 IU for 177 participants. Clinically significant internalizing problems occurred in 10 participants in the 1200-IU group (5.6% prevalence) compared with 20 participants (11.8%) in the 400-IU group (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17–0.94; P = 0.04) after adjustment for sex, birth season, maternal depressive symptoms at birth, and parental single status at follow-up. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, 48 children in the 400-IU group with maternal 25(OH)D concentrations less than 30 ng/mL had higher internalizing problems scores compared with children in the 1200-IU group, including 44 children with maternal 25(OH)D concentrations below 30 ng/mL (adjusted mean difference, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.09–0.89; P = 0.02) and 91 children with maternal concentrations above 30 ng/mL (adjusted mean difference, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.03–0.72; P = 0.04). Groups did not differ in externalizing or total problems.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that higher-than-standard vitamin D3 supplementation in the first 2 years decreased risk of internalizing problems at ages 6 to 8 years.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4948dde5]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted the meta-analysis per instructions outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Page et al.) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Handbook (Schunemann). The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022309640).

Data sources and searches

PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched to find relevant literature up to 15 December 2022. Only English-language articles were included. Two investigators (SG and SZM) independently performed the systematic search and screened the titles and abstracts and then full-text articles to find eligible studies. Disagreements were resolved under the supervision of a third reviewer (SS-B). We also checked out the reference lists of published meta-analyses of RCTs of the effect of vitamin D supplementation. Further details about the search strategy in the databases are represented in online Supplementary Table 1.

Study selection

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined according to the framework of PICOS (population, intervention/exposure, comparator, outcome, and study design). Published human intervention studies were considered eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis if they had the following criteria: (1) RCTs, with a minimum intervention period of 4 weeks, conducted in adults aged 18 years or older, regardless of medication use and their health status; (2) evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplementation alone, regardless of type (vitamin D 3, vitamin D 2), method of advice (orally, injection), and dosing regimen against a control group; (3) provided a dose of vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group; and (4) provided effect estimates in the form of mean difference and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) with its 95% CI for binary outcome, or reported sufficient information to estimate those measures. Eligible control group included usual diet, no advice, no intervention, or placebo. Trials that compared two doses of vitamin D supplementation in intervention and control arms were eligible. Except trials that used vitamin D incombinaton with calcium, others that implemented a multicomponent intervention including vitamin D in combination with another supplement (for example, omega-3) were excluded from our review.

### Some new food for thought: the role of vitamin D in the mental health of older adults [^e66509b8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D, a multipurpose steroid hormone vital to health, has been increasingly implicated in the pathology of cognition and mental illness. Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent among older adults, and several studies suggest an association between hypovitaminosis D and basic and executive cognitive functions, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Vitamin D activates receptors on neurons in regions implicated in the regulation of behavior, stimulates neurotrophin release, and protects the brain by buffering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory defenses against vascular injury and improving metabolic and cardiovascular function. Although additional studies are needed to examine the impact of supplementation on cognition and mood disorders, given the known health benefits of vitamin D, we recommend greater supplementation in older adults.

### The effect of vitamin C supplementation on mood status in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials [^54a4f185]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify the effect of vitamin C supplementation on mood in both depressed and non-depressed populations.

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web of science and Scopus databases was conducted, from inception to 1 March 2020. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the effect size (as Hedge's g) of vitamin C supplementation on depressive symptoms.

Results

Finding from 10 trials with 836 participants revealed no significant improvement in mood status in overall analysis (n = 10, Hedge's g = 0.09; 95% confidence interval: -0.15 to 0.33; P = 0.465). However, subgroup analysis showed beneficial effects of vitamin C supplementation in patients who were not prescribed antidepressants (subclinical depressed) (n = 5, Hedge's g: -0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01, P = 0.041; I² = 0.00%).

Conclusions

Although no significant effect on mood status was observed in overall population, this meta-analysis tentatively suggests that vitamin C may produce mood-elevating effects in patients with subclinical depression. Further research is recommended to reach a firm conclusion.

Protocol Registration

The study protocol was registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews database (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, registration no: CRD42018086677).

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression and some involved neurotransmitters [^79c8d8ad]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Low vitamin D levels are associated with a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and depression but a causal relationship has not been established. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on depression severity, serum 25(OH)D, and some neurotransmitters in patients with mild to moderate depression.

Methods

An 8-week double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 56 subjects with mild to moderate depression, aged 43.0 ± 1.15yrs. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups: intervention (50,000 IU cholecalciferol/2wks) and control (placebo). Biochemical parameters (serum 25(OH)D, iPTH, oxytocin and platelet serotonin), and depression severity (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II 1)) were initially and finally assessed.

Results

Following intervention, significant changes were observed in the intervention group compared to the controls: 25(OH)D concentrations increased (+40.83 ± 28.57 vs. +5.14 ± 23.44 nmol/L, P < 0.001) and BDI scores decreased (-11.75 ± 6.40 vs. -3.61 ± 10.40, P = 0.003). Oxytocin concentrations were significantly reduced in controls (-6.49 ± 13.69 ng/mL, P = 0.01), but between -group differences were insignificant. Within- and between-group differences of platelet serotonin concentrations were not significant; however, the increment in controls was higher (+0.86 ± 10.82 vs. +0.26 ± 9.38 ng/mL, P = 0.83).

Limitations

Study duration may not reflect the long-term effects of vitamin D on depression. It seems necessary to assess tryptophan-hydroxylasetypes1&2 in relation to vitamin D in serotonin pathways.

Conclusions

Eight-week supplementation with 50,000 IU/2wks vitamin D, elevated 25(OH)D concentration of subjects with mild to moderate depression and significantly improved their depression severity. However, there was no evidence that the anti-depressive effect of vitamin D supplementation is mediated by the measured neurotransmitters.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^16ec0f37]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of original articles

Characteristics of 31 trials included in the present dose–response meta-analysis are presented in online Supplementary Table 4. The included trials comprised 24 189 participants, of which, 12 091 subjects were in the control arm and 12 098 subjects were in the intervention arm. Twenty-nine trials used vitamin D 3 supplement as an intervention. In one of the RCTs, vitamin D supplementation was performed in combination with calcium (Bertone-Johnson et al.). In another one of the RCTs, vitamin D supplementation was combined with omega-3 supplementation (Okereke et al.). The intervention duration ranged from 4 to 256.8 weeks, of which, 8 trials lasted ≤ 8 weeks (Alavi et al; Choukri et al; Dean et al; Kaviani et al; Krivoy et al; Kusmiyati et al; Sepehrmanesh et al; Zhang et al.), fifteen trials lasted > 8 to ≤ 24 weeks (Alghamdi et al; Eid et al; Fazelian et al; Frandsen et al; Gaughran et al; Ghaderi et al; Hansen et al; Jorde & Kubiak; Khalighi Sikaroudi et al; Marsh et al; Omidian et al; Sharifi et al; Vellekkatt et al; Zhu et al.), five trials lasted lasted > 24 to ≤ 52 weeks (de Koning et al; Jorde et al; Rolf et al; Vieth et al; Wang et al.), and three trials lasted > 52 weeks (Bertone-Johnson et al; Okereke et al; Zheng et al.). Fifteen trials were conducted in patients with depression (Alavi et al; Alghamdi et al; Bertone-Johnson et al; Frandsen et al; Gaughran et al; Ghaderi et al; Hansen et al; Jorde et al; Kaviani et al; Omidian et al; Sepehrmanesh et al; Vellekkatt et al; Wang et al; Zhang et al.), six trials were carried out on healthy subjects (Choukri et al; de Koning et al; Dean et al; Jorde & Kubiak; Kusmiyati et al; Okereke et al.), two studies were carried out on subjects with anxiety (Eid et al; Fazelian et al.), and other trials were carried out in patients with chronic diseases including schizophrenia (Krivoy et al.), bipolar disorder (Marsh et al.), multiple sclerosis (Rolf et al.), ulcerative colitis (Sharifi et al.), and irritable bowel syndrome (Khalighi Sikaroudi et al.). Five of the 30 RCTs were carried out in individuals with normal weight (Choukri et al; Vellekkatt et al; Wang et al; Zheng et al; Zhu et al.), 15 were carried out in individuals with overweight or obesity (body mass index ⩾25 kg/m 2) (Alghamdi et al; de Koning et al; Fazelian et al; Gaughran et al; Ghaderi et al; Jorde & Kubiak; Jorde et al; Kaviani et al; Khalighi Sikaroudi et al; Krivoy et al; Omidian et al; Sepehrmanesh et al; Sharifi et al; Zheng et al.), and the remaining 11 studies did not report the participants' weight status (Alavi et al; Bertone-Johnson et al; Dean et al; Eid et al; Frandsen et al; Hansen et al; Kusmiyati et al; Marsh et al; Okereke et al; Rolf et al; Vieth et al.). Participants in the 17 trials had vitamin D deficiency (Alavi et al; de Koning et al; Eid et al; Fazelian et al; Ghaderi et al; Khalighi Sikaroudi et al; Krivoy et al; Marsh et al; Omidian et al; Rolf et al; Sepehrmanesh et al; Vellekkatt et al; Wang et al; Zhang et al; Zheng et al; Zhu et al.), six trials were conducted in those without vitamin D deficiency (Choukri et al; Dean et al; Frandsen et al; Jorde & Kubiak; Rolf et al; Vieth et al.), while the other eight trials were conducted in individuals with mixed vitamin D status (Alghamdi et al; Gaughran et al; Hansen et al; Jorde et al; Kaviani et al; Kusmiyati et al; Okereke et al; Sharifi et al.). Five trials were rated as low risk of bias (Dean et al; Frandsen et al; Gaughran et al; Hansen et al; Vellekkatt et al.), twelve trials were rated to have some concerns (Choukri et al; de Koning et al; Fazelian et al; Ghaderi et al; Jorde et al; Krivoy et al; Okereke et al; Omidian et al; Vieth et al; Wang et al; L. Zhang et al.), and the other 14 trials were rated to have a high risk of bias (Alavi et al; Alghamdi et al; Bertone-Johnson et al; Eid et al; Jorde & Kubiak; Kaviani et al; Khalighi Sikaroudi et al; Kusmiyati et al; Marsh et al; Rolf et al; Sepehrmanesh et al; Sharifi et al; Zheng et al; Zhu et al.) (online Supplementary Table 5).

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^ba5be77b]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additionally, the possible benefits of vitamin D on physical health in the long term were as follows: Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to have long-lasting benefits such as reducing the risk of falls and fractures, as demonstrated in the ViDA trial (Khaw et al.). It has also been found to lower central blood pressure among vitamin D deficient participants (Sluyter et al.) and lower the risk of overall mortality (Chowdhury et al.).

Despite the aforementioned findings, we could not find a significant association between vitamin D 3 supplementation and depression remission. Furthermore, we could not observe a significant relationship between vitamin D 3 supplementation and the severity of anxiety. Nevertheless, some previous studies demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation was effective in alleviating anxiety symptoms (Borges-Vieira & Cardoso; Eid et al; Zaromytidou et al.). These controversies may be attributed to the low number of trials available in this field, design of the studies, initial serum 25(OH)D concentrations of the participants, dose and type of vitamin D supplement (D 2 v. D 3), intervention duration, method of supplementation and age of the target group.

There were several strengths to our study. Our study updated earlier findings by including more recent RCTs in this field (Alavi et al; Alghamdi et al; de Koning et al; Eid et al; Fazelian et al; Gaughran et al; Ghaderi et al; Hansen et al; Kaviani et al; Kusmiyati et al; Omidian et al; Sharifi et al; Vellekkatt et al; Zheng et al; Zhu et al.). Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis that investigated the dose-dependent effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults. We also applied the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence. The Cochrane risk of bias tool (Version 2.0) was utilized to assess the methodological quality of included RCTs. Lastly, Pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted based on various study characteristics, including risk of bias, intervention duration, sex, weight status, vitamin D deficiency, health status, medication use, and baseline risk of depression. This comprehensive approach enabled the exploration of potential effect modifiers.

### The effects of blue-enriched light treatment compared to standard light treatment in seasonal affective disorder [^06aa4034]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

One of the most frequently investigated hypotheses of the pathophysiology underlying Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a disturbance of circadian rhythms. Since the circadian system as well as other non-visual effects is especially sensitive to blue light, a new light therapy device with blue enriched polychromatic light was tested for its efficacy to treat SAD.

Methods

Within one winter 52 patients were treated in one of three conditions: 30 min full spectrum light (9000 lx, 5000 K), 30 min blue-enriched light (9000 lx, 17,000 K), or 20 min blue-enriched light. The study lasted 22 days with 10 days of morning-light treatment on weekdays during the first 2 weeks.

Results

Depressive symptoms (SIGH SAD) diminished over the 3-week period in all conditions, with no significant differences between conditions. The percentage responders were high, differing from 75%, 59% and 71% for the standard-LT, 30 min blue-enriched-LT, and 20 min blue-enriched-LT, respectively.

Conclusion

The lack of superiority of high intensity blue-enriched light over standard bright light treatment does not clearly support nor rule out the possibility of an important role for the circadian system or the blue sensitive non-visual image forming system in general, in the pathophysiology of SAD. The lack of a difference between conditions may also be the result of a saturated response to the high light intensities used. Recent data indeed suggest that low intensity blue-enriched light may be as effective as standard bright light treatment. The possibility of improving light therapy for SAD patients by applying light of shorter duration or at lower light intensities is highly relevant for optimizing treatment and will help to clarify the role of the circadian system and/or the non-image forming photoreceptors in SAD pathophysiology.

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^703843e5]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms have been ascertained in previous research, the optimum dose of supplementation for reducing depressive symptoms has not been determined in previous studies. Our primary findings indicated that every 1000 IU/day of vitamin D 3 supplementation significantly reduced depressive symptoms. We found that depressive symptoms decreased proportionally with the increase of the dosage of intervention up to 8000 IU/day. We found the greatest impact at 8000 IU/day, and that higher doses had no added values for treatment of depressive symptoms.

Our subgroup analyses indicated a stronger effect on depressive symptoms in women than in men. This is consistent with the literature, which suggests that the relationship between vitamin D 3 deficiency and depression risk was stronger in women than in men (Harse et al; Landel, Annweiler, Millet, Morello, & Féron; Lerchbaum). There are physiological interactions between the effects of vitamin D and estrogen. Vitamin D deficiency may lead to lower estrogen levels, which can cause depression. This can make women more vulnerable to the effects of vitamin D deficiency (Harse et al; Landel et al; Lerchbaum). However, there was only one trial in women, and the credibility of subgroup difference was rated low. Therefore, the potential sex difference in the effect of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depressive symptoms should be interpreted with caution.

### Light therapy for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^c4eff10a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non-pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery and form of light vary.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non-randomised studies. We intended to include studies that compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus no treatment/placebo, second-generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes, negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy in combination with any comparator intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria. The included RCT had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis. The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light treatment. Overall, white light and infrared light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy. In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and 67% (6/9) in the non-treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38; 23 participants, very low-quality evidence). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy, but the CI was also too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; 24 participants, very low-quality evidence). Comparison of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28; 29 participants, very low-quality evidence). Reasons for downgrading evidence quality included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self-rating of outcomes, lack of checking of compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions of interest such as second-generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for people with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.

### Vitamin D and psychosis: mini meta-analysis [^d25e4202]. Schizophrenia Research (2013). Low credibility.

Individuals with psychotic disorders are more likely to have vitamin D (VD) deficiency, while evidence suggests VD could have pathophysiological roles. We summarized meta-analytically the available evidence on VD levels in psychotic disorders in comparison with healthy controls and other psychiatric illnesses. We found seven studies, all reporting insufficient VD levels in patients with psychosis. Schizophrenia had a medium effect size for lower VD than healthy controls, and a trend for lower levels than other psychoses. There were non-significant differences between schizophrenia and major depression. No study has investigated the potential psychotropic effects of VD supplementation in patients with psychosis.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of nutraceuticals for depressive disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^034c3731]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Other secondary outcomes

For anxiety symptoms, 30 studies reported usable results, and most nutraceuticals combined with ADT showed a higher efficacy than ADT alone. However, only vitamin D supplementation demonstrated significant benefit against anxiety symptoms (SMD = 2.79, with a 95% CI of 1.06–4.51) (Supplementary, pp. 96, 102, 109).

ADT (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1–1.56) monotherapy was associated with a significantly higher all-cause discontinuation rate (Supplementary, p. 103) and higher adverse event rate (1.96, 1.37–2.81) than the placebo (Supplementary, p. 104). None of the nutraceuticals used as monotherapy or as an adjunct to ADT were associated with a significantly higher discontinuation rate than the placebo. Adjunctive nutraceuticals were associated with higher but non-significant adverse event rates compared with the placebo, but this may reflect a lack of statistical power due to the small number of studies with limited numbers of patients involved.

Heterogeneity was moderate to high for most outcomes, except for all-cause discontinuation rates (Supplementary, p. 276). None of the prespecified subgroup analyses substantially reduced the level of heterogeneity (Supplementary, pp. 277–278). The design-by-treatment interaction model showed global inconsistency in the NMAs for depressive symptoms and response and remission rates, but not for anxiety, all-cause discontinuation, and adverse events (Supplementary, pp. 279–287). The node-splitting model exhibited significant differences between estimates of direct and indirect evidence for some comparisons in efficacy outcomes, but not for tolerability (Supplementary, pp. 288–307). The comparison-adjusted funnel plots of the NMA for primary outcomes did not indicate publication bias (Supplementary, pp. 308–313). According to GRADE, the quality of evidence for primary outcomes was rated as very low for most comparisons. The quality of evidence was very low for an overall ranking of treatment in terms of efficacy and low for tolerability. Full information on CINeMA is described in Supplementary(pp. 339–370).

Potential effect modifiers, including publication year and baseline depression severity, evaluated through meta-regression, did not significantly influence the relative treatment effects (, pp. 314–335). The results of sensitivity analyses did not differ substantially from those of the main analysis (Supplementary, pp. 222–265).

### The effect of vitamin D supplementation on depression: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c66d7e2a]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Subgroup analyses of the effects of vitamin D 3 supplement (each 1000 IU/d) on depressive symptoms

Table 1 presents the subgroup analysis of the effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation (each 1000 IU/day) on depressive symptoms. There were several potential effect modifications by intervention duration, sex, weight status, vitamin D status, and health status. However, the credibility of these subgroup differences was rated low (online Supplementary Table 6). For instance, we found a stronger effect in trials with an intervention duration of ≤ 8 weeks and 8 to ≤ 24 weeks, and a nonsignificant effect in trials longer than 24 weeks (p group difference < 0.001); however, only a few trials were available with follow-up longer than 52 weeks (Table 1). By using Egger's test (p = 0.23), Begg's test (p = 0.16), and an inspection of the funnel plot, we did not detect any evidence of publication bias (online Supplementary Figure 3).

The effects of different doses of vitamin D 3 on depressive symptoms are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1. The analysis showed that depression symptoms decreased proportionally with increase in the dosage of vitamin D 3 supplementation up to 8000 IU/day (SMD 8000 IU/d: −2.04; 95% CI −3.77 to −0.31), with no further change in effect estimate at higher doses (P dose−response < 0.001, P nonlinearity = 0.208; n = 31, Fig. 1 and Table 2).

### Mood disorders are associated with a more severe hypovitaminosis D than schizophrenia [^db24ec6a]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with psychiatric disorders display high levels of hypovitaminosis D (< 50nmol/L). It remains unclear whether it is associated with specific diagnoses. To further explore vitamin D status in psychiatric inpatients, 82 individuals with mood disorders or schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorders were included. Hypovitaminosis D was significantly lower in patients with mood disorders than patients with schizophrenia (standardized β coefficient = 0.385, p = 0.007). Further studies are warranted to determine specific causes of hypovitaminosis D and the interest of supplementation.

Data synthesis and analysis

We considered standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95%CI for continuous outcomes (anxiety and depressive symptoms, comorbidity index, stress, overall quality of life, bodily image, dysphoria, food avoidance, healthy worry, relationship, sexual and social reaction) and OR and risk difference (RD) for binary outcomes (depression remission, adverse events, as well as serious adverse event) to report the results. For the analyses of continuous outcomes, we first computed the mean andof changes from baseline measures for each study arm in each trial. For the studies that did not report these changes, we estimated these values using the reported means and SDs of outcomes before and after the intervention per instructions in the Cochrane Handbook (Chandler, Cumpston, Li, Page, & Welch). We converted trial data toif they reported standard errors rather than. (Higgins & Green). If neithernor standard error were reported in the trials, we used the averageobtained from other trials for the analyses (Furukawa, Barbui, Cipriani, Brambilla, & Watanabe). Second, we calculated SMD and its 95%CI for each 1000 IU/day vitamin D 3 supplementation in each trial using the method introduced by Crippa and Orsini (Crippa & Orsini). Trial-specific results were pooled using a random-effect model (DerSimonian & Laird). The following items were needed for this method: the dose of vitamin D 3 supplementation in the intervention and control arms, the mean and its relatedof change in outcomes in each study arm (treatment and control groups), and the total number of participants in each group. For trials that implemented vitamin D supplementation on a weekly or monthly basis (e.g. 30 000 IU per week or 50 000 IU per month), we converted the dosing regimen to IU per day. Finally, we conducted a dose–response meta-analysis to evaluate the shape of the dose-dependent effects of vitamin D 3 supplementation on depressive and anxiety symptoms outcomes (Crippa & Orsini).

### Antidepressants differentially related to 1, 25-(OH) ₂ vitamin D ₃ and 25-(OH) vitamin D ₃ in late-life depression [^ed396bd4]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Comparison with previous findings

To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the biologically active vitamin D form between depressed and non-depressed persons in a sufficiently large sample and adequate confounder control. One older pilot study also found lower vitamin D levels, including 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D 3 levels, in 25 depressed compared with 31 non-depressed middle-aged persons. Interpretation of that study is hampered, because only unadjusted results are presented and no information is given on the assays used. Interestingly, the differences between depressed and non-depressed persons were largest for the biologically active form of vitamin D, suggesting that the usually measured inactive form may underestimate the hypothesised pathophysiological role of vitamin D in late-life depression.

Our findings of lowered levels of 25-OH vitamin D 3 levels in depression extends previous population-based studies showing reduced levels of 25-OH vitamin D 3 levels in community-dwelling older persons with depressive symptoms or disorders, and are in line with much smaller controlledand uncontrolledhospital-basedstudies.

In line with most previous studies on the association between depression and vitamin D, we did not find any association between increased PTH levels and depression. Nonetheless, some studies did find this association. The lack of a consistent association between depression and PTH level may point to specific effects for vitamin D in depression, but may also be simply explained by PTH being a less sensitive marker for depression compared with vitamin D, as PTH is essential for minute-to-minute regulation serum-ionised calcium, whereas vitamin D effects are more delayed.

So far, three prospective studies are available, which found a two times higher risk to develop a depression when 25-OH vitamin D 3 levels are below 50 nmol l −1 (refs.) and even tripled risk when levels are smaller than 15 nmol l −1. Nonetheless, results of intervention studies using vitamin D 3 supplementation are inconsistent. Positive effects on the improvement of depressive symptoms have been reported for vitamin D 3 supplementsand for vitamin D 3 as adjunct to fluoxetine, whereas others did not find any effect.

### Second-generation antidepressants for treatment of seasonal affective disorder [^5701ee7d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent depressive episodes that is often treated with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), light therapy, or psychotherapy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in adults in comparison with placebo, light therapy, other SGAs, or psychotherapy.

Search Methods

This is an update of an earlier review first published in 2011. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (all years), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (2011 to January 2020), together with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) (all available years), for reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We hand searched the reference lists of all included studies and other systematic reviews. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished/ongoing trials. We ran a separate update search for reports of adverse events in the Ovid databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: For efficacy we included RCTs of SGAs compared with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, or psychotherapy in adult participants with SAD. For adverse events we also included non-randomised studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment were conducted individually. We pooled data for meta-analysis where the participant groups were similar, and the studies assessed the same treatments with the same comparator and had similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment.

Main Results

In this update we identified no new RCT on the effectiveness of SGAs in SAD patients. We included 2 additional single-arm observational studies that reported on adverse events of SGAs. For efficacy we included three RCTs of between five and eight weeks' duration with a total of 204 participants. For adverse events we included two RCTs and five observational (non-randomised) studies of five to eight weeks' duration with a total of 249 participants. All participants met the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for SAD. The average age ranged from 34 to 42 years, and the majority of participants were female (66% to 100%). Results from one trial with 68 participants showed that fluoxetine (20/36) was numerically superior to placebo (11/32) in achieving clinical response; however, the confidence interval (CI) included both a potential benefit as well as no benefit of fluoxetine (risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.83, very low-certainty evidence). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials involving a total of 136 participants compared fluoxetine versus light therapy. Meta-analysis showed fluoxetine and light therapy to be approximately equal in treating seasonal depression: RR of response 0.98 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.24, low-certainty evidence), RR of remission 0.81 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.71, very low-certainty evidence). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups (low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any eligible study comparing SGA with another SGA or with psychotherapy. Two RCTs and five non-randomised studies reported adverse event data on a total of 249 participants who received bupropion, fluoxetine, escitalopram, duloxetine, nefazodone, reboxetine, light therapy, or placebo. We were only able to obtain crude rates of adverse events, therefore caution is advised regarding interpretation of this information. Between 0% and 100% of participants who received an SGA suffered an adverse event, and between 0% and 25% of participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo showing a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy suggesting equivalence between the two interventions. The lack of available evidence precluded us from drawing any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD. Further, larger RCTs are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs. Data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. The data we obtained on adverse events is therefore not robust, and our confidence in the data is limited. Overall, up to 25% of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the study early due to adverse events.

Nutraceuticals — there is a significant gap in the quality of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy research compared with the quality of nutraceutical research, and despite the popularity of these treatments especially in non-Western nations, trials evaluating efficacy are minimal and have serious methodologic flaws. Specific nutraceutical questions deserving of further investigation include vitamin D supplementation in nutritionally deficient individuals, vitamin D supplementation in nutritionally replete individuals with specific emphasis on the role of genetics, omega-3 fatty acid efficacy and dosing, St. John's wort with specific emphasis on dosing strategies and comparison with FDA-approved therapies, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) efficacy and dosing.

Statistical Analysis

Longitudinal secondary data analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle; 2-tailed independent-sample t tests and Pearson χ 2 tests were used to compare follow-up characteristics between intervention groups. Differences between groups in psychiatric problems were assessed using linear and logistic regression analysis. Results are presented without adjustment (model 1) and after adjustment for sex, maternal depressive symptoms at birth, birth season, and parental single status at follow-up (model 2). Model 2 covariates were associated with at least 1 psychiatric problems score (P < .05) or differed significantly in parental single status between supplementation groups. No other assessed potential covariates were associated with outcome variables or group membership and thus were not included in analyses (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Comparing supplementation groups with α set at.05, we had a power of 0.80 to exclude or confirm effect sizes greater than 0.30 in mean difference (MD) for continuous variables and odds ratios (ORs) smaller than 0.42 in dichotomous variables. The potential impact of attrition bias was tested using inverse probability weighting estimation. In supplemental analyses, we tested associations of 1-year and 2-year 25(OH)D levels with psychiatric outcomes using regression analyses presented previously.

To test the potential interaction between prenatal 25(OH)D level and supplementation degree, children were grouped by maternal pregnancy 25(OH)D level. A 30-ng/mL cutoff point was selected a priori based on previous studies. Initial analyses testing for interaction between intervention group status and the dichotomized maternal 25(OH)D concentration variable did not show interactions at the P < .05 level (eAppendix in Supplement 2). However, exploratory post hoc linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted with adjustments as presented previously to examine differences in psychiatric problems among 4 subgroups created based on intervention group status and maternal 25(OH)D concentration. For reference groups, we first used the group with 400-IU supplementation and maternal 25(OH)D levels less than 30 ng/mL and then the group with 1200-IU supplementation and maternal 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL or greater.

Analyses were conducted with sexes combined. Additional information on study characteristics stratified by sex and sex × intervention group interaction analysis is given in the eAppendix and eTables 3 and 4 in Supplement 2. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software version 28 (IBM) and Stata statistical software version 17 (StataCorp). Data were analyzed from June 2022 to March 2023.

Vitamin D

As described in more detail elsewhere, vitamin D was measured by assessing the blood's circulating levels of 25(OH)D, which is the combined product of cutaneous synthesis from solar exposure and dietary sources. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using isotope dilution–online solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (ID-XLC-MS/MS). Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were < 6% and < 8%, respectively, for concentrations between 25 and 180 nmol l −1. In our sample, 2514 (98.1%) subjects had a vitamin D value. A previous NESDA studyshowed that compared with controls, both currently depressed and remitted depressed had lower vitamin D levels.

### Prospective associations between vitamin D and depression in middle-aged adults: findings from the UK biobank cohort [^8b554cb6]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A significant amount of mixed evidence has come from trials which have assessed the effects of vitamin D supplementation as both a preventive and therapeutic agent for depressive symptoms. A meta-analysis of six of these trials assessing the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on depressive symptoms in those with depression or at risk of depression found no significant effect (Li et al.). Similarly, Gowda, Mutowo, Smith, Wluka, and Renzaho meta-analysed nine trials and found that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce depression in those with subsyndromal depressive symptoms (Gowda et al.). The most recent meta-analysis included four trials looking at the effect of vitamin D on depressive symptoms in patients with clinically diagnosed major depression and showed that vitamin D supplementation successfully reduced depression ratings (Vellekkatt & Menon). A recent trial in the USA found that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly affect both incident and recurrent depression over a 5-year period (Okereke et al.). However, in this study, baseline vitamin D levels were generally adequate meaning that this study showed that vitamin D supplementation does not confer universal prevention against depression. In order to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation effectively, participants need to be deficient at baseline and then receive adequate vitamin D to achieve sufficient levels during the trial. In a 2014 meta-analysis, Spedding and coworkers analysed trials separately based on this criteria (Spedding). They found that studies without 'biological flaws' (i.e. studies with a vitamin D deficient sample at baseline) demonstrated significant improvement in depression with vitamin D supplementation, whereas biologically flawed studies produced inconclusive results. The results of the current observational study lend support to the notion that future trials need to focus on the impact of correcting deficiency in those with deficient, and to a lesser extent insufficient, levels of vitamin D at baseline on future depression status. While trials of this kind are required, the evidence to date provides what Lally and Gaughran describe as 'a mild signal' for the beneficial effect of vitamin D for mood disorders (Lally & Gaughran). Although the trial evidence is not strong enough to recommend universal supplementation for depression (Menon, Kar, Suthar, & Nebhinani,), the moderate effect size seen in trials without 'biological flaws' and trials in the clinically depressed taken together with the results of observational studies suggests that vitamin D does play a role in depression. While existing data do not allow robust causal inferences for vitamin D in the development or persistence of depressive symptoms, our study findings endorse the notion of a direct or indirect influence of vitamin D status on mental health.

### A preliminary investigation of the clinical and cognitive correlates of circulating vitamin D in bipolar disorder [^0e8ee972]. Psychiatry Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The role that vitamin D plays in the cognitive and clinical characteristics of bipolar disorder (BD) is unclear. We examined differences in the levels and deficiency status of vitamin D in an Australian sample of BD patients compared to healthy controls; and determined the extent to which vitamin D is associated with clinical variables and cognitive function in the sample. 22 healthy controls and 55 stable outpatients with a diagnosis of BD and low-grade mood symptomatology provided a sample of blood and completed cognitive tests and clinical measures. Plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D) were assayed and used to segregate participants into subgroups with sufficient or deficient levels of vitamin D. Subgroups were then compared in terms of global cognition and a range of sociodemographic and clinical factors (number of past mood episodes, illness duration, seasonal mood pattern, mood symptom severity), while mean levels of vitamin D were compared between patients and controls. Although almost 27% of the current sample were vitamin D deficient, no significant differences in mean vitamin D levels or the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency were evident between BD patients and controls. Vitamin D was not associated with global cognition in either patients or controls, nor any of the clinical measures assessed in the study. In conclusion, we observed no difference in the vitamin D levels and deficiency status of an Australian sample of healthy individuals and BD patients with low grade mood symptomatology compared to controls. Clinical symptoms and global cognition also appear to be independent of vitamin D levels in BD.

### Second-generation antidepressants for seasonal affective disorder [^745c793d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent depressive episodes that is often treated with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), light therapy or psychotherapy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs for the treatment of SAD in adults in comparison with placebo, light therapy, other SGAs or psychotherapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neuorosis Review Group's specialised register (CCDANCTR) on the 26 August 2011. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we searched pharmaceutical industry trials registers via the Internet to identify unpublished trial data. Furthermore, we searched OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-process, EMBASE and PsycINFO to 27July 2011 for publications on adverse effects (including non-randomised studies).

Selection Criteria

For efficacy we included randomised trials of SGAs compared with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy or psychotherapy in adult participants with SAD. For adverse effects we also included non-randomised studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy and completeness by a second. We pooled data for meta-analysis where the participant groups were similar and the studies assessed the same treatments with the same comparator and had similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment.

Main Results

For efficacy we included three randomised trials of between five and eight weeks duration with a total of 204 participants. For adverse effects we included two randomised trials and three observational (non-randomised) studies of five to eight weeks duration with a total of 225 participants. Overall, the randomised trials had low-to-moderate risk of bias, and the observational studies had a high risk of bias (due to small size and high attrition). The participants in the studies all met DSM (Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for SAD. The average age was approximately 40 years and 70% of the participants were female. Results from one trial with 68 participants showed that fluoxetine was not significantly more effective than placebo in achieving clinical response (risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.83). The number of adverse effects were similar between the two groups. We located two trials that contained a total of 136 participants for the comparison fluoxetine versus light therapy. Our meta-analysis of the results of the two trials showed fluoxetine and light therapy to be approximately equal in treating seasonal depression: RR of response 0.98 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.24), RR of remission 0.81 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.71). The number of adverse effects was similar in both groups. Two of the three randomised trials and three non-randomised studies contained adverse effect data on 225 participants who received fluoxetine, escitalopram, duloxetine, reboxetine, light therapy or placebo. We were only able to obtain crude rates of adverse effects, so any interpretation of this needs to be undertaken with caution. Between 22% and 100% of participants who received a SGA suffered an adverse effect and between 15% and 27% of participants withdrew from the studies because of adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo, which shows a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy, which suggest equivalence between the two interventions. The lack of available evidence precludes the ability to draw any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD. Further larger RCTs are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs. Data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. Therefore the data we obtained on adverse effects is not robust and our confidence in the data is limited. Overall, up to 27% of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the studies early due to adverse effects. The overall quality of evidence in this review is very low.

### Depressive mood and circadian rhythms disturbances as outcomes of seasonal affective disorder treatment: a systematic review [^1694bad9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The present systematic review was aimed at critically summarizing the evidence about interventions focused on circadian rhythms and mood symptoms in seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Methods

A systematic search of the electronic databases PUBMED, PsycINFO and Web of Science was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Original papers reporting data about the effects of treatments on both mood and circadian rhythms disturbances in SAD patients were considered for inclusion. The quality of the evidence provided by the eligible studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool (ROBINS-I).

Results

Forty papers were deemed eligible for the systematic review. The evidence of treatment outcomes referring to circadian disturbances was not robust. Despite this, bright light therapy (BLT) demonstrates to phase-advance delayed rhythms and to improve sleep-wake disorders. As for mood symptoms, both BLT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) show evidence of efficacy. The possible connection between improvements of mood symptoms and changes in circadian outcomes seems controversial.

Limitations

The included studies presented considerable methodological heterogeneity, small sample sizes and non-optimal sample selection.

Conclusions

The effectiveness of BLT in depressive symptoms and circadian disturbances of SAD was outlined by the present systematic review. The evidence about other biological and pharmacological treatments, although promising, should be replicated. A multifactorial etiopathogenesis could explain the heterogeneous clinical presentations of SAD and the complex link between mood and circadian symptoms.

Conclusions and Relevance No studies evaluated the direct benefits or harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency. Among asymptomatic, community-dwelling populations with low vitamin D levels, the evidence suggests that treatment with vitamin D has no effect on mortality or the incidence of fractures, falls, depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, or adverse events. The evidence is inconclusive about the effect of treatment on physical functioning and infection. Vitamin D has a variety of actions on calcium homeostasis, bone metabolism, and other cellular regulatory functions.

1–3 Vitamin D deficiency refers to serum levels of vitamin D that are inadequate to support bodily needs. Serum total 25D is currently considered the best marker of vitamin D status. 4, 5 However, there is no consensus regarding the serum level of 25D that represents optimal health or deficiency. 1, 5, 6. The rationale for screening for vitamin D deficiency among asymptomatic adults is to identify low serum vitamin D levels that place persons at risk for deficiency and offer treatment before potential adverse clinical outcomes occur. In 2014, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in adults. This review was conducted for the USPSTF to inform an update of its 2014 recommendation. 7–9.

Twelve RCTs18, 19, 21, 22, 25–27, 35, 39, 42–44 reported all-cause mortality outcomes over 4 months to 3 years; however, none evaluated mortality as a primary study aim.

### Vitamin D associates with improved quality of life in participants with irritable bowel syndrome: outcomes from a pilot trial [^5a86324e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

It is possible that seasonal variations in vitamin D levels may impact IBS in the current study. Our data show a general improvement in symptom score and improved 25OHD over the duration of this study is tempting to speculate that increased sunlight exposure increases vitamin D levels which in turn improved IBS symptoms. Such effects have been previously shown for IBS and IBD symptoms. However, there was a significantly greater effect of vitamin D intervention than placebo on circulating vitamin D. Taken together, these data suggestion that seasonal variation should also be taken into account in the design of trials to assess the potential application of vitamin D in IBS.

In summary we have shown that IBS sufferers deficient in vitamin D experience poorer quality of lives than their replete counterparts. Our data demonstrate the need for additional studies of more than 8 weeks in duration with recruitment of a larger cohort of IBS patients.

### Treatment of seasonal affective disorder: unipolar versus bipolar differences [^e3f5ce56]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence-based treatments for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) include light therapy and pharmacotherapy. We briefly review the diagnosis and treatment of SAD, focusing on clinical and treatment differences between patients with unipolar and bipolar illness. Special considerations for the management of SAD in patients with bipolar disorder are discussed, including the need to monitor for emergence of manic and hypomanic mood switches, to use mood stabilizers in patients with bipolar I disorder, and to be aware of potential interactions between bright light and medications used in treating bipolar disorder. Chronobiological treatments such as bright light therapy may be combined with pharmacotherapy to enhance therapeutic effects, reduce adverse side effects, and optimize treatment in patients with seasonal and nonseasonal bipolar disorder.

### A randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on perinatal depression: in Iranian pregnant mothers [^caab69aa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The spread and importance of postpartum depression have led researchers to create preventative methods such as educational programs, modified care, dietary supplements, antidepressant medication and social support.

In human body, the most important source of vitamin D is the skin where 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D 3 in response to UV exposure. Both cutaneous production and dietary consumption of vitamin D must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. Following the first hydroxylation in the liver, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is produced. However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D requires an additional hydroxylation in the kidneys to form the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1, 25(OH) 2D. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D as the main precursor of 1, 25(OH) 2D has a circulating half-life of 2–3 weeks. While, the circulating half-life of 1, 25(OH) 2D is around 4 h. Its blood concentration is 1000 times less than 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphate have influence on regulatory and production of 1,25(OH)2D. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects the body's vitamin D reserves and this is a well-known indicator for examining vitamin D status. Several studies have revealed that vitamin D supplementation can raise vitamin D reserves gradually, according to baseline concentration of vitamin D, dose and duration of consumption. In accordance to a guideline by Holick et al. 6–8 weeks consumption of a high dose vitamin D supplement are essential to obtain an adequate blood reserves of vitamin D.

It seems that in addition to calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D is also essential for brain development and function. The special nuclear receptors for 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D and also essential enzymes for hydroxylation of vitamin D are found in the central nervous system. Therefore, the brain can regionally activate vitamin D, which implicates vitamin D's role in brain function more prominent.

Studies have shown that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression and reduced cognitive function. Few case reports have suggested an interaction between season or latitude and psychological problems. In a study by Mozaffari- Khosravi et al. high doses of vitamin D have been effective in men and women who were depressed. Li et al. suggested that more accurate clinical trials are required to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of vitamin D on depression.

### Effect of a vitamin / mineral supplement on children and adults with autism [^1b089e6a]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of this study

1) The diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder by a qualified medical professional was verified in writing, but there no additional verification. Similarly, for the neurotypical children, no additional verification was made beyond the parental report. The supplement group included a somewhat higher fraction of individuals with classic autism than did the placebo group, since random assignment was done and severity of diagnosis was not controlled for. However, the effect on the results is probably small, since the analysis investigated the change in symptoms, not the final symptoms only.

2) The sample size was large enough to observe many major significant differences between the two groups; but a larger sample size is needed for appropriate statistical power for more subtle, possibly significant differences.

3) The formulation of the supplement was very good; the present data suggests ways to further improve composition and dosage optimization and titration.

4) Seasonal changes slightly affected some results (vitamin D) and possibly others.

5) The placebo contained small amounts of natural plant-based extracts that may have slightly affected some results.

6) Some of the children (45%) were taking various types of medications, which did not change during the study. A comparison of the baseline levels of the autism groups taking and not-taking medications revealed little difference between the two groups in their nutritional and metabolic status. There was a trend that the medicated group had less improvement than the unmedicated group in the Average Score of the PGI-R.

7) The length of the study (three months) may not have been long enough to observe the full-effect of the supplement, and longer treatment may result in larger effect.

### The role of vitamin D in the prevention of late-life depression [^eeeb4648]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In this article, we review current evidence regarding potential benefits of vitamin D for improving mood and reducing depression risk in older adults. We summarize gaps in knowledge and describe future efforts that may clarify the role of vitamin D in late-life depression prevention.

Methods

MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases were searched for all articles on vitamin D and mood that had been published up to and including May 2015. Observational studies and randomized trials with 50 or more participants were included. We excluded studies that involved only younger adults and/or exclusively involved persons with current depression.

Results

Twenty observational (cross-sectional and prospective) studies and 10 randomized trials (nine were randomized placebo-controlled trials [RCTs]; one was a randomized blinded comparison trial) were reviewed. Inverse associations of vitamin D blood level or vitamin D intake with depression were found in 13 observational studies; three identified prospective relations. Results from all but one of the RCTs showed no statistically significant differences in depression outcomes between vitamin D and placebo groups.

Limitations

Observational studies were mostly cross-sectional and frequently lacked adequate control of confounding. RCTs often featured low treatment doses, suboptimal post-intervention changes in biochemical levels of vitamin D, and/or short trial durations.

Conclusion

Vitamin D level-mood associations were observed in most, but not all, observational studies; results indicated that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for late-life depression. However, additional data from well-designed RCTs are required to determine the impact of vitamin D in late-life depression prevention.

### Association between vitamin D and depressive symptoms varies by season: results from the German health interview and examination survey for adults (DEGS1) [^bfda6961]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Findings from epidemiological studies regarding seasonal variations in the association between vitamin D status and depression are inconsistent.

Methods

Cross-sectional analysis of data from 6331 participants aged 18–79 years in the nationwide representative German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults 2008–2011 (DEGS1). Associations between 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D (25(OH)D) serum levels in quartiles and current depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module (PHQ-9) and defined as severity of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score, range 0–27 points) and elevated depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 points) were analysed using multivariable linear and logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic, biological and lifestyle factors. Analyses were stratified by summertime (May to October) and wintertime (November to April) because of evidence for interaction with season (p ≤ 0.01).

Results

In crude analyses, vitamin D status was inversely associated with both depression outcomes in summertime but not in wintertime. After adjustment for potential confounders, a significant association with severity of depressive symptoms remained in summer, with 0.73 point lower PHQ-9 scores in the highest versus lowest quartile. The association between 25(OH)D quartiles and elevated depressive symptoms in summertime was less strong and no longer significant in fully adjusted models.

Limitations

Participants with severe depression may be underrepresented in DEGS1. Residual confounding cannot be excluded.

Conclusion

25(OH)D serum levels were inversely associated with current depressive symptoms in summer but not in wintertime. The fact that the association is stronger in summertime suggests that vitamin D deficiency may be a consequence rather than a cause of depression.

### Amygdala response to emotional faces in seasonal affective disorder [^dd5b0cb3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by seasonally recurring depression. Heightened amygdala activation to aversive stimuli is associated with major depressive disorder but its relation to SAD is unclear. We evaluated seasonal variation in amygdala activation in SAD and healthy controls (HC) using a longitudinal design targeting the asymptomatic/symptomatic phases of SAD. We hypothesized increased amygdala activation to aversive stimuli in the winter in SAD individuals (season-by-group interaction).

Methods

Seventeen SAD individuals and 15 HCs completed an implicit emotional faces BOLD-fMRI paradigm during summer and winter. We computed amygdala activation (SPM5) to an aversive contrast (angry & fearful minus neutral) and angry, fearful and neutral faces, separately. Season-by-group and main effects were evaluated using Generalized Least Squares. In SAD individuals, we correlated change in symptom severity, assessed with The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression - Seasonal Affective Disorder version (SIGH-SAD), with change in amygdala activation.

Results

We found no season-by-group, season or group effect on our aversive contrast. Independent of season, SAD individuals showed significantly lower amygdala activation to all faces compared to healthy controls, with no evidence for a season-by-group interaction. Seasonal change in amygdala activation was unrelated to change in SIGH-SAD.

Limitations

Small sample size, lack of positive valence stimuli.

Conclusions

Amygdala activation to aversive faces is not increased in symptomatic SAD individuals. Instead, we observed decreased amygdala activation across faces, independent of season. Our findings suggest that amygdala activation to angry, fearful and neutral faces is altered in SAD individuals, independent of the presence of depressive symptoms.

### Has the sun set for seasonal affective disorder and HPA axis studies? A systematic review and future prospects [^f7e60de3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of cyclic mood disorder that tends to manifest as winter depression. SAD has anecdotally been described as a hypocortisolemic condition. However, there are no systematic reviews on SAD and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis function. This review intends to summarize these findings.

Methods

Using the PRISMA (2009) guideline recommendations we searched for relevant articles indexed in databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PsychArticles. The following keywords were used: "Seasonal affective disorder", OR "Winter Depression", OR "Seasonal depression" associated with: "HPA Axis" OR "cortisol" OR "CRH" OR "ACTH".

Results

Thirteen papers were included for qualitative analysis. Studies used both heterogeneous methods and populations. The best evidence comes from a recent study showing that SAD patients tend to demonstrate an attenuated Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR) in winter, but not in summer, compared to controls. Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST) studies suggest SAD patients have normal suppression of the HPA axis.

Conclusion

There is still insufficient evidence to classify SAD as a hypocortisolemic condition when compared to controls. Heterogeneous methods and samples did not allow replication of results. We discuss the limitations of these studies and provide new methods and targets to probe HPA axis function in this population. SAD can provide a unique window of opportunity to study HPA axis in affective disorders, since it is highly predictable and can be followed before, during and after episodes subsides.

### Telling friend from foe in emergency vertigo and dizziness: does season and daytime of presentation help in the differential diagnosis? [^c62a7a23]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients presented during the day between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. This shows that patients do not expect stroke and cannot distinguish between serious and benign causes of VD. In particular, they do not interpret the VD symptoms as a possible stroke sign, as this should lead to immediate presentation to the ER. Obviously, patients in some cases waited for normal day time before they decided to visit the ER. It is necessary to increase the alertness of the general population that VD can be symptoms of acute stroke.

BPPV patients in our study presented more often during December and January compared to summer months. This could be due to vitamin D deficiency in winter. A similar seasonal preponderance has been reported before and related to vitamin D, although the month with highest prevalence of BPPV were March and April in this study. However, the relationship between BPPV and low vitamin D could not be confirmed in meta-analyses. An alternative explanation could be the lack of physical activity in winter as BPPV occurs most often after prolonged rest (e.g. in the morning). Furthermore, BPPV incidence is increased after inflammatory ear disorders such as vestibular neuritis which is common in autumn as our study confirms. It is difficult to tell why functional VD (PPPD) seems more common in late summer (September). The seasonal fluctuation might in part just reflect usage of the health care system after summer holydays or similar factors not related to the disorder itself. However, it is well known that mental and behavioral disorders show seasonal fluctuation. Affective disorders are more common in winter and it has been shown that somatic symptoms can precede the affective nadir in autumn. It is another interesting finding that emergency room admissions related to mental and behavior disorders increase after very high temperatures in summer (peak 7 days after T > 28 °C;). However, the summer 2010 was not unusual hot in Germany.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^cae892e4]. DoD/VA (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD bipolar disorder guideline — overall stance on nutritional supplements states that the Work Group systematically reviewed evidence and categorized this as Reviewed, New-added; confidence in evidence ranged from low to very low depending on the supplement, with limitations including small sample sizes, inconsistency, and imprecision, and no significant adverse events were noted; patient values varied and there were concerns about potentially high out-of-pocket expenses without benefit; therefore, the recommendation is that in individuals with bipolar disorder, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against augmenting with nutritional supplements, including nutraceuticals, probiotics, and vitamins, for reduction of depressive or manic symptoms.

### Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder [^2410c6c5]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Premenstrual syndrome is defined as recurrent moderate psychological and physical symptoms that occur during the luteal phase of menses and resolve with menstruation. It affects 20 to 32 percent of premenopausal women. Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder experience affective or somatic symptoms that cause severe dysfunction in social or occupational realms. The disorder affects 3 to 8 percent of premenopausal women. Proposed etiologies include increased sensitivity to normal cycling levels of estrogen and progesterone, increased aldosterone and plasma renin activity, and neurotransmitter abnormalities, particularly serotonin. The Daily Record of Severity of Problems is one tool with which women may self-report the presence and severity of premenstrual symptoms that correlate with the criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text revision. Symptom relief is the goal for treatment of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. There is limited evidence to support the use of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B6 supplementation, and insufficient evidence to support cognitive behavior therapy. Serotonergic antidepressants (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine) are first-line pharmacologic therapy.

### Effects of probiotic and vitamin D co-supplementation on clinical symptoms, mental health, and inflammation in adult patients with migraine headache: a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^b91c70c8]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prior investigations have stated that patients with migraine headaches, mainly those with chronic migraine or migraine with aura, are at an increased risk of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression which would increase the burden and decrease treatment response in these patients. No study has previously investigated the effect of probiotic and vitamin D supplementation on mental health outcomes in migraine patients. The results of the present study failed to show any significant effects of probiotics and vitamin D co-supplementation on mental health outcomes. Furthermore, based on the results of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the effect of probiotics or vitamin D supplementation on mental health indices in various populations might be doubtful. Thus, further studies should be conducted to investigate the effect of probiotics and vitamin D supplementations alone or in combination with each other on mental health outcomes in different populations, including migraine patients.

The favorable effect of probiotics and vitamin D co-supplementation on some clinical characteristics of migraine headaches can be explained by several potential mechanisms. Previous findings have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased gut permeability stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines which lead to migraine headache initiation by inducing nociceptive responses in the trigeminal pathway. Thus, it seems that treatment options affecting gut microbiota such as vitamin D and probiotic supplementation can alleviate migraine headache symptoms by improving gut microbiota dysbiosis and consequent related inflammatory and immune responses. In the present study, we could not find any effect of probiotics and vitamin D co-supplementation on serum levels of hs-CRP as an inflammatory biomarker. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of co-supplementation with vitamin D and probiotics on other inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6, IL-β, and TNF-α. Additionally, it has been documented that serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in migraine pathophysiology, as serotonin levels decrease between migraine attacks and transiently increase during attacks. The gut microbiota impacts serotonin synthesis and signaling in the GI tract. Therefore, probably one of the mechanisms through which probiotic and vitamin D supplementation can improve migraine headaches is altering gut microbiota and peripheral synthesis of serotonin.
