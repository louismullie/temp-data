## Question

Any benefit of vitamin C in heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether vitamin C provides any benefit in heart failure and whether it should be used clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic rationale for vitamin C in heart failure. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend. Next, I will examine randomized and meta-analytic clinical evidence for hard outcomes. After that, I should review surrogate or mechanistic signals that might suggest benefit. Finally, I will weigh potential harms, consider special contexts, and synthesize a practical recommendation with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic rationale. Heart failure is characterized by increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, and vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant that can scavenge reactive oxygen species and regenerate vitamin E, which could theoretically improve vascular function and myocardial energetics, so the biology is plausible at first glance [^f2d05443] [^005fd66d] [^e7697a89].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines say before diving into trials. Contemporary guidelines consistently advise against routine vitamin or antioxidant supplementation in heart failure except to correct documented deficiencies, and they specifically note a lack of benefit for vitamin C in this setting, which sets a high bar for any claimed benefit to overcome [^a8e38b2e] [^61a2fad8] [^eafafab3].

> Next, I should review the highest-level clinical evidence. Large randomized trials and meta-analyses of antioxidant supplementation, including vitamin C, have not shown reductions in major cardiovascular events or mortality, and a Cochrane review of vitamin C for primary prevention found no reduction in cardiovascular outcomes, which indirectly undermines a disease-modifying role in heart failure populations as well [^73ddad2a] [^30614705] [^ef5a7750].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for any signal in heart failure–specific studies. Small trials and physiologic studies in heart failure suggest vitamin C may acutely improve endothelial function and baroreflex sensitivity, and one study hinted that vitamin C could augment the natriuretic response to furosemide in patients on ACE inhibitors, but these are surrogate endpoints or small, unpowered studies without hard outcomes, so they cannot justify routine clinical use [^08810358] [^a97d6b8c] [^ddd3e160].

> I should double-check whether any heart failure–specific outcomes trials exist. I do not find randomized trials powered for mortality, hospitalization, or durable functional improvement with vitamin C in heart failure, and narrative reviews emphasize that clinical antioxidant strategies have largely failed to translate preclinical promise into patient-centered benefit, reinforcing that we lack outcome-level evidence for vitamin C in heart failure [^f4332ef4] [^20d38cb0].

> But wait, what if there are special contexts where vitamin C helps. Observational data link higher plasma vitamin C with lower incident heart failure risk, yet this is hypothesis-generating and confounded by diet and lifestyle. Moreover, high-dose antioxidant supplementation can blunt beneficial adaptive responses like exercise-induced signaling, so indiscriminate use may be counterproductive in some settings [^0a7b4d9f] [^f118eb45].

> I need to ensure I weigh potential harms. Although vitamin C is generally safe at typical doses, high-dose regimens can cause gastrointestinal upset, and in the context of polypharmacy common in heart failure, adding unproven supplements adds pill burden and cost without proven benefit, which aligns with guideline cautions against routine supplementation [^a8e38b2e] [^b0077f4f].

> Let me reconsider the totality of evidence. The mechanistic rationale remains plausible, but high-quality trials and meta-analyses have not demonstrated improvements in hard outcomes with vitamin C, and heart failure–specific outcome data are essentially absent. Therefore, the balance of evidence does not support routine vitamin C supplementation for heart failure management [^73ddad2a] [^a8e38b2e].

> I should confirm the practical recommendation. Do not prescribe vitamin C to treat heart failure. Instead, screen for and replete documented micronutrient deficiencies, optimize guideline-directed medical therapy, and prioritize proven adjuncts such as omega-3 fatty acids in appropriate patients, while avoiding unproven antioxidants that have not shown outcome benefit in this population [^a8e38b2e] [^d10b4f76] [^725752db].

> In summary, after reviewing the pathophysiology, guidelines, and clinical evidence, I conclude that vitamin C does not have proven benefit for heart failure outcomes and should not be used as therapy. Reserve supplementation for confirmed deficiency, and counsel patients accordingly to avoid unnecessary use and potential interference with beneficial adaptive pathways [^a8e38b2e] [^f118eb45].

---

Vitamin C is **not recommended** for routine use in heart failure because it does not improve survival, reduce hospitalizations, or enhance quality of life [^a8e38b2e] [^61a2fad8]. Small studies show short-term improvements in endothelial function and baroreflex sensitivity [^08810358] [^a97d6b8c], but these effects are transient and not linked to hard outcomes. Large trials and meta-analyses find **no clinical benefit**, and guidelines advise against supplementation unless treating a documented deficiency [^73ddad2a] [^a8e38b2e]. Vitamin C is generally safe, but high doses can cause GI upset and may interact with certain medications; therefore, it should not be used as therapy for heart failure.

## Physiological rationale for vitamin C supplementation in heart failure

Vitamin C is a **potent antioxidant** that scavenges free radicals and regenerates vitamin E, potentially reducing oxidative stress — a hallmark of HF pathophysiology [^005fd66d]. It also supports endothelial function by enhancing nitric oxide bioavailability, which may improve vascular tone and microcirculation [^08810358]. These mechanisms suggest a theoretical benefit in HF, but clinical translation has been limited [^f2d05443].

---

## Clinical evidence for vitamin C supplementation in heart failure

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

- **Endothelial function**: A meta-analysis of 44 RCTs showed vitamin C improved endothelial function, with the largest effects in high-risk groups, including HF patients (standardized mean difference 0.48, 95% CI 0.08–0.88) [^08810358].
- **Baroreflex sensitivity**: Acute high-dose vitamin C improved baroreflex sensitivity in chronic HF, suggesting autonomic modulation, but long-term benefits remain unproven [^a97d6b8c].
- **Natriuretic response**: Vitamin C augmented furosemide-induced natriuresis in moderate HF, likely via the kinin–nitric oxide pathway, but clinical relevance is uncertain [^ddd3e160].

---

### Limitations of current evidence

- **Small samples**: Most studies are small, short-term, and use surrogate endpoints (e.g. endothelial function, biomarkers) rather than hard outcomes [^5ba7421e].
- **Lack of outcome data**: No large RCTs demonstrate reduced mortality, hospitalizations, or sustained functional improvement with vitamin C in HF [^notfound].
- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in doses, routes, and patient populations limits generalizability and comparability [^08810358].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the **ACC/AHA/HFSA (2022)** and the **ESC (2023)** do not recommend routine vitamin C supplementation for HF management, emphasizing correction of specific deficiencies and evidence-based therapies instead [^a8e38b2e] [^61a2fad8]. They cite insufficient evidence of benefit and potential harms from unregulated supplement use [^5ba7421e].

---

## Safety profile and potential risks

Vitamin C is generally safe at recommended doses, but **high-dose (> 1,000 mg/day) use can cause**:

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.
- **Drug interactions**: May interfere with anticoagulants, chemotherapy agents, and certain antibiotics.
- **Pro-oxidant effects**: At very high doses, vitamin C may act as a pro-oxidant, potentially worsening oxidative stress in susceptible patients.

---

## Comparison with other antioxidants

Vitamin C has been studied alongside other antioxidants (e.g. vitamin E, coenzyme Q10) [^73ddad2a]. Unlike coenzyme Q10, which shows modest reductions in mortality and hospitalizations in some trials, **vitamin C has not demonstrated consistent clinical benefit** in HF [^a9168d9f] [^82ec0e7b].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

- **Large RCTs**: Needed to evaluate hard outcomes (mortality, hospitalizations, quality of life) with sustained supplementation.
- **Dose and route**: Optimal dosing, duration, and administration route (oral vs. intravenous) remain undefined.
- **Patient selection**: Identification of subgroups (e.g. oxidative stress phenotypes) that might benefit from targeted antioxidant therapy [^fbec1afe].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Routine use**: Not recommended for HF patients without documented deficiency [^a8e38b2e].
- **Deficiency correction**: Address documented vitamin C deficiency through diet or supplementation as part of general care.
- **Patient counseling**: Educate patients on the lack of proven benefit and potential risks of high-dose supplementation [^5ba7421e].

---

Vitamin C shows **no proven clinical benefit** in heart failure and is not recommended for routine use. While small studies suggest short-term improvements in endothelial function and autonomic indices, these have not translated into improved survival or reduced hospitalizations. Clinicians should prioritize guideline-directed therapy and correct deficiencies, reserving vitamin C for documented insufficiency.

### Treating oxidative stress in heart failure: past, present and future [^f4332ef4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Following these disappointing results by inhibiting oxidative stress production in patients, clinical studies went on to assess the potential of increasing the antioxidant capacity in heart failure patients. The majority of the trials performed to date have involved the supplementation of exogenous antioxidants (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folic acid). Initial studies found that the supplementation of exogenous antioxidants leads to a reduction in cardiovascular events, infarct sizes, and oxidative stress. 52, 53 However, a recent meta‐analysis of 50 randomized controlled trials studying the effects of vitamin and antioxidant supplementation, including 294 478 participants, concluded that supplementation with exogenous vitamins and antioxidants was not associated with reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular diseases. 54 More interestingly, several clinical trials have demonstrated that improving the antioxidant capacity, by bolstering endogenous GSH levels, does show some promise in heart failure patients. These trials demonstrated that supplementation of NAC in patients resulted in a reduction in oxidative stress, as measured by an increase in the GSH/oxidized GSH (GSSG) ratio, infarct size and an improved cardiac function in patients with heart failure and acute myocardial infarction. 49, 50, 51, 57

Why have clinical anti‐oxidative stress therapies largely failed?

Taken together, these findings suggested that although targeting oxidative stress is theoretically logical, the majority of the strategies currently employed in the clinical setting have failed to improve patient prognosis. Furthermore, the exact reasons and mechanisms as to why these studies have failed to produce the expected beneficial effects, remain largely unknown. One reason could be that in the experimental setting, the majority of the studies utilized heart failure models to test the efficacy of anti‐oxidative stress treatments, while in the clinical setting anti‐oxidative stress treatments were primarily tested in patients with acute myocardial infarction and not heart failure. Although it is well documented that following myocardial infarction there is a surge in oxidative stress, 58 it maybe that at this stage anti‐oxidative stress therapies are not capable of limiting the production of oxidative stress. Rather, these strategies may serve to improve outcome in heart failure patients, where there is less oxidative stress production. Another reason for this discrepancy could be that only specific patient populations benefit from anti‐oxidative stress treatments. Or else the inadequate understanding of the mechanistic mode of action of the administered antioxidant.

### Effect of vitamin C on endothelial function in health and disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^08810358]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Observational studies indicate that higher vitamin C intake is associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular diseases. However, randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining the effect of vitamin C on endothelial function (EF) have reported inconsistent results. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to determine the effect of vitamin C supplementation on EF and to investigate whether the effect was influenced by health status, study duration, dose and route of vitamin C administration.

Methods

We searched the Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases from inception to May 2013 for studies that met the following criteria: 1) RCT with adult participants, 2) vitamin C administered alone, 3) studies that quantified EF using commonly applied methods including ultrasound, plethysmography and pulse wave analysis.

Results

Pooling the data from 44 clinical trials showed a significant positive effect of vitamin C on EF (SMD: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.66, P < 0.001). Stratification of the analysis by health outcome revealed improved EF in atherosclerotic (SMD: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.41, 1.26, P < 0.001), diabetic (SMD: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.82, P < 0.001) and heart failure patients (SMD: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.88, P < 0.02) after vitamin C supplementation. The effect size appeared to be unaffected by study design, duration, baseline plasma vitamin C concentration or route of administration of vitamin C. The meta-regression showed a significant positive association between vitamin C dose and improvement in EF (β: 0.00011, 95% CI: 0.00001, 0.00021, P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Vitamin C supplementation improved EF. The effect of vitamin C supplementation appeared to be dependent on health status, with stronger effects in those at higher cardiovascular disease risk. PROSPERO Database registration: CRD42013004567, http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/

Nutritional supplements and hormonal therapies in heart failure — evidence and guidance: Aside from replenishment of documented deficiencies, randomized trials have failed to demonstrate benefit for routine vitamin, nutritional, or hormonal supplementation, and no clinical trials have demonstrated improved survival with these therapies. Although some small studies suggest possible benefit of coenzyme Q10 for hospitalization, dyspnea, and edema, findings have not been uniform. Because of possible adverse effects and drug interactions and their widespread use, physicians caring for patients with HF should routinely inquire about their use, and until more data are available, nutritional supplements or hormonal therapies are not recommended for the treatment of HF.

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and α-tocopherol (vitamin E)

Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that can terminate lipid peroxidation chain reactions by stabilizing lipid peroxyl radicals, while vitamin C is a water-soluble radical-scavenging antioxidant with the ability to regenerate vitamin E in cellular membranes. Clinical trials using these antioxidant vitamins to decrease oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease have yielded inconsistent results. Initial studies, with numbers of participants ranging from 10 to 55, evaluating the effect of vitamin C in chronic HF showed promising results. Early studies assessing the impact of vitamin E treatment on coronary disease risk in men and women suggested that higher vitamin E intake lowers the risk of coronary disease. However, more recent studies with larger patient cohorts have not confirmed earlier findings. In a randomized trial analyzing the impact of vitamin C, vitamin E, and β-carotene in 8171 women at high risk for cardiovascular disease (either with a history of cardiovascular disease or presenting with at least three cardiovascular disease risk factors), treatment with these supplements had no effect on preventing the future occurrence of cardiovascular events. Moreover, a host of additional studies also conclude that vitamin C and/or vitamin E, given intravenously or orally, has little to no effect on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in healthy womenand male smokers. Moreover, instead of being protective, vitamin C treatment may worsen muscle metabolism in chronic HF patients. Finally, a meta-analysis of 15 independent randomized controlled trials encompassing 188,209 patients assessing the effect of vitamin antioxidant supplementation and the prevention of cardiovascular events revealed that vitamin administration had no effect on the incidence of cardiovascular events. Together, these results indicate that the global antioxidants vitamin C and E have little to no effect on heart disease.

ROS as a therapeutic target for heart disease

In light of the strong links between elevated ROS, oxidative stress, and cardiac disease, ROS has emerged as an attractive target for therapy, with the goal of many drug-based strategies being to boost cellular antioxidant capacity and enhance ROS detoxification (summarized in Table 2). Here, we highlight some of the major clinical trials evaluating the impact of general antioxidant strategies on heart disease. A number of smaller studies have shown some positive effects of global antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and N -acetylcysteine (NAC), on the treatment of heart disease. However, studies examining the impact of vitamin C and vitamin E with expanded patient cohorts do not support any beneficial effects of antioxidant vitamin supplementation, and the confirmation of the effects of NAC on larger patient cohorts is still outstanding (Table 1).

### Nutraceuticals in patients with heart failure: a systematic review [^82ec0e7b]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutraceuticals are pharmacologically active substances extracted from vegetable or animal food and administered to produce health benefits. We recently reviewed the current evidence for nutraceuticals in patients diagnosed with heart failure as part of the writing of the Australian Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of heart failure.

Methods

A systematic search for studies that compared nutraceuticals to standard care in adult patients with heart failure was performed. Studies were included if > 50 patients were enrolled, with ≥ 6 months follow-up. If no studies met criteria then studies < 50 patients and < 6 months follow-up were included. The primary outcomes included mortality/survival, hospitalization, quality of life, and/or exercise tolerance. Iron was not included in this review as its role in heart failure is already well established.

Results

Forty studies met the inclusion criteria. The strongest evidence came from studies of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which modestly decreased mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with mostly New York Heart Association class II and III heart failure across a range of left ventricular ejection fraction. Coenzyme Q10 may decrease mortality and hospitalization, but definite conclusions cannot be drawn. Studies that examined nitrate-rich beetroot juice, micronutrient supplementation, hawthorn extract, magnesium, thiamine, vitamin E, vitamin D, L-arginine, L-carnosine, and L-carnitine were too small or underpowered to properly appraise clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

Only one nutraceutical, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, received a positive recommendation in the Australian heart failure guidelines. Although occasionally showing some promise, all other nutraceuticals are inadequately studied to allow any conclusion on efficacy. Clinicians should favor other treatments that have been clearly shown to decrease mortality.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^5ba7421e]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — nutritional supplements and hormonal therapies — notes evidence limitations and mixed findings. It states, "Ultimately, most studies are limited by small sample sizes, surrogate endpoints, or nonrandomized design". It further reports "a lack of evidence of benefit from vitamin D, thiamine, carnitine, and taurine and potential harm from vitamin E". For coenzyme Q10, the largest randomized controlled trial "showed no changes in NYHA functional classification at 16 weeks", while "the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events at 2 years was significantly reduced (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–0.80; P = 0.003)", and "Despite these findings, concerns about slow recruitment in this trial have tempered enthusiasm for coenzyme Q10 supplementation in clinical practice".

### Vitamin C inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis in congestive heart failure [^d1b1332c]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha and oxidative stress induce apoptotic cell death in endothelial cells (ECs). Systemic inflammation and increased oxidative stress in congestive heart failure (CHF) coincide with enhanced EC apoptosis and the development of endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated the effects of antioxidative vitamin C therapy on EC apoptosis in CHF patients.

Methods and Results

Vitamin C dose dependently suppressed the induction of EC apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and angiotensin II in vitro as assessed by DNA fragmentation, DAPI nuclear staining, and MTT viability assay. The antiapoptotic effect of vitamin C was associated with reduced cytochrome C release from mitochondria and the inhibition of caspase-9 activity. To assess EC protection by vitamin C in CHF patients, we prospectively randomized CHF patients in a double-blind trial to vitamin C treatment versus placebo. Vitamin C administration to CHF patients markedly reduced plasma levels of circulating apoptotic microparticles to 32 ± 8% of baseline levels, whereas placebo had no effect (87 ± 14%, P < 0.005). In addition, vitamin C administration suppressed the proapoptotic activity on EC of the serum of CHF patients (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Administration of vitamin C to CHF patients suppresses EC apoptosis in vivo, which might contribute to the established functional benefit of vitamin C supplementation on endothelial function.

Increased ROS production

Cellular ROS production occurs when ROS formation outpaces or exhausts compensatory signals and overwhelms endogenous scavenging systems –. ROS are produced at several different sites within cells, both within and outside of mitochondria (reviewed in detail previously –). Mitochondrial ROS production occurs at various sites along the inner mitochondrial membrane as well as in the mitochondrial matrix by components of the ETC and the Krebs cycle, respectively(FIG. 4). ROS production is typically low under normal physiological conditions, and is kept in check by intracellular and intramitochondrial scavenging systems. Pathological ROS levels in the heart typically occur when ROS production outpaces endogenous scavenging capacity. ROS (and other associated reactive intermediates) can damage proteins and lipids, trigger cell-death cascades, and evoke synchronized collapses in the cellular energy grid. Heightened mitochondrial ROS production and downstream ROS-mediated damage has been reported in patients with HF as well as in preclinical models of the disease.

Although ROS are typically associated with pathological states, ROS levels in the heart per se are best characterized by the term 'hormesis': small amounts can evoke adaptive signalling and create beneficial, compensatory responses. Modest production of ROS has been shown to mediate beneficial myocardial signalling involved in physiological responses such as (transient) sympathetic drive, many preconditioning paradigms, cardiac mitochondrial quality control, and exercise. Exercise training is known to augment endogenous ROS-scavenging mechanisms in the heart –, restore bio-energetic efficiency in porcine models of HFpEF, and improve symptoms and quality of life in trials involving patients with HFrEF, or HFpEF. Consistent with the ROS hormesis concept, several studies have noted that administration of high doses of ROS scavengers can abolish the beneficial effects of exercise, including humans taking oral vitamin C or E supplements.

### Role of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^f181d9b1]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent meta‐analysis of six RCTs found that thiamine supplementation did not significantly impact the outcomes of patients with HF. However, we have noted that one of the studies included in this analysis employed a combination of high‐dose micronutrients (vitamin A, thiamine, vitamin C, vitamin D, etc.) for treating CHF, with thiamine accounting for only a small fraction. This does not necessarily preclude the possibility that other vitamins may have exerted an impact on treatment outcomes. For instance, certain studies have suggested that vitamin D could confer some ancillary advantages in the management of HF. This concept, however, continues to be a subject of controversy. As such, this particular study was excluded from our analysis.

A noteworthy phenomenon is the high prevalence of TD among patients with HF, with studies indicating that TD affects 21%–98% of such patients. The mechanism behind this remains unclear. Previous research has suggested that loop diuretics — commonly prescribed for HF — may contribute by increasing urine flow. In addition, cell experiments have demonstrated that furosemide, a type of loop diuretic, can impede thiamine uptake by cardiac cells via its impact on the sodium gradient. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that malnutrition resulting from various etiologies and heightened metabolism are also significant contributors to TD in patients with HF.

Additionally, TD exerts significant effects on the cardiovascular system. For example, TD can result in wet beriberi, which primarily affects myocardial energy metabolism and reduces peripheral vascular resistance. This leads to high‐output HF, characterized by cardiac enlargement, edema, and increased venous pressure. Thiamine supplementation is an effective treatment for wet beriberi and can lead to significant improvement in clinical symptoms. However, our study did not reveal any significant improvement in cardiac function (LVEF) or heart size (LVEDV) even after adequate thiamine supplementation in CHF patients with prevalent TD. Therefore, we speculate that CHF is a multifactorial clinical syndrome and thiamine supplementation alone may not be sufficient for effective treatment. However, it may be beneficial in cases of HF primarily caused by TD. In addition, correcting TD may confer benefits in terms of preventing further cardiac function deterioration and reducing the incidence of other complications in patients with CHF. For example, a recent study demonstrated that thiamine supplementation significantly decreased in‐hospital mortality rates among severe HF patients admitted to the intensive care unit.

### Dietary interventions and nutritional supplements for heart failure: a systematic appraisal and evidence map [^76a43f08]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To appraise meta-analytically determined effect of dietary interventions and nutritional supplements on heart failure (HF)-related outcomes, and create an evidence map to visualize the findings and certainty of evidence.

Methods and Results

Online databases were systematically searched for meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of dietary interventions and nutritional supplements on HF outcomes and incidence. These were then updated if new RCTs were available. Estimates were pooled using a random-effects model and reported as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. We identified 14 relevant meta-analyses, to which 21 new RCTs were added. The total evidence base reviewed included 122 RCTs (n = 176097 participants) assessing 14 interventions. We found that coenzyme Q10 was associated with lower all-cause mortality [RR 0.69 (0.50–0.96); I² = 0%; low certainty of evidence] in HF patients. Incident HF risk was reduced with Mediterranean diet [RR 0.45 (0.26–0.79); I² = 0%; low certainty of evidence]. Vitamin E supplementation was associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of HF hospitalization [RR 1.21 (1.04–1.40); I² = 0%; moderate certainty of evidence]. There was moderate certainty of evidence that thiamine, vitamin D, iron, and L-carnitine supplementation had a beneficial effect on left ventricular ejection fraction.

Conclusion

Coenzyme Q10 may reduce all-cause mortality in HF patients, while a Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of incident HF; however, the low certainty of evidence warrants the need for further RCTs to confirm a definite clinical role. RCT data were lacking for several common interventions including intermittent fasting, caffeine, DASH diet, and ketogenic diet. More research is needed to fill the knowledge gap.

### Chronic heart failure and micronutrients [^9ae1f0c8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with weight loss, and cachexia is a well-recognized complication. Patients have an increased risk of osteoporosis and lose muscle bulk early in the course of the disease. Basal metabolic rate is increased in HF, but general malnutrition may play a part in the development of cachexia, particularly in an elderly population. There is evidence for a possible role for micronutrient deficiency in HF. Selective deficiency of selenium, calcium and thiamine can directly lead to the HF syndrome. Other nutrients, particularly vitamins C and E and beta-carotene, are antioxidants and may have a protective effect on the vasculature. Vitamins B6, B12 and folate all tend to reduce levels of homocysteine, which is associated with increased oxidative stress. Carnitine, co-enzyme Q10 and creatine supplementation have resulted in improved exercise capacity in patients with HF in some studies. In this article, we review the relation between micronutrients and HF. Chronic HF is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, and research effort has centered on pharmacological management, with the successful introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic antagonists into routine practice. There is sufficient evidence to support a large-scale trial of dietary micronutrient supplementation in HF.

No substantial randomized trial of selenium supplements has yet been done in patients with HF. One placebo‐controlled, randomized trial (n = 443) investigated the effects on cardiovascular mortality of supplements of selenium together with CoQ10 given for 4 years to older Swedish citizens, some of whom had HF (KiSel‐10 study; n = 443; age 70–88 years). Despite discontinuing supplements after 4 years, cardiovascular mortality was lower at 10 years in those who had been assigned to supplementation (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.36–0.74; p = 0.0003). Although most patients had cardiovascular problems, only a minority had HF. Additionally, one very small randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been performed in patients with HF from Iran. Garakyaraghi et al. supplemented 32 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) with a combination of 90 mg CoQ10 and 200 μg selenium per day for 3 months. This led to favorable effects on New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, LVEF and myocardial performance index compared to the placebo group. Besides the low number of included subjects, it cannot be concluded whether these effects are a result of selenium supplementation or CoQ10 use as they were given coincidentally, especially as no serum levels of either were measured. A meta‐analysis of nutrients with potential antioxidant properties suggested that only supplements that included selenium reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (relative risk [RR]: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62–0.97; p = 0.02), even though the KiSel‐10 trial was not included. Supplements of other antioxidants — including vitamins A, C, and E, β‐carotene and retinol — were not associated with a lower mortality. Nonetheless, there is uncertainty and a paucity of robust data. Only patients with selenium deficiency might benefit from supplements. Molecular evidence suggests that a serum selenium > 100 μg/L is required for optimal GPX activity. A meta‐analysis that stratified studies into regions with higher (North‐ and South‐America) or lower (Europe and Asia) soil selenium content suggested a greater reduction in mortality with selenium supplements when soil selenium content was low (relative risk [RR]: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78–0.98; p = 0.02), but a possible increase in mortality when selenium soil content was high (RR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01–1.12; p = 0.03). The hypothesis that only patients who have evidence of selenium deficiency benefit from supplements is plausible but should be evaluated in a well‐designed clinical trial.

### Role of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^93bf00c0]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

In this meta‐analysis of seven RCTs involving 274 patients, we did not observe a curative effect of thiamine on patients with congestive HF when comparing changes in LVEF, LVEDV, NT‐proBNP, 6MWT, and NYHA class. However, improving TD status may be potentially beneficial in CHF. Appropriate thiamine supplementation is still necessary for patients with CHF and more robust and long‐term RCTs are needed to further clarify our conclusions.

HF: Interdisciplinary consultation on supplements in adults with heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B, C and D) indicates the registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) should consult with others on the interdisciplinary health care team regarding vitamin, mineral and herbal supplementation, because due to interactions with common medications it is unclear whether certain supplements, such as omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, vitamin D, iron and thiamin, are appropriate for patients with heart failure. This recommendation is designated 'Rating: Weak' and 'Imperative'.

Other measures for prevention — There is no direct evidence that control of dietary sodium or participation in regular exercise can prevent the development of HF; however, in patients with hypertension or other vascular disease, these efforts may have other health benefits and may enhance a general sense of well-being. There is also no evidence that routine use of nutritional supplements can prevent dysfunction or injury to the heart.

### Vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^18640e63]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years, there has been growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with the development and progression of chronic heart failure (CHF).

Hypothesis

Additional supplementation of vitamin D may have protective effects in patients with CHF.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases through June 2015 and included 7 randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CHF. Then, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to confirm whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in CHF patients. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models.

Results

Our pooled results indicated that additional supplementation of vitamin D was not superior to conventional treatment in terms of left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and 6-minute walk distance. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation was associated with significant decreases in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (WMD: -2.42 pg/mL, 95% CI: -4.26 to -0.57, P < 0.05), C-reactive protein (WMD: -0.72 mg/L, 95% CI: -1.42 to -0.02, P < 0.05), and parathyroid hormone (WMD: -13.44 pg/mL, 95% CI: -21.22 to -5.67, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplementation may decrease serum levels of parathyroid hormone and inflammatory mediators in CHF patients, whereas it has no beneficial effects on improvement of left ventricular function and exercise tolerance.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^f0b77270]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Heart failure — vitamin D supplementation: In patients with heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C), research reported that among patients randomized to either the intervention group receiving 2,000 IU oral vitamin D3 daily for six weeks or the control group, the two adverse events that occurred during the course of the study (one death and one hospitalization) were not associated with the vitamin D supplementation, and due to the interactions between vitamin D and some common medications (oral corticosteroids, thyroxin, anti-epileptics, tetracyclines, and quinolones), it is unclear whether this dose and duration of vitamin D would be appropriate for patients with heart failure; research is needed regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on quality measures in patients with heart failure (Grade III). In this population, there were no studies identified that reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on quality of life, signs and symptoms (Grade V). Research reported no significant differences in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels after six weeks between groups receiving either 2,000 IU oral vitamin D3 daily or no supplementation, and research is needed regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on renal function labs and clinical labs in patients with heart failure (Grade III). In patients with advanced heart failure (NYHA Class IV/AHA Stage D), there were no studies identified that reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on quality measures (Grade V), on quality of life, signs and symptoms (Grade V), or on renal function labs and clinical labs (Grade V).

### Heart disease and single-vitamin supplementation [^968d51c0]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and has long been recognized to be multifactorial. A growing body of evidence suggests that not only free radical-mediated reactions but also inflammatory responses play major roles in atherogenesis. Vitamin E has both antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and is the most widely studied vitamin in clinical trials and thus will be the primary example used in this review. Clinical trials of vitamin E efficacy, in hindsight, have been overly optimistic in their expectation that a vitamin could reverse poor dietary habits and a sedentary lifestyle as well as provide benefit beyond that of pharmaceutical agents in treating heart disease. However, it is also apparent that most Americans do not consume dietary amounts adequate to meet established vitamin E requirements. In response to oxidative stressors, vitamin E can decrease biomarkers of lipid peroxidation, is itself killed, and requires optimal vitamin C status to function most effectively. Thus, adequate vitamin E intakes are clearly needed, but what is adequate for what function has yet to be defined. It is noteworthy that in most trials, biomarkers were not used nor were oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation markers used or plasma vitamin E concentrations measured.

### A controlled clinical trial of vitamin E supplementation in patients with congestive heart failure [^af63392d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Oxidative stress is increased in patients with congestive heart failure and can contribute to the progressive deterioration observed in these patients. Increased oxidative stress is the result of either an increased production of free radicals or a depletion of endogenous antioxidants, such as vitamin E.

Objective

We aimed to determine whether vitamin E supplementation of patients with advanced heart failure would modify levels of oxidative stress, thereby preventing or delaying the deterioration associated with free radical injury.

Design

Fifty-six outpatients with advanced heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) were enrolled in a double-blind randomized controlled trial for 12 wk. At a baseline visit and at 2 follow-up visits, blood and breath samples were collected for the measurement of indexes of heart function and disease state, including malondialdehyde, isoprostanes, and breath pentane and ethane. Quality of life was also assessed at baseline and after 12 wk of treatment.

Results

Vitamin E treatment significantly increased plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in the treatment group but failed to significantly affect any other marker of oxidative stress or quality of life. In addition, concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (a humoral marker of ventricular dysfunction), neurohormonal-cytokine markers of prognosis, tumor necrosis factor, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were unchanged with treatment and were not significantly different from those in the control group.

Conclusion

Supplementation with vitamin E did not result in any significant improvements in prognostic or functional indexes of heart failure or in the quality of life of patients with advanced heart failure.

### Micronutrient deficiencies an unmet need in heart failure [^11c85404]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a common, disabling, and costly disease. Despite major advances in medical therapy, morbidity and mortality remain high, in part because current pharmacological regimens may not fully address some unique requirements of the heart for energy. The heart requires a continuous supply of energy-providing substrates and amino acids in order to maintain its function. In HF, defects in substrate metabolism and cardiac energy and substrate utilization may contribute to contractile dysfunction. HF is often accompanied by a deficiency in key micronutrients required for unimpeded energy transfer. Correcting these deficits has been proposed as a method to limit or even reverse the progressive myocyte dysfunction and/or necrosis in HF. This review summarizes the existing HF literature with respect to supplementation trials of key micronutrients involved in cardiac metabolism: coenzyme Q10, l-carnitine, thiamine, and amino acids, including taurine. Studies using a broader approach to supplementation are also considered. Although some of the results are promising, none are conclusive. There is a need for a prospective trial to examine the effects of micronutrient supplementation on morbidity and mortality in patients with HF.

### Selenium and outcome in heart failure [^074cd10a]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

A meta‐analysis of 25 observational studies on selenium supplementation showed a moderate association between increasing serum selenium concentration and reduced risk of coronary heart disease. 10 However, randomised trials of selenium supplementation did not show a profound reduction in cardiovascular events or mortality, 10 but these where often performed in small cohorts and contain several confounding factors (e.g. age and baseline selenium levels) hampering interpretation and generalization. One major confounding factor in these trials is the high mean serum selenium levels, especially in cohorts including subjects from countries with relatively high intake (USA, Canada). 31 Beyond a specific selenium concentration, there may be no further advantage of selenium supplementation in reducing cardiovascular mortality. 32 This is supported by our data on exercise capacity and quality of life, showing only for selenium concentrations < 100 μg/L a negative effect. Furthermore, selenium is often given in combination with other vitamins or minerals (e.g. zinc, vitamin C and E and β‐carotene) making it difficult to identify selenium specific effects. 10 A recently reported trial of older people (aged 70–80 years), many of whom were not known to have serious cardiac disease, randomly assigned participants to placebo or supplements of selenium 200 μg/day and coenzyme Q10 for a median of 5.1 years. 33, 34 Daily selenium supplements increased serum selenium concentrations from 45–87 μg/L at baseline to 185–245 μg/L at 48 months, whereas it did not change in those assigned to placebo. 33 Those receiving supplements had lower plasma concentrations of NT‐proBNP at 24 and 48 months and improved echocardiographic function. 34 Furthermore, participants with a serum selenium concentration < 65 μg/L had a higher cardiovascular mortality compared to those with concentrations > 85 μg/L. 33 It is unclear whether there is a synergistic effect of selenium and coenzyme Q10 supplements. No randomized trial has evaluated the effect of selenium supplements alone in patients with heart failure.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^eae7d51d]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 heart failure guideline — dietary sodium restriction: Recommendation (COR 2a; LOE C-LD): For patients with stage C heart failure (HF), avoiding excessive sodium intake is reasonable to reduce congestive symptoms. Restricting dietary sodium is a common nonpharmacological treatment for patients with HF symptomatic with congestion, but specific recommendations have been based on low-quality evidence. The AHA currently recommends a reduction of sodium intake to < 2300 mg/d for general cardiovascular health promotion; however, there are no trials to support this level of restriction in patients with HF. Sodium restriction can result in poor dietary quality with inadequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake, and nutritional inadequacies have been associated with clinical instability, while routine supplementation of oral iron, thiamine, zinc, vitamin D, or multivitamins has not proven beneficial. The DASH diet can achieve sodium restriction without compromising nutritional adequacy when accompanied by dietary counseling and may be associated with reduced hospitalizations for HF. Supportive data include that a registered dietitian– or nurse-coached intervention with 2 to 3 g/d sodium restriction improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and leg edema in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); in a nonrandomized study (> 2.5 g/d versus < 2.5 g/d), lower dietary sodium was associated with worse all-cause mortality in HFrEF; and in small randomized controlled trials, aggressive sodium restriction (0.8 g/d) during decompensated HF has not reduced weight, congestion, diuretic use, rehospitalization, or all-cause mortality in HFrEF or in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^d0df02d9]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation — Heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C) evidence reported no significant effect on mortality rates with 2 g/day for six months to one year; a trial using 2 g/day of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for one year showed a significant decrease in NYHA functional class compared to an increase in the placebo group; and 2 g/day for three to six months resulted in significant decreases in BNP levels. Because omega-3 may increase the effects of warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and vitamin E, it is unclear whether this dose and duration would be appropriate; research is needed regarding length of stay, quality of life, and effects on BUN, creatinine, and serum sodium (Grade III).

JAMA. 2020; 323: 791–792. doi: 10.1001/jama.2019.21984 To the Editor The CITRIS-ALI trial revealed no difference in the primary outcomes of organ failure and biomarkers of inflammation and vascular injury in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure randomized to intravenous infusions of vitamin C or placebo. 1 However, unadjusted analyses of predefined secondary outcomes suggested a possible benefit of high-dose intravenous vitamin C on mortality. Given that a before-and-after study suggested a mortality benefit among patients with sepsis receiving intravenous vitamin C, thiamine, and hydrocortisone, 2 we believe the differences in mortality observed in the CITRIS-ALI trial may cause some practitioners to be more accepting of high-dose intravenous vitamin C.

HF: Coenzyme Q10 supplementation evidence in heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C) reports no hospital admissions or deaths during the three-month intervention period within or between groups receiving either 150 mg/day of oral Coenzyme Q10 or placebo, and interaction concerns with warfarin, statins and beta-blockers make appropriateness of this dose and duration unclear; research is needed on quality measures. Mixed results were reported for quality of life, signs and symptoms, including one study in which the group receiving 150 mg/day had a significant improvement of 0.5 units in NYHA functional class after three months compared to placebo with no significant change, while one study reported that 75% of subjects reported no change in symptoms.

### Homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events [^60799235]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, stroke and congestive heart failure, is a leading cause of death worldwide. Homocysteine is an amino acid with biological functions in methionine metabolism. A postulated risk factor is an elevated circulating total homocysteine level, which is associated with cardiovascular events. The impact of homocysteine-lowering interventions, given to patients in the form of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 supplements, on cardiovascular events. This is an update of a review previously published in 2009 and 2013.

Objectives

To determine whether homocysteine-lowering interventions, provided in patients with and without pre-existing cardiovascular disease are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, as well as all-cause mortality and evaluate their safety.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1950 to January week 5 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 2014 week 6) and LILACS (1986 to February 2014). We also searched Web of Science (1970 to 7 February 2014). We handsearched the reference lists of included papers. We also contacted researchers in the field. There was no language restriction in the search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of homocysteine-lowering interventions for preventing cardiovascular events with a follow-up period of one year or longer. We considered myocardial infarction and stroke as the primary outcomes. We excluded studies in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction in duplicate. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We measured statistical heterogeneity using the I² statistic. We used a random-effects model.

Main Results

In this second updated Cochrane Review, we identified no new randomised controlled trials. Therefore, this new version includes 12 randomised controlled trials involving 47,429 participants. In general terms, 75% (9/12) trials had a low risk of bias. Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (1743/23,590 (7.38%) versus 1247/20,190 (6.17%); RR 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10, I² = 0%, high quality evidence), stroke (968/22,348 (4.33%) versus 974/18,957 (5.13%); RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.0, I² = 11%, high quality evidence) or death from any cause (2784/22,648 (12.29%) versus 2502/19,250 (10.64%); RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.07, I² = 6%, high quality evidence). Homocysteine-lowering interventions compared with placebo did not significantly affect serious adverse events (cancer) (1558/18,130 (8.59%) versus 1334/14,739 (9.05%); RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; I² = 0%, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This second update of this Cochrane Review found no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions in the form of supplements of vitamins B6, B9 or B12 given alone or in combination should be used for preventing cardiovascular events. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that homocysteine-lowering interventions are associated with an increased risk of cancer.

### Coenzyme Q10 and heart failure: a state-of-the-art review [^2be883d1]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Evidence-based therapies are often limited by tolerability, hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, and renal dysfunction. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may represent a safe therapeutic option for patients with HF. CoQ10 is a highly lipophilic molecule with a chemical structure similar to vitamin K. Although being a common component of cellular membranes, CoQ10's most prominent role is to facilitate the production of adenosine triphosphate in the mitochondria by participating in redox reactions within the electron transport chain. Numerous trials during the past 30 years examining CoQ10 in patients with HF have been limited by small numbers and lack of contemporary HF therapies. The recent publication of the Q-SYMBIO randomized controlled trial demonstrated a reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with CoQ10 supplementation in a contemporary HF population. Although having limitations, this study has renewed interest in evaluating CoQ10 supplementation in patients with HF. Current literature suggests that CoQ10 is relatively safe with few drug interactions and side effects. Furthermore, it is already widely available as an over-the-counter supplement. These findings warrant future adequately powered randomized controlled trials of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with HF. This state-of-the-art review summarizes the literature about the mechanisms, clinical data, and safety profile of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with HF.

### Treating oxidative stress in heart failure: past, present and future [^be106417]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical anti‐oxidative stress therapies

Due to these highly promising results in animal models, several studies have assessed the potential of anti‐oxidative stress therapies in the clinical setting. Similar to the animal studies, clinical trials have taken three approaches to targeting oxidative stress in heart failure patients: (i) inhibition of oxidative stress producers (xanthine oxidase and NOS uncoupling), (ii) improving endogenous antioxidant capacity (NAC), and (iii) improving antioxidant capacity by supplementation of exogenous antioxidants (vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and folic acid).

At present, the best studied therapy in patients with heart failure is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by the administration of allopurinol or oxypurinol. 11, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47 The initial clinical trials were small studies (n = 9–60) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure. These trials all demonstrated that treatment with allopurinol or oxypurinol improved myocardial function, peripheral vasodilatation capacity, blood flow, endothelial dysfunction, reduced plasma B‐type natriuretic peptide levels, and increased LV ejection fraction. 11, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47 However, in a larger randomized controlled trial in 405 patients with heart failure, oxypurinol did not improve clinical outcome. 42, 43 The primary endpoint of the study was a combined clinical endpoint that classified the patient's clinical status as improved, worsened, or unchanged 24 weeks after the initiation of the study. Compared to the placebo group, patients demonstrated no improvement in clinical status following oxypurinol treatment. 42, 43 Similarly, inhibition of NOS uncoupling, by means of sapropterin treatment, has also been studied in the clinical setting. Several small clinical trials have been performed with oral sapropterin administration in patients (n = 18–49) with systemic or pulmonary hypertension. 48, 55, 56 However, these trials all failed to demonstrate significant differences in nitric oxide synthesis, oxidative stress, systemic haemodynamics, vascular redox state, or endothelial function.

### The oxidative stress hypothesis of congestive heart failure: radical thoughts [^7ddf40e0]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

There is extensive experimental evidence from in vitro and animal experiments that congestive heart failure (CHF) is a state of oxidative stress. Moreover, in animal models, the development of CHF is accompanied by changes in the antioxidant defense mechanisms of the myocardium as well as evidence of oxidative myocardial injury. This has led to the hypothesis that oxidative stress may be a mechanism of disease progression in CHF. Indeed, many patients consume antioxidant supplements making the assumption that no harm will result and, possibly, that this therapy will yield some clinical benefits. The focus of this review is to examine the oxidative stress hypothesis of CHF as it pertains to humans. To date, human studies that have sought evidence for a role of oxidative stress in patients with CHF have fallen short of providing strong support for this hypothesis. Studies that have demonstrated an association between oxidant stress and CHF are small and are hindered by methodologic limitations that diminish the impact of their conclusions. Randomized trials of antioxidant supplementation for CHF are scarce, and to our knowledge no study yet convincingly demonstrates any benefit from consuming antioxidant supplements. Therefore, the available evidence is insufficient to support or negate the oxidative stress hypothesis of CHF and the use of antioxidants cannot be recommended as a specific therapy for this condition.

### A randomized controlled trial of high dose vitamin D3 in patients with heart failure [^843ea857]. JACC: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the effect of Vitamin D3 on physical performance in patients with HF.

Background

HF is associated with functional decline and frailty. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with loss of muscle strength and poor outcomes in patients with HF.

Methods

Sixty-four patients participated in a 6-month parallel design double blind RCT to test the hypothesis that oral vitamin D3 would improve physical performance. Vitamin D3 50,000 IU or placebo was given weekly; all received daily calcium. Patients were included regardless of EF and 25OHD ≤ 37.5 ng/ml. The primary outcome was peak VO2, and secondary outcomes were the 6MW, TGUG and knee isokinetic muscle strength. Between group comparisons were made using ANCOVA models that adjust for baseline measures.

Results

Patients were age 65.9 ± 10.4 years old, 48% women, 64% African American, EF 37.6 ± 13.9, 36% NYHA III, the remainder NYHA II. At baseline the vitamin D group 25OHD was 19.1 ± 9.3 ng/ml and increased to 61.7 ± 20.3 ng/ml; in the placebo group baseline 25OHD was 17.8 ± 9.0 ng/ml and decreased to 17.4 ± 9.8 ng/ml at 6 months (between groups p < 0.001). There was no significant change from baseline to 6 months in peak VO2, 6MW, TGUG or isokinetic muscle strength.

Conclusions

Vitamin D3 did not improve physical performance for patients with HF despite a robust increase in serum 25OHD. Vitamin D repletion in patients with HF should conform to standard adult guidelines for vitamin D supplementation.

### Coenzyme Q10 for heart failure [^a9168d9f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coenzyme Q10, or ubiquinone, is a non-prescription nutritional supplement. It is a fat-soluble molecule that acts as an electron carrier in mitochondria, and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be associated with a multitude of diseases, including heart failure. The severity of heart failure correlates with the severity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency. Emerging data suggest that the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species are increased in people with heart failure, and coenzyme Q10 may help to reduce these toxic effects because of its antioxidant activity. Coenzyme Q10 may also have a role in stabilising myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels, and in preventing the consumption of metabolites essential for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q10, although not a primary recommended treatment, could be beneficial to people with heart failure. Several randomised controlled trials have compared coenzyme Q10 to other therapeutic modalities, but no systematic review of existing randomised trials was conducted prior to the original version of this Cochrane Review, in 2014.

Objectives

To review the safety and efficacy of coenzyme Q10 in heart failure.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and AMED on 16 October 2020; ClinicalTrials.gov on 16 July 2020, and the ISRCTN Registry on 11 November 2019. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of either parallel or cross-over design that assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of coenzyme Q10 in people with heart failure. When we identified cross-over studies, we considered data only from the first phase.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods, assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR); for continuous data, the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate data were available, we conducted meta-analysis. When meta-analysis was not possible, we wrote a narrative synthesis. We provided a PRISMA flow chart to show the flow of study selection.

Main Results

We included eleven studies, with 1573 participants, comparing coenzyme Q10 to placebo or conventional therapy (control). In the majority of the studies, sample size was relatively small. There were important differences among studies in daily coenzyme Q10 dose, follow-up period, and the measures of treatment effect. All studies had unclear, or high risk of bias, or both, in one or more bias domains. We were only able to conduct meta-analysis for some of the outcomes. None of the included trials considered quality of life, measured on a validated scale, exercise variables (exercise haemodynamics), or cost-effectiveness. Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces the risk of all-cause mortality more than control (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; 1 study, 420 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 13.3; moderate-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence of inconclusive results between the coenzyme Q10 and control groups for the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.59; 1 study, 420 participants), and stroke (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.48; 1 study, 420 participants). Coenzyme Q10 probably reduces hospitalisation related to heart failure (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.78; 2 studies, 1061 participants; NNTB 9.7; moderate-quality evidence). Very low-quality evidence suggests that coenzyme Q10 may improve the left ventricular ejection fraction (MD 1.77, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.44; 7 studies, 650 participants), but the results are inconclusive for exercise capacity (MD 48.23, 95% CI -24.75 to 121.20; 3 studies, 91 participants); and the risk of developing adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.10; 2 studies, 568 participants). We downgraded the quality of the evidence mainly due to high risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies provide moderate-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 probably reduces all-cause mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure. There is low-quality evidence of inconclusive results as to whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or stroke. Because of very low-quality evidence, it is very uncertain whether coenzyme Q10 has an effect on either left ventricular ejection fraction or exercise capacity. There is low-quality evidence that coenzyme Q10 may increase the risk of adverse effects, or have little to no difference. There is currently no convincing evidence to support or refute the use of coenzyme Q10 for heart failure. Future trials are needed to confirm our findings.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^8edf07d6]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Coenzyme Q10 supplementation — Heart failure (NYHA Classes I-IV/AHA Stages B and C) showed no significant differences in creatinine after three months between groups receiving 150 mg/day oral Coenzyme Q10 or placebo; research is needed regarding effects on BUN, BNP, serum sodium, and quality of life, and given interactions with warfarin, statins, and beta-blockers, it is unclear whether this dose and duration would be appropriate (Grade III).

### Assessing and managing frailty in advanced heart failure: an International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus statement [^74d8db9f]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Frailty in advanced heart failure — nutritional interventions: Nutritional interventions could be included in the management of frail patients with heart failure (HF), as limited nutritional intake due to early satiety, chronic dyspnea, comorbid conditions, or dietary restrictions may increase the risk for nutritional deficiency. A meta-analysis reports that dietary supplements of multinutrients and protein supplements were associated with improved physical functioning; vitamin D supplementation may also benefit frail patients with HF, although the effect of vitamin D supplementation on HF outcomes remains equivocal, and vitamin D supplementation has shown a modest beneficial effect on physical performance in frail individuals. In a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, a 6-month nutritional support program of individualized nutritional counseling compared to usual care was associated with lower 1-year mortality and HF readmission rates among malnourished patients with HF, highlighting the importance of nutritional counseling within multiple diet limitations for those at risk for frailty.

### Plasma vitamin C, but not vitamin E, is associated with reduced risk of heart failure in older men [^0a7b4d9f]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF). However, data on the association between antioxidant intakes and circulating levels and risk of incident HF in the older general population are limited. We have examined prospectively the associations between plasma vitamin C and E, dietary intakes of vitamin C and E, and incident HF.

Methods and Results

Prospective study of 3919 men aged 60 to 79 years with no prevalent HF followed up for a mean period of 11 years, in whom there were 263 cases with incident HF. Higher plasma vitamin C level was associated with significantly lower risk of incident HF in both men with and without previous myocardial infarction after adjustment for lifestyle characteristics, diabetes mellitus, blood lipids, blood pressure, and heart rate (hazards ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.81 [0.70, 0.93] and 0.75 [0.59, 0.97] for 1 SD increase in log vitamin C, respectively). Plasma vitamin E and dietary vitamin C intake showed no association with HF. High levels of dietary vitamin E intake (which correlated weakly with plasma vitamin E) were associated with increased risk of HF in men with no previous myocardial infarction even after adjustment (adjusted hazards ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.23 [1.06, 1.42] for 1 SD increase).

Conclusions

Higher plasma vitamin C is associated with a reduced risk of HF in older men with and without myocardial infarction. High intake of dietary vitamin E may be associated with increased HF risk. Primary intervention trials assessing the effect of vitamin C supplements on HF risk in the elderly are needed.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^61a2fad8]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — drugs of unproven value or that may worsen HF: In patients with HFrEF, dihydropyridine calcium channel-blocking drugs are not recommended treatment for HF. In patients with HFrEF, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and hormonal therapy are not recommended other than to correct specific deficiencies. In patients with HFrEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel-blocking drugs are not recommended. In patients with HFrEF, class IC antiarrhythmic medications and dronedarone may increase the risk of mortality. In patients with HFrEF, thiazolidinediones increase the risk of worsening HF symptoms and hospitalizations. In patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors saxagliptin and alogliptin increase the risk of HF hospitalization and should be avoided in patients with HF. In patients with HFrEF, NSAIDs worsen HF symptoms and should be avoided or withdrawn whenever possible.

### Vitamin E supplementation and the risk of heart failure in women [^f1f45d31]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Oxidative stress may contribute to the development of heart failure (HF); however, an increased risk of HF has been observed with antioxidant therapy in secondary prevention trials. No large clinical trials have addressed the role of antioxidant therapy in the primary prevention of HF.

Methods and Results

We examined the effect of vitamin E and HF risk in 39 815 initially healthy women, aged at least 45 years at baseline, who were enrolled in the Women's Health Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin E (600 IU every other day). Over a median follow-up of 10.2 years, there were 220 incident HF events. In proportional hazards models, adjusting for age and randomized aspirin and beta carotene treatment, vitamin E assignment did not significantly affect HF risk (hazards ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71–1.21; P = 0.59). These results did not change with multivariate adjustment for other risk factors, including interim myocardial infarction. In a prespecified subgroup analysis, vitamin E was inversely related to developing HF with normal ejection fraction (≥ 50%) with HR 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38–0.92; P = 0.02), but there was no statistically significant effect on the risk of developing systolic HF (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.84–1.89; P = 0.26).

Conclusions

In this population of apparently healthy women, vitamin E did not affect the overall risk of HF. The possible benefit on diastolic HF requires confirmation in larger populations.

### Role of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1e1d9e38]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic heart failure (CHF) has always posed a significant threat to human survival and health. The efficacy of thiamine supplementation in CHF patients remains uncertain.

Hypothesis

Receiving supplementary thiamine may not confer benefits to patients with CHF.

Methods

A comprehensive search was conducted across the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science databases up until May 2023 to identify articles investigating the effects of thiamine supplementation in CHF patients. Predefined criteria were utilized for selecting data on study characteristics and results.

Results

Seven randomized, double-blind, controlled trials (five parallel trials and two crossover trials) involving a total of 274 patients were enrolled. The results of the meta-analysis pooling these studies did not reveal any significant effect of thiamine treatment compared with placebo on left ventricular ejection fraction (WMD = 1.653%, 95% CI: -1.098 to 4.405, p = 0.239, I² = 61.8%), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (WMD = -6.831mL, 95% CI: -26.367 to 12.704, p = 0.493, I² = 0.0%), 6-min walking test (WMD = 16.526m, 95% CI: -36.582 to 69.634, p = 0.542, I² = 66.3%), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (WMD = 258.150pg/mL, 95% CI: -236.406 to 752.707, p = 0.306, I² = 21.6%), or New York Heart Association class (WMD = -0.223, 95% CI: -0.781 to 0.335, p = 0.434, I² = 87.1%). However, it effectively improved the status of thiamine deficiency (TD).

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicates that thiamine supplementation does not have a direct therapeutic effect on CHF, except for correcting TD.

### Effects of vitamin D on cardiac function in Patients with chronic HF: the VINDICATE study [^8d5e528f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) are frequently deficient in vitamin D. Low vitamin D levels are associated with a worse prognosis.

Objectives

The VINDICATE (VitamIN D treatIng patients with Chronic heArT failurE) study was undertaken to establish safety and efficacy of high-dose 25 (OH) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD.

Methods

We enrolled 229 patients (179 men) with chronic HF due to LVSD and vitamin D deficiency (cholecalciferol < 50 nmol/l [< 20 ng/ml]). Participants were allocated to 1 year of vitamin D3 supplementation (4,000 IU [100 μg] daily) or matching non-calcium-based placebo. The primary endpoint was change in 6-minute walk distance between baseline and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included change in LV ejection fraction at 1 year, and safety measures of renal function and serum calcium concentration assessed every 3 months.

Results

One year of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation did not improve 6-min walk distance at 1 year, but was associated with a significant improvement in cardiac function (LV ejection fraction +6.07% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.20 to 8.95; p < 0.0001]); and a reversal of LV remodeling (LV end diastolic diameter -2.49 mm [95% CI: -4.09 to -0.90; p = 0.002] and LV end systolic diameter -2.09 mm [95% CI: -4.11 to -0.06 p = 0.043]).

Conclusions

One year of 100 μg daily vitamin D3 supplementation does not improve 6-min walk distance but has beneficial effects on LV structure and function in patients on contemporary optimal medical therapy. Further studies are necessary to determine whether these translate to improvements in outcomes. (VitamIN D Treating patIents With Chronic heArT failurE [VINDICATE]; NCT01619891).

### Effects of vitamin D on cardiac function in Patients with chronic HF: the VINDICATE study [^6c56cf26]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

VINDICATE has demonstrated that high-dose vitamin D 3 supplementation is safe, well-tolerated, and associated with a clinically relevant improvement in cardiac function in chronic HF patients already taking current optimal therapies.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL SKILLS: In patients with chronic HF, vitamin D deficiency is common, and high-dose vitamin D 3 supplementation is safe, well tolerated, and associated with a favorable effect on cardiac function.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are needed to establish the mechanism by which correction of vitamin D 3 deficiency improves cardiac function in patients with systolic HF and the generalizability of this response.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^b0077f4f]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Medication burden and nonprescription product use in heart failure: On average, heart failure (HF) patients take 6.8 prescription medications per day, resulting in 10.1 doses a day. This estimate does not include over-the-counter (OTC) medications or complementary and alternative medications (CAMs). More than 15 million Americans consume vitamins or CAMs, and older adults are the largest consumers of OTC medications, taking on average 4 OTC medications per day. In a single-center study of 161 patients with HF, 88% reported using OTC medications, 34.8% took herbal supplements, and 65.2% took vitamins. By definition, polypharmacy is the long-term use of ≥ 5 medications.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines — device and pharmacologic therapy for symptomatic heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is reasonable in patients with LVEF of 30% to 35% of any origin with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III symptoms who are taking chronic optimal medical therapy and who have reasonable expectation of survival with good functional status of more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: B). In Class IIb, a combination of hydralazine and a nitrate might be reasonable in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF who cannot be given an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) because of drug intolerance, hypotension, or renal insufficiency (Level of Evidence: C), and the addition of an ARB may be considered in persistently symptomatic patients with reduced LVEF who are already being treated with conventional therapy (Level of Evidence: B). Class III recommendations state that routine combined use of an ACEI, ARB, and aldosterone antagonist is not recommended for patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF (Level of Evidence: C); calcium channel blocking drugs are not indicated as primary treatment for HF in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF (Level of Evidence: A); long-term use of an infusion of a positive inotropic drug may be harmful and is not recommended for patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF, except as palliation for patients with end-stage disease who cannot be stabilized with standard medical treatment (Level of Evidence: C); use of nutritional supplements as treatment for HF is not indicated in patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF (Level of Evidence: C); and hormonal therapies other than to replete deficiencies are not recommended and may be harmful to patients with current or prior symptoms of HF and reduced LVEF (Level of Evidence: C).

### Effects of vitamin D on cardiac function in Patients with chronic HF: the VINDICATE study [^a1cd3c29]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

New therapies for serious chronic conditions including chronic HF are often expensive, increasingly technical, and frequently fail to meet the rigorous demands of large phase 3 clinical trials. Vitamin D might be an inexpensive and safe additional option for chronic HF patients and may have beneficial effects on multiple features of the syndrome.

Patients with chronic HF are frequently deficient in vitamin D, and low vitamin D levels increase the risk of incident chronic HF, and are associated with more severe disease and worse outcomes in patients with chronic HF. Supplementation to treat or prevent osteoporotic fractures might be associated with a lower incidence of chronic HF.

However, despite the publication of studies exploring various doses and forms of vitamin D supplementation in patients with chronic HF, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the benefits of this therapeutic approach. In the first study by Schleithoff et al. 93 subjects received 50 μg vitamin D 3 + calcium (Ca 2+) per day for 9 months or placebo + Ca 2+. There was a trend to improvement of LV function measured by echocardiography and a smaller increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines during follow-up in those randomized to vitamin D. Both groups were given Ca 2+ and both groups had some improvement in LV function with no differences between them. Witham et al.examined vitamin D 2 supplementation in 105 elderly patients. Subjects were randomized to 2 doses of 100,000 IU of vitamin D 2 or placebo at baseline and 10 weeks and assessed at 20 weeks. There was no effect on walk distance or immune function, and a slight deterioration in quality of life. The population in that study was heterogeneous; patients with and without LVSD were included, mean N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide levels and daily furosemide doses were lower than those seen in a usual HF population, medical therapy was not optimized, the duration of treatment was short, patients who were randomized to vitamin D remained deficient (43.4 nmol/l [17.4 ng/ml]), and PTH was not suppressed. Although Boxer et al.did not demonstrate improvements in cardiac function or objective measures of muscle strength and exercise capacity in 64 chronic HF patients (of whom 34 underwent echocardiography) randomized to weekly doses of 50,000 IU of vitamin D 3 for 6 months, there was an improvement in serum aldosterone and quality of life in those allocated the supplement. In an open-label study, Schroten et al.demonstrated a reduction in plasma renin concentration after 6 weeks of 2,000 IU vitamin D 3 daily in 101 patients with chronic HF. Finally, Dalbeni et al.noted an increase in LVEF of almost 7% after only 25 weeks in 13 patients randomized to 600,000 IU vitamin D 3 at baseline and 2 further doses of 100,000 IU at 10 weeks and 20 weeks, whereas 10 patients randomized to placebo had a reduction in LVEF of more than 4%. The authors did not comment on cardiac dimensions and there was an increase in natriuretic peptide levels in both groups. In contrast to these studies, VINDICATE is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of an oral non−calcium-based daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D 3 administered for 12 months in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD on otherwise optimal medical therapy. The supplement led to consistent biochemical evidence of replenishment and an effective suppression of PTH levels.

### Vitamin C supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^30614705]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin C is an essential micronutrient and powerful antioxidant. Observational studies have shown an inverse relationship between vitamin C intake and major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Results from clinical trials are less consistent.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of vitamin C supplementation as a single supplement for the primary prevention of CVD.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases on 11 May 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase Classic and Embase (Ovid); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database in the Cochrane Library. We searched trial registers on 13 April 2016 and reference lists of reviews for further studies. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of vitamin C supplementation as a single nutrient supplement lasting at least three months and involving healthy adults or adults at moderate and high risk of CVD were included. The comparison group was no intervention or placebo. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and CVD risk factors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted the data and assessed the risk of bias.

Main Results

We included eight trials with 15,445 participants randomised. The largest trial with 14,641 participants provided data on our primary outcomes. Seven trials reported on CVD risk factors. Three of the eight trials were regarded at high risk of bias for either reporting or attrition bias, most of the 'Risk of bias' domains for the remaining trials were judged as unclear, with the exception of the largest trial where most domains were judged to be at low risk of bias. The composite endpoint, major CVD events was not different between the vitamin C and placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.10; 1 study; 14,641 participants; low-quality evidence) in the Physicians Health Study II over eight years of follow-up. Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.18; 1 study; 14,641 participants; very low-quality evidence, total myocardial infarction (MI) (fatal and non-fatal) HR 1.04 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.24); 1 study; 14,641 participants; low-quality evidence, total stroke (fatal and non-fatal) HR 0.89 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.07); 1 study; 14,641 participants; low-quality evidence, CVD mortality HR 1.02 (95% 0.85 to 1.22); 1 study; 14,641 participants; very low-quality evidence, self-reported coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)/percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.07); 1 study; 14,641 participants; low-quality evidence, self-reported angina HR 0.93 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.03); 1 study; 14,641 participants; low-quality evidence. The evidence for the majority of primary outcomes was downgraded (low quality) because of indirectness and imprecision. For all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, the evidence was very low because more factors affected the directness of the evidence and because of inconsistency. Four studies did not state sources of funding, two studies declared non-commercial funding and two studies declared both commercial and non-commercial funding.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that vitamin C supplementation reduces the risk of CVD in healthy participants and those at increased risk of CVD, but current evidence is limited to one trial of middle-aged and older male physicians from the USA. There is limited low- and very low-quality evidence currently on the effect of vitamin C supplementation and risk of CVD risk factors.

### Influence of vitamin C on baroreflex sensitivity in chronic heart failure [^a97d6b8c]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) reduces baroreflex sensitivity. Low baroreflex sensitivity, a risk factor for sudden death, could arise partly from CHF-dependent endothelial dysfunction. Vitamin C at high doses has a protective role against CHF-related endothelial damage. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of vitamin C on baroreflex sensitivity in CHF. A study group of 33 subjects with CHF secondary to postischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction ≤ 35% and a control group (11 subjects) underwent assessment of baroreflex sensitivity by the phenylephrine method and an autonomic nervous system study by power spectral analysis. Variables were assessed after infusion of placebo and high doses of vitamin C (2.5 mg). In subjects with CHF, baroreflex sensitivity was significantly higher after vitamin C than after placebo infusion (placebo: 4.1 ± 0.4 versus vitamin C: 5.3 ± 0.5 ms/mm Hg, P < 0.001). Low-frequency of R-R (LFRR), expressed in normalized units (NU) (P < 0.05); LF/high-frequency (HF) ratio (P < 0.05), and LF of SBP (LFSBP) decreased significantly; HF power (P < 0.05), and alpha-HF (P < 0.001) increased. Conversely, in the control group, baroreflex sensitivity and other spectral variables measured at baseline, after placebo, and after vitamin C infusion remained statistically unchanged (placebo: 10.2 ± 0.1 versus vitamin C: 10.0 ± 0.2 ms/mm Hg, NS). Acute administration of vitamin C at high doses improves baroreflex sensitivity and vagal sinus modulation in patients with CHF. This finding could have notable clinical and therapeutic implications. Key issues to understand are whether the beneficial effect persists during chronic administration and whether it helps to improve survival.

### Micronutrient deficiencies in heart failure: mitochondrial dysfunction as a common pathophysiological mechanism? [^1572631e]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low plasma concentrations of several micronutrients have been associated with reduced quality of life and adverse outcomes in heart failure (HF). Most patients with HF consume less than the recommended daily amount of several micronutrients, with intake of vitamin D (97% of patients), selenium (95%), zinc (65%) and iron (46%) being most often inadequate. Up to 50% of patients are deficient in one or more micronutrients in cross‐sectional studies. Moreover, patients with HF may have reduced intestinal absorption, increased urinary excretion due to diuretics and defective renal glomerular or tubular function due to oxidative and pro‐inflammatory stress, which exacerbates micronutrient deficiency. Available clinical evidence supports the usefulness of supplementation with some micronutrients to improve HF management in addition to evidence‐based pharmacological therapy. The consensus statement from the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Scientific Statements Committee has already outlined the potential benefit for HF patients when optimizing nutritional status. However, European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelines do not recommend micronutrient supplementation, other than correcting iron deficiency with intravenous iron.

Reduction in bioenergetic capacity plays a major role in the development and worsening of HF. Macronutrients such as fatty acids, lactic acid and carbohydrates are the main energy sources for cardiomyocytes and are consumed in large quantities. Micronutrients — including vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids — are also necessary to convert macronutrients to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but are required in very small amounts, which a healthy diet normally provides. The mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) requires coenzyme Q10, zinc, copper, selenium and iron for efficient ATP production. Micronutrient deficiency in HF may contribute to defective mitochondrial function and reduced synthetic capacity for ATP.

Despite the identification of a high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies in HF and their association with an adverse prognosis, with the exception of iron, very few randomized trials of micronutrient interventions have been conducted. Therefore, a little information is provided on micronutrients in HF management guidelines. In this review, we focus on five key micronutrients involved in mitochondrial ATP production (Table 1).

### Efficacy of vitamin and antioxidant supplements in prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^73ddad2a]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Fig 1 Flow diagram for identification of relevant clinical trials examining effect of vitamins and supplements in prevention of cardiovascular disease

Among the 50 trials, 30 were primary prevention trials (general populations, smokers and workers exposed to asbestos, patients with oesophageal dysplasia, male physicians, patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, postmenopausal women, patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis, patients with end stage renal disease, ambulatory elderly women with vitamin D insufficiency, patients with chronic renal failure, older people with femoral neck fractures, patients with diabetes mellitus, elderly women with a low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, health professionals, people with a high fasting plasma total homocysteine concentration, or kidney transplant recipients), and 20 were secondary prevention trials (patients with cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischaemic attack, stroke, angiographically proved coronary atherosclerosis, vascular disease, or aortic valve stenosis).

Forty five trials were randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials, and five were open label, randomised controlled trials. All vitamin or antioxidant supplements and placebos were administered orally either singly or in combination with other vitamin or antioxidant supplements.

The dose regimens used in each trial were as follows: vitamin A (10 000 or 25 000 IU daily), vitamin B 6 (3, 6, 10, 12.5, 25, 40, 48, 50, or 100 mg daily; 20 mg three times weekly), vitamin B 12 (0.4, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg daily; 6, 18, 20, 60, or 400 µg daily; 50 µg three times weekly), vitamin C (60, 120, 180, 250, 500, or 1000 mg daily), vitamin D (800 or 1000 IU daily; 200 IU twice daily; 400 IU twice daily; 300 IU daily and 100 IU daily; 100 000 IU every four months), vitamin E (60, 200, 400, 600, 800 IU daily; 400 or 600 IU alternate day; 400 IU twice daily; 30, 50, 300, 600 mg daily), β carotene (6, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 50 mg daily; 50 mg alternate day), folic acid (560 or 800 µg daily; 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 2, 2.5, 5, 15, or 40 mg daily; 5 mg three times weekly), and selenium (50, 75, 100, 122, or 122 µg daily).

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^802f4b6d]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Complementary and alternative medications (CAMs)/nutraceuticals in HF — prevalence and guideline directives: "In a 2007 national survey, it was observed that 38% of adults in the United States use CAMs", and "1 in 4 individuals > 85 years of age reported the use of at least 1 CAM therapy". The 2010 HF practice guidelines state that "documentation of the type and dose of nutraceutical products used by patients with HF is recommended", and further specify: "No nutraceutical should be used for the management of HF symptoms or the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events"; "Ephedra-like products (ma-huang) should be avoided because of their stimulant effects on blood pressure and heart rate and their increased risk of mortality and morbidity"; and "Products with significant interactions with digoxin, vasodilators, β-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, and anticoagulants should be avoided". Additionally, "The American College of Cardiology Foundation/ American Heart Association HF guidelines recommend that nutritional supplements not be used for the treatment of HF", and "There is evidence that supplementation with vitamin E ≥ 400 IU/d may increase the risk of developing new-onset HF; it seems prudent to avoid it in individuals with established HF".

### Evidence-based answer… [^0325a9e3]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Searchable Question Do vitamin C supplements reduce mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Evidence-Based Answer Vitamin C, when taken as a dietary supplement, does not appear to reduce mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Evidence Summary It has been suggested that antioxidant nutrients, such as vitamin C, may play a role in reducing cardiovascular disease. Several cohort studies and one RCT have evaluated the effectiveness of antioxidants in reducing mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. 1–5.

The first of these two studies, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, included 11, 348 patients who were taking more than 50 mg of vitamin C per day, which resulted in an RR of 48 percent in cardiovascular disease mortality. The second of the two studies included 5, 133 patients in Finland who were taking more than 90 mg of vitamin C per day, which resulted in an RR of 51 percent. The remaining five studies included 102, 735 patients taking various doses of vitamin C but showed no effect on cardiovascular disease mortality. 2 The Chinese Cancer Prevention Trial 5 studied 39, 584 patients who were taking more than 250 mg of vitamin C per day. This study demonstrated no effect on prevention of cardiovascular disease mortality. Several clinical trials involving thousands of patients are currently examining major cardiovascular events and mortality, and the use of antioxidants for prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is hoped that the results of these trials will further elucidate the role of antioxidant supplementation in treating and preventing cardiovascular disease. 2 The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force conducted a systematic review of the studies on vitamin C and found the evidence inconclusive because the studies were inadequate and conflicting.

1. Clinical Commentary Many primary care physicians and cardiologists continue to recommend vitamin C for prevention of cardiovascular disease mortality, so you may encounter some resistance from patients if you decline to support this supplementation. In situations like this, it may be helpful to explain that while we once thought it was a good idea, newer studies have shown that it "just didn't pan out".

### Self-care of heart failure patients: practical management recommendations from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^2fc194c9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Alcohol
The relation between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular (CV) disease is still controversial, even though the evidence base for overall harm is increasing. 23
There is an association of alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking, with supraventricular arrhythmias, especially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which might precipitate, or worsen HF signs/symptoms. Abstinence might decrease arrhythmia burden. 24
Consuming more than the guideline‐recommended alcohol volumes (two units per day in men and one unit per day in women) is associated with development of HF and therefore it is recommended that this level of alcohol intake is not to be exceeded. However, in alcohol‐related HF, complete abstinence is advised, and if achieved is associated with significant clinical improvement. 14, 25

Nutrients, food and vitamin supplements
Guidelines suggest checking iron (ferritin and transferrin saturation) levels to aid both in determination of the aetiology of HF (iron overload), but also to guide whether iron supplementation is required. Intravenous iron has been found to improve quality of life, peak oxygen consumption and exercise capacity and to decrease HF readmissions. 14, 26, 27, 28 Randomized controlled trials are ongoing investigating the impact of intravenous iron supplementation on mortality and hospitalizations. 29 Whether increasing dietary iron supplementation has any benefits in HF remains unclear as oral treatment was ineffective in increasing exercise capacity. 30
Hyperkalaemia occurs in up to 40% of patients with chronic HF. Hyperkalaemia is associated with poorer outcomes and with hospitalization and mortality in patients with HF and should be corrected. Hyperkalaemia can be iatrogenic, caused by concurrent drugs and nutritional/herbal supplements. 31
Deficiencies of specific nutrients (e.g. selenium, coenzyme Q10, zinc, iron, protein, thiamine) are associated with HF. 32 There is little evidence on the safe use of supplements. Although inadequate intake and low plasma levels of micronutrients have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes, evidence supporting benefit from therapeutic repletion is limited. Thiamine (especially in alcoholics), and coenzyme Q10 have the most clinical trial data for supplementation. 33, 34 Other than in patients who are deficient in specific micronutrients, there is no clear role for routine micronutrient supplementation as a component of HF management. 10, 32

### Antioxidant supplements to prevent or slow down the progression of AMD: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5d375fe2]. Eye (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this review was to examine the evidence as to whether antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements prevent the development of AMD or slow down its progression.

Methods

Randomised trials comparing antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplement to control were identified by systematic electronic searches (updated August 2007) and contact with investigators. Data were pooled after investigating clinical and statistical heterogeneity.

Results

There was no evidence that antioxidant (vitamin E or beta-carotene) supplementation prevented AMD. A total of 23 099 people were randomised in three trials with treatment duration of 4–12 years; pooled risk ratio = 1.03 (95% CI, 0.74–1.43). There was evidence that antioxidant (beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E) and zinc supplementation slowed down the progression to advanced AMD and visual acuity loss in people with signs of the disease (adjusted odds ratio = 0.68, 95% CI, 0.53–0.87 and 0.77, 95% CI, 0.62–0.96, respectively). The majority of people were randomised in one trial (AREDS, 3640 people randomised). There were seven other small trials (total randomised 525).

Conclusions

Current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant vitamin supplements to prevent AMD. People with AMD, or early signs of the disease, may experience some benefit from taking supplements as used in the AREDS trial. Potential harms of high-dose antioxidant supplementation must be considered. These may include an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers (beta-carotene), heart failure in people with vascular disease or diabetes (vitamin E) and hospitalisation for genitourinary conditions (zinc).

### Vitamin C as a cardioprotective agent against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity [^967a5424]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Doxorubicin (Figure 1) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent recognized for potent antitumor efficacy in a variety of cancers. However, the clinical utility of doxorubicin has been historically constrained by dose‐dependent adverse effects, most prominently its cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin‐induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) is driven by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptotic signaling that can lead to irreversible damage to cardiac tissues, ultimately resulting in congestive heart failure in some patients.

Figure 1
Schematic demonstration of the protective role of vitamin C against doxorubicin‐induced cardiotoxicity.

DR indicates death receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; and TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1.

Efforts to mitigate these adverse effects have focused on antioxidant strategies. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has been extensively studied and garnered attention in this context due to its established antioxidant properties and ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS). One investigational strategy to mitigate DIC has involved the coadministration of vitamin C (Figure 1). Research in this area has explored whether vitamin C can preserve cardiac function while maintaining the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin.

Despite promising preclinical data suggesting a protective role of vitamin C against DIC, clinical studies have yielded mixed results. Some trials have demonstrated a reduction in cardiotoxicity markers with vitamin C supplementation, whereas others have shown no significant benefits. These discrepancies highlight the need for further investigation into the mechanisms through which vitamin C interacts with doxorubicin in cardiac tissues.

This literature review presents a comprehensive study of preclinical and clinical trials that consolidates existing information on the role and impact of vitamin C on DIC. The review examines various approaches and discoveries to elucidate the antioxidative processes of vitamin C, aiming to contribute to the management of cardiotoxicity in cancer by demonstrating the potential significance of vitamin C as a therapeutic adjunct in doxorubicin‐based chemotherapy (Figure 2). Additionally, this analysis identifies current knowledge gaps and potential future research initiatives to enhance cardiovascular outcomes for cancer patients.

### Short-term vitamin D3 supplementation lowers plasma renin activity in patients with stable chronic heart failure: an open-label, blinded end point, randomized prospective trial (vitD-CHF trial) [^2756e5d3]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Many chronic heart failure (CHF) patients have low vitamin D (VitD) and high plasma renin activity (PRA), which are both associated with poor prognosis. Vitamin D may inhibit renin transcription and lower PRA. We investigated whether vitamin D3 (VitD3) supplementation lowers PRA in CHF patients.

Methods and Results

We conducted a single-center, open-label, blinded end point trial in 101 stable CHF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients were randomized to 6 weeks of 2,000 IU oral VitD3 daily or control. At baseline, mean age was 64 ± 10 years, 93% male, left ventricular ejection fraction 35% ± 8%, and 56% had VitD deficiency. The geometric mean (95% CI) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 increased from 48 nmol/L (43–54) at baseline to 80 nmol/L (75–87) after 6 weeks in the VitD3 treatment group and decreased from 47 nmol/L (42–53) to 44 nmol/L (39–49) in the control group (P < .001). The primary outcome PRA decreased from 6.5 ng/mL per hour (3.8–11.2) to 5.2 ng/mL per hour (2.9–9.5) in the VitD3 treatment group and increased from 4.9 ng/mL per hour (2.9–8.5) to 7.3 ng/mL per hour (4.5–11.8) in the control group (P = 0.002). This was paralleled by a larger decrease in plasma renin concentration in the VitD3 treatment group compared to control (P = 0.020). No significant changes were observed in secondary outcome parameters, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide natriuretic peptide and fibrosis markers.

Conclusions

Most CHF patients had VitD deficiency and high PRA levels. Six weeks of supplementation with 2,000 IU VitD3 increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels and decreased PRA and plasma renin concentration.

### Increased F2 isoprostane plasma levels in patients with congestive heart failure are correlated with antioxidant status and disease severity [^e34340da]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A growing body of evidence supports the pathophysiologic role of oxidative stress and the protective role of naturally occurring antioxidants in congestive heart failure (CHF). Circulating levels of a sensitive and specific marker of lipid peroxidation and levels and activities of a broad spectrum of essential antioxidant micronutrients, vitamins, and enzymes, however, have been never simultaneously evaluated in well-characterized CHF patients.

Methods and Results

Plasma levels of 8,12-isoprostane F(2alpha)-VI; vitamins A, C, and E; uric acid; and five carotenoids as well as activities of plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were measured in 30 patients with class II and III New York Heart Association (NYHA) CHF and in 30 controls. Ejection fraction was measured in all patients. Significantly higher 8,12-isoprostane F(2alpha)-VI levels and lower antioxidant levels and activities were found in CHF patients in comparison to controls. Levels of 8,12-isoprostane F(2alpha)-VI were higher in class III than in class II NYHA CHF patients (P = 0.0012), and inversely correlated with ejection fraction; vitamins A, C, and E; uric acid; carotenoid levels; and superoxide dismutase activity.

Conclusion

There is an association between increased lipid peroxidation and both antioxidant status and disease severity in CHF in humans. These findings support the rationale for intervention trials aiming at exploring beneficial effects of antioxidant micronutrients in this disease.

### Alpha tocopherol use in the management of diabetic cardiomyopathy: lessons learned from randomized clinical trials [^d9ecd52e]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2009). Low credibility.

Although animal studies suggested that there may be a role for antioxidants (especially alpha-tocopherol) as therapy for heart failure (HF), the results obtained from human trials are disappointing. The variability in the response to antioxidant therapy may be due to genetic polymorphisms in enzymes involved in oxidative stress. We strongly believe that we do not have enough data supporting the use of antioxidant treatment in the management of HF patients, including a diabetic subset.

### Treating oxidative stress in heart failure: past, present and future [^fbec1afe]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to targeting oxidative stress production in human heart failure, it has been speculated that these therapies may be beneficial for a specific subset of patient. Oxypurinol has been shown to improve heart failure symptoms in a specific subset of patients with elevated uric acid, the product of xanthine oxidase. 43, 59 Thus, identifying patients with increases in oxidative stress production resulting from xanthine oxidase activity may still benefit from this therapeutic approach. Several current anti‐oxidative stress therapies have also been found to result in some off‐target effects. Sapropterin administration was found to result in an unexpected increase in oxidized BH 4, BH 2, a competitive inhibitor of BH 4 that promotes NOS uncoupling. 48, 60 Similarly, supplementation with α‐tocopherol (vitamin E) has been shown to drastically suppresses the levels of γ‐tocopherol (the more potent antioxidant, found primarily in the diet), thereby possibly reducing rather than increasing total antioxidant capacity. 61

Although the findings of clinical trials aimed at reducing ROS production and increasing exogenous antioxidants have been disappointing, targeting oxidative stress, specifically the endogenous antioxidant capacity, in heart failure should not be entirely disregarded. Noteworthy has been the observation that increasing the antioxidant capacity, by bolstering endogenous GSH levels via NAC supplementation, results in improved patient outcome, without any adverse side effects. 49, 50, 51, 57 Therefore, future oxidative stress therapies should focus on improving the endogenous antioxidant capacity, rather than inhibiting oxidative stress production or supplementation of exogenous antioxidants.

Class IIa–III recommendations for asymptomatic patients and device therapy — angiotensin system blockers, ICDs, and therapies to avoid: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ARBs can be beneficial in patients with hypertension and LVH and no symptoms of HF (Level of Evidence B). Angiotensin II receptor blockers can be beneficial in patients with low EF and no symptoms of HF who are intolerant of ACEIs (Level of Evidence: C). Placement of an ICD is reasonable in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF of 30% or less, are NYHA functional class I on chronic optimal medical therapy, and have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: B). Placement of an ICD might be considered in patients without HF who have nonischemic cardiomyopathy and an LVEF less than or equal to 30% who are in NYHA functional class I with chronic optimal medical therapy and have a reasonable expectation of survival with good functional status for more than 1 year (Level of Evidence: C). Digoxin should not be used in patients with low EF, sinus rhythm, and no history of HF symptoms, because the risk of harm is not balanced by any known benefit (Level of Evidence: C). Use of nutritional supplements to treat structural heart disease or to prevent the development of symptoms of HF is not recommended (Level of Evidence: C). Calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF and no symptoms of HF after MI (Level of Evidence: C).

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in critical illness-the known knowns and known unknowns [^aadc5c8f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

For cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, most RCTs do not find beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation, even when baseline vitamin D levels are low. However, there does seem to be some benefit for congestive heart failure. In these patients, after vitamin D supplementation, the serum level of pro-brain natriuretic peptide markedly decreased (p < 0.001). Restoration of serum 25 hydroxy-D level was also associated with substantial improvement in NYHA class (p < 0.001) and 6-min walk distance (p < 0.001).

RCTs have found beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in influenza and acute respiratory tract infections (RTI). This includes a meta-analysis of randomized trials of vitamin D to prevent RTI. Overall, vitamin D showed a protective effect against RTI (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.84). There was significant heterogeneity between studies. The protective effect was larger in studies using once-daily dosing compared to bolus doses (OR = 0.51 vs OR = 0.86, p = 0.01).

A Cochrane meta-analysis of patients (paediatric and adult) with predominantly mild to moderate asthma suggests that vitamin D is likely to reduce the risk of severe asthma exacerbation and reduce health care use.

In a meta-analysis of RCTs assessing all-cause mortality rates from vitamin D supplementation, relative risks for all-cause mortality were 0.89 (0.80 to 0.99) for vitamin D3 supplementation and 1.04 (0.97 to 1.11) for vitamin D2 supplementation.

On the other hand a recent RCT reported an increased risk of falls with high-dose vitamin D supplementation in patients aged over 70 years. The incidence of falls was significantly higher in the 60,000 IU dose group (66.9%; 95% CI 54.4 to 77.5%) and the 24 000 IU plus calcifediol group (66.1%; 95% CI 53.5–76.8%) group compared with the low dose (24,000 IU) group (47.9%; 95% CI 35.8–60.3%) (p = 0.048). This was despite the fact that the high dose groups were more likely to achieve 25 hydroxy-D levels of > 75 nmol/L.

### Reduction of oxidative stress augments natriuretic effect of furosemide in moderate heart failure [^ddd3e160]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The significance of antioxidant therapy in heart failure has not been fully examined. This study evaluated whether vitamin C has beneficial effects on renal function or augments the renal effects of furosemide in patients with heart failure.

Methods

There were 2 protocols. In protocol 1, plasma level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and renal function were assessed before and after intravenous infusion of vitamin C or placebo in 8 patients with moderate congestive heart failure (CHF) treated with enalapril. In protocol 2, a randomized crossover study was performed in patients with moderate CHF treated with either an ACE inhibitor (enalapril) (n = 10) or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (losartan) (n = 9) and in asymptomatic patients with impaired left ventricular function treated with enalapril (n = 8). TBARS and renal function were assessed before and after intravenous infusion of furosemide alone, coinfusion of furosemide with placebo and vitamin C, or coinfusion of furosemide with vitamin C and a kallikrein inhibitor (nafamostat mesilate).

Results

In protocol 1, although vitamin C reduced TBARS, it did not affect renal function. In protocol 2, TBARS was higher in patients with moderate CHF than in asymptomatic patients. Vitamin C augmented natriuretic effect of furosemide (from 179 ± 98 to 192 ± 104 micromol/min, P < .01) only in patients with moderate CHF treated with enalapril but not in the other 2 groups. Nafamostat mesilate prevented this augmentation.

Conclusions

In patients with CHF treated with enalapril, counteraction of the increased oxidative stress by vitamin C may contribute to the augmented natriuretic effect of furosemide through the renal kinin-nitric oxide pathway.

### Vitamin C in post-cardiac arrest (VITaCCA) [^e7dffb5e]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin C in Post-cardiac Arrest ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. The investigators hypothesize that vitamin C can reduce organ damage, especially cerebral injury, if administered for a short period as a high i. v. dose during the very early phase of reperfusion after cardiac arrest. Objectives:

- To determine whether an early high dose i. v. vitamin C can improve organ function, especially neurological outcome, in patients after cardiac arrest
- To explore the optimal dosing regimen for high dose i. v. vitamin C
- To investigate in vitro the difference in effect of plasma obtained from post cardiac arrest patients treated with placebo, 3 gr/day or 10 gr/day vitamin C on endothelial cell viability and underlying oxidative pathways. Crucial in this syndrome is the overwhelming oxidative stress, which is caused by systemic ischemia/reperfusion injury and leads to destruction of endothelial function with cardiovascular failure and brain damage.

Besides targeted temperature management, we have no effective therapy to improve prognosis. The levels of our primary circulating antioxidant, vitamin C, are markedly depressed after cardiac arrest. Early, high dose intravenous vitamin C administration can boost the body's antioxidant defence, and could be a new promising therapeutic intervention to improve clinical outcome by limiting oxidative damage. clinical studies. Multiple preclinical experiments support the potential beneficial effect of high-dose iv vitamin C post cardiac arrest. In a rat cardiac arrest model vitamin C administration immediately after return of spontaneous circulation improved survival rate and neurological outcome and decreased myocardial damage. In organ-specific ischemia-reperfusion models of kidney, liver and skeletal muscle iv vitamin C ameliorated respectively renal structure and function, bile flow and cholate secretion and muscle function.

Up to now no clinical study specifically addressed the post cardiac arrest population, but several controlled studies in critically ill patients showed favourable results. In critically ill surgical patients 3 g iv vitamin C per day reduced pulmonary morbidity, new organ failure, duration of ICU/hospital stay and mortality. In burn patients very high dose iv vitamin reduced fluid requirements, body weight gain and respiratory dysfunction. In a recent pilot trial of patients with severe sepsis vitamin C both 50 mg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day caused earlier recovery from organ failure with reduction of the pro-inflammatory biomarkers. In a before and after study of patients with septic shock high dose iv vitamin C combined with iv thiamine and stress dose steroids substantially accelerated shock reversal and improved survival.

### Effects of vitamin D on cardiac function in Patients with chronic HF: the VINDICATE study [^86ae79b4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

How does vitamin D contribute to beneficial remodeling?

Vitamin D deficiency could contribute to adverse remodeling through 2 major pathways. Vitamin D deficiency could lead to cardiomyocyte dysfunction by interfering with Ca 2+ transportat a cellular concentration. HF is a condition of intracellular calcium overload that adversely affects both contraction and relaxation. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency might contribute to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis. Hence, vitamin D deficiency could contribute to a more rapid progression to HF following myocardial damage due to more aggressive adverse remodeling.

However, adverse remodeling is also the result of persistent neurohormonal activation, particularly that of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) which strongly contributes to deteriorating cardiac function, cardiomyocyte loss, and interstitial fibrosis. Inhibition of the RAAS leads to attenuated or reverse LV remodeling in patients with HF. Vitamin D deficiency heightens RAAS activity, whereas vitamin D supplementation seems to reduce renin synthesisand plasma renin activity.

Study limitations

VINDICATE was performed at a single center. However, the study was based upon results from a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study in 53 patients using the same dose for 12 months that also showed a favorable effect of vitamin D on cardiac structure and function. We did not examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation in patients with chronic HF and preserved ejection fraction, a group of patients who may warrant such investigation.

### Role of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1f4073a9]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Chronic heart failure (CHF) represents the final stage of various cardiovascular diseases and constitutes a leading cause of mortality, primarily characterized by reduced cardiac output and circulatory congestion. Despite the availability of numerous treatments, the morbidity and mortality rates of patients with CHF continue to rise annually in many countries.

Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is a water‐soluble vitamin primarily obtained through dietary intake and excreted by the kidneys. Thiamine exists in various forms within the human body and plays a crucial role in numerous essential functions, particularly in cellular energy metabolism. Maintaining an adequate level of thiamine is crucial for the body. Currently, the common method utilized for assessing thiamine levels in clinical practice include measuring the concentration of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) in blood. TPP, also known as thiamine diphosphate, is one of the forms in which thiamine exists in the body. In addition, thiamine status can be assessed by quantifying the impact of TPP on erythrocyte transketolase activity, known as TPP effect. Low levels of TPP and a value exceeding 15% of TPP effect all indicate a deficiency in thiamine.

Over the past few decades, numerous clinical trials have endeavored to elucidate the role of thiamine in heart failure (HF), yet its precise impact remains elusive. Several earlier studies have suggested that thiamine may be efficacious in improving cardiac function among HF patients. A meta‐analysis conducted previously showed a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) following thiamine supplementation for individuals with CHF. However, with the increasing number of clinical trials conducted on this aspect, the role of thiamine in CHF has been subject to challenge. Recently, a meta‐analysis revealed that thiamine failed to improve outcomes in patients with HF. However, it is noteworthy that this study encompassed both acute heart failure (AHF) and CHF, which are characterized by distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore, the effectiveness of thiamine in CHF remains uncertain. Furthermore, previous meta‐analyses have not fully incorporated published randomized controlled trials (RCTs). For these reasons, we aimed to conduct an updated meta‐analysis to comprehensively evaluate the role of thiamine in patients with CHF.

2.3 Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and standard errors (SE) were transformed into SD using the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The heterogeneity of the results was assessed through Cochran's Q test and quantified by the I² statistic. Heterogeneity was considered high when I² > 50%. In the presence of significant heterogeneity, a random‐effects model was utilized; otherwise, a fixed‐effects model was employed. Funnel plots and statistical tests including Egger's and Begger's were conducted to evaluate publication bias. In case of evidence indicating publication bias, the trim‐and‐fill method was applied to assess missing relevant studies and ensure the stability of pooled results. Using Stata software (version 16.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) to conduct all statistical analyzes.

### Role of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^4bb6eff6]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Iqbal et al. observed a decrease in NYHA class among the thiamine group compared to the control group, whereas this was not evident in the study by Wong et al. The combined findings suggested that there was no discernible distinction between the two groups (WMD = −0.223, 95% CI: −0.781 to 0.335, p = 0.434, I² = 87.1%; Figure 4D).

Changes in thiamine status were evaluated in four trials. Shimon et al. observed a significant reduction in TPP effect following thiamine supplementation, with values decreasing from 11.7% ± 6.5% to 5.4% ± 3.2% (p < 0.01). Iqbal et al. also reported significantly lower TPP effect levels in the thiamine group compared to the control group (6.8% ± 1.5% vs. 16.0% ± 6.7%, p < 0.01). Furthermore, Keith et al. and Wong et al. demonstrate graphically that patients with heart failure who received thiamine had significantly higher erythrocyte TPP concentrations compared to those who received placebo.

### Effects of vitamin D on cardiac function in Patients with chronic HF: the VINDICATE study [^85de7c0f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure (HF) secondary to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is a common condition affecting 5 million individuals in the United Statesand a similar number in Western Europe. While the prognosis of chronic HF has improved substantially during the last 2 decades, mortality remains high with 50% of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis.

Patients suffering from cardiovascular disease are frequently deficient in the steroid hormone vitamin D, and vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with the development of chronic HF in a number of studies. Approximately 90% of chronic HF patients have hypovitaminosis D, even in sunny climates. The agent has a range of pleiotropic effects that in the setting of chronic HF may impact on disease severity, but despite this, clinical trials examining vitamin D supplementation in chronic HF patients have to date been inconclusive.

The aim of the VINDICATE (VitamIN D treatIng patients with Chronic heArT failurE) study was to describe the safety and efficacy of long-term, high-dose vitamin D 3 supplementation on submaximal exercise capacity and cardiac function in patients with chronic HF due to LVSD.

### Systemic endothelial dysfunction as an early predictor of adverse outcome in heart failure [^eb74b26b]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Endothelial dysfunction is an early event in the natural progression of heart failure. Increased oxidative stress has been linked to impaired endothelial function and both may play a prognostic role.

Methods and Results

Endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilatation were determined in 289 patients with mild left ventricular dysfunction by measuring forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside using venous occlusion plethysmography. Vascular effects of the coadministration of the antioxidant vitamin C at pharmacological doses (24 mg/min) were assessed. Occurrence of death, heart transplantation, and readmission with worsening heart failure were recorded as clinical outcome parameters during a follow-up period of 4.8 years. Patients experiencing adverse events (n = 79) had lower vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (P < 0.001) and to sodium nitroprusside (P = 0.03) compared with patients without events. However, beneficial effects of vitamin C did not differ between both groups. Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that age (P = 0.001), renal function (P = 0.001), and blunted acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation (P = 0.007) remained independent predictors of adverse outcome.

Conclusions

Impaired peripheral endothelial function independently predicts long-term adverse outcome in patients with early-stage heart failure. The findings suggest that assessment of peripheral endothelial function may represent an additional mean for risk stratification and therapy management in these patients.

Our meta‐analysis adhered to the Updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The present meta‐analysis has been duly registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, under the unique registration number CRD42023408247. All data in our study were obtained from published articles, thus exempting us from the requirement of ethical approval.

2.1 Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for relevant articles up until May 2023. The search strategy included terms such as (thiamin OR vitamin B1 OR aneurin OR thiamine mononitrate) AND (heart failure OR heart decompensation OR cardiac failure OR myocardial failure). In addition to the electronic search, we performed a manual search of the relevant literature, including reviews and references.

Inclusion criteria: RCTs; trials were conducted in patients with a diagnosis of CHF; the intervention group was administered any form of thiamine in comparison to the placebo group; studies that provided sufficient information for both the treatment and control groups.

Exclusion criteria: non‐English publication; abstracts lacking complete results; no interesting results.

2.2 Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

Two independent reviewers (P.G. and S.H.) applied predefined criteria to review eligible studies and extract the required data. We have collected the following data: study characteristics, patient numbers, treatment protocols including thiamine type and dosage, follow‐up periods, and outcome measures. The primary efficacy endpoint is the LVEF, with additional endpoints including the left ventricular end‐diastolic volume (LVEDV), 6‐min walking test (6MWT), N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and indicators to assess thiamine status such as TPP and TPP effect. We utilized the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess the potential for bias in the RCTs that were included in our analysis.

### Vitamin K-a neglected player in cardiovascular health: a narrative review [^e7dd16bc]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future directions

This review covers the rapidly expanding evidence supporting the cardioprotective effects of vitamin K 2 intake. Mediated by activated MGP, the benefits of vitamin K 2 extend beyond calcification homeostasis and antagonism, and may further include preventing or slowing the progression of arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, diabetes and HF. Moreover, vitamin K 2 supplementation appears safe and practical, and its use can be readily investigated in randomised clinical trials. Although the data presented in this review are encouraging, most of the included studies were limited by their non-randomised design, heterogeneity in results, variable dosages and formulations of vitamin K used, small sample sizes, short duration of follow-up and restricted ability to accurately assess vitamin K intake, in turn precluding our ability to infer causality of clinical endpoints. With evidence mounting, the definitive role of vitamin K 2 supplementation in delaying progression of vascular and valvular calcification remains the subject of multiple randomised clinical trials. Nonetheless, the utility of vitamin K 2 and MGP in various patient populations such as those with valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathy grows commensurate the data supporting its efficacy in improving cardiac function and decelerating arterial stiffness.

3 Results

3.1 Search Results

Five articles were obtained from a previous meta‐analysis. (The authors or institutions involved in this meta‐analysis did not have any overlap with those involved in our study.) A comprehensive search of databases and references yielded 275 eligible articles, which were then screened for duplicates resulting in 194 unique articles. After filtering by title and abstract, 177 irrelevant studies were excluded. The remaining 17 articles underwent full‐text review based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultimately leading to the inclusion of two new studies. In the end, a total of seven articles were included in the analysis (Figure 1).

Flow chart of the meta‐analysis.

3.2 Study Characteristics

Table 1 presents a summary of the clinical characteristics of the studies included in this analysis. All trials, comprising five parallel and two crossover designs, were randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled investigations. In addition to the five studies identified from previous meta‐analysis, we conducted a comprehensive search and included two additional studies by Mousavi et al. and Sofi et al. thereby augmenting the participant pool by 92 individuals. Data from 274 individuals were included in the current meta‐analysis, with thiamine doses ranging from 100 to 500 mg/day and treatment durations spanning from 1 week to 6 months.

Table 1
Patient characteristics.

3.3 Quality Assessment

All studies reported blinding of participants and personnel, as well as selective reporting, with a low risk of bias. However, three articles failed to disclose whether the resulting data were incomplete. Additionally, two studies had unclear methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Sofi et al. did not explicitly mention blinding of outcome assessment. Two studies had unclear other biases due to small sample sizes and an unbalanced baseline. The assessment of bias risk is presented in Figure 2.

### Treating oxidative stress in heart failure: past, present and future [^f2d05443]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Advances in cardiovascular research have identified oxidative stress as an important pathophysiological pathway in the development and progression of heart failure. Oxidative stress is defined as the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the endogenous antioxidant defence system. Under physiological conditions, small quantities of ROS are produced intracellularly, which function in cell signalling, and can be readily reduced by the antioxidant defence system. However, under pathophysiological conditions, the production of ROS exceeds the buffering capacity of the antioxidant defence system, resulting in cell damage and death. Over the last decades several studies have tried to target oxidative stress with the aim to improve outcome in patients with heart failure, with very limited success. The reasons as to why these studies failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects remain unclear. However, one plausible explanation might be that currently employed strategies, which target oxidative stress by exogenous inhibition of ROS production or supplementation of exogenous antioxidants, are not effective enough, while bolstering the endogenous antioxidant capacity might be a far more potent avenue for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we provide an overview of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of heart failure and the strategies utilized to date to target this pathway. We provide novel insights into modulation of endogenous antioxidants, which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcome in patients with heart failure.

### Heart failure, redox alterations, and endothelial dysfunction [^e7697a89]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Heart failure is characterized by neurohumoral alterations, such as activation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased activity of the endothelin system, increased production of norepinephrine, and increased circulating levels of cytokines. Oxidative stress is associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The myocardium has enzymes that stimulate ROS generation and enzymes with antioxidant effects. Several studies have suggested that ROS are increased in the failing heart. ROS may contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure by initiating myocyte apoptosis and exerting direct negatively inotropic effects through the reduction of cytosolic intracellular free calcium. However, mechanisms such as endothelial dysfunction and inflammation have also been involved in the progression of heart failure. Antioxidants (eg, vitamin C) seem to improve endothelial functionality and reduce the inflammatory response in patients with heart failure. Therefore, in this review, we analyzed the involvement of ROS in the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with endothelial dysfunction in heart failure.

### Effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality in heart failure (EVITA): a 3-year randomized clinical trial with 4000 IU vitamin D daily [^f1a5dfa0]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels < 75nmol/L are associated with a nonlinear increase in mortality risk. Such 25OHD levels are common in heart failure (HF). We therefore examined whether oral vitamin D supplementation reduces mortality in patients with advanced HF.

Methods and Results

Four hundred HF patients with 25OHD levels < 75nmol/L were randomized to receive 4000IU vitamin D daily or matching placebo for 3years. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Key secondary outcome measures included hospitalization, resuscitation, mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implant, high urgent listing for heart transplantation, heart transplantation, and hypercalcaemia. Initial 25OHD levels were on average < 40nmol/L, remained around 40nmol/L in patients assigned to placebo and plateaued around 100nmol/L in patients assigned to vitamin D. Mortality was not different in patients receiving vitamin D (19.6%; n = 39) or placebo (17.9%; n = 36) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69–1.71; P = 0.726]. The need for MCS implant was however greater in patients assigned to vitamin D (15.4%, n = 28) vs. placebo [9.0%, n = 15; HR: 1.96 (95% CI: 1.04–3.66); P = 0.031]. Other secondary clinical endpoints were similar between groups. The incidence of hypercalcaemia was 6.2% (n = 10) and 3.1% (n = 5) in patients receiving vitamin D or placebo (P = 0.192).

Conclusion

A daily vitamin D dose of 4000IU did not reduce mortality in patients with advanced HF but was associated with a greater need for MCS implants. Data indicate caution regarding long-term supplementation with moderately high vitamin D doses.

### Composite dietary antioxidant index and the risk of heart failure: a cross-sectional study from NHANES [^026e1dc0]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first population‐based retrospective cohort study to explore the relationship between CDAI and HF risk. We found that CDAI had a negatively relationship with the risk of HF after adjusting for potential confounders, and people in the higher quartiles of the CDAI score had a reduced the risk of HF compared to those in the lowest quartile of CDAI.

Oxidative stress, one of the most important factors in cell injury, play an important role in the pathogenesis of HF. Because nutritional supplements play an important role as antioxidants, the focus on the effects of dietary TAC is increasing. Dietary TAC is calculated from the oxygen‐free radiation absorption capacity, and it is associated with a lower risk of HF. Dietary intakes can regulate the plasma redox and protect from reactive oxygen species. Therefore, high dietary antioxidants may reduce the risk of HF. The CDAI comprises vitamins (A, C, and E) and nutritional factors (zinc and selenium), as a score of total dietary antioxidants, and is widely used in the clinical situations. High CDAI is a protective factor against depression, and higher CDAI has been linked to decreased cardiovascular mortality risk. Vitamin C supplementation increased myocardial contractility and endothelial function. Vitamin E can also increase endogenous antioxidant levels. In patients with HF, vitamin E supplementation can reduce the risk of developing HF.

### Role of thiamine supplementation in the treatment of chronic heart failure: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^68fa9f80]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 Results

4.1 Primary End Point

All studies evaluated LVEF changes during thiamine treatment. Four of the seven studies reported a significant improvement in LVEF after thiamine supplementation compared to placebo. However, the random effects model did not reveal any significant differences between the thiamine and placebo groups in terms of pooled effect sizes (WMD = 1.653%, 95% CI: −1.098 to 4.405, p = 0.239; Figure 3A). A significant level of heterogeneity was observed (I² = 61.8%, p = 0.015). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted (Figure 3B), which revealed that Keith et al. contributed the most to the heterogeneity in this meta‐analysis. The exclusion of this study resulted in a substantial reduction in heterogeneity (I² = 0, p = 0.51). Although the heterogeneity was mitigated after excluding the study conducted by Keith et al. we consider this study, with its extensive follow‐up and substantial participant pool, to be of significant impact and should not be excluded.

(C) Funnel plot of the studies included in the meta‐analysis. (D) Funnel plot using the trim‐and‐fill method. CI, confidence interval; WMD, weighted mean difference.

Using a funnel plot to assess publication bias in the seven included studies, we observed asymmetry in the funnel plot (Figure 3C), indicating the presence of publication bias. Employing Stata version 16.0, Egger's test yielded p = 0.013 and Begg's test yielded p = 0.23. There is evidence suggesting that Egger's test may be more sensitive in detecting publication bias compared to Begg's test. A p < 0.05 from Egger's test was found to be indicative of publication bias. To further assess this, we employed the trim‐and‐fill method and estimated the presence of three unpublished studies (Figure 3D). After incorporating the three unpublished studies, the funnel plots exhibited symmetry and the newly calculated pooled differences between treatment and placebo groups remained statistically insignificant (WMD = −0.055%, 95% CI: −2.612 to 2.501, p = 0.966). As there was no significant alteration in results upon inclusion of these studies, we concluded that publication bias was deemed acceptable.

### Vitamin D deficiency is a predictor of reduced survival in patients with heart failure; vitamin D supplementation improves outcome [^7777bdef]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Vitamin D deficiency is a highly prevalent, global phenomenon. The prevalence in heart failure (HF) patients and its effect on outcome are less clear. We evaluated vitamin D levels and vitamin D supplementation in patients with HF and its effect on mortality.

Methods and Results

25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were evaluated in HF patients from a health maintenance organization (HMO), and compared them with those of the rest of the members of the HMO. Patients with HF (n = 3009) had a lower median 25(OH)D level compared with the control group (n = 46 825): 36.9 nmol/L (interquartile range 23.2–55.9) vs. 40.7 nmol/L (26.7–56.9), respectively, P < 0.00001. The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L] was higher in patients with HF compared with the control group (28% vs. 22%, P < 0.00001). Only 8.8% of the HF patients had optimal 25(OH)D levels (≥ 75 nmol/L). Median clinical follow-up was 518 days. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency was an independent predictor of increased mortality in patients with HF [hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21–1.92, P < 0.001] and in the control group (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.48–2.46, P < 0.00001). Vitamin D supplementation was independently associated with reduced mortality in HF patients (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.85, P < 0.0001). Parameters associated with vitamin D deficiency in HF patients were decreased previous solar radiation exposure, body mass index, diabetes, female gender, pulse, and decreased calcium and haemoglobin levels.

Conclusions

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in HF patients and is a significant predictor of reduced survival. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with improved outcome.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) evidence — Trials in prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including HF, showed that omega-3 PUFA supplementation results in a 10% to 20% risk reduction in fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events when used with other evidence-based therapies. In GISSI-HF, a reduction in death was observed among post–myocardial infarction patients taking 1 g of omega-3 PUFA (850–882 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] as ethyl esters in the ratio of 1:1.2), with a post hoc subgroup analysis indicating concentration of benefit in approximately 2000 patients with reduced LVEF. In symptomatic HF, patients were randomized to 1 g daily of omega-3 PUFA (850–882 mg of EPA+DHA) or placebo, with death from any cause reduced from 29% with placebo to 27% in those treated; the composite of death or admission to hospital for a cardiovascular event was also significantly reduced.

### The effect of vitamin D on aldosterone and health status in patients with heart failure [^00253522]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is associated with heart failure (HF) events, and in animal models vitamin D down-regulates renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system hormones.

Methods

Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV HF and a 25OH-D level ≤ 37.5 ng/mL received 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly (n = 31) or placebo (n = 33) for 6 months. Serum aldosterone, renin, echocardiography, and health status were determined at baseline and 6 months.

Results

Mean age of participants was 65.9 ± 10.4 years, 48% were women, 64% were African American, mean ejection fraction was 37.6 ± 13.9%, 36% were in NYHA functional class III, and 64% were in class II. The vitamin D group increased serum 25OH-D (19.1 ± 9.3 to 61.7 ± 20.3 ng/mL) and the placebo group did not (17.8 ± 9.0 to 17.4 ± 9.8 ng/mL). Aldosterone decreased in the vitamin D group (10.0 ± 11.9 to 6.2 ± 11.6 ng/dL) and not in the placebo group (8.9 ± 8.6 to 9.0 ± 12.4 ng/dL; P = 0.02). There was no difference between groups in renin, echocardiographic measures, or health status from baseline to 6 months. Modeling indicated that variables which predicted change in aldosterone included receiving vitamin D, increasing age, African American race, and lower glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusions

Vitamin D3 repletion decreases aldosterone in patients with HF and low serum vitamin D. Vitamin D may be an important adjunct to standard HF therapy. Further study will assess if vitamin D provides long-term benefit for patients with HF.

### Effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular and glycemic biomarkers [^fe7a4836]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Experimental studies have also suggested a link between vitamin D and other key pathways involved in vascular and cardiac function, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 including the neurohormonal system. In human observational studies, 25‐OH‐D concentrations are inversely associated with decreased plasma renin activity 67, 68, 69 and NT‐proBNP levels among patients with heart failure. 70 However, causality cannot be established by observational studies. Prior randomized studies examining the influence of vitamin D supplementation on renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system are limited 71, 72, 73 and have largely been negative. 71, 72 Similarly, randomized studies of the effects of vitamin D supplementation on B‐type natriuretic peptide levels in humans have mostly been limited to patients with significant comorbidities, and have produced inconsistent findings. 72, 74, 75 Several RCTs have sought to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiac biomarkers and congestive heart failure end points among patients with chronic heart failure, including 6‐minute walk test, left ventricular remodeling, and NT‐proBNP levels, with pooled results demonstrating no significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on improvement in NT‐proBNP. 76 In our relatively healthy population, we found that vitamin D supplementation does not significantly affect the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system or natriuretic peptide levels. Our study extends the literature by examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation on cardiac and vascular biomarkers in a large cohort of patients without significant comorbidities that may have influenced the results of prior studies. Moreover, we examined these effects after an extensive duration of adequate vitamin D supplementation that produced a substantial difference in vitamin D levels between dose groups. Our findings that improvements in vitamin D status did not appear to influence neurohormonal activation or cardiac wall stress are concordant with the largely negative findings regarding the effect of vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation on BP, vascular function, and cardiac remodeling. 8, 10, 77, 78, 79

### Treating oxidative stress in heart failure: past, present and future [^20d38cb0]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The role of oxidative stress in the onset and progression of heart failure has been extensively studied. Pre‐clinical studies showed promising results with various anti‐oxidative strategies, but these beneficial effects did not translate into positive results in clinical studies in patients with heart failure. This might be caused by inadequate patient inclusion criteria or off target effects of currently employed therapies. Therefore, we believe there is still room for novel antioxidant approaches in heart failure. In particular, targeting the endogenous antioxidant capacity might be interesting new targets in the treatment of heart failure. Of interest would be the development of medications capable of interacting with the components of the γ‐glutamyl cycle or NAD + production, which may lead to novel treatment options for heart failure in the future.

Conflict of interest: none declared.

### Treating oxidative stress in heart failure: past, present and future [^8496229a]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The future of oxidative stress as a therapeutic target in heart failure

The major endogenous antioxidants in mammalian cells are NAD + and GSH, the latter produced via the γ‐glutamyl cycle. NAD + has a multitude of cellular functions, and more recently it has become evident that it plays an important role in the detoxification of cellular ROS. Similarly, GSH protects cells against oxidative stress, and both NAD + and GSH levels have been shown to be associated with heart failure in the experimental and clinical setting. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 Furthermore, supplementation of NAD + or GSH precursors has been found to improve cardiac function and redox state in models for heart failure. 26, 28, 29 Thus, we propose two approaches for future anti‐oxidative stress therapies in heart failure patients: (i) increasing the endogenous antioxidant capacity, and (ii) increasing the expression/activity of antioxidant producing enzymes.
