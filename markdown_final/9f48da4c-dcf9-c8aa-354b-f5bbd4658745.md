## Question

Meperidine mechanism of action

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about meperidine's mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary opioid receptor mechanism and how it compares to morphine. Then, I should verify non-opioid receptor effects, especially alpha-2 adrenergic and serotonin transporter interactions. Next, I will examine local anesthetic properties and their clinical implications. After that, I need to check the role of the normeperidine metabolite and its neurotoxic potential. Finally, I will integrate these mechanisms into a concise, clinically relevant summary and confirm any dose-response or receptor-specific claims against the cited data.

> Let me first confirm the primary mechanism. Meperidine is an opioid agonist with multiple actions qualitatively similar to morphine, producing analgesia and sedation via central nervous system opioid receptor activation, which aligns with classic opioid pharmacology and the FDA labeling that repeatedly notes similarity to morphine in CNS and smooth muscle effects [^5224982a] [^06ff5003].

> Wait, let me verify receptor specificity. Although labels emphasize opioid receptor agonism, preclinical work shows meperidine binds and activates alpha-2 adrenoceptors, particularly the alpha-2B subtype, with high affinity relative to other alpha-2 subtypes; however, antagonists of alpha-2 receptors did not block meperidine's analgesia in that study, suggesting this interaction contributes to some non-analgesic effects rather than the primary antinociceptive effect, so I should be careful not to overstate its analgesic contribution [^3a126a77].

> I need to check serotonergic effects next. Meperidine inhibits the serotonin transporter (SERT), which can increase synaptic serotonin and, in combination with other serotonergic agents, precipitate serotonin toxicity; this mechanistic liability is well described in perioperative and clinical toxicology literature and explains case reports of serotonin syndrome with meperidine plus MAOIs or linezolid, so I should flag this as a clinically important non–mu-opioid mechanism with safety implications [^1be56b8e] [^0fb85dc6] [^da0456a4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all effects being receptor mediated. Meperidine has local anesthetic properties via blockade of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels in spinal dorsal horn neurons, which can suppress action potential generation; this explains its occasional intrathecal or epidural use and its utility for postanesthetic shivering, though I should confirm that this is adjunctive to, not a replacement for, opioid receptor–mediated analgesia [^f649cbce] [^c0d158bc].

> I will now examine the metabolite dimension. Meperidine is N-demethylated to normeperidine, which has a longer half-life and pro-convulsant activity; accumulation with repeated dosing, especially in renal impairment, increases seizure risk and neurotoxicity, so the mechanism here is not direct receptor agonism but rather toxic metabolite accumulation lowering seizure threshold, which is why guidelines restrict dose and duration and advise avoidance in renal impairment when possible [^64ce9906] [^0937c85b] [^14187bd5].

> Let me think about clinical correlations to ensure internal consistency. The rapid onset and short duration of meperidine align with its lipophilicity and receptor kinetics, while its inferior or comparable analgesic performance versus alternatives and higher adverse effect burden, including sedation and neurotoxicity, reflect both the short duration necessitating redosing and the normeperidine accumulation risk; this mechanistic-clinical bridge supports modern recommendations to avoid meperidine except for limited scenarios like treatment of postanesthetic shivering or amphotericin B–related rigors [^5a39d96d] [^5ae156b8] [^94f41893].

> But wait, what if someone claims a unique antishivering mechanism unrelated to opioids? I should double-check that. Evidence supports kappa-opioid activity, alpha-2 effects, and possibly monoamine reuptake inhibition contributing to antishivering, yet the analgesic effect remains primarily mu-opioid receptor–mediated and blockable by naloxone, reinforcing that multiple parallel mechanisms can explain different clinical endpoints without contradicting the core opioid agonism [^c0d158bc] [^3a126a77].

> In summary, meperidine's analgesia is primarily via mu-opioid receptor agonism analogous to morphine, with additional alpha-2 adrenergic interactions, SERT inhibition with serotonergic liability, and local anesthetic channel blockade; clinically, the most consequential non-analgesic mechanism is accumulation of normeperidine, which drives seizures and limits safe use, especially with repeated dosing or renal dysfunction, so I need to ensure any clinical recommendation reflects these mechanistic constraints and current safety guidance [^5224982a] [^3a126a77] [^1be56b8e] [^64ce9906] [^0937c85b].

Meperidine is a **mu-opioid receptor agonist** [^5224982a] that produces analgesia and sedation by activating opioid receptors in the CNS, with additional **serotonin reuptake inhibition** [^1be56b8e] that contributes to unique effects such as antishivering [^c0d158bc]. It also has **local anesthetic properties** [^f649cbce] via sodium channel blockade, which can enhance spinal analgesia. Meperidine is metabolized to normeperidine, a neurotoxic metabolite that can accumulate and cause seizures, especially with repeated dosing or renal impairment [^64ce9906] [^0937c85b]. These mechanisms underpin its analgesic and antishivering effects, as well as its safety limitations compared with other opioids [^445e60d7].

---

## Primary mechanism of action: opioid receptor agonism

- **Mu-opioid receptor agonism**: Meperidine binds to and activates mu-opioid receptors in the CNS, producing analgesia and sedation [^5224982a] [^06ff5003].
- **Comparison with morphine**: Its analgesic effects are qualitatively similar to morphine, though meperidine is less potent and has a shorter duration of action [^f8de87e9] [^5a39d96d].
- **Clinical implications**: Rapid onset and short duration make it useful for acute pain, but repeated dosing can lead to accumulation of normeperidine, increasing toxicity risk [^093cffd6].

---

## Additional mechanisms of action

### Serotonin reuptake inhibition

Meperidine **inhibits serotonin reuptake** [^1be56b8e], increasing synaptic serotonin and contributing to unique effects such as antishivering [^c0d158bc]. This serotonergic activity also underlies the risk of **serotonin syndrome** when combined with other serotonergic drugs [^0fb85dc6].

---

### Local anesthetic properties

Meperidine **blocks voltage-gated sodium channels** [^f649cbce] in spinal dorsal horn neurons, contributing to local anesthetic effects and enhancing spinal analgesia. This property is particularly relevant in **neuraxial anesthesia** and for **postoperative shivering control** [^c0d158bc].

---

## Metabolism and active metabolites

Meperidine is metabolized primarily to **normeperidine**, a neurotoxic metabolite with a longer half-life (15–30 hours) than the parent drug [^093cffd6]. Normeperidine accumulation can cause **CNS excitation**, including seizures, especially with repeated dosing or renal impairment [^64ce9906] [^14187bd5].

---

## Clinical implications of mechanism of action

- **Analgesia**: Effective for acute pain but less potent than morphine, requiring higher doses for equivalent effect [^f8de87e9] [^5a39d96d].
- **Antishivering**: Unique serotonergic and local anesthetic properties make it effective for postoperative shivering [^c0d158bc] [^5ae156b8].
- **Safety concerns**: Neurotoxicity from normeperidine accumulation limits use, particularly in renal impairment or with repeated dosing [^0937c85b] [^14187bd5].

## Comparison with other opioids

| **Feature** | **Meperidine** | **Morphine** | **Fentanyl** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Potency | Lower | Higher | Much higher |
| Duration | Shorter | Longer | Shorter |
| Unique properties | Serotonin reuptake inhibition; local anesthetic | None significant | High lipophilicity; rapid onset |
| Major limitation | Normeperidine neurotoxicity | Constipation; respiratory depression | Respiratory depression; tolerance |

---

Meperidine's mechanism of action is multifaceted, involving **mu-opioid receptor agonism**, **serotonin reuptake inhibition**, and **local anesthetic effects**. These properties explain its analgesic and antishivering effects, but also its safety limitations, particularly due to normeperidine accumulation.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Meperidine is an opioid agonist with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most prominent of these involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on the Central Nervous System

Meperidine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Meperidine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Meperidine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, transient elevations in serum amylase, and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction (OIED).

Effects on the Cardiovascular System

Meperidine produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Meperidine hydrochloride is a narcotic analgesic with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most prominent of these involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.

There is some evidence which suggests that meperidine may produce less smooth muscle spasm, constipation, and depression of the cough reflex than equianalgesic doses of morphine. Meperidine, in 60 mg to 80 mg parenteral doses, is approximately equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of morphine. The onset of action is slightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. Meperidine is significantly less effective by the oral than by the parenteral route, but the exact ratio of oral to parenteral effectiveness is unknown.

Effects on the Endocrine System

Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and luteinizing hormones (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.

Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6)] .

### The relative efficacy of meperidine for the treatment of acute migraine: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^11ddd4a4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Despite guidelines recommending against opioids as first-line treatment for acute migraine, meperidine is the agent used most commonly in North American emergency departments. Clinical trials performed to date have been small and have not arrived at consistent conclusions about the efficacy of meperidine. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the relative efficacy and adverse effect profile of opioids compared with nonopioid active comparators for the treatment of acute migraine.

Methods

We searched multiple sources (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS, emergency and headache medicine conference proceedings) for randomized controlled trials comparing parenteral opioid and nonopioid active comparators for the treatment of acute migraine headache. Our primary outcome was relief of headache. If this was unavailable, we accepted rescue medication use or we transformed visual analog scale change scores by using an established procedure. We grouped studies by comparator: a regimen containing dihydroergotamine, antiemetic alone, or ketorolac. For each study, we calculated an odds ratio (OR) of headache relief and then assessed clinical and statistical heterogeneity for the group of studies. We then pooled the ORs of headache relief with a random-effects model.

Results

From 899 citations, 19 clinical trials were identified, of which 11 were appropriate and had available data. Four trials involving 254 patients compared meperidine to dihydroergotamine, 4 trials involving 248 patients compared meperidine to an antiemetic, and 3 trials involving 123 patients compared meperidine to ketorolac. Meperidine was less effective than dihydroergotamine at providing headache relief (OR=0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09 to 0.97) and trended toward less efficacy than the antiemetics (OR=0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.11); however, the efficacy of meperidine was similar to that of ketorolac (OR=1.75; 95% CI 0.84 to 3.61). Compared to dihydroergotamine, meperidine caused more sedation (OR=3.52; 95% CI 0.87 to 14.19) and dizziness (OR=8.67; 95% CI 2.66 to 28.23). Compared to the antiemetics, meperidine caused less akathisia (OR=0.10; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.57). Meperidine and ketorolac use resulted in similar rates of gastrointestinal adverse effects (OR=1.27; 95% CI 0.31 to 5.15) and sedation (OR=1.70; 95% CI 0.23 to 12.72).

Conclusion

Clinicians should consider alternatives to meperidine when treating acute migraine with injectable agents.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Meperidine hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to meperidine.

Meperidine is contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or those who have recently received such agents. Therapeutic doses of meperidine have occasionally precipitated unpredictable, severe, and occasionally fatal reactions in patients who have received such agents within 14 days. The mechanism of these reactions is unclear, but may be related to a preexisting hyperphenylalaninemia. Some have been characterized by coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension, and have resembled the syndrome of acute narcotic overdose. In other reactions the predominant manifestations have been hyperexcitability, convulsions, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, and hypertension. Although it is not known that other narcotics are free of the risk of such reactions, virtually all of the reported reactions have occurred with meperidine. If a narcotic is needed in such patients, a sensitivity test should be performed in which repeated, small, incremental doses of morphine are administered over the course of several hours while the patient’s condition and vital signs are under careful observation. (Intravenous hydrocortisone or prednisolone have been used to treat severe reactions, with the addition of intravenous chlorpromazine in those cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia. The usefulness and safety of narcotic antagonists in the treatment of these reactions is unknown.)

2.5 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. If adequate pain management cannot be achieved with a total daily dosage of 600 mg or less, discontinue treatment with meperidine by tapering the dose and select an alternate analgesic.

Continually reevaluate patients receiving meperidine to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and other adverse reactions, as well as to reassess for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.17)] . Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.

If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the meperidine dosage. If after increasing the dosage, unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed (including an increase in pain after dosage increase), consider reducing the dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse reactions.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of meperidine during product development did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to evaluate age-related differences in safety or efficacy. Literature reports indicate that geriatric patients have a slower elimination rate compared to young patients and they may be more susceptible to the effects of meperidine. A reduction in the total daily dose of meperidine may be required in elderly patients, and the potential benefits of the drug weighed against the relative risk to a geriatric patient.

### Voluntary warnings and the limits of good prescribing behavior: the case for de-adoption of meperidine [^db7198da]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Meperidine (also known as pethidine) was first developed as an anticholinergic agent in 1939, but its analgesic properties were quickly discovered. Meperidine was promoted as an opioid alternative to morphine that might avoid some of morphine’s adverse effects including respiratory depression, constipation, urinary retention, abuse, and addiction.Meperidine became one of the most widely used opioids in North America.Despite the initial promise and widespread use, it has become clear that meperidine is actually a more problematic drug than morphine. Meperidine’s rapid onset, initially suggested as an advantage, makes the drug prone to abuse. It is considered one of the most intoxicating opioids and has often been associated with addiction in health care professionals.Meperidine has a relatively short duration of action with a half-life of 2–5 hours, making repeated dosing necessary for continuous pain management. Meperidine is metabolized to normeperidine, a neurotoxic metabolite with a much longer half-life (15–30 hours). Repeated dosing can lead to accumulation of normeperidine and has been associated with seizures and delirium.Taken on balance, it is generally agreed that meperidine offers few advantages and has considerable additional risks compared to other opioids.

This increased understanding of the limitations of meperidine coupled with case reports of patient harm led safety and quality organizations to begin placing restrictions on its use.In Canada, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) issued warnings in 2004 and 2005 suggesting that meperidine be avoided, and when used, it should be in limited doses (<600 mg/24 h) and for a limited duration (<48 hours).Many of these restrictions have been implemented in the relatively controlled environment of the hospital.–There has been relatively limited assessment of the issue of meperidine use in the less regulated community setting.

In this study, the objective was to assess the potential impact of ISMP warnings on prescribing in the community and to determine the current level of usage using time series analysis for the population in Manitoba, Canada (1.3 million people).

### The safety of meperidine prescribing in older adults: a longitudinal population-based study [^093cffd6]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Meperidine (pethidine) was once one of the most commonly used opioid analgesics in North America. More than 50 years after its introduction the American Pain Society began pointing out the problems with meperidine and suggesting limiting its use. Meperidine has a rapid onset of action which makes it more prone to abuse than other opioids. In terms of efficacy, meperidine lacks potency and has a relatively short duration of action (2.5 to 3.5 h) compared to morphine. As such, it is frequently under-dosed and given at intervals longer than its duration of action resulting in poor pain control. While meperidine has a half-life of only 2 to5 h, its metabolism produces normeperidine, a neurotoxic metabolite with a much longer half-life of 15 to 30 h. This creates a clinical dilemma where the dosing frequency necessary for adequate pain control is likely to produce accumulation of normeperidine which has been associated with delirium and seizures.

There are a number of reasons why older adults may experience more adverse effects related to meperidine. Firstly, older adults are more sensitive to the central nervous system side effects of meperidine including anxiety, hallucinations, confusion, and seizures. Secondly, renal function generally diminishes with age, and as normeperidine is eliminated renally, older adults are more likely to accumulate normeperidine with repeated dosing, putting them at elevated risk of toxicity. It is therefore not surprising that meperidine has been included on the Beers list of medications that are best avoided in older adults. A recent examination of the outcomes associated with medications on the Beers list prescribed to older adults found meperidine to be the medication most strongly associated with unplanned hospitalizations (OR 2.37, 95 % CI 1.25–4.50).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For Relief of Pain

Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain and the response of the patient. Meperidine is less effective orally than on parenteral administration. The dose of meperidine hydrochloride should be proportionately reduced (usually by 25 to 50 percent) when administered concomitantly with phenothiazines and many other tranquilizers since they potentiate the action of meperidine.

Adults

The usual dosage is 50 mg to 150 mg orally, every 3 or 4 hours as necessary.

Pediatric Patients

The usual dosage is 1.1 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg orally, up to the adult dose, every 3 or 4 hours as necessary.

### Meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol) [^5a39d96d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Effects on the Immune System

Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

Concentration–Efficacy Relationships

The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of meperidine for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] .

Meperidine, in 60 mg to 80 mg parenteral doses, is approximately equivalent in analgesic effect to 10 mg of morphine. The onset of action is slightly more rapid than with morphine, and the duration of action is slightly shorter. Meperidine is significantly less effective by the oral than by the parenteral route, but the exact ratio of oral to parenteral effectiveness is unknown.

Concentration–Adverse Reaction Relationships

There is a relationship between increasing meperidine plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose-related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, CNS effects, and respiratory depression. In opioid-tolerant patients, the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid-related adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)] .

### Meperidine suppresses the excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons [^f649cbce]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In addition to local anesthetics, meperidine has been successfully used for local anesthesia. When applied intrathecally, the dorsal horn neurons of the superficial laminae are exposed to high concentrations of meperidine. These cells represent an important point for the transmission of pain information. This study investigated the blocking effects of meperidine on different ionic currents of spinal dorsal horn neurons and, in particular, its impact on the generation of action potentials.

Methods

Using a combination of the patch clamp technique and the entire soma isolation method, the action of meperidine on voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons of rats was described. Current clamp recordings from intact neurons showed the functional relevance of the ion current blockade for the generation of action potentials.

Results

Externally applied meperidine reversibly blocked voltage-gated Na+ currents with a half-maximum inhibiting concentration (IC50) of 112 microM. During repetitive stimulation, a slight phasic block occurred. In addition, A-type K+ currents and delayed-rectifier K+ currents were affected in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 102 and 52 microM, respectively. In the current clamp mode, single action potentials were suppressed by meperidine. The firing frequency was lowered to 54% at concentrations (100 microM) insufficient for the suppression of a single action potential.

Conclusions

Meperidine inhibits the complex mechanism of generating action potentials in spinal dorsal horn neurons by the blockade of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels. This can contribute to the local anesthetic effect of meperidine during spinal anesthesia.

### A comparison between remifentanil and meperidine for labor analgesia: a systematic review [^dd028379]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Remifentanil is an ultrashort-acting opioid with favorable pharmacokinetic properties that make it suitable as a labor analgesic. Although it crosses the placenta freely, it is eliminated quickly in the neonate by rapid metabolism and redistribution. We aimed to determine whether remifentanil compared with meperidine is effective in reducing pain scores in laboring parturients. Other effects on the mother, the labor process, and the neonate were also examined.

Methods

MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Maternity and Infant Care databases were searched without language restriction using multiple keywords for labor analgesia, remifentanil, and meperidine. Published abstracts from 5 key research meetings and references from retrieved articles were examined for additional studies. Randomized controlled trials in laboring parturients comparing remifentanil with meperidine were selected. Risk of bias was assessed using criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed for adequacy of sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and completeness of follow-up. Data were extracted from each study using a standardized data collection form. The primary outcome was reduction in pain scores (visual analog scale [VAS], 0-100 mm). We also evaluated maternal side effects (sedation, oxygen desaturation, and bradypnea) and effects on the neonate (Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, and Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scores).

Results

Seven studies (349 patients) were identified for inclusion; only 3 studies were suitable for quantitative synthesis in a meta-analysis (233 patients). We found that remifentanil reduces the mean VAS score at 1 hour by 25 mm more than meperidine (P < 0.001) (95% confidence interval = 19-31 mm). Limited conclusions can be made regarding the side-effect profile of remifentanil because of insufficient data.

Conclusion

Compared with meperidine, remifentanil is superior in reducing mean VAS scores for labor pain after 1 hour.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^7022e939]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacologic analgesia—route and product selection for acute pain—Generally, administer opioids orally unless the specific clinical circumstance warrants parenteral administration. Long-acting products (e.g., extended-release preparations and transdermal preparations) are not appropriate for treatment of acute pain and should not be used, and avoid specific products such as meperidine and codeine. Begin opioid tapering as tissue healing occurs—particularly during step-down transitions of care—with a desired goal.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

Meperidine Hydrochloride Oral Solution

Ensure accuracy when prescribing, dispensing, and administering Meperidine Hydrochloride Oral Solution to avoid dosing errors due to confusion between mg and mL, and with other meperidine solutions of different concentrations, which could result in accidental overdose and death. Ensure the proper dose is communicated and dispensed. When writing prescriptions, include both the total dose in mg and the total dose in volume.

Instruct patients and caregivers on how to accurately measure and take or administer the correct dose of Meperidine Hydrochloride Oral Solution.

Strongly advise patients and caregivers to always use a graduated oral syringe or measuring cup, with metric units of measurements (i.e., mL), to correctly measure the prescribed amount of medication.

Inform patients and caregivers that oral dosing devices may be obtained from their pharmacy and to never use household teaspoons or tablespoons to measure Meperidine Hydrochloride Oral Solution.

Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution

Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution should be prescribed only by healthcare professionals who are knowledgeable about the use of opioids and how to mitigate the associated risks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration of time consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks.

Many acute pain conditions (e.g., the pain that occurs with a number of surgical procedures or acute musculoskeletal injuries) require no more than a few days of an opioid analgesic. Clinical guidelines on opioid prescribing for some acute pain conditions are available.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient’s underlying cause and severity of pain, prior analgesic treatment and response, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

### Determinants of prescribing meperidine compared to morphine in hospitalized patients [^18316178]. Pain (2004). Low credibility.

Morphine is a preferred narcotic since meperidine forms toxic metabolites. Determinants of meperidine use have been poorly described. The objective of this study is to explore factors associated with the ordering of meperidine versus morphine. Retrospective chart review of adult patients, randomly selected based on orders for morphine or meperidine. 1552 orders were written for 670 patients. Of these, 36% were for meperidine. In multivariable analysis, the ordering of meperidine was associated with the following variables in decreasing order of importance: physician specialty, total doses received, hospital location, patient race, age and insurance, and physician gender. More orders for meperidine were written for those receiving fewer doses. Though meperidine has little role in the routine management of hospital pain, we found it continues to be used frequently. Importantly, meperidine is ordered more frequently for patients who receive shorter courses of narcotics. Our study suggests that interventions targeted at more appropriate use of meperidine rather than complete elimination might be more acceptable to physicians while minimizing the risk of toxicity.

There has been further action to limit the use of meperidine. In Canada, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) issued safety warnings in 2004 and 2005, recommending that meperidine be limited to situations where alternative opioids are contraindicated. When its use cannot be avoided the ISMP recommendations suggest that doses should not exceed 600 mg of meperidine in 24 h, and duration of use should be limited to 48 h.

Given the higher risk in older adults we examined the use of meperidine in people 65 years of age and older in a longitudinal utilization analysis in Manitoba, Canada. The objective of this study was to determine the level of meperidine use in older adults and assess the dosage and duration of meperidine with reference to these safety recommendations.

### Analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of meperidine in managing postoperative or labor pain: a narrative review of randomized controlled trials [^445e60d7]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meperidine, a synthetic opioid, has a rapid onset and short duration of action. Mounting evidence has challenged meperidine's analgesic benefits, and concerns have been raised about its safety profile. Despite recommendations to restrict the prescription of meperidine, the drug remains frequently used.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of meperidine for acute postoperative and labor pain.

Study Design

This was a narrative review of the analgesic efficacy and side effects of meperidine compared to other analgesic drugs for acute postoperative and labor pain in adults.

Setting

Randomized controlled trials that compared the analgesic efficacy and side effect profile of meperidine versus another analgesic drug in adult patients were evaluated.

Methods

A systemized search of randomized controlled trials studying meperidine for acute postoperative or labor pain in the adult patient population from PubMed, Medline, and EMBASE was performed. Included studies reported on different routes of meperidine administration including intramuscular, intravenous, and patient-controlled analgesia in various surgical procedures such as abdominal surgery, Cesarean section, gynecological surgery, orthopedic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, as well as for labor analgesia. Meperidine's analgesic efficacy and safety profile were compared to other opioids (morphine, tramadol, fentanyl, buprenorphine, nalbuphine, and pentazocine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ketorolac, diclofenac, and indomethacin), dipyrone, ketamine, and bupivacaine.

Results

A total of 62 randomized controlled trials published between 1972 and 2018 were reviewed. Meperidine had a similar or inferior analgesic efficacy compared to other analgesics for acute postoperative or labor pain. Meperidine was associated with more sedation and respiratory depression.

Limitations

The sample sizes of many clinical studies were small, and therefore probably insufficiently powered to detect differences in uncommon side effects, such as central nervous system toxicity. In addition, some of the included clinical studies were old.

Conclusion

Considering the availability of other effective analgesics with potentially fewer side effects, the use of meperidine for acute postoperative or labor pain should not be recommended.

5.16 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders

The meperidine in Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders, and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. If dosage is escalated substantially above recommended levels because of tolerance development, seizures may occur in individuals without a history of seizure disorders. Regularly evaluate patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during meperidine therapy. Use of meperidine for an extended period of time may increase the risk of toxicity (e.g., seizures) from the accumulation of the meperidine metabolite, normeperidine.

5.17 Withdrawal

Do not abruptly discontinue Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets or Oral Solution in a patient physically dependent on opioids. When discontinuing Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets or Oral Solution in a physically dependent patient, gradually taper the dosage. Rapid tapering of meperidine in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

Additionally, avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving a full opioid agonist analgesic, including Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets and Oral Solution. In these patients, mixed agonist/antagonist and partial agonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.18 Risks of Driving and Operating Machinery

Meperidine may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets or Oral Solution and know how they will react to the medication [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.19 Risks in Patients with Pheochromocytoma

In patients with pheochromocytoma, meperidine has been reported to provoke hypertension.

5.20 Risk of Use in Patients with Atrial Flutter and Other Supraventricular Tachycardias

Meperidine should be used with caution in patients with atrial flutter and other supraventricular tachycardias because of a possible vagolytic action which may produce a significant increase in the ventricular response rate.

### Meperidine exerts agonist activity at the alpha (2B)-adrenoceptor subtype [^3a126a77]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The opioid agonist meperidine has actions, such as antishivering, that are more pronounced than those of other opioid agonists and that are not blocked with nonselective opioid antagonists. Agonists at the alpha(2) adrenoceptors, such as clonidine, are very effective antishivering drugs. Preliminary evidence also indicates that meperidine interacts with alpha(2) adrenoceptors. The authors therefore studied the ability of meperidine to bind and activate each of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes in a transfected cell system.

Methods

The ability of meperidine to bind to and inhibit forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate formation as mediated by the three alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes transiently transfected into COS-7 cells has been tested. The ability of the opioid antagonist naloxone and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and RX821002 to block the analgesic action of meperidine in the hot-plate test was also assessed. The ability of meperidine to fit into the alpha(2B) adrenoceptor was assessed using molecular modeling techniques.

Results

Meperidine bound to all alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes, with alpha(2B) having the highest affinity (alpha(2B), 8.6 +/- 0.3 microm; alpha(2C), 13.6 +/- 1.5 microm, P < 0.05; alpha(2A), 38.6 +/- 0.7 microm). Morphine was ineffective at binding to any of the receptor subtypes. Meperidine inhibited the production of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate mediated by all receptor subtypes but was most effective at the alpha(2B) adrenoceptor (alpha(2B), 0.6 microm; alpha(2A), 1.3 mm; alpha(2C), 0.3 mm), reaching the same level of inhibition (approximately 70%) as achieved with the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine. The analgesic action of meperidine was blocked by naloxone but not by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and RX821002. The modeling studies demonstrated that meperidine can fit into the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor subtype.

Conclusion

Meperidine is a potent agonist at the alpha2 adrenoceptors at its clinically relevant concentrations, especially at the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor subtype. Activation of the alpha(2B) receptor does not contribute significantly to the analgesic action of meperidine. This raises the possibility that some of its actions, such as antishivering, are transduced by this mechanism.

Acute migraine—meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of injectable opioids compared with other active agents found that meperidine was significantly less efficacious than dihydroergotamine (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97), caused more dizziness and sedation, and was less likely to result in return to normal functioning. There was a trend toward decreased efficacy of meperidine versus antiemetics (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.11) and a higher rate of return to the hospital for patients who received meperidine, although the antiemetics caused a higher rate of akathisia. There were no significant differences in efficacy or adverse event profile between meperidine and ketorolac (OR 1.75; 95% CI 0.84 to 3.61). Injectable administration was defined as intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes; studies required headache intensity data within 2 h of treatment, and the primary outcome was relief of headache within 1 h of medication administration.

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an overdose.

Explain to patients and caregivers that effects of opioid overdose reversal agents like naloxone and nalmefene are temporary, and that they must call 911 or get emergency medical help right away in all cases of known or suspected opioid overdose, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Overdosage (10)].

Advise patients and caregivers:

how to treat with the overdose reversal agent in the event of an opioid overdose.
to tell family and friends about the opioid reversal agent, and to keep it in a place where family and friends can access it in an emergency.
to read the Patient Information (or other educational material) that will come with their opioid overdose reversal agent. Emphasize the importance of doing this before an opioid emergency happens, so the patient and caregiver will know what to do.

MAOI Interaction

### Effect of intrathecal lipophilic opioids on the incidence of shivering in women undergoing cesarean delivery after spinal anesthesia: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c0d158bc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Meperidine is an opioid with intermediate lipid solubility and is unique in having local anesthetic properties. It has been used as a sole agent for spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. It prolongs postoperative analgesia for up to 4 h, which is considerably lower compared to IT morphine, which can provide analgesic effect for up to 24 h. An incidence of pruritus of 10.7–32% has been reported with the use of ≥50 mg of IT meperidine, which is much lower than IT morphine. Meperidine is shown to be effective against shivering. While the mechanism of action is not fully understood, the anti-shivering effect of intravenous meperidine is due to its effect on the kappa opioid receptor and decreases the threshold of shivering [,–]. Possible suggested mechanisms for the anti-shivering effect of meperidine include k-opioid receptor activity, anticholinergic action, biogenic monoamine reuptake inhibition, NMDA receptor antagonism, or stimulation of alpha 2–adrenoceptors, and possibly modulating the heat loss caused by vasodilatation after spinal anesthesia [,–]. Meperidine slightly increases the threshold for sweating, significantly decreases the threshold for vasoconstriction, and reduces the threshold for shivering. We found that IT meperidine was associated with nausea and vomiting, which limits its clinical efficacy.

Limitations

The doses of IT fentanyl, sufentanil and meperidine differed among the studies, which is a limitation of this systematic review, although the meta-regression ruled out the effect of the varying doses on our primary outcome. Overall, this systematic review and meta-analysis provides the best summary of the effect of the IT lipophilic opioids on shivering after cesarean delivery.

### Nefopam and meperidine are infra-additive on the shivering threshold in humans [^98595c59]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Induction of therapeutic hypothermia is often complicated by shivering. Nefopam, a nonsedative benzoxazocine analgesic, reduces the shivering threshold (triggering core temperature) with minimal side effects. Consequently, nefopam is an attractive drug for inducing therapeutic hypothermia. However, nefopam alone is insufficient and thus needs to be combined with another drug. Meperidine also reduces the shivering threshold. We therefore determined whether the combination of nefopam and meperidine is additive, infra-additive, or synergistic on the shivering threshold.

Methods

Ten volunteers were each studied on 4 randomly assigned days. In random order, they were given the following treatments: (1) control, no drug; (2) nefopam to a target concentration of 0.1 μg/mL; (3) meperidine to a target concentration of 0.1 μg/mL; and (4) both nefopam and meperidine at target concentrations of 0.1 μg/mL each. Lactated Ringer's solution at 4°C was infused to decrease core temperature while mean skin temperature was kept near 30.5°C. The core temperature that increased oxygen consumption >25% defined the shivering threshold.

Results

Nefopam reduced the shivering thresholds by 0.7°C ± 0.3°C compared with no drug. Meperidine reduced the shivering thresholds by 0.4°C ± 0.3°C compared with no drug. When combined, the shivering threshold decreased by only 0.6°C ± 0.4°C, which was about half what would have been expected based on the individual effects of each drug (P < 0.001). The effect of combined nefopam and meperidine on the shivering threshold was thus infra-additive.

Conclusions

The combination of nefopam and meperidine should be avoided for induction of therapeutic hypothermia. Better options would be combinations of drugs that are at least additive or even synergistic.

### The safety of meperidine prescribing in older adults: a longitudinal population-based study [^ecb2722c]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Meperidine (pethidine) is an opioid analgesic that offers little advantage relative to other opioids and several disadvantages including limited potency, short duration of action, and the production of a neurotoxic metabolite (normeperidine) with a long half-life. Older adults are more sensitive to meperidine’s side effects and may have diminished renal function which leads to the accumulation of normeperidine. The Institute for Safe Medication Practices has suggested avoiding meperidine in older adults, limiting its dose (≤600 mg/day) and duration of use (≤48 h). The objective of this study was to determine the level of meperidine use in older adults and assess the dosage and duration of meperidine with reference to these safety recommendations.

Methods

A longitudinal study using administrative healthcare data was conducted to examine meperidine utilization and levels of high dose and extended duration prescribing among persons ≥65 years of age between April 1, 2001, and March 31, 2014 in Manitoba, Canada. The number of meperidine prescriptions, users, duration of treatment, defined daily doses (DDD) dispensed and number of prescribers were determined over the study period.

Results

In the Manitoba older adult population there was a marked decline in meperidine users and prescriptions from 2001 to 2014. There was an average use of 26.4 (95 % CI 24.0–28.8) DDDs of meperidine per user per year. While only 3.7 % of the prescriptions exceeded the 600 mg maximum daily dose, 96.7 % of prescriptions exceeded the recommended 2 days of therapy. For the remaining users of meperidine, the amount of meperidine used per person rose from 18.98 to 56.14 DDDs/user/year over the study period. The number of prescribers of meperidine declined throughout the study, but low DDD prescribers declined more quickly than high DDD prescribers.

Conclusions

While meperidine use has declined, the remaining use appears to be decreasing in safety, with more meperidine prescribed per user. This seems to be driven by the continued prescribing by a small number of high DDD prescribers. Targeted educational initiatives directed at this small group of prescribers may be helpful. Alternatively removing meperidine from medication insurance schemes may provide additional incentive to avoid meperidine in older adults.

### Effects of opioids administered via intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia after caesarean section: a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f02237d2]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Meperidine is a unique opioid with well-known local anaesthetic properties. It has been shown to block the voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, and therefore inhibits the generation of action potentials in spinal dorsal horn neurons.This unique characteristic, in addition to its agonistic effects on opioid receptors, may underlie the observation that PCEA meperidine elicits excellent pain relief. However, meperidine remains potentially harmful to infants. Meperidine carries a high risk of neonatal respiratory depression due to the long half-lives of 13 and 65 h for meperidine and its active metabolite normeperidine, respectively. In addition, normeperidine is known to lower seizure thresholds, especially in susceptible patients. The included studies of the present study that investigated the effects of meperidine either administered intravenously or epidurally were all published before 2000. In fact, The American Pain Society and Institute for Safe Medication Practices do not recommend the routine use of meperidine for acute pain management. Consequently, although the drug ranked highly in terms of analgesia, with relatively low odds of nausea/vomiting and sedation/drowsiness, we do not recommend the routine use of PCEA meperidine for post-caesarean section analgesia. Further research is warranted to investigate the efficacy and safety of PCEA meperidine.

### The anaesthetist, opioid analgesic drugs, and serotonin toxicity: a mechanistic and clinical review [^1be56b8e]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Most cases of serotonin toxicity are provoked by therapeutic doses of a combination of two or more serotonergic drugs, defined as drugs affecting the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Common serotonergic drugs include many antidepressants, antipsychotics, and opioid analgesics, particularly fentanyl, tramadol, meperidine (pethidine), and methadone, but rarely morphine and other related phenanthrenes. Symptoms of serotonin toxicity are attributable to an effect on monoaminergic transmission caused by an increased synaptic concentration of serotonin. The serotonin transporter (SERT) maintains low serotonin concentrations and is important for the reuptake of the neurotransmitter into the presynaptic nerve terminals. Some opioids inhibit the reuptake of serotonin by inhibiting SERT, thus increasing the plasma and synaptic cleft serotonin concentrations that activate the serotonin receptors. Opioids that are good inhibitors of SERT (tramadol, dextromethorphan, methadone, and meperidine) are most frequently associated with serotonin toxicity. Tramadol also has a direct serotonin-releasing action. Fentanyl produces an efflux of serotonin, and binds to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1A and 5-HT 2A receptors, whilst methadone, meperidine, and more weakly tapentadol, bind to 5-HT 2A but not 5-HT 1A receptors. The perioperative period is a time where opioids and other serotonergic drugs are frequently administered in rapid succession, sometimes to patients with other serotonergic drugs in their system. This makes the perioperative period a relatively risky time for serotonin toxicity to occur. The intraoperative recognition of serotonin toxicity is challenging as it can mimic other serious syndromes, such as malignant hyperthermia, sepsis, thyroid storm, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Anaesthetists must maintain a heightened awareness of its possible occurrence and a readiness to engage in early treatment to avoid poor outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of ondansetron in preventing postanesthesia shivering: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5c565fef]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Meperidine has a therapeutic effect on PAS, and its mechanism is likely to be associated with activation of κ receptor [-]. In our meta-analysis, we compared the effect of meperidine and ondansetron on the prevention of PAS, no significant superiority was found in ondansetron. While taking the adverse effects into consideration, accumulating studies show that meperidine could increase the incidence of nausea and vomiting and induce respiratory depression. Like ondansetron, meperidine at dose of 0.4 mg/kg for treatment of PAS rarely causes cardiovascular effects, which were also poorly confirmed by our combined estimate with small sample.

Many drugs aimed at the treatment and prophylactic of PAS have been found. Physostigmine inhibits PAS through cholinergic system, but it would also cause nausea and vomiting, increased heart rate and blood pressure. Tramadol, which could inhibit 5HT-uptake and increase its release, reduces PAS after general anesthesia. In contrast to ondansetron, it could depress the thresholds of sweating, vasoconstriction and shivering. Doxapram, used as a stimulant in respiratory failure, had been proven to be effective on PAS, but accompanied with distinct side effect on hemodynamics. From our analysis and the comparisons, ondansetron exhibited a high safety profile.

### The safety of meperidine prescribing in older adults: a longitudinal population-based study [^fb920c1c]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Safety warnings and increased clinical awareness of the problems with meperidine in older adults have resulted in dramatic declines in the prescribing of meperidine to those who are 65 year of age or older. However, the small amount of remaining use appears to be less safe with an increase in the DDDs per user per year. This appears to be primarily related to a small number of high DDD prescribers that have not responded to past safety warnings. Educational initiatives directed at the small group of prescribers may be helpful. Given that safer opioid alternatives exist for the vast majority of these patients, another approach may be to remove insurance coverage for meperidine for those over the age of 65. This may provide a further incentive to avoid meperidine in this sensitive population.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and codeine phosphate (prometh with codeine) [^a2056dd7]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Codeine: Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, exert their primary effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The analgesic effects of codeine are due to its central action; however, the precise sites of action have not been determined, and the mechanisms involved appear to be quite complex. Codeine resembles morphine both structurally and pharmacologically, but its actions at the doses of codeine used therapeutically are milder, with less sedation, respiratory depression and gastrointestinal, urinary, and pupillary effects. Codeine produces an increase in biliary tract pressure, but less than morphine or meperidine. Codeine is less constipating than morphine.

Codeine has good antitussive activity, although less than that of morphine at equal doses. It is used in preference to morphine, because side effects are infrequent at the usual antitussive dose of codeine.

Codeine in oral therapeutic dosage does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system.

Narcotic analgesics may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ); however, they also depress the vomiting center, so that subsequent doses are unlikely to produce vomiting. Nausea is minimal after usual oral doses of codeine.

Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection on parenteral administration. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus, and sweating.

### A comparison of tramadol, amitriptyline, and meperidine for postepidural anesthetic shivering in parturients [^9f81e1f5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Tramadol is effective for treating shivering during epidural anesthesia in parturients. In addition to its low affinity to opioid receptors, tramadol exerts a modulatory effect on central monoaminergic pathways. In this respect, there are parallels between the mechanisms of the action of tramadol and antidepressants such as amitriptyline. Meperidine is often recommended for the treatment of postanesthetic shivering. This prospective, double-blinded, and randomized clinical study was performed to compare the antishivering effects and accompanying side effects among tramadol, meperidine, and amitriptyline for the treatment of postepidural anesthetic shivering. Forty-five parturients who shivered during cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia and requested antishivering treatment were randomly allocated to one of three groups for IV treatment: Group T (n = 15) received tramadol 0.5 mg/kg, Group M (n = 15) received meperidine 0.5 mg/kg, and Group A (n = 15) received amitriptyline 15 or 20 mg. The response rate (shivering ceased after treatment in 15 min) was 87% and 93% for Groups T and M, respectively, compared with 13% in Group A (P < 0.01). The time that elapsed from treatment to the time shivering ceased was 5.1 +/- 3.6 min (mean +/- SD) for Group T and 4.2 +/- 2.3 min for Group M. There was a significantly more frequent incidence (33%) of somnolence in Group M when compared with Groups T (7%) and A (0%) (P < 0.01). However, no significant differences were shown for pruritus, nausea, vomiting, or Apgar scores of newborns. We concluded that both tramadol and meperidine show a significantly faster response rate in the treatment of postepidural anesthetic shivering when compared with amitriptyline in the dosage used; tramadol had a decreased incidence of somnolence when compared with meperidine.

Implications

This study was performed to compare the antishivering and side effects among tramadol, amitriptyline, and meperidine for the treatment of postepidural anesthetic shivering in parturients. Both tramadol and meperidine show a significantly faster response rate in the treatment of shivering when compared with amitriptyline. Tramadol had a less frequent incidence of somnolence than meperidine.

### Intravenous butorphanol, meperidine, and their combination relieve pain and distress in women in labor [^13f34b23]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic opioids are commonly administered during labor, but their efficacy has been recently questioned. In addition, laboratory and clinical studies provide a strong rationale for combining mu- and kappa-opioid receptor agonists for analgesia. The authors therefore studied, using validated intensity and affective scales and definitions of effective pain relief, the efficacy of intravenous meperidine, butorphanol, and their combination for labor analgesia.

Methods

Healthy women with singleton term pregnancy requesting analgesia during active labor were studied. Women were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg meperidine, 1 mg butorphanol, or 25 mg meperidine plus 0.5 mg butorphanol (n = 15/group). Pain intensity was assessed using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, and affective magnitude was assessed using a ratiometric descriptive scale before drug administration and between the sixth and seventh uterine contractions after drug administration.

Results

All three treatments reduced pain intensity equally. Butorphanol alone did not reduce pain affective magnitude, whereas the other treatments did. There was a significant correlation between reduction in pain intensity and affective magnitude in all groups, with greater reductions in affective magnitude than intensity. Overall, 29% of women exhibited clinically meaningful pain relief, with no difference among groups. Groups did not differ in incidence of opioid-induced adverse effects.

Conclusions

These doses of meperidine and butorphanol do reduce pain intensity and affective magnitude, although a minority of patients achieve meaningful pain relief as defined in multiple patient populations, including laboring women. Combination of these drugs did not improve their therapeutic benefit.

### Meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol) [^32f15bf1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.11 Severe Hypotension

DEMEROL Injection may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of DEMEROL Injection. In patients with circulatory shock, DEMEROL Injection may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of DEMEROL Injection in patients with circulatory shock.

5.12 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness

In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), DEMEROL Injection may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for worsening of signs of increasing intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with DEMEROL Injection.

Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of DEMEROL Injection in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.

5.13 Risks of Use in Patients with Gastrointestinal Conditions

DEMEROL Injection is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus.

The meperidine in DEMEROL Injection may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Opioids may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.

5.14 Increased Risk of Seizures in Patients with Seizure Disorders

The meperidine in DEMEROL Injection may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures occurring in other clinical settings associated with seizures. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control during DEMEROL Injection therapy. Prolonged meperidine use may increase the risk of toxicity (e.g., seizures) from the accumulation of the meperidine metabolite, normeperidine.

### Use of preoperative gabapentin significantly reduces postoperative opioid consumption: a meta-analysis [^248bb88c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Adequate postoperative pain management is a crucial component in surgical patient care. Effective postoperative pain management not only improves the patient’s level of comfort and satisfaction but also is associated with earlier mobilization, fewer cardiopulmonary complications, reduced risk of thromboembolism, earlier return of bowel function, faster recovery, and reduced hospital costs.Traditionally, opioid analgesics that act on mechanisms associated with pain perception have been used in managing postoperative pain. While opioid medications, including morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, and meperidine, are very effective analgesics, they are also associated with numerous adverse side effects that include somnolence, respiratory depression, cardiac instability including hypotension and bradycardia, and nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and constipation.

Multimodal pain management aims for additive or synergistic effects by utilizing analgesic medications of various classes that have differing pharmacologic mechanisms of actions in the nervous system.By combining multiple drugs from different classes, multimodal pain management regimens aim to provide adequate pain management, while reducing the amount of required postoperative opioid use and its associated adverse effects.

### Determinants of effective cooling during endovascular hypothermia [^ffd81e91]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising neuroprotective therapy with multiple mechanisms of action. We demonstrated the feasibility of thrombolysis combined with endovascular hypothermia, but not all patients achieved effective cooling. We sought to identify the factors that determined effective cooling.

Methods

In 26 patients who underwent endovascular hypothermia, we computed four measures of effective cooling: time to reach target; Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) 34 ratio; AUC-34; and AUC-35. By multivariate regression, we examined the effects of age, weight, starting temperature, body mass index, body surface area (BSA), gender, shivering, and total meperidine dose on the four outcome measures.

Results

In univariate analyses, all four outcome measures were significantly influenced by BSA (p < 0.01 in all univariate analyses). Time to reach target temperature was quicker in older patients (p < 0.01). Shivering and meperidine dose were highly intercorrelated (r = 0.6, p < 0.01) and both marginally influenced all four outcome measures. In multivariate analysis, AUC ratio and time to reach target temperature were significantly influenced by BSA (p < 0.01) and meperidine (p < 0.05); AUC-34 was influenced only by BSA (p < 0.01). The AUC-35 was influenced by BSA (p < 0.01), shivering, and total meperidine dose (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

The most important determinant of effective cooling during endovascular hypothermia is BSA; larger patients are more difficult to cool and maintain in therapeutic range. Older patients cool more quickly. Shivering was well controlled by the combination of meperidine, buspirone, and surface counter-warming and only minimally influenced cooling effectiveness. Future trials of therapeutic hypothermia may include added measures to cool larger patients more effectively.

### Current concepts of phenylpiperidine derivatives use in the treatment of acute and chronic pain [^23fe8dde]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Phenylpiperidines are a chemical class of drugs with a phenyl moiety directly attached to piperidine. These agents have an important role in many aspects of medicine including anesthesia and pain medicine. After the development of meperidine, fentanyl, which is a second generation synthetic phenylpiperidine series opioid, was synthesized and introduced into clinical anesthesia practice as fentanyl citrate in 1968. Fentanyl-mediated or modulated responses involve action at the mu-opioid receptor as an agonist at the dorsal horn inhibiting ascending pain pathways in the rostral ventral medulla, increasing pain threshold, and producing both analgesic and sedative effects. Clinicians should appreciate that since fentanyl is metabolized mainly via CYP3A4, potential adverse effects can occur with concomitant use of any drug which affects CYP3A4 activity. Discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers can also result in an increase in fentanyl plasma concentration. We describe the role of remifentanil, a short-acting, organ independent analgesic and sufentanil, including newer formulations of sufentanil currently being evaluated sublingually for pain management. We examine the routes of administration and clinical considerations, including the role of opioids such as fentanyl as a natural killer cell suppressive agent. Fentanyl and other opioids have been shown to potentiate propagation of infection or cancer. In recent years, fentanyl and other phenylpiperidine formulations have been developed and successfully marketed for chronic pain patients. Because all opioids have complex physiological responses and potential drug-drug interactions, the clinician should appreciate all aspects of this drug class and consider all available options in appropriate clinical settings. Key words: Fentanyl; Remifentanil, Sufentanil, opioids, analgesics, pain, perioperative, management.

### Obstetric analgesia: a comparison of patient-controlled meperidine, remifentanil, and fentanyl in labour [^c38f5f5d]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Background

To compare the analgesic efficacy of remifentanil with meperidine and fentanyl in a patient-controlled setting (patient-controlled analgesia, PCA).

Methods

Parturients (n=159) were randomly assigned to receive remifentanil (n=52), meperidine (n=53), or fentanyl (n=54). Pain scores and an observer sedation scores were assessed hourly. Fetal outcome was evaluated with Apgar score, cord blood gas analysis and the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Score.

Results

Pain scores decreased in all groups, the decrease varying from mild to moderate, average pain scores remaining above 4.5 cm in all groups. Remifentanil PCA was associated with the greatest decrease in pain scores, but the difference was significant only at 1 h. Pain scores returned towards baseline over time; 3 h after the initiation of treatment, pain scores no longer differed significantly from baseline values in any of the groups. Significantly more parturients receiving meperidine crossed over to epidural analgesia. Overall satisfaction scores were higher with remifentanil, but remifentanil produced more sedation and itching. More periods of desaturation (Sa(o(2)) <95%) were observed during administration of remifentanil and fentanyl. There were no significant differences in fetal outcome between the three groups.

Conclusions

The efficacy of meperidine, fentanyl, and remifentanil PCA for labour analgesia varied from mild to moderate. Remifentanil PCA provided better analgesia than meperidine and fentanyl PCA, but only during the first hour of treatment. In all groups, pain scores returned to pre-treatment values within 3 h after the initiation of treatment.

### Fentalogues [^8011d7ef]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Licit fentanyl was first synthesized in the 1950s via manipulation of another phenylpiperidine, meperidine, in an effort to develop a novel analgesic agent and laying the groundwork for pharmaceutical fentanyl and multiple analogues. Only a small percentage of those analogues are actually approved for medical use.The remainder are dangerously potent with high binding affinity to opioid receptors and rapid entry to the CNS. These characteristics make them particularly hazardous when added to other illicit substances such as heroin, unbeknownst to the end-user with potentially deadly consequences.

Illicit fentanyl has had a dramatically increasing impact on opioid overdose deaths in the US over the past decade. According to provisional data from the 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over half of the opioid-related overdose deaths in 2018 involved non-methadone synthetic opioids; the most common of which was illicitly manufactured fentanyl.Perhaps more telling are the annual data released by the New Hampshire Department of Justice, with the most recent of which indicating that less than 7% of 2019 opioid overdose deaths in the state were due to prescription opioids.These illicit opioids have affected the landscape of opioid abuse to the extent that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) chose to emergently schedule all fentanyl-related substances (FRS) to schedule I as of February 2018.

### The safety of meperidine prescribing in older adults: a longitudinal population-based study [^39c9d6f1]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 4 
Meperidine prescriptions and DDDs per user over time

Less than 5 % (37/743) of the prescribers were responsible for over 50 % of all meperidine prescriptions (4612 out of 9196 prescriptions). This high prescribing group (the top 5 % of prescribers) wrote an average of 125 prescriptions per prescriber in contrast to the remaining prescribers (i.e. the remaining 95 % of meperidine prescribers) who averaged just 6.5 prescriptions per prescriber.

The number of prescribers of meperidine declined dramatically from 247 prescribers to 96 prescribers by the end of the study (Fig. 5). The number of low DDD prescribers declined more, from 137 to 32 prescribers, than high DDD prescribers group which fell from 110 to 64 prescribers. As a result, the proportion of high DDD prescribers has risen steadily across the study period from 44.5 % in 2001/02 to 66.7 % in 2013/14.

### Codeine phosphate, promethazine hydrochloride, and phenylephrine hydrochloride (promethazine VC with codeine) [^e22e5c51]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Codeine:

Narcotic analgesics, including codeine, exert their primary effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. The analgesic effects of codeine are due to its central action; however, the precise sites of action have not been determined, and the mechanisms involved appear to be quite complex. Codeine resembles morphine both structurally and pharmacologically, but its actions at the doses of codeine used therapeutically are milder, with less sedation, respiratory depression and gastrointestinal, urinary and pupillary effects. Codeine produces an increase in biliary tract pressure, but less than morphine or meperidine. Codeine is less constipating than morphine.

Codeine has good antitussive activity, although less than that of morphine at equal doses. It is used in preference to morphine, because side effects are infrequent at the usual antitussive dose of codeine.

Codeine in oral therapeutic dosage does not usually exert major effects on the cardiovascular system. Narcotic analgesics may cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ); however, they also depress the vomiting center, so that subsequent doses are unlikely to produce vomiting. Nausea is minimal after usual oral doses of codeine.

Narcotic analgesics cause histamine release, which appears to be responsible for wheals or urticaria sometimes seen at the site of injection on parenteral administration. Histamine release may also produce dilation of cutaneous blood vessels, with resultant flushing of the face and neck, pruritus and sweating.

Codeine and its salts are well absorbed following both oral and parenteral administration. Codeine is about ⅔ as effective orally as parenterally. Codeine is metabolized primarily in the liver by enzymes of the endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes O-demethylation, N-demethylation and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid. The drug is excreted primarily in the urine, largely as inactive metabolites and small amounts of free and conjugated morphine. Negligible amounts of codeine and its metabolites are found in the feces.

Following oral or subcutaneous administration of codeine, the onset of analgesia occurs within 15 to 30 minutes and lasts for four to six hours.

The cough-depressing action, in animal studies, was observed to occur 15 minutes after oral administration of codeine, peak action at 45 to 60 minutes after ingestion. The duration of action, which is dose-dependent, usually did not exceed 3 hours.

### Acute kidney injury-associated delirium: a review of clinical and pathophysiological mechanisms [^14187bd5]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct neurotoxic effects of AKI from drug accumulation

Another common explanation for delirium in the setting of AKI is the accumulation of drugs that are frequently administered in the ICU setting. A common mechanistic theme for the deliriogenic drugs, such as benzodiazepines and certain antibiotics, is their ϒ-aminobutyric acid antagonistic properties.

Cefepime-induced neurotoxicity is a relatively commonly precipitant of delirium, imposing up to a tenfold greater risk of neurotoxicity when compared to meropenem, and occurring in up to 15% of ICU patients treated with cefepime. The setting of critical illness is believed to create an inflammatory environment that disrupts the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), thus allowing for the penetration of cefepime into the brain. Given that cefepime is renally cleared, AKI further exacerbates cefepime-induced neurotoxicity due to drug accumulation. If delirium due to cefepime-induced neurotoxicity is suspected, one should investigate for the presence of non-convulsive status epilepticus, which occurs in a quarter of such patients. Adjustment of cefepime dosing or avoidance of cefepime is recommended in AKI to prevent neurotoxicity manifesting as delirium.

Certain classes of drugs, such as opioids and neuropathic agents, confer various degrees of delirium, largely based on their anticholinergic properties. Meperidine, for instance, should be avoided in AKI because its metabolite, normeperidine, may accumulate and result in central nervous system excitation, induce life-threatening seizures, and exacerbate the phenotype of delirium. An expanded discussion on the risks of delirium from analgosedatives in the setting of AKI will be reviewed below.

### Meperidine hydrochloride [^07e1336c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Patient Access to an Opioid Overdose Reversal Agent for the Emergency Treatment of Opioid Overdose

Inform patients and caregivers about opioid overdose reversal agents (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene). Discuss the importance of having access to an opioid overdose reversal agent, especially if the patient has risk factors for overdose (e.g., concomitant use of CNS depressants, a history of opioid use disorder, or prior opioid overdose) or if there are household members (including children) or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. The presence of risk factors for overdose should not prevent the management of pain in any patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)].

Discuss the options for obtaining an opioid overdose reversal agent (e.g., prescription, over-the-counter, or as part of a community-based program).

There are important differences among the opioid overdose reversal agents, such as route of administration, product strength, approved patient age range, and pharmacokinetics. Be familiar with these differences, as outlined in the approved labeling for those products, prior to recommending or prescribing such an agent.

Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, and how to use an opioid overdose reversal agent for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Emphasize the importance of calling 911 or getting emergency medical help, even if an opioid overdose reversal agent is administered [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4), Overdosage (10)].

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute headache [^0fb1c461]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Parenteral ketorolac in acute migraine—8 trials were included, involving >321 patients (141 ketorolac), and the median quality scores were 3 (interquartile range 2 to 4); there were no baseline differences in 10-point pain scores (WMD 0.07; 95% CI −0.39 to 0.54). At 60 min, ketorolac and meperidine resulted in similar pain scores (WMD 0.31; 95% CI −0.68 to 1.29), ketorolac was more effective than intranasal sumatriptan (WMD −4.07; 95% CI −6.02 to −2.12), and there was no difference versus phenothiazine agents (WMD 0.82; 95% CI −1.33 to 2.98). Heterogeneity was high (I2 70%), and adverse effect profiles were similar between ketorolac and comparison groups.

### Morphine induces less nausea than meperidine when administered parenterally [^4cf7c205]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The objective of our study is to identify and compare the prevalence of nausea after parenteral administration of opioids in the Emergency Department (ED). This prospective study utilized a convenience sample at a community-based ED with a volume of 60,000 annual visits. Patients who were in acute pain or had an exacerbation of chronic pain requiring treatment with an opioid analgesic agent were eligible. Demographic and historical features were recorded on a standardized closed data collection form. The main study endpoint was the occurrence of nausea. The prevalence of nausea and vomiting was compared between morphine and meperidine. There were 37 patients in the morphine group and 156 in the meperidine group. The two groups were similar with respect to mean age, gender, and weight. The reported nausea was 0 of 37 in the morphine group and 20 of 156 (12.8%) in the meperidine group. This difference between morphine and meperidine groups of 12.8% (95% confidence intervals 2-24%) was statistically significant. In our patient population, morphine caused significantly less nausea then meperidine when it was used as an analgesic in the ED.

### Fentanyl citrate [^9ebefe89]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effects on the Endocrine System

Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and lutenizing hormone (LH) in humans [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . They also stimulate prolactin, growth hormone (GH) secretion, and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon.

Use of opioids for an extended period of time may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [see Adverse Reactions (6)] .

Effects on the Immune System

Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. Overall, the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive.

Concentration – Efficacy Relationships

A dose of 100 mcg of Fentanyl Citrate Injection is approximately equivalent in analgesic activity to 10 mg of morphine or 75 mg of meperidine.

The minimum effective analgesic concentration will vary widely among patients, especially among patients who have been previously treated with opioid agonists. The minimum effective analgesic concentration of fentanyl for any individual patient may increase over time due to an increase in pain, the development of a new pain syndrome and/or the development of analgesic tolerance [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] .
