## Question

CT scan shows obstructed R maxillary ostium, L frontonasal duct and mucosal thickening of maxillary sinus, ethmoid air cells and frontal sinus. Should this patient get sinus surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient with CT evidence of right maxillary ostium obstruction, left frontonasal duct obstruction, and mucosal thickening in the maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses should undergo sinus surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical picture meets diagnostic criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis and whether symptoms have persisted despite appropriate medical therapy. Then, I should verify that objective inflammation is present on endoscopy or CT and that the CT is adequate for surgical planning. Next, I will assess disease severity, phenotype, and anatomic risk features that might push toward earlier surgery. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks of surgery versus continued medical therapy. Finally, I will outline the surgical plan, perioperative counseling, and postoperative follow-up, ensuring I do not overextend surgery to sinuses without radiologic disease and that I align the extent of surgery with the patient's overall disease burden and goals [^117CQ5dc] [^1163E3Yd].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Chronic rhinosinusitis requires at least 12 weeks of two or more cardinal symptoms (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, or smell loss) plus objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation on endoscopy or CT, and I should not jump to surgery without documenting this objectively because CT abnormalities alone are not sufficient to diagnose CRS or to mandate surgery [^111miwXY] [^115hVHRc] [^1142S7cH].

> Wait, let me verify the objective evidence here. The CT shows mucosal thickening and outflow obstruction in multiple sinuses, which constitutes objective inflammation, but I should confirm that symptoms are present and persistent; if the patient is asymptomatic, I should reconsider the diagnosis and avoid surgery driven by imaging alone, since asymptomatic individuals can have CT abnormalities and surgery should not be based on arbitrary radiologic thresholds like a minimum mucosal thickness or degree of opacification [^115U67mc] [^1119C1QY] [^1163E3Yd].

> Next, I should review whether appropriate medical therapy has been tried and failed. Standard initial therapy includes intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigations, and, when indicated, culture-directed antibiotics; if disease is refractory after a reasonable trial, surgical consideration is appropriate, and I need to ensure we are not prematurely escalating without optimizing medical management first [^1178tGrc] [^113K3r3m].

> I will now examine disease severity and phenotype. The CT demonstrates multi-sinus involvement with ostial obstruction, which suggests moderate-to-severe disease and raises concern for mucostasis and recurrent infections; I should also check for polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease, because these features favor earlier surgical intervention with full exposure and tissue removal rather than limited dilation alone [^117CQ5dc] [^111T3eEX] [^117S2isK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which sinuses to operate on. I should confirm that the extent of surgery is tailored to the patient's overall disease, not to arbitrary CT cutoffs; there are carefully selected scenarios where a sinus without overt radiologic disease may be addressed if it is interposed between diseased sinuses or if not addressing it risks compromising outcomes, but I must avoid indiscriminate surgery on normal-appearing sinuses and document the rationale if I include them [^11774cUw] [^1163E3Yd] [^1119C1QY].

> Let me consider anatomic risk and complications. Obstructed outflow tracts can predispose to mucocele formation, pneumoceles, and even bony erosion in select cases; I should double-check for any bony changes or expansile lesions on CT and plan a disease-directed approach that addresses the obstructed drainage pathways, particularly the right maxillary ostium and left frontonasal duct, to restore ventilation and drainage [^116wkVQC] [^115vDL5a] [^114y5Yhv].

> I should confirm the quality of imaging before committing to surgery. If the existing CT is not a fine-cut sinus protocol, I need to obtain a non-contrast maxillofacial CT with ≤ 1 mm slices and multiplanar reconstructions for surgical planning; surgeons should review images themselves to identify variants and plan safe, efficient dissection, and this step is explicitly recommended for surgical candidates [^113Yc5AY] [^116V6W3P] [^1147Buh7].

> Now, I need to weigh benefits versus risks. Potential benefits of endoscopic sinus surgery include improved symptom control, reduced infection frequency, enhanced topical medication delivery, and prevention of complications in appropriately selected patients; risks include bleeding, infection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, orbital injury, and the possibility of revision surgery, so I should ensure the patient understands these trade-offs and that the anticipated benefits exceed those of continued medical therapy alone [^117CQ5dc] [^115zWnDS] [^113K3r3m].

> Let me outline the surgical plan. For multi-sinus CRS with ostial obstruction, functional endoscopic sinus surgery with targeted maxillary antrostomy, anterior and posterior ethmoidectomy, and frontal sinusotomy to restore outflow is appropriate; if polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease are present, I should perform full exposure and removal of diseased tissue rather than relying on balloon dilation alone, reserving balloon techniques as adjuncts in select limited disease scenarios [^117CQ5dc] [^111T3eEX] [^115hVHRc].

> I should double-check perioperative counseling. The patient needs to understand postoperative pain control, debridement schedules, topical steroid irrigations, activity restrictions, and the need for ongoing medical management to maintain sinus patency; I should also set expectations for follow-up visits and the possibility of revision surgery, and I must document that these discussions occurred [^117CQ5dc] [^114y5Yhv].

> Next, I should review postoperative follow-up. Outcomes should be assessed at 3 to 12 months with symptom inventories such as SNOT-22 and nasal endoscopy to evaluate mucosal healing, patency of surgically created openings, and control of disease; this helps detect early stenosis or recurrence and guides adjustments in medical therapy [^117CQ5dc] [^115moNjG].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic or symptoms are mild and intermittent? In that case, I should reconsider surgery and favor continued medical therapy, because CT abnormalities without compatible symptoms do not establish CRS and surgery should not be based solely on imaging thresholds; shared decision-making is essential to align the plan with the patient's symptom burden and preferences [^115U67mc] [^1119C1QY] [^1163E3Yd].

> Final synthesis: Yes, if the patient has persistent CRS symptoms for at least 12 weeks, objective inflammation is documented on endoscopy or CT, and symptoms persist despite appropriate medical therapy, then sinus surgery is indicated; the CT findings of multi-sinus mucosal thickening with right maxillary ostium and left frontonasal duct obstruction support a disease-directed FESS plan to restore drainage, provided the CT is adequate and the patient understands perioperative expectations and long-term medical management needs [^111miwXY] [^117CQ5dc] [^113Yc5AY].

---

Not necessarily. Surgery is **not indicated** based on CT findings alone [^115hVHRc]; it is reserved for patients with **persistent symptoms** despite optimized medical therapy [^113K3r3m] or with **complications** such as mucocele, orbital or intracranial extension, or fungal disease [^113K3r3m] [^117FMUXq]. The CT shows mucosal thickening and ostial obstruction, but these can be seen in asymptomatic patients [^115U67mc] and do not, by themselves, mandate surgery [^1122Wcyv]. Management should be guided by symptoms, endoscopy, and response to medical therapy; if surgery is considered, obtain a fine-cut CT for planning [^113Yc5AY] and tailor the extent to disease, not arbitrary CT thresholds [^1163E3Yd].

---

## Clinical significance of CT findings

CT findings of mucosal thickening and ostial obstruction are common in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) [^115U67mc] but are **not specific**; they may also occur in asymptomatic individuals [^115U67mc]. Therefore, CT alone **cannot determine the need for surgery** [^1122Wcyv].

## Indications for sinus surgery

According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) guidelines, sinus surgery is indicated only when the following criteria are met:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Chronic symptoms (≥ 12 weeks) [^111miwXY] including nasal obstruction, facial pain/pressure, nasal discharge, or anosmia despite optimized medical therapy [^113K3r3m].

- **Objective evidence**: Endoscopic or CT evidence of mucosal disease [^115hVHRc] correlating with symptoms [^1142S7cH].

- **Failure of medical therapy**: Inadequate response to appropriate medical management, including intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation, and antibiotics if indicated [^113K3r3m].

- **Complications**: Presence of complications such as mucocele, orbital or intracranial extension, or fungal disease [^113K3r3m] [^117FMUXq].

---

## Role of medical management

Medical therapy is the **first-line treatment** for CRS and should be optimized before considering surgery [^113K3r3m]. This includes:

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation and improve symptoms [^113oH42v].

- **Saline irrigation**: Improves mucociliary clearance and reduces symptom burden [^notfound].

- **Antibiotics**: Indicated only if there is evidence of bacterial infection or acute exacerbation [^114y5Yhv].

- **Allergy management**: Identify and treat allergic triggers [^116xoKv1].

---

## Risks and benefits of sinus surgery

Sinus surgery, specifically functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), can improve symptoms, quality of life, and sinus drainage [^1177oVdx]. However, it carries risks, including bleeding, infection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and recurrence of disease. Therefore, surgery should be **individualized** based on symptom severity, disease extent, and response to medical therapy [^1163E3Yd].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Based on the CT findings alone, **surgery is not indicated** [^1122Wcyv]. Management should be guided by clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and response to medical therapy. If symptoms persist despite optimized medical management, or if complications are present, then sinus surgery may be considered [^113K3r3m]. A fine-cut CT scan should be obtained for surgical planning if surgery is pursued [^113Yc5AY].

Table 7 — evaluation criteria for ESS without radiologic evidence of disease in a sinus — outlines selected scenarios in patients with guideline-established CRS undergoing ESS. In such patients, there may be very carefully selected patient-specific scenarios when ESS could include a sinus that does not have any radiologic evidence of mucosal thickening. Reasons include when the sinus is interposed between radiologically diseased sinuses and not addressing it could compromise ESS, when the patient's CRS puts them at high risk for recurrence and revision ESS due to postoperative osteitic changes, when the radiologically diffuse nature suggests a sinus without radiologic evidence is likely to have active CRS, and when ESS on adjacent sinuses may risk postoperative function of the nondiseased sinus. The table additionally states that these concepts and this key action statement do not condone surgery on patients with normal sinus computed tomography scans.

A woman in her late 70s with chronic bilateral epiphora under ophthalmology review was referred to our department for dacryocystorhinostomy after punctoplasty and detection of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. A CT scan of the paranasal sinuses for preoperative planning revealed complete opacification of the right maxillary, anterior ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid sinuses, left septal deviation and an incidental finding of foreign bodies in the right anterior nasal airspace. She proceeded with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and removal of foreign bodies. To our surprise, a partially eroded 20 pence and 1 penny coin were found and removed from her right nasal airway. There was no history given about foreign bodies in her nose. Her symptoms improved postoperatively.

### Clinical consensus statement: balloon dilation of the sinuses [^1122Wcyv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Balloon dilation patient selection — consensus requires objective CT-based inflammation and pre-procedure imaging: There was consensus that objective evidence of inflammation on CT imaging was necessary in addition to sinonasal symptoms for a patient to be deemed appropriate to undergo a SOD procedure, and the panel reached consensus that CT scanning of the sinuses is a requirement before SOD can be performed. SOD was considered inappropriate for patients with CT scans showing no evidence of sinus mucosal inflammation and/or ostial occlusion, despite the presence of sinonasal symptoms. However, evidence of inflammation or other findings on a CT scan was not deemed sufficient alone to make a patient a candidate for balloon dilation, and both symptoms and objective evidence of sinonasal disease are needed; a CT scan is necessary before proceeding with surgical management.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117CQ5dc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Key action statements for adult chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — Offer sinus surgery to an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis when the anticipated benefits exceed that of nonsurgical management alone, there is clarity regarding the anticipated outcomes, and the patient understands the expectation for long-term disease management following surgery (KAS 6). For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning (KAS 7). The surgeon should not plan the extent of sinus surgery solely based on arbitrary criteria regarding a minimal level of mucosal thickening, sinus opacification, or outflow obstruction on a CT scan (KAS 8). The surgeon or their designee should educate an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery regarding anticipated postoperative care, specifically pain control, debridement, medical management, activity restrictions, return to work, duration and frequency of follow-up visits, and the potential for recurrent disease or revision surgery (KAS 9). When the sinus involves polyps, osteitis, bony erosion, or fungal disease in an adult with chronic rhinosinusitis who is scheduled for sinus surgery, the surgeon should perform sinus surgery that includes full exposure of the sinus cavity (lumen) and removal of diseased tissue, not just balloon or manual ostial dilation, or refer the patient to a surgeon who can perform this extent of surgery (KAS 10). The surgeon or their designee should routinely follow up to assess and document outcomes of sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis, between 3 and 12 months after the procedure, through history (symptom relief, quality of life, complications, adherence to therapy, need for rescue medications, and ongoing care) and nasal endoscopy (KAS 11).

### Clinical consensus statement: balloon dilation of the sinuses [^116uWFai]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Balloon dilation of the sinuses — patient criteria consensus — states that balloon dilation is not appropriate for patients who are without both sinonasal symptoms and positive findings on computed tomography (CT), is not appropriate for patients with sinonasal symptoms and a CT that does not show evidence of sinonasal disease, and that CT scanning of the sinuses is a requirement before balloon dilation can be performed; it is also not appropriate for the management of headache or sleep apnea in patients who do not otherwise meet the criteria for chronic sinusitis or recurrent acute sinusitis, while balloon dilation can be appropriate as an adjunct procedure to functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps, there can be a role in patients with persistent sinus disease who have had previous sinus surgery, and there is a role in managing recurrent acute sinusitis as defined in the AAO-HNSF guideline based on symptoms and CT evidence of ostial occlusion and mucosal thickening; in this subcategory, a total of 8 statements reached consensus, while 12 did not achieve consensus, with representative mean agreement scores including 9.00 for the absence of both symptoms and positive CT, 8.77 for headache and 8.77 for sleep apnea, and 8.46 for the CT requirement.

### Frontal sinus pneumocele caused by a maxillary sinus mucocele [^116wkVQC]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A sinus pneumocele is a rare entity caused by obstruction of a paranasal sinus ostium. It is characterised by dilation and expansion of the sinus, with subsequent bony erosion. The most probable mechanism is air trapping in the paranasal sinus, via a one-way valve mechanism. The case presented concerns a 68-year-old Caucasian man, with recurrent episodes of acute rhinosinusitis. Clinical examination and subsequent imaging of the face, revealed a large pneumocele of the right frontal sinus that significantly eroded the posterior sinus wall. A large mucocele of the right maxillary sinus was also noted, extending to the middle meatus, causing full obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex. Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed, the mucocele was removed and the pneumatisation pathway of the frontal sinus was restored. The patient reports full resolution of symptoms and shows no evidence of recurrence, 6months postoperatively.

### Failed endoscopic sinus surgery: spectrum of CT findings in the frontal recess [^111QxsHE]. Radiographics (2009). Low credibility.

Since its introduction over 2 decades ago, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) has revolutionized the surgical management of chronic sinusitis. Performed over 200,000 times annually in the United States to treat medically refractory sinusitis, FESS has success rates as high as 98%. When surgical failure occurs, it is typically due to postoperative scarring or unaddressed outflow tract obstruction in the region of the frontal recess. The most common causes of surgical failure in the frontal recess include remnant frontal recess cells, a retained uncinate process, middle turbinate lateralization, osteoneogenesis, scarring or inflammatory mucosal thickening, and recurrent polyposis. Computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses has become indispensable in evaluation of patients with FESS failure, particularly in the frontal recess, a location that can be difficult to visualize at endoscopy. Familiarity with the complex anatomy of the frontal recess and knowledge of the most common causes of surgical failure are essential for proper interpretation of sinus CT images obtained in patients being considered for revision FESS of the frontal sinus.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114y5Yhv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults — begin with "Adult patient with suspected CRS", then "Verify that signs/symptoms meet CPG diagnostic criteria", "Assess candidacy for ESS", "Assess additional disease characteristics of CRS", and "Assign appropriate individualized medical therapy". For infection assessment, ask "Does patient have evidence of purulence?"; if yes, "May prescribe antibiotics", and if no, "Do not prescribe antibiotics". Education and imaging planning include "Educate patient about realistic long-term expectations", determine "Has patient had a recent adequate sinus CT scan?" — if yes, "Avoid arbitrary guidelines for mucosal thickening", and provide "Educate patient about postoperative care expectations". Surgical approach should "Tailor extent of surgery to patient's disease, not solely mucosal thickening measurements", and disease-directed steps use "Does the patient have polyps, fungus, osteitis, erosion?" — if yes, "Perform wide exposure ± tissue removal", and if no, "Perform surgery as required of disease state". Postoperative evaluation states "Assess outcomes at 3–12 months postop", followed by "Continue follow up and care as needed".

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115U67mc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Radiologic mucosal thickening in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — prevalence and overlap with controls — shows that asymptomatic individuals can demonstrate measurable burden, limiting sinus-by-sinus decision-making for endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). An SR reported a mean Lund-Mackay score between 1.8 and 2.24 with ≥ 2 mm maxillary thickening present in 17.7%, and a half millimeter of thickening may occur from nose blowing. Although CRS patients have greater mucosal thickness than controls, there is considerable overlap, and one study found 94% of symptomatic CRS patients had ≥ 2 mm maxillary thickening versus 29% of asymptomatic controls; these data are largely from the maxillary sinuses, where thickening is typically more pronounced than in other sinuses, and did not investigate ESS outcomes on a sinus-by-sinus basis. Finally, the inflammatory rather than postobstructive nature of most CRS subtypes calls into question using outflow obstruction criteria to determine ESS on a sinus-by-sinus basis.

### A brief clinical study: consecutive occurences of frontal sinus pneumocele [^115UYYAZ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Sinus pneumocele is a rare condition marked by pathologic expansion of a paranasal sinus with concomitant bone loss. Here, we describe the case of a 24-year-old male who first presented with a 2×3 cm bony projection of his right medial forehead. Exam and history were notably absent for any skin tethering, prior trauma, inflammation, or neurological symptoms. A computed tomography scan confirmed the prominence was secondary to an enlarged right frontal sinus. The pneumocele was successfully corrected through surgery, but the patient notably developed a similar presentation on the left frontal sinus nearly 1 year later. Clinical findings support a hypothesis of air trapping through mucosal thickening. This second pneumocele was managed similarly.

Chronic rhinosinusitis — Statement 7: Imaging in candidates for sinus surgery. For an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116V6W3P]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 7 — imaging in candidates for sinus surgery specifies that for an adult who is a candidate for sinus surgery, the surgeon or their designee should obtain a CT scan with a fine-cut protocol, if not already available, to examine the paranasal sinuses for surgical planning. Evidence strength: Recommendation based on limited and mostly observational reports, surgeon preference, and availability of imaging with a majority of evidence of moderate quality and moderate correlation with surgical outcomes, and the level of confidence in the evidence is high. Benefits include delineating sinonasal anatomy as part of surgical planning, identifying anatomical variants, ensuring that a proper CT is obtained that fully evaluates the paranasal sinuses to provide adequate information for the surgeon and avoid the need to repeat CT scans, and delineation of the extent of disease and/or coexistent pathology; risks, harms, and costs are additional radiation from a CT and cost of scans, with a benefits-harm assessment noting a preponderance of benefit and a trade-off between slice thickness and radiation exposure. Value judgments note that CT imaging provides an anatomic roadmap for safe surgery; not all CT scans have the requisite resolution for optimal surgery and some may provide inferior information if not obtained with a specific paranasal sinus protocol; image guidance is not mandatory. Intentional vagueness states the specifics of "fine cuts" are not specified, but the general consensus of the GDG is that 1–mm cuts or finer are ideal. Exceptions include revision surgery, for which a current CT scan is required regardless of time frame, and patients who would not pursue sinus surgery. Supporting text states that CT remains the gold standard for planning all types of sinus surgery.

### Clinical consensus statement: balloon dilation of the sinuses [^112UTMJ1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Clinical consensus statement — sinus ostial dilation (SOD) of the paranasal sinuses is addressed through an expert panel process targeting adults 18 years or older with chronic or recurrent rhinosinusitis (with or without nasal polyps, with or without prior sinus surgery) for whom SOD is being recommended, defined as endoscopic use of a balloon device to enlarge or open the outflow tracts of the maxillary, frontal, or sphenoid sinuses, as a standalone procedure or with endoscopic surgery. A modified Delphi method was used, and after 3 iterative Delphi method surveys, 13 statements met the standardized definition of consensus while 45 statements did not, grouped into 3 categories for presentation and discussion: patient criteria, perioperative considerations, and outcomes. Strong consensus was obtained for not performing SOD in patients without sinonasal symptoms or positive findings on computed tomography (CT) and in patients with symptoms only of headache or sleep apnea without criteria for sinusitis; strong consensus was also met that CT scan of the sinuses was necessary before performing SOD and that surgeons need to understand and abide by regulations set forth by the US Food and Drug Administration if they choose to reuse/reprocess devices. The panel further stated that the use of SOD was inappropriate in the absence of underlying sinusitis and that when patients meet the definition of chronic sinusitis as confirmed by CT scan, SOD of the sinuses can be indicated and/or effective in certain scenarios.

### Maxillary sinusitis resulting from ostium plugging by dislodged bone graft: case report [^115rX9c4]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report an unusual case of severe maxillary sinusitis resulting from ostial plugging by dislodged bone graft material used for sinus elevation procedure.

Patients and Methods

A 49-year-old female presented to the oral surgery clinic with severe right maxillary sinusitis after a sinus elevation procedure and placement of a dental implant. She had completed an extended course of multiple antibiotics without culture and sensitivity studies or resolution of sinusitis.

Results

A CT scan was obtained which showed a dental implant protruding into the right maxillary sinus, sinusitis of the right ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, and dislodged bone graft material obstructing the ostium into the middle nasal meatus. The dental implant was removed, the patient was referred for functional endoscopic sinus surgery, and her sinusitis subsequently rapidly resolved.

Conclusions

Surgeons performing this or similar procedures should be aware of the possible complications that can arise from foreign debris introduced into the maxillary sinuses. Also, the avoidance of empirically changing antibiotic regimens and the early use of CT scans should be considered.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1147Buh7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) surgical planning — computed tomography (CT) imaging provides functional and practical information for surgery, whereas plain films provide little or no definitive information; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone has limitations but can complement CT when soft-tissue assessment is needed. The American College of Radiology (ACR) endorses a maxillofacial CT without contrast as typically appropriate for surgical candidates, and nearly all members of the GDG endorsed a fine-cut protocol with cuts ideally at 1 mm or finer, with radiologist input on parameters such as image acquisition at 1 mm cuts with 50% slice overlap. Surgeons review their patients' images themselves in advance, and CT interpretation assesses mucosal thickening and anatomic abnormalities; although the degree of mucosal thickening may not always correlate with symptoms or directly influence decisions, it provides useful information about disease severity and extent that guides the overall surgical approach.

### A case of Pott's puffy tumor associated with barosinusitis from scuba diving [^113SC9Kc]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

During this illness, the patient did not experience fevers, chills, diaphoresis, upper respiratory symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or rash. He had no history of headaches, migraines, allergic rhinitis, or sinusitis prior to this acute illness. He also had no history of prior otorhinolaryngology procedures, recurrent otitis media, or snoring during sleep.

Upon admission, pertinent findings on physical examination include normal vital signs, significant swelling of his forehead (left greater than right), marked bilateral periorbital edema, and nonpainful extraocular movements. Notable laboratory findings include a leukocyte count of 12.0 × 10⁹/L with 77% neutrophils and a C-reactive protein of 74 mg/L. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head with and without contrast was obtained on day of admission and revealed a heterogeneous T2 hyperintense, peripherally enhancing opacification of bilateral frontal sinuses extending to left anterior ethmoid air cells; a 2.0 × 0.3-cm subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone; and dural enhancement, likely reactive, without brain parenchymal involvement (Fig. 1). The patient's clinical and radiological findings were consistent with PPT. Computed tomography scan without contrast of brain and sinuses demonstrated severe frontal sinus opacification (left greater than right), anterior ethmoid opacification, mucosal obstruction of the left ostiomeatal complex, mucosal thickening, and retention cysts throughout the sinuses. Of note, there was no evidence of intracranial involvement (Fig. 2).

### Endoscopic surgery for frontal sinusitis – a graduated approach [^1177oVdx]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Contemporary surgical treatment of patients with frontal sinusitis is based on a graduated approach determined by the patient's history and the extent of disease present. Most patients with inflammatory disease of the frontal sinus respond well to an anterior ethmoidectomy and clearing of agger nasi cells encroaching upon the frontal recess. In more advanced cases, a frontal sinusotomy with enlargement of the ostium may be performed to facilitate frontal sinus drainage and ventilation. For patients in whom conventional endoscopic techniques have not been successful, the floor of the frontal sinus is removed with a drill, usually with the assistance of image-guidance technology. Frontal sinus obliteration is reserved for patients with advanced disease for whom endoscopic management has been unsuccessful. Although patients with refractory frontal sinusitis can present a therapeutic challenge, proper surgical management usually results in successful control of symptoms and overall improvement in quality of life.

### Evaluation and decision making in frontal sinus surgery [^115KoYRr]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Management of frontal sinusitis can be challenging for even the most experienced otolaryngologists. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the frontal sinus is essential to properly manage disease affecting the frontal sinus. Being able to distinguish acute viral from acute bacterial and acute from chronic sinusitis is crucial because these distinctions guide appropriate management. Nasal endoscopy can confirm diagnosis, and radiologic imaging, including computed tomography and MRI, is often a necessary adjunct that aids in determining appropriate therapeutic decisions. One must be aware of the many procedures used in the surgical treatment of frontal sinusitis.

### Combined aplasia of sphenoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses accompanied by ethmoid sinus hypoplasia [^112cCbtt]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the case of a woman who had combined aplasia of sphenoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses accompanied by ethmoid sinus hypoplasia.

Methods and Results

A 47-year-old woman presented with complaints of headache, nasal obstruction, and postnasal drainage. She had no previous history of either facial trauma or systemic diseases affecting the skeletal system. She had a history of functional endoscopic sinus surgery twice in an other institution. However, the surgeries did not significantly alter her symptoms. Coronal and axial computed tomographic scans of the nose and the paranasal sinuses showed poorly developed frontal, sphenoid sinuses, ethmoid cells, and very severe and profound hypoplasia (aplasia) of bilateral maxillary sinuses.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this patient seems to be the first case having combined aplasias of the sphenoid, frontal, and maxillary sinuses with hypoplastic ethmoid cells without any systemic or skeletal disease.

Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) — algorithm highlights: Chronic rhinosinusitis consists of signs and symptoms compatible with rhinosinusitis persisting at least 12 weeks, and evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan to clarify the extent of disease and specific location or locations of obstruction. The CT scan ideally should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management; and consider evaluation by otolaryngologist.

3 Results

A total of 74 patients met inclusion criteria. Patient demographics are available in Table 1. The study period overlapped with the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and, as such, many post‐operative visits occurred virtually. In the instance of any symptoms, the patients were scheduled for an in‐office visit for endoscopic evaluation. Any virtual visits were discarded, and only in‐office visits were included. Endoscopic visits were unavailable at 12 months for eight patients; however, all eight had a documented endoscopy at their five‐month follow‐up.

TABLE 1
Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

3.1 Frontal Sinus Ostium Patency

The one‐year patency rates were 95.45% (63/66) for the left and 96.97%.

(64/66) for the right frontal sinuses at the final follow‐up (Table 2). Within a small subset of patients (n = 3), stenosed frontal sinuses were identified on endoscopy, encompassing bilateral stenosis in two patients and unilateral stenosis of the left side in one patient. One patient developed narrowing at 2 weeks and then complete stenosis at 9 months. The other two patients developed complete stenosis at 12 months. Surgical intervention for the two patients with bilateral stenosis was scheduled at 9 and 12 months, respectively, whereas the third patient with unilateral left‐sided stenosis did not require surgical intervention because of mild post‐operative symptoms. A third symptomatic patient underwent surgical re‐intervention at 11 months for frontoethmoidal recess obstruction evident on imaging despite apparent endoscopic patency. All patients with symptoms inconsistent with findings on endoscopy were sent for CT imaging, and no other such cases were identified.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1163E3Yd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) extent determination should not be determined by an indiscriminate criterion of a minimal mucosal thickness or degree of opacification applied to each sinus, and rather than an image that captures a patient at a single point in time, the extent of sinus surgery should be based on the patient as a whole: their symptoms, endoscopic and radiologic findings, expectations, need for postoperative topical drug delivery, and progression of rhinosinusitis; conversely, this KAS does not in any way suggest that surgeons routinely operate on sinuses without radiologic evidence of disease. Aggregate evidence quality is stated as B with a benefit-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit, with benefits including ensuring appropriate extent of surgery, improved outcomes, optimized postoperative medical management and drug delivery, and minimizing the need for revision surgery, while risks include misinterpretation leading to indiscriminate surgery on unaffected sinuses and added risk of adverse events from additional sinuses operated on. Value judgments emphasize that patients can benefit from surgery on selected sinuses based on the overall disease and to avoid surgical planning based on nonvalidated radiological criteria, with intentional vagueness to avoid setting a firm standard or criterion for mucosal thickening and to interpret the degree of thickening based on clinical relevance; patient preferences have a role through shared decision-making. The supporting text notes that there were no scientific results found to support indiscriminate minimum mucosal thickness or degree of sinus opacification criteria for deciding which single sinuses to operate on in medically recalcitrant CRS and that consensus documents by international rhinology societies do not advocate for choosing sinuses based on fixed radiologic thresholds.

### Case studies in the surgical management of nasal airway obstruction [^1138F6qp]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Nasal obstruction is one of the most common complaints evaluated by the otolaryngologist. The differential diagnosis is broad, ranging from benign reversible causes to life-threatening diseases. In addition, patients may suffer from a combination of etiologies, further confusing the diagnosis. Surgical management is directed at the underlying origin of obstruction. The clinician therefore must use a careful history and physical examination as well as appropriate sinonasal imaging in accurately identifying the causes of nasal obstruction. To further illustrate these principles, we present two interesting cases of patients presenting with nasal obstruction.

Representative Case Report

A 33-year-old male with a history of blunt-force trauma to the right orbit, resulting in fractures of the lateral orbital wall, anterolateral maxilla, and nasal septal deviation, developed progressive chronic dacryocystitis over one year. CT-DCG-MPR imaging revealed:(1) lateral displacement of the contrast-filled lacrimal sac (Figure 1A, red arrow), and (2) a clearly identifiable nasolacrimal duct fracture across all reconstructed planes (Figure 1A–C). Endo-DCR confirmed an 8-mm displaced fracture of the maxillary frontal process and abnormal lacrimal sac positioning, with intraoperative findings fully consistent with preoperative imaging. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited patent lacrimal irrigation and complete resolution of epiphora (VAS score improved from 9 to 1). At 12-month follow-up, postoperative endoscopic evidence demonstrated complete mucosal epithelialization of a 3.5-mm diameter ostium.

### Clinically relevant frontal sinus anatomy and physiology [^114acYgW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Management of frontal sinus disease has evolved considerably with the advent of endoscopic paranasal sinus instrumentation. With this evolution has come the increased demand for anatomic competence among otolaryngologists. Armed with a better understanding of the complex frontal sinus and anterior ethmoid complex anatomy, the otolaryngologist can target the anatomic abnormalities that predispose an individual to frontal sinus disease and limit the effectiveness of medical and surgical management.

Fig. 3
Uncinate process collapse. CBCT reformations on the coronal (a) and sagittal (b) plane. The right uncinate process (arrows) lies in contact with the inferomedial orbital wall. The maxillary sinus and ethmoid infundibulum are opacified by inflamed mucosa and shrinkage of the lumen, and its walls (arrowheads) are remodeled and display an abnormally concave shape. The condition is referred to as silent sinus syndrome

The anatomy of the frontal sinus is largely conditioned by the degree of pneumatization of surrounding air cells (mostly agger nasi cells) and by the cranial attachment of the uncinate process. Some configurations (i.e. supraorbital ethmoid air cell and deep olfactory fossa) significantly influence the complexity of the procedure and may increase the relative risk of complications.

### Computed tomographic and endoscopic analysis of supraorbital ethmoid cells [^1172Ss9S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study is to look at the incidence of supraorbital ethmoid cells (SOEC) in normal Chinese subjects by using spiral computed tomography (CT) scanning. In addition, subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis with SOEC were reviewed for endoscopic analysis.

Methods

A total of 202 normal Chinese subjects underwent spiral CT. Meanwhile, a retrospective review of patients who had undergone endoscopic sinus surgery over a 1-year period was conducted.

Results

SOEC showed an incidence of 5.4% (22 sides), and all of them arose from the anterior ethmoid cells. On coronal CT, an SOEC might give the appearance of multiple frontal sinuses, type III frontal cells, suprabullar cells, frontal bullar cells, interfrontal septal cells, or that there was a septation present within the frontal sinus. Meanwhile, 11 chronic rhinosinusitis patients with 12 SOEC were identified.

Conclusion

A thorough knowledge of endoscopic anatomy and CT of the frontal recess and various fronto-ethmoid cells were required for safe dissection of the SOEC and frontal ostium.

### The contribution of computed tomography to nasal septoplasty [^115QQycs]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of computed tomography (CT) scanning to nasal septoplasty.

Methods

The study included 76 patients, on whom septoplasty was planned to be performed because of deviated nasal septum. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those who had a CT scan (group 1, study group) and those who did not have a CT scan (group 2, control group) before septoplasty. Pathologic anatomic structures accompanying deviated septum and surgical interventions performed in addition to septoplasty were determined. The patients were asked the degree of improvement in nasal air passage obstruction, and 2 groups were compared with each other.

Results

Group 1 included 40 patients, and group 2 had 36 patients. In group 1, the pathologic findings determined along with deviated septum were concha bullosa in 14 patients, retention cyst of the maxillary sinus in 2 patients, paradox middle nasal concha in 2 patients, inferior concha hypertrophy in 18 patients, frontal osteoma in 1 patient, antrochoanal polyp in 1 patient, and chronic sinusitis (maxillary, ethmoidal, frontal) in 7 patients. Lateral resection was performed for concha bullosa; out-fracture with submucosal cauterization was performed on the patients with inferior concha hypertrophy, and endoscopic sinus surgery was performed for the patients with chronic sinusitis and antrochoanal polyp.

Conclusions

Computed tomography is able to recognize some pathologic findings that cannot be found on physical examination and is helpful to decide the location and the type of the surgery. Additional surgical interventions owing to CT performed before the septoplasty are much more helpful to relieve the patient's nasal air passage obstruction.

### Anatomic considerations in frontal sinus surgery [^115wCXha]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Comprehension of the complex anatomic variants comprising the frontal sinus outflow tract is essential for successful surgical intervention. Deviation from sound technique increases the potential for a variety of deleterious sequelae, including recurrent disease as well as catastrophic intracranial and orbital injury. Furthermore, incomplete removal of elements occluding the frontal recess can result in severe stenosis that can increase the difficulty of further interventions. This review covers anatomic considerations that should be kept in mind when performing frontal sinus surgery.

### The impact of nasal airflow on sinus mucosa: a radiographic review [^116jDtyr]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a disease of widespread prevalence and high morbidity. Many suggest that the introduction of toxins and allergens via nasal airflow plays a significant role in the development of CRS. In patients who have undergone total laryngectomy, nasal airflow is disrupted, providing an opportunity to examine the role of nasal airflow in sinonasal pathology.

Methods

All patients who received a total laryngectomy between 2002 and 2012 with preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were retrospectively reviewed. The Lund-Mackay (LM) score for each sinus was recorded for both scans. The assessment of differences in pre-operative and post-operative LM scores was analyzed utilizing paired t-tests.

Results

56 patients underwent total laryngectomy and had both preoperative and postoperative CT scans. There were no significant differences in the LM scores between pre-operative and post-operative scans within each sinus (frontal sinus, p = 1.0; anterior ethmoid sinus, p = 0.77; posterior ethmoid sinus, p = 0.45; maxillary sinus, p = 0.90; sphenoid sinus, p = 0.63; ostiomeatal complex, p = 0.78) or in the total LM scores (p = 0.97). Furthermore, patients with pre-operative sinonasal mucosal thickening (total LM score > 0) showed no significant change in their total LM score post-operatively (p = 0.13).

Conclusion

In total laryngectomy patients, studies demonstrate that a disruption in nasal airflow is correlated to altered sinonasal physiology and decreased subjective symptoms. However, our study shows that the disruption of nasal airflow results in no significant change in radiographic evidence of sinonasal mucosal thickening.

Acute invasive fungal sinusitis conversely is potentially life-threatening and occurs in immunocompromised patients. It has a propensity for the ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses. Invasion and obliteration of the periantral, pterygopalatine, or orbital apex fat (Fig. 8) portend life-threatening intracranial spread. Invasive features, however, may not always be present on CT and severe mucosal thickening- though non-specific- is the most sensitive finding.

Coronal soft tissue CT a demonstrates "bubbly" aerated secretions within the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells bilaterally suggestive of acute sinusitis. Hyperdense regions are indicative of inspissated secretions or fungal elements (arrowed). Axial soft tissue CT images b, c illustrate subtle abnormal soft tissue at the right orbital apex (short arrow, b) and the right pterygopalatine fossa (short arrow, c), which suggests trans-spatial spread of disease.

### An additional challenge for head and neck radiologists: anatomic variants posing a surgical risk-a pictorial review [^1157R7Gy]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Another point of concern for optic nerve injury during surgery is the anterior clinoid process pneumatization. In this case, the risk of iatrogenic damage is related to the thickness of the bony walls of the process and to the degree of pneumatization surrounding the nerve. The prevalence of this variant is low (6–13%).

The infraorbital (or Haller's) cell is an extension of ethmoid pneumatization to the orbital wall, inferolateral to the ethmoid bulla (Fig. 2). This cell may obstruct the ethmoid infundibulum, thereby predisposing the patient to maxillary sinusitis and may increase the hazard of orbital penetration during endoscopic sinus surgery; while opening such a cell, in fact, the surgeon may dangerously leverage on the inferomedial orbital wall.

Fig. 2
Haller's cell. Coronal MDCT reformation shows a huge infraorbital cell (asterisk) along the inferior orbital wall, not affecting the caliber of the ethmoid infundibulum (arrows)

Both clinoid pneumatization and Haller's cell are readily detected on coronal MDCT scans or on cone beam CT (CBCT) scans.

A unilaterally shrunk maxillary sinus may indicate the collapse of the uncinate process along the inferomedial orbital wall. This anomalous position of the uncinate process enhances the risk of accidental orbital penetration during uncinectomy, a frequent procedure in the early stages of endoscopic sinus surgery. The pathophysiology in this anatomic variant is triggered by adhesion between the uncinate process and the orbital wall; in fact, this induces chronic hypoventilation and negative pressure within the maxillary sinus resulting in shrinkage of the lumen and inflammatory thickening of the mucosa. Negative sinus pressure also induces partial collapse of the orbital floor and increased vertical diameter of the orbit. All of these signs are referred to as silent sinus syndrome and can be easily detected on (CB) MDCT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (Fig. 3).

Benign inflammatory diseases

Sinonasal polyposis is a benign inflammatory mucosal condition that most commonly affects the maxillary sinuses and often extends into the middle meatus of the nasal cavity (Fig. 7). It is characterised by its rounded contours. The presence of more extensive sinonasal polyposis, particularly in the upper meatus and the posterior portion of the middle meatus, can significantly impede olfactory function.

Standard radiography — plain film views and limitations are detailed: "There are 4 standard radiographic views of the paranasal sinuses; these include 2 anterior-posterior (A-P) views (Caldwell, Waters), a lateral view, and a submentovertical view". The Caldwell view shows the frontal and maxillary sinuses but "superimposition of the ethmoid air cells on these A-P views limits their evaluation". "The Waters view, also known as the occipitomental view, is likely the best view to evaluate the maxillary sinuses, particularly to evaluate for the presence of a maxillary sinus air-fluid level". "The lateral and submentovertical views are a useful adjunct to evaluate the frontal and maxillary sinuses and assess adenoid size in children". Critically, "Compared with CT, none of the standard radiographic views reliably image the severity or location of sinus disease", and "standard radiography does not provide reliable information regarding the sinus outflow tracts".

Imaging features.

Nasal cavity.

On imaging, a deviated nasal septum was seen in 84% of patients (n = 42). It was deviated toward the right in 21 patients and toward the left in 21 patients. Turbinate thickening was seen in 90% of patients (n = 45).

Paranasal sinuses.

The ethmoid sinuses were involved most commonly, right (92%, n = 46) more than left (90%, n = 45), followed by the maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses. Severe disease was seen more often in the ethmoid sinuses than the rest of the sinuses (Figure 3). Bilateral involvement of the ethmoid, maxillary, and frontal sinuses was seen in 82% of patients (n = 41), 62% of patients (n = 31), and 40% of patients (n = 20), respectively. The presence of moderate to severe sinusitis affecting two or more sinuses was seen in 94% of patients (n = 47) (Figure 4). The most common pattern was the involvement of both maxillary and ethmoid sinuses (88%, n = 44). Three or more sinus groups — among the maxillary, ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal sinuses — were affected in 66% of patients (n = 33), suggesting the need for extensive sinonasal debridement to achieve adequate clearance of the disease.

### Eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis of the lacrimal sac [^111qQtf8]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Chronic sinusitis is a condition affecting millions of individuals each year. Recent findings indicate that chronic rhinosinusitis is a response to fungi mediated by the eosinophil in some of these individuals. We report a case of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis of the lacrimal sac, an entity not previously reported.

Study Design

Case report.

Methods

A 69-year-old man presented with a 1-cm cystic lesion in the right-side medial canthal region. This lesion was fluctuant, and mucoid material was freely expressed from the medial canthal area. Endoscopic examination revealed bilateral nasal polyps anteriorly and superiorly with mucopurulent drainage from both maxillary sinuses. He had undergone three prior sinus surgeries and two prior lacrimal cannulations elsewhere. A computed tomography scan showed opacification of both maxillary sinuses, ethmoid sinuses, and the left sphenoid sinus and moderate thickening in the frontal sinuses. There was significant soft tissue prominence in the area of both lacrimal fossae with erosion into the medial orbit. The patient underwent bilateral endoscopic revision ethmoidectomies, middle meatal antrostomies, sphenoidotomies, frontal sinusotomies, and endoscopic right-side dacryocystorhinostomy at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN).

Results

At the time of surgery, massive amounts of thick mucoid material were aspirated from both lacrimal regions. The aspiration of the lacrimal duct on the left side was sufficient treatment, whereas the dacryocystorhinostomy was necessary to decompress the cyst of the face on the right side. The material aspirated was allergic mucin, and the patient met the criteria for diagnosing eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis. The patient was started on a regimen of antifungal nasal irrigations postoperatively and has done well in follow-up.

Conclusions

Although never previously reported, eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis can occur in the lacrimal sac. It is important to recognize this so that the underlying disease process can be treated appropriately.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — preoperative diagnostic confirmation and assessment (KAS 1A/1B) states that This KAS underscores the necessity of confirming the CRS diagnosis by aligning with established diagnostic criteria outlined in CPGs, specifying that a formal diagnosis includes at least 12 weeks of two or more of the four cardinal symptoms and one or more objective findings such as evidence of inflammation on nasal endoscopy or computed tomography (CT) or discolored discharge from the paranasal sinuses or ostiomeatal complex; KAS 1B then focuses on evaluating the patient's candidacy for surgery based on symptomatology and quality of life (QOL) disruptions, objective disease severity, and prior therapeutic interventions, noting that clinicians may utilize validated instruments including the SNOT-22 and CRS-PRO and other disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, that it is helpful to identify objective findings by anterior rhinoscopy, endoscopy, and/or CT scan, and that some patients reporting CRS-attributable symptoms may not have objective exam or CT findings of CRS.

### Frontal sinus septations predict the presence of supraorbital ethmoid cells [^112m8q6B]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

This study is undertaken to determine if the presence or absence of multiseptated frontal sinuses is associated with the presence or absence of supraorbital ethmoid cells (SOECs).

Study Design

Analysis of prospectively collected data.

Methods

Sixty consecutive patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were identified from a prospectively collected database at a tertiary-referral institution as having full-sinus computed tomography (CT) scans. Preoperative or initial CT scans of the sinuses were reviewed, specifically identifying the presence or absence of supraorbital ethmoid air cells (SOECS) and frontal sinus multiseptated sections on coronal imaging. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-squared test to evaluate any association between the two structural entities.

Results

Sixty total patients were identified, for a total of 120 sides. Of the 61 sides with frontal septations, 43 (70%) had SOECs present and 18 (30%) did not. Of the 59 sides without frontal sinus septations, 13 (22%) had SOECs present and 46 (78%) did not (chi squared = 28.3; P = 0.0000001). The difference in the presence of supraorbital ethmoid cells between whites and blacks is also statistically significant (chi squared = 4.23; P = 0.040).

Conclusion

The presence of frontal sinus septations appears to be significantly associated with and predictive of the presence of supraorbital ethmoid cells. Thus, identifying frontal sinus septations on sinus CT is implicated with more complex anatomy of the frontal recess.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^114gHWha]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Nasal endoscopy — diagnostic findings and value in suspected chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) include that findings supporting CRS are purulent mucus or edema in the middle meatus or ethmoid region, or polyps in the nasal cavity or middle meatus; in adults with suspected CRS using CT as the gold standard, a systematic review found that a positive nasal endoscopy (pus or polyps) had an added value for confirming CRS of 25% to 28%, whereas a negative nasal endoscopy had an added value of ruling out CRS of 5% to 30%; the authors concluded that nasal endoscopy should be a first-line confirmatory test for CRS, reserving CT for patients with a prolonged or complicated clinical course.

### The role of agger nasi air cells in patients requiring revision endoscopic frontal sinus surgery [^111AQFwC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the association of agger nasi air cell disease with frontal rhinosinusitis, assessed by computed tomography (CT), in patients who require revision functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).

Methods

We prospectively collected data on patients undergoing revision FESS at a tertiary care medical center over an 18-month period. Sinus CT scans were graded as per Lund-Mackay. Frontal sinus findings on CT scan were correlated with the presence or absence of disease in agger nasi air cells.

Results

Eighty patients underwent revision FESS in an 18-month period. A total of 160 sides were evaluated by sinus CT scan with agger nasi being present in all but 11 sides (93%). One patient did not have a pneumatized frontal sinus on 1 side and so 148 sides were available for study. Frontal sinus disease was present in 119 and absent in 29 sides. The average CT grade of patients with frontal rhinosinusitis was 8.4 while it was only 3.0 in patients without frontal rhinosinusitis (P = 0.000). Agger nasi air cell disease was present in only 3 of 29 (10%) sides in patients without frontal rhinosinusitis and was present in all 119 (100%) sides of patients with frontal rhinosinusitis (P = 0.0000).

Conclusion

Agger nasi air cells are a common anatomic feature, present in 93% of our patients. Agger nasi air cell disease correlates strongly with frontal sinus disease as assessed by sinus CT scan in patients undergoing revision FESS. In addition, frontal sinus disease correlates with the severity of overall sinus disease as determined by sinus CT scan.

### Clinical consensus statement: balloon dilation of the sinuses [^114Q6GS5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Balloon dilation of the sinuses — patient criteria without consensus: The panel listed several statements that did not reach consensus, noting that items in boldface reached "near consensus". Examples include that "CT scanning of the sinuses is a requirement before balloon dilation can be considered" (mean 6.69; outliers 8) and that "There is a role for balloon sinus dilation in managing patients with recurrent acute sinusitis… without CT evidence of disease" (mean 4.69; outliers 8). Near-consensus items included "Balloon dilation is appropriate as an adjunct procedure to functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) in patients with chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps" (mean 7.31; outliers 2), "For patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with limited sinus disease who meet criteria for surgery, balloon dilation is an appropriate standalone procedure before considering more extensive sinus surgery" (mean 6.62; outliers 1), and "There is a role for balloon dilation in patients with persistent sinus disease who have had previous sinus surgery" (mean 6.69; outliers 1).

### Balloon catheter dilation of the frontal sinus ostium [^1114ooJu]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The decision to operate on the frontal sinus is based on persistent symptoms that have been refractory to appropriate medical therapy with associated radiographic evidence of disease by computed tomography. There is currently no evidence to support operating on radiographically negative frontal sinuses, regardless of the availability of technology or site of service options. There are many surgical procedures as well as a variety of different technologies available for the treatment of symptomatic, medically refractory frontal sinus disease. Balloon catheter dilation can be performed safely in an office setting with outcomes comparable to those in traditional operating room settings.

### Reformation of concha bullosa following treatment by crushing surgical technique: implication for balloon sinuplasty [^116tmEAy]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

There are various surgical techniques designed to treat conchae bullosae (CB). These include partial or total resection and crushing. Frontal sinus balloon sinuplasty is thought to work by the crushing/remodeling of the agger nasi and frontal recess air cells. The long-term outcome of sinuplasty in the frontal/ethmoid air cell region is unknown. To date, no study has been done on the reformation of CB after crushing. We report on the long-term outcome of a series of patients who underwent crushing of their CB and suggest implications for frontal sinus balloon sinuplasty.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

Retrospective review of 10 patients who re-presented with CB as a component of their nasal obstructive symptoms despite previously undergoing crushing of their CB. Data analyzed included paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scans and operative reports.

Results

These 10 patients re-presented with recurrent rhinosinusitis and nasal obstructive symptoms. The patients had previously undergone septoplasty surgery with crushing of the CB and were noted to have reformed the CB on their most recent sinus CT. The previous surgeries were preformed from 2 to 15 years prior to their representation.

Conclusions

CB can reform following crushing technique. One may extrapolate that agger nasi and frontal recess air cells may reform following balloon sinuplasty leading to recurrent obstruction of the frontal sinus outflow tract.

### Role of maximal endoscopic sinus surgery techniques in chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hEwgt]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

There remains a continued debate regarding the extent of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) required for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). By examining anatomic, etiologic, and postoperative factors that may lead to recalcitrant CRS, this article aims to highlight some of the reasons for performing maximal techniques in ESS. This concept is further expanded in various surgical maneuvers including wide maxillary antrostomy, extended frontal sinus procedures, and intraoperative computed tomography-guided ESS.

### Overview of frontal sinus pathology and management [^116dBRAe]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The frontal sinus is the most complex of all paranasal sinuses. Given its proximity to the cranial vault and orbit, frontal sinus pathology can progress to involve these structures and lead to significant morbidity, or even mortality. Surgical management of the frontal sinus is technically challenging. Various open and endoscopic surgical techniques are available to the otolaryngologist. This article presents an overview of the major disease entities that affect the frontal sinus, with a special emphasis on treatment principles and surgical management.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^112eZ4LC]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Imaging techniques to evaluate sinuses — modality indications specify that CT without contrast is used to evaluate extent of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and complications of rhinosinusitis; evaluate sinus anatomy, including anatomy of outflow tracts, nasal turbinate anatomy, and nasal septal deviation or spur; evaluate sinus variants (eg, infraorbital ethmoid [Haller] cells, frontal bulla and cells, agger nasi cells, sphenoethmoidal [Onodi] cells); evaluate for a mucocele; evaluate recurrent acute rhinosinusitis; and for operative stereotactic navigation image guidance during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). CT with contrast/MRI with contrast are used to evaluate for the complications of rhinosinusitis, such as orbital and intracranial extension; evaluate for presence, location, and extent of a sinus tumor and for extra-sinus involvement, such as orbital and intracranial extension; differentiate a mucocele from a tumor; rule out a structural, neoplastic, or inflammatory process originating outside paranasal sinuses; and evaluate allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS).

### Frontal sinus irrigation: indications, results, and complications [^112RjR3N]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Management, diagnosis, and surgical treatment of the frontal sinus pathology remain a challenge for the rhinologist. Since the introduction of endoscopic instrumentation, the frontal recess may be reached easily and a variety of endonasal approaches have been rediscovered. Although the endoscopic technique allows direct visualization and manipulation, some problems remain, from localization of the frontal sinus ostium during the procedure to the management of the postoperative care to prevent stenosis. The frontal irrigation is suggested as a useful adjunct during the endonasal approach to locate the frontal drainage.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hVHRc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnostic confirmation — The clinician should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography, and this is a strong recommendation based on cross-sectional studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade B and a high level of confidence in evidence, with benefit of improved diagnostic certainty for CRS and fewer false-positive diagnoses; risks, harms, and costs relate to the diagnostic modalities themselves; patient preferences have a large role in choice of the confirmatory modality; and the policy level is Strong Recommendation. MRI can be used to document sinonasal disease if already available, but CT scanning is the preferred imaging modality, and a quality improvement opportunity is to make care safer by reducing overdiagnosis of CRS based on self-reported symptoms.

### Clinicoradiological profile of COVID-19-associated rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis with a focus on computed tomography: a clinical case series and review [^1172meUP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Paranasal sinuses.

Paranasal sinus involvement manifests as hypodense mucosal thickening of the sinus mucosa. In 2020 in western India, Joshi et al.evaluated 25 patients with COVID-19–associated mucormycosis. Maxillary involvement was seen most commonly in their case series, followed by the ethmoid sinus. Similarly, in another series in 2021 in eastern India, Dubey et al.noted the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were affected most frequently. The ethmoid and maxillary sinuses were involved most often in our series as well. In addition, bilateral disease and involvement of multiple sinuses were also frequently seen. Sixty-six percent of our patients had moderate to severe involvement of three or more sinus groups. This becomes significant in terms of the extent of debridement, and emphasizes the fact that patients with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, or who have an altered immune status for any reason should be warned about the warning signs and symptoms, so that an early endoscopic examination can be performed. The results of the endoscopy will affect morbidity and functional loss positively by guiding debridement. The combination of maxillary, ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinusitis was noted in 26% of our patients. Mucosal thickening of the turbinates was another common finding.

### Nasolacrimal duct obstruction after maxillary orthognathic surgery [^111Z7DrC]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) after maxillary orthognathic surgery.

Materials and Methods

The authors reviewed the clinical manifestations, dacryocystographic images, and orbital computed tomographic scans of 10 patients who were diagnosed with NLDO after undergoing maxillary orthognathic surgery.

Results

Six of the 10 patients (60%) complained of epiphora immediately after the surgery. Bilateral (n = 2, 20%) or unilateral (n = 8, 80%) NLDO occurred in all patients involved in the study. Twelve eyes of 10 patients were examined, and dacryocystography showed that the obstruction was present in the distal ostium in 7 eyes (58.3%), the junction between the sac and duct in 3 eyes (25%), and the common canaliculus in 2 eyes (16.7%). Computed tomographic scans of all subjects showed that mucosal swelling and congestion around the distal NLD opening narrowed the space between the lateral nasal wall and the inferior turbinate of the affected side. Dacryocystorhinostomy was performed in 9 eyes (8 patients), with a success rate of 100%.

Conclusions

The distal to proximal portion of the NLD can become obstructed after maxillary orthognathic surgery. This obstruction seems to be caused by secondary inflammatory changes associated with an indirect injury of the NLD. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of NLDO after orthognathic surgery, which can be treated successfully with dacryocystorhinostomy.

### Pathophysiological classification of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115xjrNw]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Subjects

Charts from 100 consecutive chronic sinusitis subjects were assessed retrospectively. The clinical diagnosis of chronic sinusitis was made by contemporary criteria based on chronic nasal discharge, sinus region pain and tenderness, and poor symptomatic responses to antibiotics and other therapies for at least 12 weeks. Most gave a history of recurrent acute sinusitis that progressed to CRS over a period of several years. Patients were referred by otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, general internists, and by self-referral. Subjects with allergic rhinitis or nonallergic rhinitis without chronic sinusitis complaints were excluded.

Independent groups of CRS, allergic rhinitis, and healthy subjects with neither condition provided representative control groups. They were recruited to concurrent clinical research studies of fatigue, pain sensitivity, irritant rhinitis, and tobacco sensitivity that did not include CRS as an inclusion or exclusion criterion. However, because of the nature of their studies, they did not have the same extensive laboratory evaluation at the clinical CRS patients.

Variables

CT scan severity was used as a study variable and so was not required for the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis. Coronal CT scans were scored according to the May classification in order to be consistent with our previous studies. Normal nasal and sinus CT scans were scored as Grade 0. Grade 1 indicated osteomeatal narrowing without sinus mucosal thickening (OMC). Thickening or opacification limited to the ethmoid sinuses was Grade 2 disease. Grade 3 required bilateral disease involving mucosal thickening, air-fluid levels, or opacification of individual larger sinuses. Pansinusitis with opacification of ethmoid, maxillary, frontal and potentially sphenoid sinuses was classified as Grade 4. In practical terms, 3 groups were identified. The OMC group had nasal disease only (Grade 1). Sinus involvement (Grades 2 to 4) was present in both the polyp and CRSsNP groups.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113cx3DW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

CT imaging in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is used to confirm diagnosis and guide surgery; a diagnosis may also be confirmed by CT scanning or MRI, but MRI for diagnostic confirmation is discouraged because of increased cost and hypersensitivity in comparison to CT without contrast. CT scanning can help quantify the extent of inflammatory disease and improves diagnostic accuracy because imaging findings correlate with the presence or absence of CRS, and although CT findings do not necessarily correlate with symptom severity, they offer an objective method for monitoring recurrent or chronic disease. CT of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained when endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is considered or planned in patients with CRS or RARS, and the study will provide anatomic detail necessary to guide the surgery. Multidetector CT offers advantages over single‑detector imaging because other planes can be reconstructed from one scan; multidetector CT imaging may reduce total radiation dose and is acceptable to use not only for diagnosis but also for surgical intervention. MRI as an alternative to CT has noted higher costs, longer procedure times, and higher false‑positive rates; ultrasound has limited diagnostic utility for CRS, though in resource‑constrained environments it has shown improved diagnostic accuracy compared to plain film X rays or as a precursor to CT as a screening tool.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^116xoKv1]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP) with symptoms more than 12 weeks is evaluated and managed using an algorithm that begins with evaluation (sinus CT and/or nasal endoscopy, consider culture, consider evaluation for aeroallergens — especially perennial aeroallergens — and other environmental triggers, and consider evaluation for immunodeficiency), followed by initial treatment with topical steroids, nasal saline irrigation, and an oral steroid, with consideration of an oral antibiotic (culture-based, if possible). After the decision point "Treatment successful?", the Yes branch leads to follow up to consider further evaluation of underlying risk factors and to continue individualized medical therapy; the No branch leads to additional treatment and evaluation including sinus CT if not done before (MRI for special cases), consideration of an alternate oral antibiotic, culture if not done before, consideration of immunodeficiency if not done before, consultation by an otolaryngologist for surgery, consideration of aspirin desensitization for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), consideration of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), continuation of topical steroid and nasal saline irrigation, and management of comorbid asthma if present. Additional notes state that nasal examination may show mucosal erythema, edema, and purulent secretions in addition to polyps; evaluation should include coronal sinus CT scan, and the CT scan should ideally be performed 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of medical therapy; nasal polyps are relatively uncommon in children, and their presence should prompt evaluation for possible CF; and patients benefit from continued individualized medical therapy, including, when indicated, allergy management.

### Spontaneous transethmoidal meningoencephalocele presenting in the form of recurrent unilateral nasal discharge: discussion of the diagnosis and endoscopic surgical management [^114s5Rv4]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 56-year-old Caucasian woman presented with an intermittent unilateral rhinorrhea on the right side for several months associated with chronic ipsilateral fronto-temporal headaches. She was in good health and had no significant medical background or history of head trauma or any nasal or para-nasal sinuses surgery. She underwent a neurological evaluation and the diagnosis of chronic tension headaches with migraines component was made. A medical treatment was tried without any symptom improvement.

Due to the unfavourable evolution, she underwent a head CT scan (figure 1A, B) and MRI (figure 1C, D). These radiological examinations showed a cystic mass located in the anterior ethmoidal cells on the right side with an adjacent skull base bony defect. There were no other intracranial mass or other lesions. The rest of the nasal cavity and sinuses showed no other anomalies.

Figure 1
(A) Coronal CT scan view shows the lesion with a bony defect at the level of the skull base on the right side. (B) Sagittal CT scan view shows the lesion on the anterior ethmoid cells in the right side with a skull base defect at this level. (C) MRI imaging on T2 sequence fat sat, axial view shows the cystic lesion on the anterior right ethmoid. (D) MRI imaging on T2 sequence Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), coronal view shows the cystic lesion on the anterior right ethmoid. (E) Intraoperative three-dimensional imaging guided navigation system view shows the accurate localisation of the lesion. (F) Intraoperative endoscopic view shows the herniated sac of brain parenchyma at the level of the anterior ethmoid in the right side.

The patient was referred to the ear, nose and throat department for evaluation. Her initial complaint was an intermittent right-sided rhinorrhea without nasal obstruction or any other symptoms. The fiberoptic endoscopic examination of the nose showed a normal appearance of the nasal mucosa, mild and non-obstructive septal deviation, no evidence of intranasal mass or polyps. There was no spontaneous right-sided rhinorrhea but the Dandy manoeuvre (head bent forward and downwards for a few minutes) triggered a right-sided clear rhinorrhea and the analysis of this nasal liquid was positive for beta-2 transferrin protein.

According to these clinical and radiological findings, the diagnosis of a transethmoidal meningoencephalocele was retained. After discussion with the patient, the decision of a combined otorhinolaryngology and neurosurgery management was made.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^114UqzKD]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis — preoperative evaluation and special scenarios: "In CRS, preintervention evaluation should include a careful history and evaluation for environmental and general host factors that might predispose to rhinosinusitis, in addition to evaluation of the local host factors within the sinuses and ostiomeatal complex". Surgeons should recognize that "Surgical intervention exposes virgin mucosa to nasal airflow and thus potentially allows initiation of the inflammatory process at a new site". Fungal disease is a key indication because "Surgery is typically required for fungal rhinosinusitis" and "Fungus balls, typically within the maxillary or sphenoid sinuses, AFRS, and invasive fungal sinusitis generally require surgical intervention". Unilateral polypoid disease warrants tissue assessment as "biopsy examination should be considered in these patients", and dental-origin disease patterns and management are noted: "Rhinosinusitis of dental origin also typically presents as unilateral disease" and "Such patients typically require endoscopic surgical intervention for sinus drainage and management of the underlying dental cause, typically an apical abscess or infected dental implant, for resolution of the disease". Endoscopic technique context is provided: "Endoscopic approaches have generally become the surgical standard of care for CRS".

### Maxillary sinusitis developed as sequelae of accidental middle turbinectomy that occurred during nasotracheal intubation: a case report [^111pF7Bq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, traumatic removal of the middle turbinate mucosa resulted in the formation of synechiae causing signs and symptoms of nasal obstruction and sleep disturbance at 3 months postoperatively. Synechiae have been reported to form early during the postoperative period and resolve with simple lysis in patients who have undergone turbinectomy. Thus, close follow-up during the initial postoperative stages is generally recommended to avoid long-term complications. Indeed, the symptoms and signs of nasal obstruction and sleep disturbance improved in our patient, following simple lysis with concurrent septoplasty. Our patient remained free of synechia for the next 65 months.

Ipsilateral maxillary sinusitis was observed on facial CT performed at 2 years postoperatively in our patient. Maxillary sinusitis has been described as a complication of prolonged nasotracheal intubation. An ostial obstruction has been causally related to the development of sinusitis in animal studies. This may have been applicable in our patient; notably, he did not exhibit a common cause of maxillary sinusitis (e.g. fungal ball or periapical abscess). Another explanation is that impaired sinus mucociliary movement due to loss of the middle turbinate may have led to the development of maxillary sinusitis. This speculation is supported by prior findings that the middle turbinate is the primary site for impaction of inhaled particles and serves to protect the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses from inhaled air and the associated drying effects on sinus mucociliary clearance; moreover, the middle turbinate plays an indirect role in sinus mucociliary clearance by blocking turbulent flow in the middle meatus.

In conclusion, in patients with trauma to the middle turbinate complicated by nasotracheal intubation, both early complications (e.g. life-threatening airway obstruction or bleeding) and late complications (e.g. nasal synechiae or sinusitis) can occur. If an anesthesiologist must perform nasotracheal intubation in a patient with septal deviation, sufficient preoperative nasal examination and preparation to reduce damage should be performed to avoid possible complications.

Allergic rhinitis imaging and diagnosis — The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis (AR) is based on clinical presentation and there is no role for radiographic imaging; potential significant costs and possible side effects of imaging modalities outweigh their utility in routine AR evaluation. In contrast, sinonasal imaging, specifically computed tomography (CT) scans without contrast, may be indicated for recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, chronic rhinosinusitis, complicated rhinosinusitis, or to define sinus anatomy prior to surgery.

### A new device for frontal sinus endoscopy: first clinical report [^111SkChZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Endoscopically or microscopically controlled paranasal sinus surgery currently represents the state of the art. For anatomic reasons the ostium of the frontal sinus and the frontal sinus itself are difficult to observe. Flexible endoscopes are often difficult to implement and do not provide enough light intensity to visualize all parts of the frontal sinus.

Materials and Methods

A specially curved rigid endoscope with a working channel of 1.5 mm that allows passage into the frontal sinus has been developed to manage this problem. The system was used on 15 patients during paranasal sinus surgery to evaluate possible indications and its clinical usefulness.

Results

The endoscope could be introduced into the frontal sinus after an ethmoidectomy had been performed in all of the patients. The anatomy of the sinus could be visualized with sufficient light intensity in 14 patients. The shadowing of the frontal sinus seen in CT was not due to polyps of the mucosa of the frontal sinus in all cases, but rather due to secretion with otherwise normal mucosa. In the cases with polyps, it was necessary to irrigate with saline solution to prevent the buoyant polyps from collapsing over the endoscope. The following specific indications for this endoscopic version were established during this first test: intraoperative and postoperative control of the frontal sinus, clinical evaluation of tumor growth into the frontal sinus, biopsies within the frontal sinus, and evaluation of fractures.

Conclusion

The new device provides further insight within the field.

### Maxillary sinusitis developed as sequelae of accidental middle turbinectomy that occurred during nasotracheal intubation: a case report [^117H8WRF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

An otolaryngologist performed a bilateral endoscopic nasal cavity examination on 1 day postoperatively. Inspection of the right nares revealed that the septum deviated to the right, especially at the level of the uncinate process; residual bloody spots (Fig. 2 a) and the stalk remnants of the middle turbinate (Fig. 2 b) were observed. The maxillary crest was wide and the mucosa was damaged. A tilted vomer and perpendicular ethmoid plate made an acute angle. However, there was no bleeding or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. No endoscopic cauterization of the remaining right middle turbinate stalk or nasal packing was required to achieve hemostasis. Inspection of left nares also revealed mucosal damage. A facial CT scan taken 1 day postoperatively revealed remnants of the right middle turbinate stalk (Fig. 1 b). The patient was followed up at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology before discharge, but he denied any nasal complications, bleeding, or obstruction.

Fig. 2
Nasal endoscopy findings in the right nasal cavity. a A right deviated nasal septum (*) and residual bloody spots, as well as b a small remnant of the middle turbinate, are present at 1 day postoperatively. c Formation of synechiae was observed at 3 months postoperatively.

At the 3-month postoperative follow-up, the patient had symptoms and signs of nasal obstruction in the traumatized nasal cavity; he also reported sleep disturbance. Ipsilateral synechiae had formed between the nasal septum and lateral nasal wall, as determined by a right rhinoscopic examination (Fig. 2 c) and facial CT (Fig. 1 c). A home sleep test was performed to determine the degree of sleep apnea, which revealed a respiratory disturbance index of 11.3 events per hour. The synechiae resolved rapidly after simple lysis with concurrent septoplasty, and the signs of nasal obstruction and sleep disturbance were much improved. The patient remained recurrence-free beyond simple lysis of the synechia for the next 65 months.

At the 2-year follow-up, the patient exhibited nasal fullness and a yellowish discharge. Although right rhinoscopy indicated that no new synechiae had formed, ipsilateral maxillary sinusitis was observed on facial CT (Fig. 1 d). The symptoms of maxillary sinusitis improved after medical treatment.

### Rhinosinusitis derived staphylococcal enterotoxin B plays a possible role in pathogenesis of food allergy [^1176vbZ1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment of CRS

We diagnosed CRS as inflammation of the sinus mucosa with a persistent mucoid or mucopurulent nasal discharge for longer than 3 months that resisted antimicrobial therapy and antral irrigation. Diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical history, rhinoscopic findings, and computed tomographic scan of rhinosinuses. CRS was confirmed by computed tomographic examination that showed diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid or/and maxillary sinuses bilaterally with scores higher than 12 by the Lund-Mackay staging system. The procedures of FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery) followed the previous reports. The surgical side of sinus was irrigated daily post-FESS until the irrigated fluids became clear. After discharge, the patients were required to visit the hospital to conduct a post-operation examination of nasal cavity and sinuses on a monthly basis for the first year. Any unusual feelings in the operated sinus area were recorded. Physicians would do necessary treatment for relapse of inflammation in the sinuses during the entire follow-up period.

The CRS in the patients selected in this study had been treated with many means and got poor results. They thus pleaded to FESS following physician's advice. All the CRS patients (including CRS-FA and CRS alone) underwent FESS in their maxillary sinusitis. Among the CRS-FA patients, 8 (17.4%) patients also underwent bilateral ethmoidectomy. 9 patients also underwent unilateral ethmoidectory (19.6%, right or left side). 6 (13%) patients also underwent septum orthomorphia. 18 (39.1%) patients had nasal polyps that were removed during FESS. 3 (6.5%) patients underwent partial middle turbinectomy. 6 (13%) patients underwent inferior turbinectomy. During the 2 month observation period, all the patients underwent regular follow-up visit (The total follow-up period lasted for one year after FESS). 2 months after FESS, all the patients reported significant improvement in their clinical symptoms of CRS. Clinical symptom scores were recorded before and 2 months after FESS that were defined from 0 to 4 (0 for no symptoms; 4 for severe). Most patients had moderate to severe CRS clinical symptoms before FESS; 40 out of 46 (87%, scored 0 and 1) patients showed significant attenuation in their clinical symptom of sinusitis.

### Orbitofrontal cholesterol granuloma masquerading as frontal sinus mucoceles: report of two cases [^115vDL5a]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Orbitofrontal cholesterol granuloma is rare, has a prediliction to the frontal sinuses. The location of disease is similar to the frontal sinus mucoceles. Therefore, the two patients were misdiagnosed before surgery and should be differentiated from them. Mucoceles are expansive cysts of mucus secreted by goblet cells interspersed in the ciliated mucosa. Although all paranasal sinuses are susceptible, the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses have the highest incidence. They can occur at any age, but most patients with mucoceles are between 40–60. Compromised sinus ventilation is the basic etiology of mucocele formation. The reasons may include (1) lesions of the nasal cavity and sinuses (or abnormal development), such as nasal polyps, sinus osteoma, and nasal septum deviation, and (2) inflammation or trauma leading to nasal adhesion and sinus obstruction. Mucoceles can compress and erode the surrounding bone wall, leading to absorption of the orbital wall as they grow gradually. Frontal sinus mucoceles frequently lead to the absorption of superior orbital wall, extending into the orbit, resulting in ocular symptoms and signs. The ocular manifestations are similar to orbital cholesterol granuloma. CT scan shows expansive growth of the mucoceles in the sinuses with absorption and destruction of adjacent bone and intrusion into surrounding structures. The clear boundary; the internal density is more uniform, mostly low density; a few can be equal or even high density. The density is dependent on the protein concentration of sac fluid. When protein concentration is high, density is high, whereas when protein concentration is low, density is low. Mucocele MRI signal intensity is quite distinct, and signal level may correlate with disease duration. Subsequently, patients with a short disease course have more moisture and hypointense presentation on T1WI. Patient with a long period of the disease has more protein, presenting hyperintense on T1WI.

### Expression of eicosanoid receptors subtypes and eosinophilic inflammation: implication on chronic rhinosinusitis [^117KoUDf]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients and clinical diagnosis

Samples from ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses were collected during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) procedures in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the Ghent University Hospital. Nasal tissues were obtained from 13 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis (CRS-NP) (10 males, 3 females, age range: 30–54 years) and 11 subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis CRS (8 males, 3 females, age range: 21–53 years) who were scheduled for sinus surgery in the department of Othorinolaryngology of the Ghent University Hospital. As control group (Controls), we included 6 subjects (4 males, 2 females, age range: 21–53 years), who underwent septal surgery and removal of parts of the inferior turbinate due to anatomical variations. These patients had any acute or chronic clinical, endoscopic or imaging signs of sinusitis or polyposis; and they did not show any history of atopic, or lower airway disease.

Diagnosis of CRS was based on the presence of typical symptoms (headache, nasal obstruction and discoloured nasal drainage) longer than 12 weeks and a positive CT-Scan showing swelling of the ethmoidal and maxillary mucosa and bilateral obstruction of the osteomeatal complex but without polyp formation, visible during nasal endoscopy or during surgery. Nasal polyposis was diagnosed based on symptoms history (nasal congestion, lost of smell, changes in sense of taste and persistent postnasal drainage), clinical examination, nasal endoscopy and paranasal sinuses CT-Scan, defined as presence of visible bilateral polyps growing from the middle meatus into the nasal cavities, and affecting the ethmoidal sinuses. In the CRS-NP group, three patients had asthma and in the CRS group, there was one patient with allergic rhinitis and one with asthma. Diagnosis of asthma was based on clinical history, typical symptoms and lung (pulmonary) function tests (Spirometry and Peak Expiratory Flow), following the Global initiative for asthma (GINA) guidelines. All patients have taken aspirin or other NSAIDs without manifesting any hypersensitive reaction.

The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Ghent University Hospital, and all patients gave informed consent before their participation. The use of any oral medication with possible impact on measurements of enzymes or mediators, including systemic glucocorticoids and anti-leukotrienes, was stopped in all subjects 4 weeks before surgery. The use of topical glucocorticoids was interrupted 2 weeks before surgery.

### Management of the entered frontal sinus [^11557ojk]. Neurosurgical Review (2004). Low credibility.

The opening of the frontal sinus is a common occurrence in surgical practice. It may involve many surgical disciplines. The complications that may derive from incorrect treatment of an opened frontal sinus are potentially fatal. Unfortunately, the treatment of patients with injured frontal sinus is not uniform and standardized. Here, we describe our technique of treatment. We propose our treatment modality on the basis of our personal experience, which has been excellent in the past 20 years, that is from the time of the technique's introduction and routine application.

### How does nose blowing effect the computed tomography of paranasal sinuses in chronic sinusitis? [^116vX6s9]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to determine whether inward or outward movement of the secretions in the paranasal sinuses due to nose blowing after nasal decongestion has any effect on the paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) images in patients with sinusitis and to asses whether nose blowing may result in misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis in radiological evaluation of sinusitis.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-four patients with chronic sinusitis were evaluated in an academic tertiary care hospital and data were collected prospectively. After coronal sinus computed tomography scans were performed at 100 mA setting which was half the value of the standard radiation dose suggested by the manufacturer, topical decongestion was applied to each nostril followed by nose blowing 10 min later. Sinus CT scans were then repeated at the same setting. We evaluated the mucosal thickness of medial, lateral, superior and inferior maxillary and frontal sinus walls and the maximal thickness in anterior ethmoidal cells. The measurements prior to and following nose blowing were compared with Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The obtained images were also staged using Lund-McKay staging system separately and the scores were compared with Student's t-test.

Results

We observed a tendency towards reduction in mucosal thickness after nose blowing. There were statistically significant differences between maxillary sinus inferior wall and frontal sinus inferior wall mucosal thickness values prior to and after nose blowing. The difference however was very small, about 0.5 mm in magnitude and Lund-McKay score did not change in any of the patients after nose blowing.

Conclusion

Nose blowing and topical nasal decongestion does not have any effect on the diagnostic accuracy of sinus CT in chronic sinusitis patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113oH42v]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps — key action statement and management: The clinician should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS. Recommendation based on observational studies with preponderance of benefit over harm, and policy level: Recommendation. The exact prevalence of nasal polyps in rhinosinusitis is unknown, but about 4% of patients with CRS have concurrent polyps. Smaller nasal polyps in the middle meatus or in the posterior nasal cavity, however, may only be detected by nasal endoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the sinuses is often useful in evaluating CRS with nasal polyps, especially for unilateral polyps, concern for polyps extending outside of the nasal cavity, or other atypical presentations. For unilateral processes, tissue biopsy and imaging are often required to differentiate unilateral polyps from other pathologies; scraping of nasal polyps is not recommended. Topical nasal steroid sprays are indicated for long-term treatment of nasal polyps in the setting of CRS. If no response is seen within 3 months, a short course of oral corticosteroids can be considered. Off-label topical corticosteroids in the nasal cavity such as budesonide, may also be beneficial.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117S2isK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — early surgery candidate identification emphasizes recognizing CRS subtypes anticipated to have limited improvement from medical therapy alone and for which early surgery is expected to provide significant benefit, noting that proceeding directly to surgery avoids unnecessary delays in care and disease progression and that a required "one-size-fits-all" treatment plan before considering surgery can be harmful. CRS heterogeneity and subtype classification, disease severity, risk of disease-related complications, comorbid conditions, and patient impact influence treatment, and specific features can indicate that medical therapy will not suffice. While many CRS subtypes are initially treated medically, in judiciously selected CRS patients expediting surgical intervention can result in better short-term and long-term outcomes; surgery is generally accepted as the first-line treatment for fungal balls and AFRS, and expediting surgery may provide benefit in neo-osteogenesis, bony erosion, severe nasal polyposis and obstruction, and in the presence of risks such as orbital infection, vision change, recurrent bronchitis, and asthma exacerbations. A key rationale is the inability of medical intervention to correct sinus obstruction and/or allow egress of stimulating antigens, with medically recalcitrant obstruction arising from severe polyposis, neo-osteogenesis of sinus outflow tracts (osteitis), or semisolid secretions such as eosinophilic mucin; surgery can remove sinus drainage obstruction and/or antigenic stimulation and permit systemic and topical medical therapies to be effective by creating wide sinus openings. Data cited suggest patients who have surgery promptly have lower healthcare utilization and better short/long-term outcomes than those who delay, whereas other data have suggested patients with longer term symptoms (> 60 months) had greater mean improvement in SNOT-22 after sinus surgery despite similar baseline disease.

14.2 Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Nasal Polyps

The efficacy of XHANCE for Chronic Rhinosinusitis without Nasal Polyps (CRSsNP) was evaluated in two 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, placebo-controlled trials in 555 adults 18 years and older (Trial 3 [NCT03960580] and Trial 4 [NCT03781804]). Trial 3 included 223 patients with CRSsNP and Trial 4 included 332 patients with either CRSsNP (N = 124) or CRSwNP (N = 208). While Trial 4 included CRSwNP patients, efficacy results from Trials 3 and 4 are presented for CRSsNP patients only.

In both trials, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive XHANCE 186 mcg twice daily, XHANCE 372 mcg twice daily, or placebo, all administered nasally for 24 weeks. All patients enrolled in Trial 3 and Trial 4 had at least 2 active nasal symptoms (congestion/obstruction, discharge, facial pain or pressure, reduction or loss of smell) with a minimum nasal congestion score ≥ 1.5 out of 3 and a baseline CT scan showing ≥ 25% opacification of both ethmoid and at least 1 maxillary sinus. Refer to Table 4 for the demographic and baseline characteristics of all randomized CRSsNP patients in Trials 3 and 4.

Another patient recruited for the study had severe recalcitrant nasal polyposis with a large left frontal sinus mucocele at T0 (TENPS 8). At the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and computer tomography scan there was evidence of a mucocele protruding from the left frontal sinus to the left frontal region causing an extensive erosion of the posterior wall of the frontal sinus (Fig. 3 a–d). The patient underwent sinus surgery in addition to FESS (5 th revision) during the study, while he was on mepolizumab treatment (after T6). This patient was excluded from SNOT-22 and TENPS evaluation at T12.

### Real-life study showing uncontrolled rhinosinusitis after sinus surgery in a tertiary referral centre [^115WAg12]. Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the paranasal sinuses characterized by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either nasal blockage or nasal discharge in addition to facial pain/pressure and/or reduction of smell, lasting for at least 12 weeks 1. The latter symptoms should be supported by endoscopic findings or computed tomography (CT) scan changes 1. Within the 2012 European Position Paper on Sinusitis (EPOS) document, clinicians are provided with evidence‐based treatment algorithms for CRS. Treatment is advocated according to evidence‐based guidelines, with adaptation of treatment according to the response to treatment. Control of disease is defined as a disease state in which the symptoms are not considered bothersome anymore to the patient 1. The 2012 EPOS expert committee proposed an assessment of clinical control of CRS (Table 1), following the concept of the validated asthma control test 2. The proposed CRS control test takes into account the presence and severity of the four major sinonasal symptoms, sleep disturbance and/or fatigue, nasal endoscopic evaluation and need for oral medication. Based on the presence of none, one or more items of this list, patients are divided into those with well controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled rhinosinusitis. So far, clinical studies validating this tool are lacking. In this retrospective study, we used the proposed 2012 EPOS criteria to divide patients into the three groups of control and also compared patients with (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP).

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) fungal balls — definition and first-line management are described as follows: A fungal ball is a collection of noninvasive fungal debris that can lead to an inflammatory mucosal reaction and sinus outflow obstruction, and fungal balls are associated with mucostasis and bacterial superinfection. Trapped fungal debris is unlikely to resolve with medical treatment, and multiple international consensus guidelines recommend surgery as the initial treatment for fungal balls. Surgical treatment has remained the first-line care to remove fungal debris and open the affected sinus to facilitate mucociliary clearance and also allows for postoperative topical medical treatment.

### Frontal sinus fractures: a review on etiology and management emphasizing minimally invasive and endoscopic techniques [^1131rt6X]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In spite of a long and tortuous history of the acute management of frontal sinus fractures, current optimal management remains steeped in controversy. These fractures are frequently produced by excessive forces and are often accompanied with other injuries. However, disruption of the nasofrontal duct persists as essential to maintain proper sinus function and should guide current management. Although there has never been any distinct procedure defining optimal outcomes, proper treatment is contingent on precise diagnosis culled from a complete history, physical examination, and imaging studies. This is further augmented by the surgeon's intraoperative findings. Reconstruction will ultimately rest on the degree of disruption of the anterior and posterior sinus walls, as well as the status and function of the nasofrontal ducts. For these reasons, current management continues to be challenging and evolving. Thus, this review will discuss the etiology and clinical presentation of frontal sinus fractures, the current complications arising in the subject, and the evolution of treatment options towards a more conservative and endoscopic approach to care.

### Primary endoscopic management of the frontal sinus [^114SMmnW]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Surgical treatment of the frontal sinus continues to be an area of much interest and controversy. The complex anatomy and confined space of this region require the endoscopic surgeon to be knowledgeable and delicate to obtain a positive result. Proper instrumentation is crucial and continues to evolve over time. Postoperative endoscopic care is integral to the success of endoscopic frontal sinusotomy and the availability of proper office equipment to perform this care is critical. In most instances, the intranasal endoscopic approach can be accomplished successfully without the need for an external procedure.

A and B, CT scans of case patient 2 showing soft shadow filling of the bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinuses in the referred hospital before administration of tezepelumab in March (A); after administration of tezepelumab, improvement was seen in the soft tissue shadows of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses in October (B). C and D, CT scans of case patient 2 showing mucosal thickening within the left ethmoid sinus in the referred hospital before administration of tezepelumab in August (C); after tezepelumab therapy was started, improvement was seen in the soft tissue shadows of the ethmoid sinuses in January (D). E and E, CT scans of case patient 4 show soft tissue shadow bilateral filling of the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses in June (E); after the start of tezepelumab therapy, improvement was seen in both sinuses in January (F).

Case patient 3 was a 74-year-old male who was referred to a core hospital in August for repeated asthma attacks; he was administered prednisolone, 10 mg every day. He also had nasal congestion and nasal polyps. The patient's laboratory data included a peripheral blood eosinophil count of 39 cells/μL and IgE level of 518 IU/L. PFT indicated a %FEV₁ value of 33%, FEV₁/FVC value of 45.3%, and Flevel of 118 ppb. A CT scan exhibited mucosal thickening within the left ethmoid sinus (Fig 2, C). Inhalants of an ICS/LABA (budesonide/formoterol, 200/6 μg; 4 inhalations twice daily) and LAMA (tiotropium, 5 μg twice daily) had been administered by the previous clinic. An increase in FEV₁ value and a decrease in Flevel were seen in September (see Fig E2, B). Tezepelumab treatment was started in October because the OCS could not be tapered off. The patient's respiratory and nasal symptoms were improved, and the OCS was gradually tapered and then discontinued after 3 months. Mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinus had also improved on the patient's recent CT scan (Fig 2, D), and the patient's LMCT score was also improved, from 5 on X/8 to 3 on X+1/1.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Participants

Approval for this study was obtained from the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board before data collection began. Consecutive patients age 18 years or older who presented with a chief complaint of rhinosinusitis or nasal drainage to a participating hospital ambulatory otolaryngology clinic were eligible. Patients were included if they prospectively provided a structured sinonasal history, completed the entire SNOT-22 questionnaire, and underwent sinus CT imaging within 1 month. The structured history included an assessment of symptom duration. Exclusion criteria were the presence of nonnasal chief complaints or lack of either SNOT-22 completion or related imaging within the specified timeframe. Since studies of discriminatory ability ideally include patients with a range of symptom and disease states, symptom thresholds and endoscopy were not a requirement for entry.

Case presentation

A 19-year-old man was transferred to the emergency department at the Chonnam National University Hospital because of painful swelling of the left mandibular area due to a bicycle accident that had occurred 12 hours prior. His medical history was nonspecific except for a fatty liver. A physical examination revealed stable vital signs but he was in acute distress. Head and neck examination indicated severe tenderness and swelling over the left mandibular angle and left periorbital regions. A CT scan and clinical examination showed that the patient had sustained a left mandibular angle fracture and left infraorbital wall fracture, requiring surgical intervention. Open reduction of the mandibular angle fracture was planned at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; the surgery was planned to include general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for the surgical procedure. The results of pre-anesthesia evaluation, including routine investigations (e.g. chest X-ray, electrocardiography, and blood chemistry), were within normal limits. The patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II. He had no unusual findings on upper airway examination; however, he exhibited restricted mouth opening, presumably due to pain. The nasal septum deviated slightly to the right; mucosal edema on both sides of the nasal cavity was evident on preoperative facial CT (Fig. 1 a). At the preoperative visit, the patient reported easier breathing through the right side of his nose on the nasal obstruction test.

### Radiologic imaging in the management of sinusitis… [^114nNkJ9]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Advances in diagnostic imaging techniques have enhanced the understanding and management of sinusitis. Diagnostic imaging is generally used in cases of recurrent or complicated sinus disease. Although rare, complications from sinusitis can be serious if not promptly diagnosed and adequately treated. A coronal CT image is the preferred initial procedure. Bone window views provide excellent resolution and a good definition of the complete osteomeatal complex and other anatomic details that play a role in sinusitis. MRI MRI allows better differentiation of soft tissue structures within the sinuses. It is used occasionally in cases of suspected tumors or fungal sinusitis. 17–19 Otherwise, MRI has no advantages over CT scanning in the evaluation of sinusitis. Disadvantages of MRI include high false-positive findings, poor bony imaging, and higher cost.

MRI scans take considerably longer to accomplish than CT scans and may be difficult to obtain in patients who are claustrophobic. revealed bilateral pansinusitis with evidence of polyposis. He also had a large air cell within the left middle turbinate, which likely contributed to obstruction of ostia draining adjacent sinuses. The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery with improvement of his symptoms. He had left maxillary and frontal tenderness to palpation on examination. His ears were clear by otoscopy, and his nasal examination revealed a right-sided septal deviation. Because of the progression of his headaches, a maxillofacial and head CT scan was obtained, revealing acute sinusitis with frontal epidural abscess. He was started on intravenous antibiotics and underwent external frontal sinusotomy to decompress the adjacent infected frontal sinus.

After a prolonged course of antibiotics, serial CT scans revealed resolution of the frontal abscess and sinusitis. He subsequently underwent a successful frontal sinus obliteration to prevent future episodes of frontal sinusitis. CT scan showed a large neoplasm of the right paranasal sinuses with bony erosion of inferior and medial orbit. For better definition of the neoplasm, an MRI scan was obtained. The MRI showed extension of the neoplasm into the medial anterior maxilla and septum. An intranasal biopsy revealed an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses. He underwent transfacial and endoscopic resection of the mass with postoperative radiation therapy.

### Paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^114aF4KN]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment Option Overview for Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer Except for patients with T1 mucosal carcinomas, the accepted method of treatment is a combination of radiation therapy and surgery. The incidence of lymph node metastases is generally low. Thus, routine radical neck dissection or elective neck radiation therapy is recommended only for patients presenting with positive nodes. Surgery Surgical exploration may be required to determine operability. Relative contraindications to surgery include destruction of the base of the skull, cavernous sinus, or the pterygoid process; infiltration of the mucous membranes of the nasopharynx; or nonresectable lymph node metastases. Surgical approaches include fenestration with removal of the bulk tumor, which is usually followed by radiation therapy or block resection of the upper jaw.

Treatment of Stage I Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer Stage I disease includes small lesions. Maxillary Sinus Tumors Maxillary sinus tumors are small lesions of the infrastructure. Treatment options for stage I maxillary sinus tumors include the following:

- Surgical resection.
- Postoperative radiation therapy should be considered for close margins. Ethmoid Sinus Tumors Ethmoid sinus tumors are usually extensive when diagnosed. Treatment options for stage I ethmoid sinus tumors include the following:

- External-beam radiation therapy alone is generally used for unresectable lesions.
- Well-localized lesions can be resected, but resection of the ethmoids, maxilla, and orbit, with consideration for a craniofacial approach, is generally required.
- If surgery can be done with good functional and cosmetic results, postoperative radiation therapy should be given even with clear surgical margins.

Ethmoid Sinus Tumors Ethmoid sinus tumors are usually extensive when diagnosed. Treatment options for stage II ethmoid sinus tumors include the following:

- External-beam radiation therapy alone is generally used and produces better overall results than surgery.
- Well-localized lesions can be resected, but resection of the ethmoids, maxilla, and orbit, often with a combined neurosurgical sinus craniofacial approach, is generally required.
- If surgery can be done with good functional and cosmetic results, postoperative radiation therapy should be given, even when surgical margins are clear.

### Imaging… [^116KckgS]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The sinuses are lined with mucoperiosteum, which is thinner and less richly supplied with blood vessels and glands than the mucosa of the nasal cavity. Cilia sweep mucus toward the ostia. The ostia of the frontal, maxillary and anterior ethmoid sinuses open into the osteomeatal complex, which lies in the middle meatus lateral to the middle turbinate. Imaging Imaging studies are not cost effective in the initial assessment and treatment of patients with clinical findings suggestive of acute sinusitis. Radiographs, however, may be helpful in uncertain or recurrent cases. A normal sinus x-ray series has a negative predictive value of 90 to 100 percent, particularly for the frontal and maxillary sinuses. The positive predictive value of x-rays using opacification and air-fluid levels as end points is 80 to 100 percent, but the sensitivity is low since only 60 percent of patients with acute sinusitis have opacification or air-fluid levels.

44 of adult male patients in a general medicine Veterans Affairs clinic with sinus symptoms and radiographic evidence of maxillary sinusitis compared the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole twice daily for three days and 10 days. By 14 days, 77 percent of the three-day group and 76 percent of the 10-day treatment group rated their symptoms as cured or much improved, suggesting that shorter courses of therapy than the traditional 10- to 14-day course may be effective. However, some have argued against the validity of this study, so standard therapy is preferred until further data are available. Treatment Failure and Complications Despite the use of antibiotics and selected adjunctive therapy, 10 to 25 percent of primary care patients continue to have symptoms.

The office re-evaluation of these patients, two to three weeks after the first visit, should include a careful history and physical examination, and a single Waters view of the sinuses should be taken to confirm the diagnosis. Empiric therapy may include a two-week course of a second-line antibiotic. Antibiotics appear to be of little benefit in the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Recurrent or chronic sinusitis often requires otolaryngology consultation. CT imaging of the osteomeatal complex followed by functional endoscopic sinus surgery often successfully restores the physiology of sinus aeration and drainage. Between 80 and 90 percent of FESS patients experience significant improvement of symptoms.
