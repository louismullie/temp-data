## Question

Do biologic therapies for psoriatic arthritis show different efficacy for skin versus joint symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether biologic therapies for psoriatic arthritis show different efficacy for skin versus joint symptoms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic basis that could plausibly create different responses in skin versus synovium. Then, I should verify whether randomized trial data and meta-analyses actually demonstrate such differential efficacy by drug class. Next, I need to check how major guidelines operationalize these differences in their domain-based recommendations. After that, I will examine quantification of effect-size gaps and placebo effects to avoid overinterpreting nominal differences. Finally, I should consider real-world implications, switching strategies, and caveats like IBD risk with IL-17 blockade and possible discordant responses requiring dual strategies or a change of mechanism of action.

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. The IL-23/IL-17 axis is disproportionately upregulated in psoriatic skin relative to PsA synovium, whereas synovium shows a relatively stronger IL-6 signature and engages overlapping but not identical inflammatory circuits, suggesting that agents targeting IL-17/23 may clear skin more profoundly than joints, while TNF and other pathways may be more central in synovial inflammation [^113Dh2aR] [^1154KGNC] [^113mkSSn].

> Next, I will examine IL-17 pathway inhibitors. Wait, I should verify both skin and joint outcomes. Trials like SPIRIT-P1 with ixekizumab and long-term bimekizumab studies show robust ACR responses and structural benefits in PsA, yet skin clearance rates (PASI 90/100) often exceed joint response magnitudes, indicating relatively greater cutaneous than articular effect size under the same mechanism of action, consistent with the biology noted above [^1162Jte8] [^111v2vEe] [^114GkQt8].

> I will now consider IL-23 pathway inhibitors. Hold on, let me check the balance between skin and joint responses. High-quality psoriasis efficacy is consistent in PsA populations, but musculoskeletal responses are generally more modest than skin responses, leading guidelines and evidence reviews to position IL-23 inhibitors as outstanding for cutaneous disease but not necessarily superior for peripheral arthritis control compared with TNF or IL-17 inhibitors in many patients, reinforcing a domain-tailored approach [^111htnyr] [^113mkSSn] [^114hvywP].

> Now, I should review TNF inhibitors as a reference class. I need to ensure the data support a more "balanced" profile. Cochrane and multiple RCTs consistently show TNFi improve joint outcomes (ACR responses, minimal disease activity, radiographic progression) with clinically meaningful skin benefits, often yielding a more even joint–skin efficacy profile than IL-23 agents and sometimes than IL-17 agents for joints, which is why TNFi remain a frequent first biologic when peripheral arthritis predominates [^114U7Jkd] [^114hvywP] [^116xzPf5].

> Next, I should review whether guidelines explicitly reflect this differential efficacy. EULAR emphasizes choosing IL-17A, IL-17A/F, IL-23, or IL-12/23 inhibitors when clinically relevant skin involvement is present, whereas for peripheral arthritis after csDMARD failure, biologic DMARDs such as TNFi are typically initiated, with switching across mechanisms if responses are inadequate, which operationalizes domain-specific selection and acknowledges discordant responses across domains [^116Egi2u] [^114hvywP] [^116LW7xw].

> Hold on, I should verify the broader consensus. GRAPPA's domain-focused schema and BSR's recommendations similarly direct therapy selection by dominant domains (skin, peripheral joints, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis), comorbidities, and safety, again implying that a single agent may not optimally control all domains in every patient and that mechanism switching is appropriate when discordance persists [^116LW7xw] [^116pXqdn] [^117Rj4ra].

> I need to quantify the magnitude of difference rather than rely on impressions. Meta-analytic work and platform trials indicate that while skin endpoints with IL-17/23 agents often reach very high response thresholds, joint endpoints like ACR20/50 lag behind those skin rates; moreover, rising placebo responses in PsA RCTs mandate attention to placebo-adjusted effects to avoid overstating differences, with pooled placebo ACR20 near 20% over two decades and active–placebo risk differences around 27% on average, supporting a real but nuanced efficacy gap between domains [^114GkQt8] [^112VgXJq] [^111htnyr].

> Wait, let me verify a potential misattribution in my earlier thinking. I initially thought a Cochrane TNFi review stated that IL-17 inhibitors yield dramatic skin responses but little to no joint response; that's not correct, because the Cochrane analysis focuses on TNFi and does not draw that conclusion about IL-17 agents. I should correct that: IL-17 inhibitors have proven joint efficacy in PsA, as demonstrated in SPIRIT-P1 and other trials, even though their skin responses are often numerically higher than joint responses, which is a different point altogether [^114U7Jkd] [^1162Jte8].

> Next, I should review real-world and pragmatic implications. Registries show meaningful TNFi effectiveness with a proportion discontinuing for ineffectiveness or adverse events, and case reports and series document patients requiring dual or sequential biologic strategies when skin–joint discordance persists, while observational dermatology cohorts suggest PsA patients on biologics may face somewhat higher infection risk than psoriasis-only patients, underscoring the need to balance domain control and safety [^112HgbY2] [^116gkYNd] [^116uDsWD].

> I need to ensure the switching and sequencing logic aligns with guidance. When responses are inadequate after a reasonable trial, guidelines recommend switching to another biologic or JAK inhibitor, often across mechanisms rather than within-class if the non-dominant domain is driving failure, and considering PDE4 inhibitors for milder disease or when biologics and JAK inhibitors are unsuitable, which matches a practical approach to discordant domain control [^113VbGVe] [^114BF52N] [^117Hf5a2].

> But wait, what about special caveats. IL-17 inhibitors warrant caution in patients with IBD, where flares can occur, so BSR advises avoiding secukinumab or ixekizumab in active Crohn's disease and proceeding with gastroenterology input in controlled disease; conversely, while ustekinumab and IL-23 inhibitors can excel in skin, some mechanistic and translational data suggest less robust joint effects and occasional discordant arthritis activity despite skin control, guiding agent selection when joints are the priority [^115MPajy] [^1168Nc31] [^113Dh2aR].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the bottom line. Yes, biologic therapies in PsA show clinically meaningful, mechanistically plausible differential efficacy between skin and joint manifestations: IL-17/23 agents often achieve superior cutaneous clearance relative to joint responses, whereas TNF inhibitors typically offer a more balanced joint–skin profile, and guidelines endorse domain-prioritized selection with readiness to switch mechanisms if discordance persists, aligning evidence, biology, and practice recommendations [^116xzPf5] [^116Egi2u] [^116LW7xw].

---

Yes, responses to biologic therapy in psoriatic arthritis differ between skin and joint disease: **IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors are superior for skin**, whereas **TNF inhibitors are preferred for joints**. IL-17/IL-23 agents achieve **higher PASI responses** but may be less effective for joint symptoms, while TNF inhibitors offer more balanced joint and skin control. IL-12/23 inhibitors are less effective for joints, and JAK inhibitors are typically reserved for refractory cases. Treatment should be **individualized by domain activity**, comorbidities, and patient preference, with **switching or combination strategies** considered for discordant responses [^116Egi2u] [^114hvywP] [^113VbGVe] [^114BF52N].

## Differential efficacy of biologic classes

| **Class** | **Joint efficacy** | **Skin efficacy** | **Axial disease** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) | TNFi (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab, golimumab) are highly effective for peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, with robust ACR20/50/70 and radiographic inhibition [^1123yynN] [^114U7Jkd] | Improve psoriasis, but IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors achieve higher PASI75/90/100 [^113mkSSn] [^111htnyr] | Effective for axial PsA and are first-line for predominant axial involvement [^115bCx3C] |
| Interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) | Improve peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, but joint responses may be slightly lower than TNFi [^113mkSSn] | Provide rapid, high PASI responses, often superior to TNFi [^113mkSSn] [^111htnyr] | Effective for axial PsA and are recommended for predominant axial involvement [^115bCx3C] |
| Interleukin-23 inhibitors (IL-23i) | Improve peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, but joint responses may be lower than TNFi and IL-17i [^113mkSSn] | Achieve high PASI responses, often exceeding TNFi [^111htnyr] | Limited efficacy in axial PsA; not recommended for predominant axial disease |
| Interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i) | Ustekinumab is less effective for joints than TNFi and IL-17i [^113mkSSn] | Ustekinumab improves psoriasis but is less effective than IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors [^113mkSSn] | Limited efficacy; not recommended for predominant axial disease |
| Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) | JAKi (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) improve peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, and are options after inadequate response to biologics [^114BF52N] | Improve psoriasis but are generally less effective than IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors [^111htnyr] | Limited data; not first-line for axial PsA |

## Clinical evidence of differential responses

Clinical trials and real-world studies demonstrate **discordant responses** between skin and joints:

- **Etanercept**: PRESTA showed higher skin responses with 50 mg twice weekly vs once weekly, but similar joint responses [^1139x6yV].

- **IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors**: Superior skin efficacy but potentially lower joint efficacy than TNFi [^113mkSSn] [^111htnyr].

- **IL-12/23 inhibitors**: Less effective for joints than TNFi and IL-17i [^113mkSSn].

---

## Factors influencing differential responses

Several factors underlie these **differential responses**:

- **Disease phenotype**: Peripheral vs axial disease influences biologic choice and response [^1123yynN] [^115bCx3C].

- **Comorbidities**: IBD, uveitis, and cardiovascular disease affect selection and response [^114Erb5q].

- **Patient characteristics**: Age, sex, and disease duration impact response [^111ntWd9].

- **Genetic and molecular differences**: Distinct skin vs synovial pathways contribute to variability [^113Dh2aR].

---

## Clinical implications and treatment strategies

Given these differences, **individualized treatment** is essential:

- **Domain-driven therapy**: Select biologics by predominant domain (skin, peripheral, axial) [^1123yynN] [^115bCx3C].

- **Switching strategies**: Switch within or between classes for inadequate response [^113VbGVe].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider dual biologics or biologic plus csDMARD for refractory, discordant disease [^116gkYNd].

- **Treat-to-target**: Aim for remission or low disease activity with regular assessment and adjustment [^1119bSpp].

## Summary of biologic efficacy by disease domain

| **Biologic class** | **Peripheral arthritis** | **Axial disease** | **Skin disease** |
|-|-|-|-|
| TNF inhibitors | High efficacy | High efficacy | Moderate-high efficacy |
| IL-17 inhibitors | Moderate-high efficacy | High efficacy | High efficacy |
| IL-23 inhibitors | Moderate efficacy | Limited efficacy | High efficacy |
| IL-12/23 inhibitors | Moderate efficacy | Limited efficacy | Moderate-high efficacy |
| JAK inhibitors | Moderate-high efficacy | Limited data | Moderate efficacy |

---

Responses to biologics in PsA **vary by domain**, with IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors superior for skin and TNF inhibitors preferred for joints. Individualized, **domain-driven therapy**, with timely switching or combination strategies, is key to optimizing outcomes.

We will follow the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Chapters 14 and 15, for interpreting results. It is crucial to distinguish a lack of evidence of effect from a lack of effect. Our conclusions will be based solely on findings from the quantitative or narrative synthesis of included studies for this review. We will refrain from making practice recommendations; instead, our implications for research will suggest priorities for future research and outline the remaining uncertainties in the area.

We will create two "Summary of Findings" tables:

- **Dose reduction of biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs compared with continuation**: This table will compare the outcomes of dose reduction versus continuation.
- **Discontinuation of biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs compared with continuation**: This table will assess the effects of discontinuation versus continuation.

The summary tables will include the following outcomes:

- Proportion of participants with remission
- Proportion of participants with flare or relapse
- Proportion of participants with low disease activity
- Proportion of participants with radiographic progression
- Mean disease activity score
- Proportion of participant withdrawals due to adverse events
- Proportion of participants with serious adverse events

Two review authors will independently assess the certainty of the evidence, resolving any disagreements through discussion or by involving another review author. We will employ the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, impre…

### Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for psoriatic arthritis [^114U7Jkd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic arthritis affecting people with psoriasis. If untreated, it may lead to disability. Recommended drugs include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are the first choice of bDMARDs.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of TNFi in adults with psoriatic arthritis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization trials portal up to 28 March 2024.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with PsA, comparing TNFi to placebo, physiotherapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and cs/b/tsDMARDs. Major outcomes included clinical improvement, minimal disease activity, physical function, health-related quality of life, radiographic progression, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. The primary comparison was TNFi versus placebo. The primary time point was 12 weeks for clinical improvement, 24 weeks for minimal disease activity, function, quality of life, and radiographic progression, and the end of the trial period for serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Main results**: We included 25 RCTs randomizing 7857 participants. Four studies compared TNFi to methotrexate and one to ustekinumab in DMARD-naïve participants.

### Enhancing current guidance for psoriatic arthritis and its comorbidities: Recommendations from an expert consensus panel [^115pF41C]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

The recommendations within the "Disease Assessment" theme aim to achieve two key objectives: to highlight the need for individualized assessments addressing factors affecting the individual most significantly, and to provide practical guidance for assessing PsA in the clinic.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has a notably broad impact on quality of life, greater than psoriasis (PsO) alone, due to associated symptoms of pain and fatigue, among others, leading to impairments in functional ability and ability to work. This impact may not only be linked to PsA symptoms but also to comorbid conditions, including mental health conditions, which need to be identified and managed as early as possible. Extra-articular manifestations, as previously mentioned, can provide important diagnostic indicators, but are also important to assess ongoing due to their impact on the burden of disease and as a factor in driving therapy selection.

Evidence from the TLR suggested that sex is closely linked with the disease course in PsA, resulting in distinct clinical presentations in men and women. Women reported worse quality of life associated with higher levels of disability, fatigue, pain, and overall disease severity, as well as a lower likelihood of achieving remission. Men with PsA experienced less overall functional impairment but a higher impact on their self-esteem.

Given the variability in patients' experience of PsA, it is recommended that the Psoriatic Arthritis Impact of Disease (PsAID-12) questionnaire be used at every consultation. PsAID-12 covers all key domains and can be administered efficiently.

### Safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis: Three-year results from a phase IIb randomized controlled trial and its open-label extension study [^111v2vEe]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by varied musculoskeletal and dermatological manifestations, including joint inflammation, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin disease. Given the substantial and enduring impact of psoriatic disease on patients, it is crucial to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of treatments. In recent years, the interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine superfamily has emerged as a target of new monoclonal antibody therapies for a range of inflammatory diseases. Currently approved therapies for PsA that target IL-17 cytokines include secukinumab and ixekizumab, both of which inhibit IL-17A, one of the six isoforms of IL-17. The safety of IL-17A inhibitor treatment has been reported up to five years in patients with PsA.

Bimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits IL-17F in addition to IL-17A. Previous studies have shown that the dual neutralization of IL-17A and IL-17F results in rapid clinical improvements in patients with PsA (phase IIb) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (phase IIb), sustained up to 48 weeks, and plaque psoriasis (phase III), sustained up to 56 weeks. Given that PsA is a chronic disease with the potential for lasting complications, including irreversible joint damage, an increased risk of comorbidities, impaired quality of life, and substantial psychosocial burden, it is important to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of treatments in this patient population. While studies have examined the safety and efficacy of IL-17A inhibitors in PsA patients.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: Section 2. Psoriatic arthritis: overview and guidelines of care for treatment with an emphasis on the biologics [^1158jytV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In this second of five sections of the guidelines of care for psoriasis, we provide an overview of psoriatic arthritis, including its cardinal clinical features, pathogenesis, prognosis, classification, assessment tools used to evaluate psoriatic arthritis, and the approach to treatment.

Although patients with mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or intra-articular steroid injections, the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, particularly methotrexate, along with biological agents are considered the standard of care for patients with more significant psoriatic arthritis. We discuss the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biological therapies in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis.

### Apremilast monotherapy in DMARD-naive psoriatic arthritis patients: results of the randomized, placebo-controlled PALACE 4 trial [^111HPMZT]. Rheumatology (2018). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) often involves the skin and joints, leading to a poor quality of life and sometimes joint damage. Treatment recommendations emphasize addressing the spectrum of PsA clinical manifestations and associated comorbidities while minimizing complications associated with untreated disease or therapy. Although numerous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate (MTX), and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) are available, efficacy varies among agents. Many are associated with safety issues and limitations that can impact a patient's comfort level when initiating or continuing therapy. The importance of effective, earlier PsA treatment was highlighted in the Tight Control in Psoriatic Arthritis study, which demonstrated the benefits associated with tight control of early PsA.

The fourth Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy (PALACE 4) study, in the phase III clinical trial program, is evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of apremilast — an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor — in patients with active PsA. PALACE 1, 2, and 3 evaluated apremilast in patients with active PsA who were considered inadequate responders to csDMARDs or bDMARDs, with benefits observed up to 156 weeks. PALACE 4 assessed apremilast use earlier in the treatment algorithm in patients with active PsA who were csDMARD naive and biologic naive. This report describes the results of the first 52 weeks of PALACE 4.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^1162xxSp]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

The limitations of clinical assessment in PsA have led to EULAR recommending the use of MRI and US for diagnosis, activity monitoring, and structural change evaluation in peripheral SpA. Traditional plain radiographs still form an important baseline test in clinical assessment. We know that erosive changes on X-ray will be seen after two years of disease. Other changes include joint space narrowing, periosteal new bone formation, osteolysis, and ankyloses.

- **Imaging features predictive of treatment response**: In the spine, generic SpA changes are seen in PsA, but by the time these appear on plain film, the disease has usually advanced. Chronic damage at the entheses is also visible with plain films.

### The pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis [^1154KGNC]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory arthropathy that presents with inflammation of the joints and entheses, including those of the axial skeleton, and is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical phenotype because of the diversity of the associated features, which can include skin and nail disease, dactylitis, uveitis, and osteitis.

Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis has led to the development of effective biologics and small-molecule drugs targeting specific cytokines and signaling pathways, which can prevent disease progression and improve quality of life. However, at least 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis have only a partial response or fail to respond to such treatments.

- **Cytokine inhibitors**: Mainly those specific for tumor necrosis factor and, more recently, the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway, have been highly successful in the treatment of disease manifestations in several different tissues. However, targeting the interleukin 23-T-helper-17 cell pathway might be more effective in psoriasis than in arthritis.

The precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis — which include genetics, environmental factors, and immune-mediated inflammation — are complex, and the relationship between the disease of the joint and that of other domains is poorly understood. Improving our understanding of psoriatic arthritis pathogenesis could help to establish validated biomarkers for diagnosis and predict therapeutic response.

Regarding medical management for psoriatic arthritis, specifically with respect to biologic DMARDs and peripheral arthritis, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend the following considerations when initiating biologic DMARDs:

- **TNF inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, or upadacitinib**: Consider these options ahead of IL-12/23 inhibitors.
- **IL-12/23 inhibitors**: Consider these ahead of IL-23 inhibitors.
- **IL-23 inhibitors**: Consider these ahead of PDE4 inhibitors.
- **PDE4 inhibitors**: Consider these ahead of CTLA-4 immunoglobulin.

### Group for research and assessment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (GRAPPA): Updated treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis 2021 [^116LW7xw]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Since the second version of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations was published in 2015, therapeutic options for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have advanced considerably. This work reviews the literature since the previous recommendations (data published 2013–2020, including conference presentations between 2017 and 2020) and reports high-quality, evidence-based, domain-focused recommendations for medication selection in PsA developed by GRAPPA clinicians and patient research partners.

The overarching principles for the management of adults with PsA were updated by consensus. Principles considering biosimilars and tapering of therapy were added, and the research agenda was revised. Literature searches covered treatments for the key domains of PsA: peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail psoriasis. Additional searches were performed for PsA-related conditions (uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease) and comorbidities.

Individual subcommittees used a GRADE-informed approach, taking into account the quality of evidence for therapies, to generate recommendations for each of these domains, which were incorporated into an overall schema. The choice of therapy for an individual should ideally address all disease domains active in that patient, supporting shared decision-making. As safety issues often affect potential therapeutic choices, additional consideration was given to relevant comorbidities.

These GRAPPA treatment recommendations provide up-to-date, evidence-based guidance.

### A cross-sectional questionnaire survey involving physicians for the clarification of the diagnosis and current status of therapeutic intervention of psoriatic arthritis in Japan [^112u6kBL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is characterized by various clinical symptoms, including skin psoriasis, peripheral arthritis in the distal interphalangeal joints, and joint symptoms of axillary arthritis similar to sacroiliac arthritis. Additionally, nail psoriasis, enthesitis, and dactylitis are observed in approximately 60%, 30%, and 25% of patients, respectively. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of PsA are important and should be based on a comprehensive assessment that includes a physical examination, a visual examination of the skin and nails, an interview, a blood test, and an imaging test.

The prevalence of PsA in Japan has increased in recent years due to the westernization of dietary habits, widespread public awareness of the disease, and improvements in diagnostic methods. PsA in Japan accounts for 1.9%, 14.3%, and 15.3% of all psoriasis cases according to the health insurance claims database of the Japan Medical Data Center, a report from rheumatologists, and a report from dermatologists, respectively.

However, PsA has a wide range of clinical symptoms, making its diagnosis difficult. Dermatologists often examine skin psoriasis owing to their expertise, whereas patients with joint symptoms are more likely to consult orthopedists and/or rheumatologists. The stance on PsA screening might differ between dermatology clinics and hospitals depending on the circumstances of the facilities. Therefore, collaboration among different clinical departments becomes important. Since cutaneous lesions appear before other symptoms in most patients with PsA, dermatologists play a crucial role in early detection and referral.

Regarding the medical management of psoriatic arthritis, particularly concerning treatment goals, the BSR 2022 guidelines recommend aiming for remission or alternatively low disease activity. This should be achieved through a treat-to-target strategy, considering the patient's goals, associated conditions and comorbidities, as well as non-inflammatory causes of pain.

### Dose reduction and discontinuation of biologic and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for people with psoriatic arthritis in remission or low disease activity [^115gNNLV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory joint disease that occurs in people with psoriasis, although less frequently, the arthritis may predate the onset of skin manifestations. In the general population, the reported incidence of psoriatic arthritis varies. One systematic review reported a worldwide incidence ranging from 3 to 41.3 per 100,000 per year across nine countries. In people with psoriasis, the incidence of psoriatic arthritis is between 270 and 2700 per 100,000 per year. Worldwide prevalence of psoriatic arthritis varies between 0.01% and 0.19%. In people with psoriasis, estimates of prevalence range from 6% to 42%. Psoriatic arthritis is more prevalent among people living in Europe than in Middle-Eastern or East-Asian populations and is most prevalent in people aged 50 to 70 years. It affects males and females equally.

Five distinct patterns of psoriatic arthritis have been described: predominant distal interphalangeal joint involvement, arthritis mutilans, symmetrical polyarthritis, asymmetrical oligoarthritis, and spondyloarthritis. Among these, polyarthritis and oligoarthritis are the most common. Overlap of spondyloarthritis and peripheral joint disease occurs in 20% to 40% of people. Periarticular structures may also be involved, leading to enthesitis, tenosynovitis, dactylitis, and fingernail dystrophy.

Joint erosions are reported in approximately 40% to 57% of people with psoriatic arthritis, out of which approximately 17% develop severe joint destruction and deformity. Clinical diagnosis is aided by the classification systems and diagnostic criteria available for psoriatic arthritis, which help distinguish it from other similar rheumatic conditions.

### Psoriatic arthritis: A comprehensive review for the dermatologist part I: Epidemiology, comorbidities, pathogenesis, and diagnosis [^114f7ARc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory seronegative arthritis strongly associated with psoriasis. Recognition of the clinical features of PsA is critical, as delayed detection and untreated disease may result in irreparable joint damage, impaired physical function, and a significantly reduced quality of life. Dermatologists are poised for the early detection of PsA, as psoriasis predates its development in as many as 80% of patients. In an effort to further acquaint dermatologists with PsA, this review provides a detailed overview, emphasizing its epidemiology, comorbidities, etiopathogenesis, and diagnostic features.

We will assess the robustness of the treatment effect on both the proportion of participants with remission and the proportion of participants with flare or relapse due to potential selection bias and potential detection bias by performing the following sensitivity analyses.

- **Selection bias**: We will remove the trials that report inadequate or unclear allocation concealment from the meta-analysis to see if this changes the overall treatment effect.

- **Detection bias**: We will remove the trials that report inadequate or unclear participant blinding from the meta-analysis to see if this changes the overall treatment effect.

In addition, if we have to impute any missing data, we will assess the impact in sensitivity analyses.

### Outcome measures in psoriatic arthritis [^113JCyRi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Recent advances in biologic therapies have provided hope for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, studies have been hampered by the lack of acceptable and validated outcome measures. This article reviews outcome measures used in the assessment of both skin and joints in PsA and provides a summary of the Psoriatic Arthritis Workshop during OMERACT 7. A set of domains to be included in the assessment of patients with PsA was derived, and a research agenda was developed.

### Placebo response in psoriatic arthritis clinical trials: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VgXJq]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

To determine the placebo response rate in PsA randomized clinical trials (RCTs), its contributing factors, and its impact on the effect size of active treatments, we conducted a comprehensive study. We searched multiple databases, from inception to 20 December 2020, for placebo-controlled RCTs in PsA. We employed a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the response rates for the ACR20 criteria in the placebo arm, determined the risk difference for treatment versus placebo, and used meta-regression to determine the factors associated with placebo response rates. The risk of bias was assessed in duplicate, and the study protocol was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42021226000.

We included 42 RCTs, comprising 5050 patients receiving placebo, published between 2000 and 2020. The risk of bias was low in 28 trials, high in four, with some concerns in 10. The pooled placebo response rate was 20.3% (95% CI: 18.6%, 22.1%; predicted intervals, 11.7–29.0%), with significant between-trial heterogeneity (I² = 56.8%, P < 0.005). The pooled risk difference for treatment versus placebo was 27% (95% CI: 24%, 31%). In the multivariable meta-regression, there was a 15% (95% CI: 2.9%, 29.8%) increase in the odds of achieving the placebo response for each 5-year increment in publication year (P = 0.016). Additionally, the active treatment risk difference decreased for every 5-year increment in publication year (β = -0.053, 95% CI: -0.099, -0.007; P = 0.024) but was not associated with the placebo response.

Despite increasing over time, the placebo response for ACR20 in PsA RCTs was not associated with the active treatment effect.

### Effect of psoriatic arthritis on treatment response in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis [^116uDsWD]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Among patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the efficacy and tolerability of available treatments based on psoriatic arthritis (PsA) history are not well described. We evaluated disease characteristics and variations in treatment response in the moderate-to-severe psoriasis population based on PsA history.

The simple measure for assessing psoriasis activity (S-MAPA) was used to retrospectively analyze treatment responses. A total of 191 moderate-to-severe psoriatic patients, 58 with and 133 without rheumatologist-diagnosed PsA, were analyzed. Regardless of PsA history, S-MAPA improvement was similar with biologic monotherapy (46.2 versus 44.1; P = 0.74), traditional systemic monotherapy (62.29 versus 38.12; P = 0.22), and combination treatments (64.62 versus 52.71; P = 0.40) after 12 weeks. PsA patients on biologic monotherapy experienced a higher infection rate than patients without PsA (0.57% versus 0.19%; P = 0.01). PsA patients also experienced more adverse events (AEs) associated with traditional systemic monotherapy than with biologic monotherapy (3.25 versus 1.04; P = 0.001).

The relatively small PsA cohort was the primary limitation. Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis responded similarly to all treatments, independent of PsA history. PsA patients received more overall treatments and more biologic monotherapy prescriptions. PsA patients had a greater infection risk on biologic monotherapy compared to those without PsA and a greater risk of adverse events on traditional systemic monotherapy.

### Advances in the management of psoriatic arthritis in adults [^116xzPf5]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis that affects approximately 30% of patients with psoriasis. The disease spectrum includes peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, tenosynovitis, dactylitis, axial involvement, and skin and nail psoriasis in most patients. In addition to the cutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations, several comorbidities can complicate the disease course, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, gout, anxiety, and depression.

The management of patients with psoriatic arthritis begins with a careful assessment of the skin and joints, along with screening for comorbidities. This review describes the assessment tools and outcome measures used in the evaluation of patients with psoriatic arthritis and summarizes the approach to therapy. Non-medicinal interventions, such as education, lifestyle changes, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy, are integral parts of management.

The evidence on pharmacologic treatments is discussed, including drugs used for symptomatic relief such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and those used to control the disease process. This last group comprises conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like methotrexate, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine. Additionally, biologic and targeted DMARDs, including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), anti-interleukin-17 (IL-17), anti-IL-12/23, and anti-IL-23 agents, as well as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) antagonists, are discussed. Although these drugs are usually tailored to the clinical profile of the patient, biomarkers predictive of response to therapy are also considered.

### Sex differences in the effectiveness of first-line tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in psoriatic arthritis: Results from the European Spondyloarthritis Research Collaboration Network [^111ntWd9]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Women with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) may have reduced tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) effectiveness compared to men. We examined sex differences in treatment response and retention rates during 24 months of follow-up among patients with PsA initiating their first TNFi.

Data from patients with PsA across 13 European Spondyloarthritis Research Collaboration Network registries starting their first TNFi were pooled. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between sex and treatment response using low disease activity (LDA) according to the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) (< 3.2) at six months as the primary outcome. Analyses were adjusted for age, country, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment, and TNFi start year. Retention rates were explored using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.

We analyzed the treatment response of 7,679 patients with PsA (50% women) with available data on LDA at six months. At baseline, women and men had similar characteristics, including mean DAS28-CRP (women vs. men, 4.4 [SD 1.2] vs. 4.2 [SD 1.2]), though patient-reported outcome measures were worse in women. At six months, 64% of women and 78% of men had LDA (relative risk [RR] 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.84). This difference was similar after adjustment (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.81–0.85). TNFi retention rates were evaluated in 17,842 patients with PsA. Women had significantly lower retention rates than men at all time points (women 79%, 64%, and 50% vs. men 88%, 77%, and…).

### Risks and benefits of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in the management of psoriatic arthritis: Systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials [^117QT2gx]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors in the management of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), we conducted a systematic review. We searched electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab used in patients with PsA. A random effects metaanalysis was undertaken to produce pooled estimates of the relative risk, risk difference, or the weighted mean difference for efficacy and safety outcomes using Stata version 9.0.

Six RCTs met the inclusion criteria, incorporating a total of 982 patients. All three TNF-alpha inhibitors were significantly more effective than placebo according to the Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) and American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 ratings). There were no significant differences between TNF-alpha inhibitors and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing withdrawal for any reason (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.20–1.18), withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.73–6.27), serious adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55–1.77), or upper respiratory tract infections (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65–1.28).

Pooled rates for injection site reactions were significantly higher for adalimumab and etanercept compared to placebo (RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.16–5.29). However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients experiencing infusion reactions with infliximab when compared to placebo (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.48–2.20). Indirect analysis did not demonstrate any significant differences between the TNF-alpha inhibitors.

### Sequencing of targeted therapy in psoriasis: Does it matter [^112udXG2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

With the continued development of biologics for the treatment of psoriasis, some patients have achieved optimal control. However, a recommended biologic sequence is still lacking when a biologic fails to initially improve the skin, termed primary nonresponse, or loses efficacy after initial improvement, termed secondary nonresponse. Primary and secondary nonresponse can occur with any class of biologics, and the type of nonresponse can drive the choice of whether to switch within a biologic class or to a different biologic class.

The choice of biologic can also be challenging when managing psoriasis and concomitant psoriatic arthritis, as treatment differs based on the severity of both diseases and further classification of axial and peripheral joint involvement. When choosing a biologic, each patient's comorbidities and preferences are also taken into account to provide the optimal therapy.

In light of the lack of an established biologic sequence after biologic failure, the objective of our review is to define a therapy sequence for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor classes in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Our proposed biologic sequence was derived through an analysis of the efficacy of each biologic class, primary and secondary nonresponse rates from clinical trials, and clinical experience with expert opinion.

### Comparative genomic profiling of synovium versus skin lesions in psoriatic arthritis [^113Dh2aR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Our findings indicate that treating both skin lesions and arthritis with the same modalities may show different patterns of efficacy between the skin and the joint. Although TNF antagonists are somewhat effective treatments for both psoriasis without arthritis and skin/joint manifestations of PsA, treatment failures occur in at least 30–40% of the overall PsA population, and alternative treatments are needed. IL-17 has emerged as the most critical cytokine for sustaining skin disease. In psoriasis vulgaris trials, the emerging IL-17 antagonists yielded response rates that reflect virtual elimination of disease. IL-12/IL-23 antagonists, which ultimately suppress IL-17 signaling, show marked lesional skin improvement in psoriasis but less robust results for PsA joint symptoms. It is not clear whether IL-17 will play a major role in PsA. The lower responses of PsA to ustekinumab and brodalumab (compared with TNF antagonists) seem to predict that this cytokine will not have the dominant role in arthritis that it has in controlling the skin phenotype. In addition, some clinical trials have shown flares of arthritis in a small number of PsA patients whose skin disease was well controlled with ustekinumab.

Our findings of a relatively stronger IL-6 gene signature in synovium may point toward another target in PsA. GSVA showed a trend toward positive expression of IL-6 pathways in synovium and negative expression in skin. In addition, real-time PCR further confirmed our GSVA IL-6 pathway findings, with mRNA for IL-6 significantly increased in synovium compared with skin.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in psoriatic arthritis: a systematic literature review and network meta-analysis [^114GkQt8]. Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease characterized by a high burden of illness for patients. It features multiple articular and extra-articular manifestations, including peripheral arthritis, axial disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, skin psoriasis (PSO), and psoriatic nail disease. Patients with PsA may also experience related inflammatory conditions such as uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Approximately one-fifth of all PSO patients, increasing to one-quarter of those with moderate to severe PSO, will eventually develop PsA over time.

The primary goal of treatment is to control inflammation and prevent structural damage, thus minimizing disease burden, normalizing function and social participation, and maximizing the quality of life for patients. Given that PsA is a heterogeneous disease, treatment choices are guided by individual patient characteristics, efficacy across a broad spectrum of skin and joint symptoms, and varying contraindications to treatments. Treatment options include:

- **Conventional DMARDs**: Methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), and leflunomide (LEF).
- **Biologic DMARDs**: Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin (IL) inhibitors, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)-immunoglobulin.
- **Targeted synthetic DMARDs**: Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors.

Despite the variety of available treatment options, many patients with PsA report not achieving remission, indicating a need for additional therapeutic options. Consequently, the treatment landscape for PsA continues to evolve with increasing complexity in treatment decisions, especially as direct comparative data becomes available.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^111a69HR]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Can imaging help in assessing treatment response**: Going forward, we have a choice to scan and research each domain of PsA separately or attempt to cover all domains with one composite score. The PsA-Son scores include entheses examination, and other composite US scores have attempted to reflect the heterogeneity of PsA. The Five Targets PwD (power Doppler) for Psoriatic Disease is another example. This score recognizes the various domains in PsA and can be used to monitor power Doppler at the joint, enthesis, skin, nail, tendons, and synovial sheath. This score is much more feasible, but it focuses on areas that are difficult to scan, including the skin and nails.

There is evidence of an association between nail disease (both clinical and subclinical) and enthesitis at the DIP joint in PsO. US is able to assess the nail bed, matrix, and plate as well as its relationship with the DIP joint of the finger. A high transducer probe can diagnose subclinical psoriatic nail disease and potentially monitor response to treatment. Interestingly, a study of PsO patients with nail disease noted a higher incidence of subclinical systemic enthesitis. Thus, nail bed disease merits further investigation to again better stratify patients by phenotype.

### New generation biologics for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. State of the art and considerations about the risk of infection [^115AV7iT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation of the skin (psoriasis), joints (psoriatic arthritis), or both, resulting from a dysregulation, particularly of the T helper (Th)17 functions. There is no available cure for psoriasis, and lifelong treatment is necessary to manage signs and symptoms.

Research interest is high around the newest biological drugs approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, especially drugs blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis. Our aim is to review the new biological drugs for the treatment of psoriasis and their adverse effects, focusing on the risk of infections.

### Differential efficacy of biologic treatments targeting the TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^113mkSSn]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis cause significant physical and psychological burdens for afflicted individuals. An accelerated TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 axis is their major pathomechanism; therefore, anti-TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 biologics are very effective for the treatment of skin and joint lesions in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Given that the IL-17 signature is more upregulated in the skin than in the synovium for psoriatic arthritis, anti-IL-23/IL-17 agents seem to be superior to anti-TNF-α remedies in the treatment of skin lesions. In this review, we focus on the differential efficacy of anti-TNF-α/IL-23/IL-17 biologics in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

### How early should psoriatic arthritis be treated with a TNF-blocker [^113wk6j4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is the second most commonly identified inflammatory arthropathy in early arthritis clinics. It is a complex multisystem disease involving the skin and joints but may also present with inflammation of the spine (spondylitis), digits (dactylitis), eyes (uveitis), and ligamentous insertions (enthesitis). The skin manifestations may be mild or patchy and often precede joint inflammation. However, joint erosions may occur within the first two years in up to half of PsA patients, and an erosion rate of 11% per annum has been reported, suggesting it is not a benign disease as it was once regarded.

- **Recent findings**: Therapy with mild anti-inflammatories is only beneficial in very mild or localized disease. In cases of more widespread joint involvement, systemic therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate may be required. In cases of extra-articular or spinal disease, where DMARDs have failed to show efficacy, biologic therapy may be highly effective.

- **Summary**: The question of how early treatment should be instituted should be decided in a specialist rheumatology referral center following appropriate assessment. Optimal therapy with a combination of DMARDs and biologics may result in remission rates of up to 60%.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^115Vk6UY]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

To integrate imaging and biomarker assessment in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) for predicting biologic therapy response, a molecular biomarker should fulfill specific criteria: it must be easy to obtain, sensitive, specific, reproducible, and prognostic. Currently, there are no validated biomarkers in PsA. The main focus areas for biomarker discovery have been genomics and proteomics, both explored peripherally in the serum and in the involved tissue in PsA.

### Treatment guidelines in psoriatic arthritis [^113ubGn7]. Rheumatology (2020). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, inflammatory, musculoskeletal disease associated with psoriasis. Up to 30% of patients with psoriasis may develop PsA over the course of their lifetime. Musculoskeletal manifestations of PsA include peripheral arthritis, spondylitis, dactylitis (inflammation of the whole digit), and enthesitis (inflammation where a tendon, ligament or joint capsule inserts onto the bone). Skin manifestations of PsA include psoriasis (which has numerous phenotypes, but the most common type associated with PsA is psoriasis vulgaris or plaque psoriasis) and nail disease. Beyond the musculoskeletal and skin features, patients with PsA experience fatigue, physical function limitations, sleep disturbance, as well as diminished work capacity and social participation. In addition to the association with extra-articular manifestations such as uveitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), PsA is also associated with several comorbidities including obesity and metabolic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, cardiovascular outcomes, depression, and anxiety. All of these factors may play an important role in therapy selection.

Treatment for PsA includes traditional or conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic therapies such as TNF inhibitors (TNFi), IL-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), IL-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i), and new targeted oral agents including a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor and a Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitor.

### Pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis [^111FXSDS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis that is more common and severe than initially appreciated. The success of biologic agents in psoriatic arthritis has sparked great interest in this disorder, although the disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. This review focuses on recent advances in the genetic factors and immune pathways that have been implicated in disease susceptibility. Recent studies examining the mechanisms that underlie angiogenesis, enthesitis, and bone resorption in psoriatic arthritis are also discussed.

- **Recent findings**: Studies performed on several different populations indicate that the MHC class I allele Cw6 is associated with both early-onset psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Mutations in the caspase-activating recruitment domain 15 locus on chromosome 16 are also associated with psoriatic arthritis, providing support for a model involving innate immune mechanisms. Evidence for a CD8 antigen-driven acquired immune response in the psoriatic synovium and blood was reported. The finding of elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin 2 in psoriatic arthritis synovial vasculature may provide insights into events responsible for the tortuous vessel morphology, a histologic feature characteristic of psoriatic joints. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a critical factor mediating inflammation in the synovium, enthesis, and bone. In particular, osteoclasts resorb bone via a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand.

### Remission in psoriatic arthritis-where are we now [^114BXyZP]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Advances in treatments and treatment strategies for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have led to many patients responding well to management of their disease, and targeting remission as a treatment goal is now a possibility. Treat to target is a strategy aimed at maximizing benefit, irrespective of the type of medication used, by monitoring disease activity and using it to guide therapy. The measurement of response to treatment has been the subject of wide discussions among experts for some time, and many instruments exist. Comparisons of the different measures and their different strengths and weaknesses are ongoing. The impact of modern imaging techniques on monitoring disease progression is also evolving, and advanced techniques using both MRI and ultrasound (US) have the potential to improve management of PsA through identification of risk factors for poor prognosis as well as accurate assessment of inflammation and damage, including subclinical disease. Increased understanding of the pathways that drive the pathogenesis of PsA will be key to identifying specific biomarkers for the disease and developing effective treatment strategies.

Targets for response, considerations for use of a treat to target strategy in PsA, different imaging techniques, and serological aspects of remission are all discussed in this review, and areas for further research are identified.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^113ij38v]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Advances in psoriasis arthritis (PsA) treatment have highlighted the significance of early intervention. Psoriasis (PsO) impacts 2% of the population, with one-third developing PsA. This condition entails a range of overlapping articular patterns, such as deforming peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis-dominant disease, and axial disease. Recent treatment recommendations stress the heterogeneity of PsA and emphasize targeting the various disease domains.

Rheumatologists prioritize early treatment, particularly for patients unresponsive to conventional DMARDs. Available treatments include small-molecule synthetic DMARDs such as apremilast. Nevertheless, biologic agents remain the cornerstone of effective PsA management. Anti-TNF-α (TNFi) drugs have transformed PsA management and were formerly the sole biologics available. Newly effective options encompass monoclonal antibody therapies targeting IL-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23, along with combinatorial cytokine inhibition via Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors.

Currently, the decision to initiate or switch to a specific biologic depends on factors unrelated to the disease itself, such as patient preference, co-morbidities, and the drug's cost and safety profile. Limited evidence exists to guide the choice between them.

### Cross-sectional multicenter observational study of psoriatic arthritis in Japanese patients: Relationship between skin and joint symptoms and results of treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors [^11649FEE]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis with as yet unclear pathophysiology. This retrospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in 19 facilities in western Japan and aimed to identify patients' characteristics and factors that affect the results of treatment with biologic agents. Of 2,116 patients with psoriasis, 285 (13.5%) had PsA. Skin manifestations preceded joint manifestations in 69.8%, the onset was simultaneous in 17.2%, whereas PsA preceded skin manifestations in 2.5%.

Peripheral arthritis was most common, occurring in 73.7%, compared with axial disease in 21.8%, enthesitis in 23.5%, and dactylitis in 35.4%. Patients with severe skin manifestations were significantly younger at onset (P = 0.02) and more frequently had axial disease (P < 0.01). Biologic agents were used in 206 patients (72.3%), with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antibodies being prescribed first to 157 of them. Anti-TNF-α antibodies were continued by 105 participants and discontinued by 47, with the remaining five patients being lost to follow-up.

Patients who discontinued anti-TNF-α antibodies were significantly older than those who continued (55 vs. 51 years, P = 0.04) and significantly older at the onset of joint manifestations (50 vs. 44 years, P = 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients over 50 years significantly more frequently terminated anti-TNF-α antibodies (P < 0.01). In conclusion, patients with PsA and severe skin manifestations have earlier onset and axial disease, which seriously impacts quality of life. Anti-TNF-α antibodies were generally effective.

### Diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^112F9CG2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, heterogeneous disease whose pathogenesis is unknown, although genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors play major roles. Psoriatic arthritis can follow an aggressive clinical course, and differentiating it from other arthropathies is sometimes difficult. Diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis is based on history, physical examination, the usual absence of rheumatoid factor, and characteristic radiographic features. At least 40% of patients with psoriatic arthritis develop radiographically detectable joint destruction; therefore, proper diagnosis and early treatment can have a significant impact on disease course and outcome.

Understanding the pathogenesis of psoriatic disease has led to the use of several biologic agents that work by modulating T-cell signaling or by inhibiting key cytokines involved in inflammation, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF inhibitors have demonstrated excellent efficacy in resolving skin and joint disease in patients with psoriatic arthritis and have been shown to be safe agents in various inflammatory disorders. This article reviews the diagnostic and treatment challenges of psoriatic arthritis as they relate to pathogenesis and burden of disease.

At the conclusion of this learning activity, participants should have acquired a more comprehensive knowledge of our understanding of the classification, clinical presentation, etiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of psoriatic arthritis.

### Psoriatic arthritis [^113w8y9p]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2012). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy that affects approximately 6% to 48% of patients with psoriasis. Arthritis is not correlated with the extent of skin disease. Classic radiographic findings of the involved joint include erosion, ankylosis, and fluffy periostitis. Site-specific characteristic deformities, such as the pencil-in-cup deformity of the phalanges, also may be present.

The disease typically follows a moderate course, but up to 47% of cases develop into destructive arthritis in which the inflammatory process leads to bony erosion and loss of joint architecture. The mainstay of treatment is biologic therapy (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors) in conjunction with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Patients with end-stage joint destruction may require surgery to alleviate pain and restore function. Orthopaedic surgeons should be cognizant of the risk factors, such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and potential complications, including poor wound healing and an increased risk of infection, associated with psoriatic arthritis.

### Interleukin (IL)-17 versus IL-23 inhibitors: Which is better to treat patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and mild psoriatic arthritis in dermatology clinics [^111GuK9n]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-23 inhibitors are both approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In the absence of head-to-head studies, it is not clear which agent is better suited to treat patients with moderate-to-severe PsO and mild PsA. During the 2022 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) conference, Dr. April Armstrong and Dr. Joseph Merola debated which of these two biologic classes should be used in this patient population. Armstrong argued in favor of IL-17 inhibition, whereas Merola presented reasons for IL-23 inhibition. An overview of their main arguments is described in this manuscript.

### Psoriatic arthritis: current therapy and future approaches [^114D2Kov]. Rheumatology (2015).

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a systemic inflammatory condition that affects 20–30% of patients with psoriasis. It is characterized by potential involvement of diverse tissues, including peripheral and axial joints, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail disease. The degree of involvement in each domain can vary over time in individual patients and can differ substantially between PsA patients. The clinical heterogeneity, along with the varying extent of severity and activity, can pose significant challenges to treatment.

Although some studies had suggested immunopathophysiological similarities between PsA and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), more recently important distinctions have been defined. Similarly, although some immunomodulatory therapies have proved effective for both PsA and RA, recent data suggest distinct responses to certain targeted therapies. Herein, DMARDs and biologic agents, as well as the potential role of emerging therapeutics, will be reviewed.

### Comprehensive treatment of psoriatic arthritis: Managing comorbidities and extraarticular manifestations [^1153Zjh8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis that can lead to decreased health-related quality of life and permanent joint damage, resulting in functional decline. In addition to joint and skin manifestations, both psoriasis and PsA are associated with numerous comorbidities and extraarticular/cutaneous manifestations, which may influence the physician's choice of therapy.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review are to identify comorbidities in patients with PsA based on the available evidence; examine the effects of these comorbidities or extraarticular/cutaneous manifestations on the management of patients with PsA as well as the selection of therapy; and highlight research needs around comorbidities and treatment paradigms.

This review is part of a treatment recommendations update initiated by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA).

### The many faces of psoriatic arthritis: Their genetic determinism [^113HHYtz]. Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

The heterogeneous treatment responses in psoriatic arthritis have been explored through well-designed phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs), particularly those involving biologic and, more recently, small molecules. It is notable that despite the various cytokine and molecular pathways targeted, response rates for achieving an ACR 20% (ACR20) response remain around 40%, indicating that 60% do not respond adequately. Additionally, discordant responses are common. For instance, treatment targeting IL-17 may result in dramatic skin psoriasis improvements, yet features of peripheral arthritis might show little to no response, and inflammatory bowel disease features may flare, even for the first time. Clinicians face the challenge of identifying the most suitable drug for each patient, often relying on an individual's clinical features, comorbidity profiles, and history of previous drug responses to guide treatment decisions. This tailored approach often leads to patients cycling through several treatments before finding one that is effective, contributing to periods of non-response.

### Integrating imaging and biomarker assessment to better define psoriatic arthritis and predict response to biologic therapy [^113VNJvL]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Randomized controlled trials identified several biomarkers, including adiponectin and factor VII, which appeared to predict response in both skin and joint scores following golimumab therapy. Several potential biomarkers were strongly associated with ACR20 and/or DAS28 score response and are noted in Table 3. MMP-3 baseline results did not correlate with either skin or joint outcomes. The correlation between inflammatory markers and joint scores, especially the DAS-28 count, which includes CRP or ESR, is not surprising. Certain proteins like VEGF, MMP-3, and ICAM-1 have also been identified as potential biomarkers in TNFi studies looking at RA.

We do not want to develop a panel that only identifies one presentation of PsA, namely a polyarthritis presentation similar to RA. The focus should be on assessing those on biologic treatment and complementing the more detailed data from imaging with proteomic analysis. Additionally, synergism between predictive proteome work in PsA and PsO will be vital. The ever-expanding capabilities from omic technology, including metabolomics and the subcategory of lipidomics, are also exciting areas of discovery.

### Clinical management of psoriatic arthritis [^1144DBbq]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis, or the broader term psoriatic disease, refers to an inflammatory disorder that affects multiple organs, including the skin and joints, and has related extra-articular manifestations and comorbidities. Patients with psoriatic disease experience a substantial clinical burden. Early identification leading to timely diagnosis and treatment is crucial to prevent long-term structural damage and disability, as well as the associated socioeconomic consequences. The increase in therapeutic options, such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, both biological and targeted synthetic, has revolutionized the treatment of skin and joint disease. This advancement has prompted clinicians to use the full clinical picture of an individual patient to make rational treatment decisions. Research is also focused on treatment strategies, including treat to target, early remission-induction, and tapering.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of apremilast in psoriatic arthritis: Focus on skin manifestations and special populations [^117CNNWM]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

Few real-life studies have evaluated long-term apremilast therapy in the variable spectrum of clinical-anamnestic features found in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients. This real-life retrospective observational study aimed to assess the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of apremilast among patients with PsA and concomitant cutaneous psoriasis.

A stratified analysis was performed on special populations, defined as:

- **Number of comorbidities**: ≤ 1 vs. > 2.
- **Presence or absence of history of malignancy**.
- **Previous exposure to biologics**.

Patients attending three Italian University and Hospital centers, who received at least one dose of apremilast and had at least one follow-up visit, were included. Ninety-six patients with PsA were identified. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area, 28-joint Disease Activity Score, and Dermatology Life Quality Index scores improved during treatment, already at week 4, relative to baseline.

More than two comorbidities, history of malignancy, and previous biologic treatment negatively influenced PASI responses. At least one adverse event was experienced by 56 out of 96 patients, and 11 out of those 56 events required drug withdrawal. In conclusion, this study confirms the efficacy and safety of apremilast on joints and skin involvement in PsA, highlighting which patients could have less favorable treatment responses.

The BSR 2022 guidelines address follow-up and surveillance for psoriatic arthritis, particularly concerning the management of inadequate response to biologic agents. They recommend not using routine conventional synthetic DMARDs in patients with active psoriatic arthritis starting biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs. However, consider initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs to meet the drug license requirements or to maximize the effectiveness for skin disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or uveitis. Additionally, they may be used to improve persistence with TNF inhibitors.

### Consensus terminology for preclinical phases of psoriatic arthritis for use in research studies: Results from a delphi consensus study [^114fJTCf]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by both skin and joint involvement. Synovio-entheseal involvement is present in up to 30% of those with psoriasis, and individuals with psoriasis progress to PsA at a rate of up to 3% per year. PsA can lead to joint erosions and deformities, as well as to decreased quality of life, high levels of psychosocial stress, and increased rates of comorbidities, unemployment, absenteeism, and productivity loss. Despite this burden, PsA remains both underdiagnosed and undertreated, even within dermatology practices. The challenges in diagnosing and treating PsA create a considerable gap in the care of patients with psoriatic disease, given that a delay in treatment of as little as 6 months can lead to worse disease outcomes.

Measures of treatment effect

We will analyze dichotomous data as risk ratios or Peto odds ratios when the outcome is a rare event (approximately less than 10%) and use 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, results will be presented as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs, if possible. When studies use different scales to measure the same conceptual outcome (e.g. quality of life), we will calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs), with corresponding 95% CIs. SMDs will be back-translated to a typical scale (e.g. 0 to 10 for pain) by multiplying the SMD by a typical among-person standard deviation (e.g. the standard deviation of the control group at baseline from the most representative trial).

Where trials used different measures for the same outcome or concept, we will use the reported outcome measure that was the highest in our hierarchy as an index measure. We will transform means and standard deviations of other outcome measures to the scale of the index instrument and pool the data using MD as the summary estimate. For mean disease activity score, we will assume the 0 to 10 (0 represents no disease activity) PASDAS as the index instrument. For function, we will assume the 0 to 3 (where 0 is best function) HAQ-DI as the index instrument.

### The 2022 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis with biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs [^1168Nc31]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

For patients with psoriatic arthritis and extra-articular manifestations, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the 2022 BSR guidelines recommend acknowledging that while IBD is not an absolute contraindication for IL-17 inhibitors, specific agents like secukinumab or ixekizumab should be avoided. It is advised to proceed with caution and consult the gastroenterology team before administering IL-17 inhibitors to patients with controlled ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Furthermore, if therapy is initiated, regular monitoring for symptoms indicative of IBD is essential.

### Biological therapy for psoriatic arthritis in clinical practice: Outcomes up to 2 years [^112HgbY2]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of biological drugs in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) within a routine care setting, utilizing the Finnish national register of biological treatment (ROB-FIN).

- **Methods**: Patients with PsA who initiated therapy with infliximab or etanercept between June 2000 and February 2006 (n = 127) were monitored for up to 24 months. The response was assessed using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, including individual measures.

- **Results**: There were significantly diminished values for swollen and tender joints, patient's global and pain assessments, doctor's global assessment of disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and Health Assessment Questionnaire score within 3 months after beginning treatment with both infliximab and etanercept. These values remained significantly lower throughout the 24-month follow-up. The ACR20 response at 3 months was 79% (n = 22/28) for infliximab and 76% (n = 34/45) for etanercept. The first biological drug was discontinued in 16% of cases due to lack of effectiveness and in 6% due to adverse events.

- **Conclusion**: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy, often combined with conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, appeared to have limited toxicity and sustained effectiveness for up to 2 years in a cohort of Finnish patients with severe peripheral PsA.

### The state of the art-psoriatic arthritis outcome assessment in clinical trials and daily practice [^113ngSPa]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis is a heterogeneous condition with substantial challenges in optimizing outcome measures for both clinical trials and daily practice. As with other inflammatory arthritides, there is no gold standard instrument for measuring disease activity or impact, both of which are key to evaluate therapeutic approaches in trials and monitor disease in daily practice. A wide range of domains have been highlighted in the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) core domain set for psoriatic arthritis, reflecting the disease involvement in multiple tissues — joints, tendons, skin, and spine — and the heterogeneous impact of the disease on individuals. This review summarizes the evidence around outcome measure selection, considering factors such as unidimensional versus multidimensional outcomes, continuous versus binary measures, and the feasibility of these approaches in trials compared with clinical practice.

### New therapies for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^116UMWXG]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Over the last several years, novel immunologic pathways pivotal in the development of the pathobiology of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have been revealed. These discoveries have catalyzed a search for new treatment targets, resulting in many new therapies that are now available for patients with psoriatic disease.

Helper T cells that secrete interleukin-17 (TH17) along with CD8+ cells, innate lymphocyte cells, and gamma delta T cells are important in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA. Recently, agents that target interleukin-17, the interleukin-17 receptor, and interleukin-23 (antip19) have been approved or are in clinical trials. Apremilast, a new oral agent, has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA.

Secukinumab, an interleukin-17A antibody, has been approved for the treatment of psoriasis and PsA in the United States. It is effective with a good safety profile. Ixekizumab, another anti-interleukin-17A antibody, is currently in clinical trials, and brodalumab, an interleukin-17 receptor antagonist, was removed from clinical trials due to safety concerns despite demonstrated efficacy in psoriasis and PsA. Targeting interleukin-23 with antibodies to p19 presents another approach with encouraging results in psoriasis. Apremilast, an oral agent approved to treat psoriasis and PsA, demonstrates moderate efficacy with an excellent safety record. The role of tofacitinib in psoriatic disease remains to be determined pending a safety review in psoriasis and completion of PsA trials.

### Ixekizumab treatment of biologic-naïve patients with active psoriatic arthritis: 3-year results from a phase III clinical trial (SPIRIT-P1) [^1162Jte8]. Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immune-mediated condition, manifesting as peripheral arthritis, axial arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail psoriasis. The disease can be progressive, leading to structural joint damage and significant impairment of patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Ixekizumab is a high-affinity monoclonal antibody specifically targeting IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes the pathogenesis of PsA and psoriasis. It is approved for treating PsA and psoriasis. In a phase III study involving patients naïve to biologic PsA treatments (SPIRIT-P1), ixekizumab demonstrated superiority over placebo in improving signs and symptoms of PsA, slowing the progression of structural joint damage, and enhancing patient HRQoL.

This report presents the findings of safety, efficacy, and HRQoL for ixekizumab in SPIRIT-P1, extending up to 156 weeks.

### Risankizumab shows high efficacy and maintenance in improvement of response until week 52 [^114fMKw5]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The presence of joint involvement in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) shares the same inflammatory pathways as the cutaneous form; however, the greater resistance to treatment and deeper systemic involvement suggest the role of further molecular and genetic factors that are not yet well defined. The impact on the quality of life in PsA is often greater than in its skin counterpart, and therapeutic options lead to more modest results.

The high impact on quality of life from PsA and the involvement of difficult sites justify the prescription of biologic drugs even in patients with a limited extent of disease, such as those with a low Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI).

The purpose of our study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of risankizumab and possible prognostic factors such as the use of previous biological therapies, obese status, involvement of difficult sites, the habit of smoking, and joint involvement in a real-life setting.

### Treatment of psoriasis in patients with psoriatic arthritis: An updated literature review informing the 2021 GRAPPA treatment recommendations [^111htnyr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Our aim was to summarize and evaluate the quality of evidence regarding the efficacy of therapies for cutaneous psoriasis (PsO) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).

A literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and conference abstracts was conducted to identify interventional randomized controlled trials in patients with PsA between February 2013 and December 2021. Studies were included if PsO outcomes included achieving at least 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index and the blinded comparison period was ≥ 10 weeks. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was employed to assess the quality of the evidence to inform and update the 2021 Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) treatment recommendations.

A total of 116 studies and 36 abstracts identified in the initial search were screened. A total of 37 studies (40 treatment arms) met the criteria for final inclusion. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitors, interleukin 17 inhibitors (IL-17i), IL-12/23i, IL-23i, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) had high-quality data broadly supporting the efficacy of each class for plaque PsO over placebo. Head-to-head studies with high-quality data supported both IL-17i and IL-23i over TNFi.

Several pharmacologic therapeutic classes have high-quality evidence demonstrating efficacy for cutaneous PsO in the PsA population. The findings will be integ…

### Comparison of two etanercept regimens for treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: PRESTA randomised double blind multicentre trial [^1139x6yV]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy over 12 weeks of two different etanercept regimens in treating the skin manifestations of psoriasis in patients who also have psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, the study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety over an additional 12 weeks of open-label etanercept treatment. This was a randomised double-blind multicentre outpatient study.

The study was conducted across 98 outpatient facilities in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region. It involved 752 participants who had both psoriasis, evaluated by dermatologists, and psoriatic arthritis, evaluated by rheumatologists.

- **Interventions**: During the blinded portion of the study, participants were randomised to receive etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (n = 379) or 50 mg once weekly (n = 373) for 12 weeks via subcutaneous injection. All participants then received open-label etanercept 50 mg once weekly for an additional 12 weeks, while remaining blinded to the regimen.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants achieving "clear" or "almost clear" on the physician's global assessment of psoriasis at week 12. Secondary efficacy analyses included psoriasis area and severity index, American College of Rheumatology responses, psoriatic arthritis response criteria, and improvement in joint and tendon disease manifestations.

At week 12, 46% (176/379) of participants receiving etanercept 50 mg twice weekly achieved a physician's global assessment of psoriasis of "clear" or "almost clear" compared with 32% (119/373) in the group treated with 50 mg once weekly (P < 0.001).

### Dual biologic therapy for recalcitrant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^116gkYNd]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Numerous biologic medications are available to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; however, many patients experience differential responses of their skin and joints to the same agent. In patients who do not respond to biologic monotherapy or a combination of a biologic with an oral systemic agent, dual biologic therapy is a possible treatment option. Dual biologic therapy is rarely reported in the psoriatic literature.

We present a patient with severe psoriatic skin and joint disease who has been treated with multiple combinations of dual biologic therapy, including ustekinumab plus etanercept for 12 months, secukinumab plus etanercept for 6 months, and guselkumab plus etanercept for 15 months. Throughout the patient's treatment, adverse events only occurred with the ustekinumab plus etanercept combination and consisted of an increased incidence of urinary tract and upper respiratory infections, including a hospitalization for H2N1 flu.
