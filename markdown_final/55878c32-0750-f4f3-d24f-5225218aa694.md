## Question

Long case of patient flank pain. US of the kidney showed Hypochoic acoustic shadow. Diagnosis?
﻿﻿﻿A-Blood clot
﻿﻿﻿B-Uric acid stone
C-﻿﻿﻿Renal papilloma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis best fits a patient with flank pain and a kidney ultrasound showing a "hypochoic acoustic shadow", with options of a blood clot, a uric acid stone, or a renal papilloma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the sonographic meaning of "hypochoic" versus "hyperechoic" and whether "acoustic shadow" is a typical stone feature. Then, I should verify which entities among the choices classically produce posterior acoustic shadowing on ultrasound. Next, I will review the imaging characteristics of blood clots and renal papillomas to see if they fit this description. Finally, I will align the most likely diagnosis with clinical context and guideline-based imaging patterns for nephrolithiasis.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure I'm not misreading the finding. "Hypochoic" means relatively dark on ultrasound, whereas stones are typically echogenic (bright) foci; importantly, urinary calculi often demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing, which is a dark band behind the echogenic focus due to attenuation of sound, and this shadowing is a key sonographic sign of stones rather than a "hypochoic" lesion per se [^115iKs3B] [^116htq7x].

> Wait, let me verify which option actually matches the classic stone signature. Uric acid stones, like other urinary calculi, appear as echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing on ultrasound; this is precisely the "echogenic focus with shadow" pattern we expect in nephrolithiasis, and posterior shadowing is particularly specific for stones when present, even though sensitivity varies with stone size and location [^115iKs3B] [^116Mj26A] [^113r5Fsh].

> I will now examine the alternatives to ensure I'm not missing a mimic. Blood clots in the collecting system are typically echogenic but do not consistently produce posterior acoustic shadowing; they lack the crystalline interface that generates shadow, so they would not be described as a "hypochoic acoustic shadow" on ultrasound, making option A less likely here [^116Mj26A] [^111T7FTp]. Renal papillomas are solid urothelial tumors that present as soft-tissue masses rather than echogenic calculi; they do not create posterior acoustic shadowing, so option C does not fit the described sonographic sign either [^111T7FTp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the clinical context. Flank pain is the classic presentation of renal colic from obstructing stones, and ultrasound is an appropriate first-line modality in many patients, with stones often showing echogenicity and shadowing even when CT is not immediately available; this supports the coherence of a uric acid stone as the diagnosis in this scenario [^116P58kz] [^115iKs3B].

> But wait, what if the phrase "hypochoic acoustic shadow" is a misstatement and the intended finding was a hyperechoic focus with posterior shadowing? That would strengthen the case for a stone even more, and given that uric acid stones are radiolucent on plain radiographs yet still echogenic with shadowing on ultrasound, ultrasound can indeed depict them and the described shadowing would be expected, reinforcing option B as the best answer [^115iKs3B] [^116Mj26A].

> Final answer: B. Uric acid stone, because the described posterior acoustic shadowing is characteristic of urinary calculi on ultrasound, whereas blood clots and renal papillomas do not produce this shadowing pattern, and the clinical picture of flank pain aligns with nephrolithiasis [^115iKs3B] [^114MTUxJ].

---

The most likely diagnosis is a **uric acid stone**, because uric acid stones are radiolucent on plain films but often appear as echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing on ultrasound [^114MTUxJ] [^115iKs3B]. Blood clots are typically echogenic without shadowing, and renal papillomas are solid masses that do not produce acoustic shadowing. Confirm with **non-contrast CT** if available, as it is the gold standard for stone detection and characterization [^114sk6Tz] [^111kMaDx].

---

## Ultrasound findings in uric acid stones

Uric acid stones have **distinct ultrasound characteristics**:

- **Echogenicity**: Uric acid stones appear as echogenic foci within the renal collecting system [^111SKc4o].

- **Posterior acoustic shadowing**: These stones frequently exhibit posterior acoustic shadowing, a hallmark feature of calculi on ultrasound [^115iKs3B] [^113r5Fsh].

- **Radiolucency**: Unlike calcium-based stones, uric acid stones are radiolucent on plain radiographs, making ultrasound a valuable modality for their detection [^114MTUxJ].

---

## Differentiation from other diagnoses

### Blood clot

Blood clots within the renal collecting system can mimic stones on ultrasound; however, they typically lack the **posterior acoustic shadowing** characteristic of calculi. Clots are usually echogenic but do not produce the distinct shadowing seen with stones [^notfound].

---

### Renal papilloma

Renal papillomas are solid tumors arising from the renal pelvis or calyces. On ultrasound, they appear as solid masses and do not exhibit **posterior acoustic shadowing**. Their solid nature and lack of shadowing differentiate them from calculi [^notfound].

---

## Clinical correlation and further evaluation

Flank pain is a classic symptom of nephrolithiasis, particularly when associated with hematuria [^116GM3CA]. Ultrasound is a useful initial imaging modality, especially in patients with contraindications to radiation or contrast agents [^112vwgDG]. However, **non-contrast CT** remains the gold standard for confirming and characterizing urinary stones, including uric acid stones [^114sk6Tz] [^111kMaDx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the ultrasound findings of an echogenic focus with posterior acoustic shadowing in a patient presenting with flank pain, the most likely diagnosis is a **uric acid stone**. This diagnosis aligns with the characteristic ultrasound features of uric acid calculi and the clinical presentation. Confirm with non-contrast CT if available, as it provides definitive information regarding stone size, location, and composition, guiding management decisions [^114sk6Tz] [^111kMaDx].

### Right flank pain: a case report of an interesting sonographic finding [^113Wn8sZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Focused bedside ultrasound is a screening tool frequently used by emergency physicians to evaluate hepatobiliary and renal pathology in patients presenting with abdominal complaints in the emergency department (ED).

Objective

This case report describes a sonographic finding that was interpreted as free fluid in the right upper quadrant. Computed tomography (CT) was used to confirm the diagnosis.

Case Report

A 44-year-old man presented to the ED with the sudden onset of right-sided abdominal pain and exhibited right costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. Focused bedside ultrasound of the right upper quadrant revealed severe hydronephrosis of the right kidney and free fluid of either subcapsular, perinephric, or peritoneal location represented by an anechoic stripe in Morison's pouch. On CT evaluation, this patient was found to have perinephric fluid accumulation from a presumed ruptured renal calyx in the setting of chronic ureteropelvic junction obstruction with severe hydronephrosis.

Conclusion

The exact location of anechoic fluid in the abdomen is not always apparent on bedside ultrasound. To minimize misinterpreting focused bedside ultrasound examination findings, we recommend a number of sonographic techniques to identify possible mimics of free fluid. Suspected free fluid findings on bedside ultrasound should always be evaluated within the clinical context of the patient's presentation.

### What do we miss without contrast in patients with flank pain? [^112cnLoG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Flank pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, and the most frequent cause of flank pain is urolithiasis. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and renal artery thrombosis are rare causes of abdominal pain which can result in renal parenchymal injury. They are mostly difficult to diagnose and treat in the emergency setting. The present report describes 2 patients admitted to the emergency department because of acute flank pain who were diagnosed with renal infarction.

### Renal infarction versus pyelonephritis in a woman presenting with fever and flank pain [^1176sVAM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with fever, flank pain, and dysuria frequently are encountered in the emergency department. Acute pyelonephritis is the most likely diagnosis; however, its clinical and radiologic presentation consistently overlap with that of acute renal infarction. Ultrasound is unable to distinguish early infarction from nonabscessed acute pyelonephritis. Hence, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are needed. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman who presented with fever, flank pain, and dysuria, along with respiratory distress and tachycardia. Elevated values for inflammatory indexes suggested a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, and subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed hypodense wedge-shaped areas in both kidneys. However, the presence of a thin rim of capsular enhancement (cortical rim sign), the absence of perirenal inflammatory changes, and the location of the lesions apart from defined calyces suggested the alternative diagnosis of renal infarction. The underlying cause was not identified until an episode of acute dyspnea revealed paroxysmal arrhythmia. Our case demonstrates that a thorough knowledge of the imaging findings of renal infarction and acute pyelonephritis is essential to correctly making the diagnosis.

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^1124EhWh]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

### Sonographically identified echogenic renal masses up to 1 CM in size are so rarely malignant they can Be safely ignored [^1112cwhg]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine whether small echogenic renal masses up to 1 cm in size incidentally detected by sonography are rarely malignant and thus do not need further workup.

Methods

We reviewed approximately 13,600 reports of all abdominal sonographic examinations performed between November 2001 and October 2007 that identified a small echogenic mass in a kidney. Patients with known malignancy of any kind, tuberous sclerosis, lesions larger than 1.0 cm, lesions with heterogeneous echogenicity, and lesions with posterior ring-down artifacts or posterior acoustic shadowing were excluded. All patients without magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans that completely characterized the lesions were excluded unless a follow-up study (sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or contrast-enhanced computed tomography) at least 5 years later was available for comparison to prove that the lesion was benign.

Results

A total of 120 lesions in 111 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Lesion sizes were 0 to 5 mm (n = 16) and 6 to 10 mm (n = 104). Of these, 54 lesions were characterized as definitely benign (47 angiomyolipomas and 7 other benign entities: calcifications in stones or within a cyst or calyx and cysts that were either simple on follow-up studies or complicated with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous content). For the remaining 66 lesions, follow-up results after at least 5 years were normal in 24 cases (which meant that the lesion was no longer visible), and the remaining 42 lesions were stable in size. The mean duration of follow-up for these 66 lesions was 7.4 years.

Conclusions

Small echogenic renal masses up to 1 cm in size that fulfill our study criteria are so likely to be benign that they can be safely ignored.

### Sonographic mimics of renal calculi [^116Mj26A]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review sonographic findings that can mimic renal calculi.

Methods

We comment on a number of echoes that can mimic renal calculi.

Results

There are a number of sonographic renal artifacts, vascular and nonvascular, that may confound a correct diagnosis.

Conclusions

Awareness of these potential artifacts will result in a more specific sonographic examination and will accurately guide the referring physician toward appropriate patient treatment. The importance of other imaging modalities is also emphasized to ensure that a correct diagnosis is obtained whenever the sonographic findings are inconclusive.

### Renal medullary carcinoma masquerading as renal infection: a case report [^1172pHAB]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 29-year old man presented on January 7, 2019 with dry cough and fever with shivering accompanied by left flank pain for over 40 days and a left kidney occupying lesion for 10 days. The patient developed dry cough without apparent trigger and fever (temperature 37.7 °C) in the afternoon, with shivering accompanied by left flank pain. On November 30, 2018, blood chemistries at a local hospital showed increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and urinalysis revealed hematuria and proteinuria and he received intravenous metronidazole and penicillin for 3 days without apparent improvement. On December 5, 2018, he received intravenous levofloxacin at a provincial hospital for 2 days; left flank pain was worsened with fever (38.7 °C) with shivering during the treatment. Abdominal MRI scan revealed left kidney enlargement with a hypointense shadow with peripheral enhancement. His symptoms did not abate despite intensive antibiotics with piperacillin plus tazobactam, etimicin, linezolid, voriconazole, biapenem, and sulperazone. No symptomatic improvement occurred. The patient had lost about 5 kg in body weight since his illness.

The patient had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and received allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 2007. He did not experience an acute kidney injury episode, a renal infarct or any renal disease in the past.

Admission examination revealed a temperature of 37.7 °C and a pulse of 107/min. No other remarkable physical findings were seen. His blood chemistries showed white blood cell (WBC) counts at 12.3 × 10⁹ /L with 63.7% neutrophils and hsCRP 125.20 mg/L, ferritin 1421 ng/mL and ESR 104 mm/h. Serum creatinine was 97 μmol/L and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 9.04 mmol/L. Routine urinary tests on six occasions were unremarkable and showed no signs of infection. Doppler flow imaging ultrasonography (CDFI) showed a regular hypoechoic mass with distinct borders in the upper pole of the left kidney, 3.8 × 3.7 cm in size, and dot or strip-like flow signal (Fig. 1). Biopsy pathology on January 11, 2019 showed scant left kidney necrosis. A tentative diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and probable left kidney infection was made.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^113VmyK2]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Ultrasound can achieve a high sensitivity and specificity for the depiction of ureteral calculi and acute obstruction and has several advantages including its availability, lower cost and absence of radiation. Thus, it should be considered the first imaging modality in patients with renal colic. No more complications, serious adverse events, return emergency department visits or hospitalisations are expected using US first instead of CT. CT should be reserved for patients in whom US does not obtain a diagnosis, if symptoms do not resolve or there is a suspicion of alternative diagnoses.

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^1151QPTU]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 8
Type 2 renal hydatid cyst. A 15-year-old boy presented with right flank pain. a Axial contrast-enhanced computed tomography image reveals a multiseptated cystic lesion (arrow) in the upper pole of the right kidney, mimicking a neoplasm. b Axial fat-saturated T2-weighted image shows a multiloculated cystic lesion containing cysts of various sizes, compatible with daughter cysts (arrow). c, d Axial pre-contrast (c) and post-contrast (d) T1-weighted images demonstrate no internal vascularity. Serological tests were positive, and the lesion was treated by interventional radiology

Type 3 refers to a completely calcified cyst, indicative of parasite death. These lesions appear as bright echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing on US. Type 4 refers to a complicated cyst. Complications are rupture and superinfection, which may be seen in both type 1 and type 2.

Vascular renal pseudotumors

Renal extramedullary hematopoiesis

Extramedullary hematopoiesis is the development of hematopoietic tissue outside the bone marrow. It generally occurs in the reticuloendothelial system, such as the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is observed in patients who have hematologic disorders affecting the bone marrow. Renal involvement is very rare and may be parenchymal, parapelvic, or perirenal. Parenchymal involvement can mimic Wilms' tumor, renal cell carcinoma, and lymphoma. Parapelvic and perirenal lesions are often bilateral, and these lesions are similar to lymphoma.

Extramedullary hematopoiesis typically appears as homogeneous, hypovascular, enhancing soft tissue masses on imaging. Chemical shift MRI can demonstrate microscopic fat within the lesion. Extramedullary hematopoietic foci containing reticuloendothelial cells can be visualized using Tc-99m sulfur colloid due to their tracer uptake properties.

Although the clinical history of the patient may suggest extramedullary hematopoiesis in the differential diagnosis, biopsy is often required due to the nonspecific imaging findings. In patients with known myeloproliferative disorders, extramedullary hematopoiesis should be considered prior to biopsy, as such lesions may carry an increased risk of bleeding due to their high vascularity.

### Bedside renal ultrasound in the evaluation of suspected ureterolithiasis [^116MvCo7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether ultrasound changes emergency physicians' estimated likelihood of acute ureterolithiasis in patients with flank pain.

Methods

This prospective, observational study enrolled patients awaiting computed tomographic (CT) scan for presumed renal colic. Using a visual analogue scale, treating physicians estimated the likelihood of acute ureterolithiasis based first on clinical findings and urinalysis, then after ultrasound, and finally after CT. A 20% change in estimated likelihood was considered clinically significant. Test characteristics of ultrasound for any ureteral stone and for those greater than or equal to 5 mm in size were determined.

Results

One hundred seven patients were enrolled. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of ultrasound for stones observed on CT were 76.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59.4%-88.0%), 78.3% (95% CI, 66.4%-86.9%), and 85.7% (95% CI, 74.1%-92.9%) respectively, and for stones > 5 mm 90.0% (95% CI, 54.1%-99.5%), 63.9% (95% CI, 53.4%-73.2%), and 98.4% (95% CI, 90.3%-99.9%), respectively. Ultrasound significantly impacted the estimated likelihood of disease in 33 of 107 cases (30.8%, 95% CI, 22.5%-40.6%). Computed tomography further significantly changed physicians' impression of disease in 55 of 107 cases (51.4%, 95% CI, 41.6%-61.1%).

Conclusions

Bedside renal ultrasound had only a limited impact on the physicians' clinical impression of patients with possible ureterolithiasis. The sensitivity of sonographic hydronephrosis was modest for detecting any ureteral stone, but much better for detecting a large stone. Further study is needed to define the precise role ultrasound should play in evaluating patients with suspected ureterolithiasis.

### Ultrasound of renal masses [^1168SdTT]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Renal masses are common incidental findings. Although most are benign, it is important to evaluate for features concerning for malignancy. Because of its relative low cost; excellent differentiation among simple cysts, complex cysts, and solid lesions; and lack of ionizing radiation, ultrasound is the preferred modality for initial workup of renal lesions. Given the increasing availability of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, more and more lesions are now able to be completely characterized by sonography alone, including use of the Bosniak criteria.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^116sAEYS]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

CT

CT has become the imaging study of choice for renal colic because of its high sensitivity in the detection of renal and ureteral stones. Moreover, when CT is performed with dual energy, it helps to characterise the composition of the renal stones. However, most hospitals do not have this technology, which in addition has very limited usefulness in case of ureteral stones. CT can identify the presence and size of stones with a very high accuracy of > 95% and is able to detect alternative diagnoses that simulate renal colic in 5–10% of patients. Nonetheless, in spite of its high accuracy, there is increasing concern about the increase of health care costs and radiation risk that accompanies CT scans, since the use of CT rarely changes the treatment plans of these patients. In this way, in a recent retrospective study, Westphalen et al. determined the proportion of patient visits for flank or kidney pain receiving CT or US and calculated the diagnosis and hospitalisation rates for urolithiasis. From 1996 to 2007, the use of CT to assess patients with suspected urolithiasis increased from 4.0 to 42.5% over the study period, and the use of US remained low, at about 5%. However, the diagnosis of kidney stones, identification of significant alternate diagnoses or admission to the hospital did not increase.

The problem of exposure to radiation is very important in these patients, especially because of the possibility of cumulative radiation that is not usually well assessed when multiple CTs are performed in repetitive episodes of renal colic. Thus, the use of dedicated low-dose protocols is essential in these patients. In spite of the advances with dedicated low-dose CT protocols, a recent study evaluated renal colic CT studies conducted in 93 institutions in the USA from May 2011 to January 2013 and demonstrated that reduced-dose renal CT protocols are used infrequently. The overall mean effective institutional dose was 11.2 mSv. Only 2% of the studies were conducted with a "reduced dose" of 3 mSv, and only 10% of institutions used an effective dose of 6 mSv or less in at least 50% of patients. In another study performed in a single institution, the mean effective doses for a single study were 6.5 mSv for SDCT and 8.5 mSv for MDCT. Moreover, 4% of these patients (all with a known history of nephrolithiasis) underwent three or more studies, with estimated effective doses ranging from 19.5 to 153.7 mSv.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^113pnxG3]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Urolithiasis is the process of forming stones along the urinary tracts, including the kidney, bladder and urethra. Acute flank pain due to suspected urolithiasis is a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for more than 1 million visits in the USA annually. The estimated lifetime incidence of these urinary stones is 12%, they most commonly presents in patients between 30 and 60 years of age, and they are three times more common in men.

Non-contrast abdominopelvic CT has become the most common initial imaging study for suspected urolithiasis due to its high sensitivity for urinary stone disease, which ranges from 91% to 100%. Unlike other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography (US), CT exposes patients to high levels of ionising radiation with consequent long-term cancer risk. It has been estimated that 14 000 additional cancers in the USA may be attributable to unnecessary abdominal and pelvic CT scans. These avoidable scans can also lead to increased false positives and incidental findings, resulting in unnecessary patient anxiety and inappropriate follow-up interventions, further exacerbating the cycle of unnecessary and potentially harmful care. These interventions additionally contribute to increased system-level costs of acute renal colic, which currently amount to over $5 billion annually in the USA. Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that increased CT use, despite its higher sensitivity, is associated with improved patient outcomes.

While ultrasound has lower sensitivities to visualise urinary stones, it is an alternative imaging modality which may be used to investigate renal colic without exposing patients to ionising radiation. Furthermore, ultrasound can accurately detect hydronephrosis, perinephric fluid and abnormal ureteric jets, which increases the sensitivity for detecting kidney stones when they are too small to be visualised directly. As such, the importance of reducing unnecessary CT imaging for presentations of renal colic is recognised at an international level. In support of choosing wisely (CW), the growing international movement to reduce the overuse of unnecessary medical interventions, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) released 10 recommendations specifically targeting ED interventions. One of these recommendations was to 'avoid ordering CT of the abdomen and pelvis in young, otherwise healthy emergency department patients (age < 50) with known histories of kidney stones, or ureterolithiasis, presenting with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated renal colic'.

Regarding medical management for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to management of chronic pain, KDIGO 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain an evaluation for chronic flank, abdominal, or lumbar pain in patients with ADPKD to rule out causes other than ADPKD, such as mechanical or spinal back pain or malignancy in older patients, or complications from ADPKD, such as chronic low-grade infection or stones.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^1152jgsx]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. The most frequent cause is urolithiasis, but many other entities can cause the same clinical presentation. In many institutions unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is used in this setting. One of the major advantages of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies other than stone disease in patients with acute flank pain.

Introduction

Renal stone disease is common in Europe, with a prevalence ranging between 2 and 8%. It is a condition affecting relatively young individuals with an almost equal sex ratio and high tendency to recur: it is estimated that almost 50% of stone patients will present recurrence within 10 years. Renal colics are secondary to ureteral obstruction by the stones. They are a common cause of visits to the Emergency Department and frequently require imaging evaluation.

In most institutions non-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is considered the gold standard technique to evaluate these patients because of its accuracy in the detection of stones as well as of other pathological conditions mimicking renal colic. It is also considered as the first imaging technique for the evaluation of patients with acute onset of flank pain by The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. MDCT also allows an overall assessment of the 'stone load', which can help to plan the treatment. However, the vast majority of stones pass spontaneously, and CT imaging in the emergency department rarely alters immediate management. Moreover, concerns about the over-utilisation of CT are growing because of increasing health care costs and, more importantly, exposure to ionising radiation. The use of low-dose techniques can dramatically reduce the radiation dose, but these low-dose protocols have not been adopted worlwide. On the other hand, ultrasound (US) is a safe, non-invasive and non-expensive technique able to evaluate patients with renal colic. However, its use remains controversial as it has good capability to identify dilatation of the excretory system even in non-experienced hands, but can have difficulties in directly demonstrating the stones, especially in the mid ureters, remaining operator dependent to detect stones and indirect findings that can help in the diagnosis. In addition, the absence of the 'indirect findings' does not exclude ureteral stones. In spite of these difficulties several papers, including a very recent multicentre comparative study between US and CT, have demonstrated the usefulness of US in the diagnosis and management of renal colic patients.

### Emergency ultrasound and urinalysis in the evaluation of flank pain [^113WF83i]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of limited emergency ultrasonography of the kidney in diagnosing renal colic.

Methods

This was a prospective observational trial from December 2001 to December 2003 at a suburban emergency department. Patients who presented with flank pain suspicious for renal colic were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included fever, trauma, known current kidney stone, unstable vital signs, and inability to provide consent. All patients underwent sequential emergency ultrasonography and computed tomography of the kidneys and bladder. Data were analyzed using chi-square analysis. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography. Results were also stratified for presence of hematuria.

Results

Fifty-eight of the 104 patients enrolled in the study were diagnosed with renal colic. The overall sensitivity and specificity of bedside ultrasonography for the detection of hydronephrosis were 86.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 78.8 to 92.3) and 82.4 (95% CI = 74.1 to 88.1), respectively. In patients with hematuria, hydronephrosis by emergency ultrasonography demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 87.8 (95% CI = 80.3 to 92.5) and 84.8 (95% CI = 73.7 to 91.9), respectively. In 55 of the cases, the initial computed tomograph was read by a resident and later re-read by an attending physician. Using the reading of the attending physician as the criterion standard resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3 (95% CI = 73.2 to 88.0) and 92.0 (95% CI = 79.9 to 97.6), respectively.

Conclusions

Emergency ultrasonography of the kidneys shows very good sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing renal colic in patients with flank pain and hematuria.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for the investigation of patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. There are several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT that support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, there are many pitfalls, that may confound a correct diagnosis. Some of the common pitfalls, together with methods to avoid such occurrences, will be discussed. A review of some of the common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### Imaging patients with renal colic-consider ultrasound first [^115iKs3B]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

US

Ultrasound is an accurate imaging technique to diagnose renal colic. Moreover, this technique also allows the diagnosis of other renal diseases or extrarenal conditions that mimic renal colic (Table 1). The diagnosis of renal colic is based on the detection of stones and the consecutive obstruction of the excretory system (Fig. 1). Although the detection of dilatation of the excretory tract is very useful in the context of renal colic, this sign should be evaluated carefully, as dilatation does not necessarily mean obstruction, and the degree of dilatation does not reflect the severity of obstruction.

Table 1
Alternative diagnoses in patients with renal colic

Fig. 1
Left proximal ureteral stone (arrow) producing hydronephrosis

Features of stones in grey-scale and limitations. Stones are identified as hyperechogenic foci with posterior shadowing. The most important limitations of US are the detection of small lithiases (< 5 mm), which may be not recognised because of a partial volume effect or the absence of posterior shadowing, and the detection of stones not evaluable whatever the size in the mid ureters, which can be masked by overlying intestinal loops and gas, especially in obese patients. Regarding the detection of small intrarenal stones, one limitation is that hyperechoic foci can also be secondary to vascular or parenchymal calcifications, clots or arcuate arteries. The sensitivity of US in the detection of lithiasis varies greatly depending on the studies, with a wide range of sensitivities that usually depends on the size and location of the stones. Thus, Fowler described a very low sensitivity of 24% with 73% of calculi of < 3 mm not visualised. Vallone described a sensitivity of 47.57% in the detection of renal lithiasis smaller than 5 mm, and Sheafor reported 61% sensitivity with 70% of calculi ≤ 3 mm not detected. On the other hand, other studies have obtained very high sensitivities, such as 93% obtained in the study by Patlas performed by three experienced senior radiologists, 95% in the study of Dalla Palma and 96% in the study of Middleton. The specificity of US detecting ureteral calculi is 100%. A complete study should include the kidney, ureterovesical joint (UVJ) and ureters. The presence of UVJ oedema is considered a useful sign of a recent stone evacuation that can help to confirm the diagnosis of renal colic (Fig. 2). Regarding the detection of ureteral stones, the mid ureter is particularly difficult to identify, especially in obese patients or because of interposition of the bowel. However, the visualisation of the mid ureter can be improved by compressing the area with the transducer or changing the patient's position (Fig. 3). The distal part of the ureter far to the vascular cross can also be very difficult to identify even with a well-dilated proximal ureter. In selected patients it can be helpful to perform transrectal or transvaginal US to evaluate the pelvic ureteral segment. Another limitation of US is that in the early phases of renal colic dilatation of the excretory tract is not always identified because there has not been enough time for its development; furthermore, dilatation can be minimal in case of small stones (Fig. 4) or can be absent in dehydrated patients. The US study should then be performed following hydration to ensure a distended urinary bladder (thus allowing a good acoustic window to the terminal ureter) as well as visibility of the ureteral jet (produced by the passage of urine from the ureter into the bladder), if there is not complete occlusion. The accuracy of diagnosing renal obstruction and stones improves with the use of Doppler US and colour Doppler identifying secondary signs. Fig. 2 Patient with right renal colic. a US image show an oedematous UVJ (arrow). b Colour Doppler shows the presence of a small ureteral jet confirming the patency of the ureter (arrow). c A small stone that moves according to patient decubitus is identified at the urinary bladder (arrow) Fig. 3 a Right kidney hydronephrosis with ureteral dilatation. b Interposition of bowel loops that hampers the identification of the ureter. c Correct visualisation of a midureteral stone was obtained after compressing and displacing the bowel loops Fig. 4 Patient with known congenital polycystic kidney disease and mild renal impairment with flank pain and acute renal insufficiency. a Right kidney with multiple cysts and mild dilatation of the pelvis; b minimal dilatation of the ureter due to a small stone (arrow) at the upper third of the ureter
Additional sonographic features that can help in the diagnosis. An absent, asymmetric and/or reduced ureteric jet from the ureteric orifices evaluated by colour Doppler is an additional indicator of obstruction. However, the presence of a positive ureteral jet does not rule out the presence of ureteral stones since ureteral stones quite often only cause partial obstruction. Increased resistive index as a sign of acute obstruction, distinguishing between obstructive and non-obstructive dilatation. A renal RI > 0.70 and/or a 10% difference between the kidneys is considered as diagnostic of obstructive uropathy. Colour Doppler twinkling artefact. This artefact is a mixture of red and blue pixels on colour Doppler secondary to the "noise" produced from rough interfaces composed of sparse reflectors such as urinary stones. It is very useful to confirm findings of grey-scale, especially in doubtful cases due to small size of the stone or located in difficult-to-visualise ureteral portions. In the study by Moore et al. the sensitivity of US improved from 47.6 to 86% when the twinkling sign was used. In the recent study by Ripolles et al. which analysed the specific value of the twinkling artefact, the sensitivity of US using the twinkling artefact for detecting lithiasis was 90% and the specificity 100%. A total of 78% of the lithiases showed the twinkling artefact, including three stones not identified by B-mode US, and in 68% of these stones, the artefact was detected before the stone itself with B-mode.

### Small [^113HkpjJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Non-calcified echogenic renal cortical nodules are commonly detected with abdominal ultrasound (US). The majority of these nodules represent benign angiomyolipomas (AMLs), which are present in 0.3–2.1% of the population at autopsy. The increased echogenicity (in the absence of calcification) of renal AML is due to the presence of gross or mature fat within the nodule. Although renal AMLs are typically markedly echogenic, echogenicity may vary depending upon the relative proportion of fat, smooth muscle and blood vessels within the nodule. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is traditionally considered to be less echogenic than renal cortical parenchyma, although the echogenicity of RCC varies with its size. Forman et al. demonstrated that one-third of RCCs less than 3 cm in size are as echogenic as "classic" AML. In a recent meta-analysis, Farrelly et al. demonstrated that nearly half of small RCCs are more echogenic than renal cortical parenchyma and 11.5% are as echogenic as renal sinus fat. The increased echogenicity of small RCC is attributed to cell arrangement with increased internal interfaces and the presence of internal degeneration or haemorrhage. Nodule heterogeneity, intratumoural cysts and the presence of a hypoechoic rim are specific sonographic findings that favour echogenic RCC; while posterior acoustic shadowing is a specific sonographic finding that favours AML. Although these differentiating sonographic findings are specific, they lack the sensitivity required to discriminate between AML and RCC when a small echogenic renal cortical nodule is detected in everyday practice.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: a report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not an uncommon disease in an emergency department (ED). It manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation of pain to the back and flank region. Isolated left flank pain being the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and not previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Having negative findings on an ultrasound initially, she was misdiagnosed as having possible "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A second radiographic evaluation with computed tomography showed pancreatitis in the tail with abnormal fluid collected extending to the left peri-renal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also discussed the clinical pitfalls in this case.

### Ultrasound to address medullary sponge kidney: a retrospective study [^115NiPFv]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

MSK is a rare kidney disease that is at risk to be underdiagnosed in the next future because urography is less and less used in the diagnostic work-up. After reviewing the results of US findings in our cohort, we believe that the diagnostic performance of US is greater than generally stated in the literature and that, when complemented with clinical findings, history and biochemical analysis, it may help establish the diagnosis of MSK. Thus, promoting greater expertise of sonographers and imaging specialists in addressing specific MSK features could increase the number of correct diagnoses and provide patients with adequate follow-up and appropriate treatment.

### Acute flank pain: comparison of unenhanced helical CT and ultrasonography in detecting causes other than ureterolithiasis [^116F1Q4Z]. Emergency Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Several conditions can clinically mimic renal colic. We assessed the accuracy of non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and of ultrasonography (US) in offering an alternative explanation for flank pain. In a 3-year period, 181 patients with acute flank pain underwent US and non-contrast-enhanced helical CT in a blinded sequence. Their efficacy in detecting both alternative causes of pain and additional findings unrelated to the pain was assessed in 160 cases with a confirmed diagnosis. An alternative cause was found in 23 cases (14%). US gave 4 false-negative results (1 acute appendicitis, 1 ovarian cyst torsion, 1 diverticulitis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 2 false-positive results (1 acute pyelonephritis and 1 diverticulitis), with a 78% sensitivity and a 98% specificity for nonlithiasic causes. CT gave 5 false-negative results (1 complicated ovarian cyst, 1 pleuritis, 1 epididymitis, 1 acute pyelonephritis, and 1 papillary necrosis) and 1 false-positive (1 simple ovarian cyst described as a complicated lesion), resulting in a 74% sensitivity and a 99% specificity for diagnosing alternative causes. There were 130 additional US findings in 68 patients and 151 additional CT findings in 77 patients. A wide spectrum of findings can be identified in subjects imaged for flank pain. Non-contrast-enhanced helical CT and US have comparable accuracy in diagnosing causes other than stone disease.

### Do incidental hyperechoic renal lesions measuring up to 1 CM warrant further imaging? Outcomes of 161 lesions [^116WExAV]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of hyperechoic renal lesions measuring 1 cm or less at ultrasound examination.

Materials and Methods

This retrospective study included 161 hyperechoic renal lesions measuring 1 cm or less at ultrasound that were evaluated with follow-up ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Follow-up imaging examinations were reviewed to assess for definitive lesion characterization or size stability.

Results

Follow-up included 11 unenhanced CT, 39 contrast-enhanced CT, 52 unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT, two unenhanced MRI, 50 unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI, and 87 ultrasound examinations. At CT or MRI 58.4% of lesions were confirmed to be angiomyolipomas. At CT, one lesion represented a stone, and one a hyperdense cyst. At CT or MRI 11.8% of the lesions had no correlate; 3.1% were not visualized at follow-up ultrasound. An additional 23.6% were stable at 2-year follow-up imaging or beyond. Two lesions were evaluated with only contrast-enhanced CT less than 1 month after ultrasound, and the CT images did not show macroscopic fat or calcification or meet the criteria for a simple cyst. These lesions were considered indeterminate. One lesion in a 65-year-old man was imaged with unenhanced and contrast-enhanced CT 23 months after ultrasound, and the CT showed an increase in size, solid enhancement, and no macroscopic fat. This lesion was presumed to represent renal cell carcinoma. Overall, the one lesion presumed malignant and the two indeterminate lesions constituted 1.9% of the cohort. The other 98.1% of lesions were considered clinically insignificant.

Conclusion

Most hyperechoic renal lesions measuring 1 cm or smaller were clinically insignificant, suggesting that such lesions may not require additional imaging. Patient demographics, symptoms and risk factors for malignancy may help inform the decision to forgo follow-up imaging of such lesions.

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^112aKG7p]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal abscess is a complication of focal pyelonephritis and may be parenchymal or perinephric. In the early stages, abscesses appear as ill-defined hypovascular areas. A mature abscess presents as a well-defined complex cystic lesion with a thick, irregular wall. On US, a typical abscess appears as a heterogeneous mass with posterior acoustic enhancement and absent internal flow on color Doppler. These features can also be seen in necrotic malignant tumors. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are crucial in differential diagnosis. If clinical findings are inconsistent with an abscess, MRI may be useful for confirming the diagnosis. Abscesses appear hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. They may exhibit perilesional edema and fluid–fluid levels. Pseudocapsules may enhance in the venous phase. Restricted diffusion is typically observed at the center of the abscess, with ADC values lower than focal nephritis or sterile fluid collections. On CT, they appear as round or geographic hypodense lesions with enhancing thick wall (Fig. 6). The wall of Wilms' tumor is typically more irregular and the presence of fat stranding may be particularly helpful in distinguishing between an abscess and a Wilms' tumor.

Focal bacterial nephritis and renal abscess

Acute focal bacterial nephritis is a localized, non-liquefactive bacterial infection of the kidney affecting one or more lobes. Solitary lesions can resemble Wilms' tumor or renal cell carcinoma, while multifocal lesions may mimic lymphoma or metastases. Characteristic US findings include hypo- or hyperechoic focal lesions with poorly defined margins, focal loss of corticomedullary differentiation, and nephromegaly. The sensitivity of US in detecting focal bacterial nephritis is limited. Focal bacterial nephritis typically appears as an ill-defined hypodense lesion on CT (Fig. 5). CEUS or MRI may serve as alternative imaging modalities in pediatric patients. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is particularly useful, as lesions demonstrate restricted diffusion and lower apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values compared to normal renal parenchyma. It has been noted that the sensitivity of DWI in diagnosis is higher compared to CT. Clinical and laboratory findings, including fever, pyuria, flank pain, positive urine culture, and leukocytosis, are important for distinguishing focal bacterial nephritis from neoplasm, and regression of the lesion is expected with appropriate treatment. Imaging features such as perirenal fat stranding, Gerota's fascia thickening and diffuse nephromegaly support the diagnosis of infection.

This article reviews new advances in ultrasound technology for urinary stone disease. Recent research to facilitate the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, including use of the twinkling signal and posterior acoustic shadow, have helped to improve the use of ultrasound examination for detecting and sizing renal stones. New therapeutic applications of ultrasound technology for stone disease have emerged, including ultrasonic propulsion to reposition stones and burst wave lithotripsy to fragment stones noninvasively. The safety, efficacy, and evolution of these technologies in phantom, animal, and human studies are reviewed herein. New developments in these rapidly growing areas of ultrasound research are also highlighted.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: case report [^114tkX4R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED), pyelonephritis is a fairly common diagnosis, especially in patients with unilateral flank pain. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare type of pyelonephritis that is associated with unique features, which may lead to its diagnosis.

Case Report

A 30-year-old male patient presented to the ED for evaluation of right-sided abdominal pain that has been ongoing for the past 24 hours. He noted the pain was located predominantly in the right flank and described it as sharp in nature. The pain was nonradiating and was associated with scant hematuria. He stated that he had similar pains approximately 1 month earlier that resolved after a few days. The patient underwent a bedside ultrasound and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed an enlarged, multiloculated right kidney with dilated calyces and a large staghorn calculus, findings that represent XGP. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report highlights an unusual variant of pyelonephritis, a relatively common ED diagnosis. XGP should be considered in patients with recurrent pyelonephritis, as treatment for XGP may require surgical intervention in addition to traditional antibiotic management.

Benign mimics

Pyelonephritis and renal abscesses

Focal pyelonephritis and abscesses may mimic renal masses and renal lymphoma. Clinical information is essential in making the diagnosis, including symptoms of dysuria, hematuria, flank pain, and a urinalysis positive for infection. On CT, a striated nephrogram or areas of patchy hypoenhancement can be seen in pyelonephritis, with a predilection for the upper pole. On ultrasound, renal abscesses appear as complex collections, with posterior through transmission, and lack internal vascularity. On contrast-enhanced imaging, abscesses may demonstrate rim enhancement. Follow-up imaging often demonstrates focal parenchymal scarring as a result of prior inflammation/infection (Fig. 10).

IGG4 related renal disease

IGG4-related disease is characterized by fibroinflammatory lesions rich in IGG4 positive plasma cells, and often but not always elevated serum IGG4 concentrations. Five patterns of disease have been described in renal involvement, with bilateral round or wedge-shaped peripheral cortical lesions being the most common pattern (Fig. 11). Patients usually improve after corticosteroid treatment. On MRI, IGG4 lesions demonstrate both T1 and T2 hypointense signal with mild enhancement on post-contrast T1 weighted images.

### Pictorial review: renal ultrasound [^1131XE3o]. Clinical Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Ultrasound (US) is the first-line imaging modality for evaluating azotemic patients for urinary obstruction and renal size. US is also valuable for distinguishing congenital variants and simple cystic lesions from renal masses. Doppler US is effective in detection of renal calculi and evaluation of vascular pathology. Unfortunately, renal US is limited in distinguishing causes of medical renal disease. The kidneys have a complex internal architecture with a highly variable appearance on US. This article illustrates non-neoplastic renal conditions, including normal and embryological variants, parenchymal, cystic, and vascular diseases. Renal infections, calcifications, and trauma and fluid collections are also discussed, with an emphasis on distinguishing US features and pathophysiology.

### Imaging urolithiasis: complications and interventions in children [^113i9Tdb]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Urolithiasis affects people in all age groups, but over the last decades there has been an increasing incidence in children. Typical symptoms include abdominal or flank pain with haematuria; in acute cases dysuria, fever or vomiting also occur. Ultrasound is considered the modality of choice in paediatric urolithiasis because it can be used to identify most clinically relevant stones. Complementary imaging modalities such as conventional radiographs or non-contrast computed tomography should be limited to specific clinical situations. Management of kidney stones includes dietary, pharmacological and urological interventions, depending on stone size, location or type, and the child's condition. With a very high incidence of underlying metabolic abnormalities and significant recurrence rates in paediatric urolithiasis, thorough metabolic evaluation and follow-up examination studies are of utmost importance.

### Does twinkle artifact truly represent a kidney stone on renal ultrasound? [^111Svfce]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nephrolithiasis is detected on ultrasound by the presence of an echogenic focus, posterior acoustic shadowing and/or twinkle artifact (TA). TA has been shown to be highly predictive of nephrolithiasis in adults with renal colic and ureteral stones. We sought to evaluate if TA is reliable for diagnosing nephrolithiasis in the pediatric population.

Methods

We reviewed renal ultrasound reports indicating presence or absence of TA associated with a single echogenic focus in the kidney or ureter. Exclusion criteria were age > 18, multiple echogenic foci or medullary calcinosis, no follow-up, or TA located outside the kidney or ureter. Stone was confirmed either by CT within 3 months of color Doppler ultrasound, visualization on ureteroscopy, or patient report of passing the stone.

Results

Five hundred and ninety-nine ultrasound reports were reviewed and 293 met inclusion criteria. Sixty-nine had diffuse twinkle without echogenic focus and 224 showed TA with single echogenic focus. 135 patients had confirmatory information available (Summary Table). Nephrolithiasis was diagnosed using TA and confirmed on confirmatory studies for 49 ultrasounds. The majority of confirmed stones were in the kidney (n = 40; 82%) and mean size of confirmed stones on ultrasound was 5 mm (range 1.5–10). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of TA for detecting nephrolithiasis were 83%, 78%, 74% and 86% respectively.

Conclusions

Compared to the adult literature, TA in children has lower sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value, but similar negative predictive value for diagnosing nephrolithiasis. This may be related to renal location and smaller stone size. The presence of TA should be weighed in the setting of other clinical and radiographic evidence of nephrolithiasis.

### Diagnosis of an acute lobar nephronia in the emergency department using POINT-OF-CARE ultrasound [^1178dcrY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past decade, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been performed increasingly in pediatric emergency medicine for a variety of indications. POCUS is a focused, limited, goal-directed examination at the bedside performed and interpreted by a physician trained in POCUS with the purpose of answering a specific question. Applying POCUS for immediate evaluation of specific emergent complaints may allow for faster and safer management of ill patients in the pediatric emergency department (ED).

Case Report

A 5-year-old female presented to the pediatric ED with fever, vomiting, and back pain. Based on the real-time gray scale and color Doppler POCUS findings, a diagnosis of an acute lobar nephronia (ALN) was made by a pediatric emergency physician and the patient was admitted to the hospital before laboratory and urinalysis findings were resulted. This case report illustrates how POCUS and knowledge of the sonographic characteristics of an ALN were beneficial for shortening the time to decision for admission, rapidly ruling out hydronephrosis (which may have required other interventions), and conveying important information to the admitting team. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Performing a kidney POCUS and knowing the sonographic characteristics of an ALN can assist in its diagnosis, especially in patients where pyuria is absent. In addition, performing a kidney POCUS in patients with a suspected upper urinary tract infection may shorten the time to decision for admission and improve communication with the pediatric admitting resident regarding diagnosis and indication.

### Acoustic shadowing in pediatric kidney stone ultrasound: a retrospective study with non-enhanced computed tomography as reference standard [^113r5Fsh]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The usefulness of acoustic shadowing as a feature of pediatric kidney stone ultrasound (US) may be underestimated.

Objective

The hypothesis was that the majority of stones in children have acoustic shadowing and that its specificity is high (> 90%) in pediatric kidney stones.

Materials and Methods

Our retrospective observational study included children who had undergone abdominal non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for kidney stones in a pediatric renal stone referral centre between 2015 and 2016. US examinations prior to CT were retrospectively assessed for US features such as acoustic shadowing, twinkle artifact and stone size. These features were compared to CT as reference standard.

Results

Thirty-one patients (median age: 13 years, range: 1–17 years) with 77 suspected kidney stones were included. The median stone size was 5 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 5 mm). For acoustic shadowing, sensitivity was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 56–80%) and specificity was 100% (95% CI 56–100%). All kidney stones with a diameter ≥ 9 mm demonstrated shadowing. Sensitivity for twinkle artifact was 88% (95% CI 72–96%), but specificity for twinkle artifact could not be calculated due to the lack of true negatives. All false-positive stones on US demonstrated twinkle artifact, but none showed shadowing.

Conclusion

Acoustic shadowing was demonstrated in the majority of pediatric kidney stones. Specificity was high, but this was not significant. Twinkle artifact is a sensitive US tool for detecting (pediatric) kidney calculi, but with a risk of false-positive findings.

### ACR appropriateness criteria for acute onset of flank… [^1141ZuDf]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Helical noncontrast CT has high clinical accuracy, allowing for the precise measurement of a mass, as well as providing a clear depiction of where in the ureter a stone has become lodged.
- A low-dose CT radiation regimen should be used in place of conventional dosing when evaluating for renal or ureteral stones. Procedures with a rating of 9 are considered most appropriate, and those with a rating of 1 least appropriate. These guidelines rate the suitability of computed tomography, ultrasonography, radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging for patients who present with suspected stone disease, recurrent stone disease symptoms, or abdominal pain in pregnancy. Patients who undergo noncontrast CT are exposed to a greater radiation dose than with other imaging tests, and it could cause adverse health effects. Therefore, a low-dose regimen should be used in place of conventional dosing when evaluating for renal or ureteral stones.

If low-dose CT does hinder sensitivity, intravenous contrast media, secondary signs and dual-energy CT may be useful for clarifying findings. CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with contrast media is assigned an appropriateness rating of 6. Magnetic resonance imaging is less accurate for identifying suspected stones, but it is highly dependable in depicting hydronephrosis and perinephric edema. In contrast, although intravenous urography has long been a standard test for ureterolithiasis, it cannot guide physicians toward alternative diagnoses if stones are ruled out. Both of these modalities are assigned a rating of 4. RECURRENCE OF STONE DISEASE SYMPTOMS Stones are a likely cause of flank pain, especially in patients who have already had them.

Reviewing previous images that indicate where or how many stones the patient had during earlier episodes, or limiting noncontrast CT to the bladder, can help avoid problems generated by repetitive use of CT imaging. Non-contrast CT, preferably at reduced doses, is usually appropriate in the evaluation of recurrent symptoms, with a rating of 7 for these situations. Additionally, large stones may appear on radiography — with potential for tracking their course — depending on stone composition and weight of the patient. Ultrasonography is an option for evaluating hydronephrosis.

### Stone-mode ultrasound for determining renal stone size [^113WHjzL]. Journal of Endourology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to measure the accuracy of stone-specific algorithms (S-mode) and the posterior acoustic shadow for determining kidney stone size with ultrasound (US) in vivo.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-four subjects with 115 renal stones were prospectively recruited and scanned with S-mode on a research US system. S-mode is gray-scale US adjusted to enhanced stone contrast and resolution by minimizing compression and averaging, and increasing line density and frequency. Stone and shadow width were compared with a recent CT scan and, in 5 subjects with 18 stones, S-mode was compared with a clinical US system.

Results

Overall, 84% of stones identified on CT were detected on S-mode and 66% of these shadowed. Seventy-three percent of the stone measurements and 85% of the shadow measurements were within 2mm of the size on CT. A posterior acoustic shadow was present in 89% of stones over 5mm versus 53% of stones under 5mm. S-mode visualized 78% of stones, versus 61% for the clinical system. S-mode stone and shadow measurements differed from CT by 1.6 ± 1.0mm and 0.8 ± 0.6mm, respectively, compared with 2.0 ± 1.5mm and 1.6 ± 1.0mm for the clinical system.

Conclusions

S-mode offers improved visualization and sizing of renal stones. With S-mode, sizing of the stone itself and the posterior acoustic shadow were similarly accurate. Stones that do not shadow are most likely < 5mm and small enough to pass spontaneously.

### CT for the evaluation of flank pain [^1157qAsw]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT allows rapid and accurate determination of whether a stone is present anywhere in the urinary tract. There is a learning curve for both radiologist and urologist, but a number of signs are highly predictive of stone. Helical CT scans should always be accompanied by a "scoutogram" to convey an idea of what the stone might look like. The scan requires no contrast medium and takes only 5 to 10 minutes of imaging time, making it cost effective. It behooves both urologists and radiologists to familiarize themselves with the techniques for reading these scans.

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^112JcdQp]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma

Spontaneous subcapsular renal hematoma is a rare entity. Patients may present with back or flank pain, and tenderness. Possible etiologies in children include tumors, vascular diseases, infections, and the use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs, with a small proportion of cases being idiopathic. It has been shown that hypertension is a risk factor in some cases where the etiology cannot be determined. The diagnosis of liquefied or layered hematomas is straightforward with US. However, these lesions may present as heterogeneous subcapsular solid masses, potentially mimicking neoplasms (Fig. 10). The absence of internal vascularity on color Doppler US is an important diagnostic feature for hematoma. In cases of large lesions or diagnostic uncertainty, further imaging is often required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying etiology. In emergency settings, CT is preferred due to its rapid acquisition time, offering high sensitivity — approaching 100% — for hematoma detection. MRI is appropriate for both diagnostic and etiological evaluation in pediatric patients.

### Identification of clinically insignificant renal calculi on sonography [^111sDVRn]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine factors predicting if a radiologists… report of a. stone… on ultrasound (US) was not actually a clinically significant stone, based on subsequent computed tomogram (CT). US often overestimates stone size and various pathologic entities are also hyperechoic;.ßthus, a subsequent CT without a clinically significant stone may represent unnecessary radiation exposure. A decision-tree and nomogram were developed to predict when stones are unlikely on subsequent CT.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of patients, of any age, receiving CT within 24.ßhours of a sonographic report documenting a single renal stone, during 2019… 2020, in any phase of care, at one institution. Novel stone-likelihood-systems for US and CT (US-SLS, CT-SLS) were devised and validated to classify stones as clinically significant or insignificant, with CT as the gold standard. Binomial logistic regression predicting clinically significant stones was performed with sonographic and patient characteristics.

Results

Eight hundred twenty patients had US followed by CT, 228 (27.8%) reported documented stones, 140 (17.1%) reported a single stone. Clinically significant stones were associated with larger stone size (P: .002), location (P: .002), hydronephrosis (P: .04), shadowing-artifact (P: .02) depth.ßto.ßstone (P: .008), and Body mass Index (BMI) (P: .01). US-SLS had higher sensitivity (95.4%) and negative-predictive-value (81.8%) compared to a multivariate model of significant variables.

Conclusion

US-SLS appears to exclude clinically irrelevant. stones… better than established criteria including twinkle or shadow in this retrospective analysis. A diagnostic algorithm and nomogram are presented. US-SLS and the associated decision tree can assist providers in avoiding unnecessary radiation when clinically significant stones are unlikely.

Rotation Prep Published October 8, 2024 A brief refresher with useful tables, figures, and research summaries Acute renal colic typically presents with intermittent colicky flank pain that may radiate to the groin, s often associated with nausea and vomiting and may be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms such as dysuria. Calcium: Most kidney stones contain calcium combined with either oxalate, phosphate, or uric acid, and all calcium-containing stones are radio-opaque. Conditions causing hypercalciuria can contribute to the formation of calcium stones. These include diseases such as primary hyperparathyroidism, certain malignancies, granulomatous diseases, sarcoidosis, and thyrotoxicosis. Uric acid: Unless combined with calcium stones, uric acid stones are radiographically transparent. Causes include gout, myeloproliferative disorders, and tumor lysis syndrome that results in hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria.

Workup Urinalysis: All patients require urinalysis, which may show microscopic hematuria as well as signs of urinary tract infection. Blood work: In the acute setting, blood work is useful to evaluate electrolytes and renal function, and in the chronic setting, it can help identify underlying causes of stones. Plain abdominal radiographs are useful for radio-opaque stones and to monitor disease activity. Renal ultrasonography is useful in follow up or in pregnant patients. Although historically, ultrasonography was not been used in the acute evaluation of renal colic, given its low sensitivity, a recent study reported no difference in rates of missed high-risk diagnoses or adverse events between ultrasound or CT in patients with renal colic.

### Hypoechoic normal renal sinus and renal pelvis tumors: sonographic differentiation [^111T7FTp]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the sonographic findings of an unusually hypoechoic renal sinus that mimics a tumor in the renal pelvis or renal sinus.

Methods

Sonographic scans of 7 patients with an unusually hypoechoic portion in the renal sinus were reviewed retrospectively. Computed tomography, excretory urography, or both confirmed all sinuses as normal. Five consecutive cases of renal pelvis tumors, which were detected on sonography initially in same period, were also reviewed to determine the differences between the 2 conditions. All cases were transitional cell carcinomas of the renal calyces. The images were analyzed for location, shape, margin, presence of posterior sonic attenuation, and associated findings such as caliectasis.

Results

Sonographic findings noted in patients with hypoechoic normal renal sinuses were irregular and poorly defined margins (n = 7), a central and symmetric location in the renal sinus (n = 6), the presence of posterior sonic attenuation with nonvisualization of the posterior border of the lesion (n = 7), an unaffected peripheral hyperechoic renal sinus (n = 7), and traversing hilar vessels in the lesion on color Doppler sonography (n = 7). In contrast, renal pelvis tumors had a relatively well-defined margin (n = 4), an eccentric location in the renal sinus (n = 2), a partially or completely obliterated hyperechoic renal sinus (n = 2), a visible posterior margin (n = 5), no posterior shadowing (n = 5), vessel displacement by the mass on color Doppler sonography (n = 5), and associated caliectasis (n = 1).

Conclusions

By being familiar with the sonographic characteristics of a hypoechoic renal sinus, it can be differentiated from renal pelvis tumors, and unnecessary diagnostic workups can be avoided.

### Imaging urolithiasis: complications and interventions in children [^116KW2d8]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Colour Doppler axial image of the bladder of a 17-year-old girl who presented with right lower quadrant pain and haematuria shows a stone in the distal part of the right ureter. Twinkling artifact facilitates differentiation of the stone from other echogenic structures

Other possible US findings in children with urolithiasis include weakening of the ureteric jet and elevation in renal resistive index resulting from obstruction, which might precede pelvicalyceal dilatation.

A few possible mimics of kidney stones might arise on US, one of the most important being medullary nephrocalcinosis, referring to accumulation of calcium deposits in medullary pyramids. This condition may be differentiated from nephrolithiasis by the specific localisation of the echogenic foci outside the collecting system; early changes involving only the apices of the medullary pyramids do not result in acoustic shadowing. Other causes of hyperechogenic medullary pyramids or their apices include papillary necrosis, medullary sponge kidneys or renal infection. In neonates, Tamm-Horsfall protein accumulation resulting in transient pyramidal echogenicity must be considered. An echogenic, highly vascular benign tumour — angiomyolipoma — is another possible sonographic mimic of a kidney stone. It can be differentiated by its intraparenchymal or exophytic localization; acoustic shadowing is occasionally seen. Echogenic renal foci can also represent calcifications in renal vessels or in the cortex. It is important not to confuse a ureteric stent left in place following urological procedures for pathological echogenic foci. In cases of unclear US appearance of echogenic renal foci, the use of other imaging modalities such as non-contrast CT should be considered.

### Imaging urolithiasis: complications and interventions in children [^111SKc4o]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic imaging

Ultrasound (US)

Many imaging modalities can be useful in diagnosing urolithiasis, including US; conventional radiographs of the kidney, ureter and bladder (KUB); non-contrast CT; and magnetic resonance (MR) urography. Unlike in the adult population, where non-contrast CT is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of urolithiasis, US, being a non-ionizing, easily accessible and effective procedure, is recommended as the initial diagnostic method in children. Although sensitivity and specificity of US depend on the physician as well as the machine and patient position, they have been reported to be as high as 67–90% and 95–100%, respectively.

Ultrasound is used to visualise presence, size and location of stones, along with potential complications of urolithiasis. Typical US findings of urolithiasis include a hyperechogenic structure in the renal collecting system with or without posterior shadowing, depending on the size of the calculus. Pelvicalyceal dilatation, an indirect sign of obstruction, might also be seen (Fig. 1). In chronic cases of severe obstruction, thinning of the renal cortex can occur.

### Two in one: epithelioid angiomyolipoma within a classic kidney angiomyolipoma-a case report [^117DYsYm]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 52-year-old female patient with recurrent urinary tract infections underwent abdominal ultrasound examination. The right kidney ultrasound showed a sharply restricted, hypoechoic solid renal mass of 2.5 cm diameter without posterior acoustic shadowing closely located to the renal sinus. The kidney was not congested. Atypical sinus lipomatosis, lipomas or a transitional cell carcinoma was suspected and subsequently a computer tomography scan was performed showing a homogenous mass that met the criteria for a classic angiomyolipoma (Fig. 1). A computed tomography scan repeated 2 years later demonstrated a possible tumor growth to 3 cm in diameters. Another 2 years later, an ultrasound examination revealed two different areas of the solid mass: a hyperechoic outer rim (echogenicity tumor to normal kidney cortex ratio (TQ) of 2.27) and inner hypoechoic portion (TQ of 0.47.) as displayed in Fig. 2a. Echogenicity was measured according to prior reported method. A contrast enhanced ultrasound was performed displaying a distinct different perfusion pattern of these two areas. In the hyperechoic peripheral area, we noticed a strong perfusion that started nearly simultaneously with the renal cortex and a marked slower contrast material flooding with a relatively rapid wash out in the hypoechoic portion of the tumor (Fig. 2b). The finding of the contrast enhanced ultrasound of the hyperechoic part of the tumor was in line with a classic angiomyolipoma whereas the dignity of the hypoechoic part remained unclear. A target biopsy of both parts was performed. The histological examination showed a classic angiomyolipoma in the biopsy specimen of the outer rim (Fig. 3a) and an epithelioid angiomyolipoma in the biopsy specimen of the center part (Fig. 3b). Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity for melanocytic markers and smooth muscle markers, confirming the diagnosis of epithelioid angiomyolipoma. A subsequent nephrectomy was performed confirming the diagnosis.

### A case of psoas muscle abscess with hematuria, detected initially by point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^1159Jgmp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Psoas muscle abscess (PMA) is a collection of pus in the psoas muscle. It is considered a rare clinical entity and is often misdiagnosed due to highly vague symptoms. We report that point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) serves as a useful and noninvasive tool for early detection of PMA.

Case Report

Our patient was a 35-year-old man without any past medical illness who visited the emergency department due to right lower back pain and hematuria for 8 months. He denied fever, trauma, or recreational drug use. On arrival, the patient's vital signs were stable and had no fever. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count 12,800/μL with neutrophil segment 83.2%, C-reactive protein 0.2 mg/dL, and normal renal function. Urine routine showed red blood cells > 100/high-power field. Kidney-ureter-bladder radiograph revealed a positive psoas sign on the right. POCUS showed a mixed echogenic mass adjacent to the right kidney. Subsequently, contrast abdominal computed tomography revealed T10-T11 collapsed vertebral bodies with disc erosion and right psoas muscle abscess at the right kidney level. The patient received open drainage of psoas muscle abscess and T11-T12 laminectomy. He was discharged 13 days post admission. Why ShouldanEmergency PhysicianBe Aware of This? Early and accurate diagnosis of PMA is important because, if left untreated, mortality rate can reach 100%. A potential pitfall in our case is the presence of hematuria with flank pain that could lead to incorrect diagnosis of renal calculi, a much more common condition. This case illustrates the importance of using POCUS in any patient with back or flank pain, with or without hematuria.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^115qgcxk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency room in a regional hospital with nausea and left flank pain that had suddenly started 12 h earlier. She had a history of left flank trauma, having fallen from 2-meter- height 5 years earlier. Physical examination revealed no tenderness over the abdomen or flank and normal chest auscultation. Blood analysis was within normal limits, except for leukocytosis (12.7 × 10⁹ /L). Routine urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without white blood cells or proteins. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged kidney and a 16-mm hyperechoic focus in the left renal pelvis, suggesting a diagnosis of renal calculus. The patient was therefore administered extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the regional hospital. A follow-up ultrasound examination 2 weeks later showed that the shape and size of the hyperechoic focus had not changed.

Due to left lower back pain and the persistent left hyperechoic focus in the renal area, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Urine analysis and ultrasound examination showed the same results as in the regional hospital (Fig. 1a). An abdominal plain film showed a left-sided renal calcification (Fig. 2a), but there was no evidence of a palpable tender mass or an audible abdominal bruit. Laboratory data, except for urinalysis results, were within normal limits. Because of the failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotomy was recommended.

### Is ultrasound useful for further evaluation of homogeneously hyperattenuating renal lesions detected on CT? [^1125rg3i]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of ultrasound (US) to characterize hyperattenuating cysts detected as indeterminate hyperattenuating renal lesions on unenhanced and single phase enhanced CT.

Materials and Methods

A total of 107 consecutive homogeneously hyperattenuating renal lesions underwent gray-scale and Doppler US at our institution between 2010 and 2013. Two radiologists who were unaware of the final diagnosis retrospectively evaluated US images for visibility and diagnosis (simple cyst, intermediate complexity cyst, cystic or solid mass showing internal flow on Doppler US, or indeterminate). A third radiologist assessed lesion size, location, and distance to skin on CT and US. US visibility was compared using chi-square and independent t tests. Consensus US interpretation was compared with reference standard diagnoses, and accuracy for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cysts was tabulated.

Results

Mean lesion size ± SD was 20 ± 16 mm (range, 6–96 mm) and mean distance to skin on CT was 62 ± 25 mm (range, 18–125 mm). In all, 89.7% (96/107) of the lesions were visible on US, including all lesions that were 15 mm or larger. Nonvisible lesions were smaller than visible ones (10.0 ± 3.6 mm vs 20.7 ± 16.3 mm, p = 0.03) regardless of location (p > 0.05). CT overestimated lesion distance to skin compared with US (46.6 ± 18.6 mm, p < 0.001). Final diagnoses for US visible lesions (n = 96) were hyperattenuating cyst (n = 66), Bosniak IIF cyst (n = 13), and cystic or solid neoplasm (n = 15); two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 66 hyperattenuating cysts, 54 (81.8%) appeared as simple cysts on US with sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cyst of 81.8% (95% CI, 75.6–84.3%) and 92.9% (95% CI, 78.1–98.7%), respectively. The other 12 (18.2%) hyperattenuating cysts appeared complex. Two of the 13 Bosniak IIF lesions were incorrectly classified as simple cysts with US. Including the 11 (10%) nonvisible lesions reduced sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cyst to 73.0% (95% CI, 66.9–75.9%) and 89.7% (95% CI, 74.2–97.2%), respectively.

Conclusion

US can further characterize hyperattenuating cysts presenting as indeterminate hyperattenuating renal lesions on CT in the majority of cases.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^114JsBGH]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

AIUM practice parameter — abdominal point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the urinary system outlines indications, technique, documentation, and limitations: A point-of-care ultrasound examination should be performed for a valid medical indication, and there are no absolute contraindications. Indications include but are not limited to acute kidney injury, oliguria, hematuria, undifferentiated shock, evaluation for hydronephrosis, confirmation of Foley catheter placement, urinary retention, evaluation for renal calculi, masses, or cysts, and evaluation for a perinephric abscess. The examination of the urinary system should include long- and short-axis views of the kidneys and bladder; decubitus, prone, or upright positioning may provide improved views; and limitations include partial visualization of the kidney. The hepatorenal and splenorenal recesses should be evaluated for the presence of fluid, and documentation of free or loculated peritoneal fluid should include the extent and location. Both kidneys should be evaluated for size, echogenicity, and the presence of hydronephrosis, scanned in multiple long-axis and transverse planes, with a maximal longitudinal measurement of renal length documented, and renal echogenicity compared to adjacent liver or spleen tissue; if a focal abnormality is identified, the examiner should refer for a comprehensive ultrasound examination. Small, isolated hyperechoic renal cysts (1 or 2 cysts, < 3 cm in diameter) with thin walls, posterior acoustic enhancement, and located in the upper or lower poles typically do not require a comprehensive examination. The urinary bladder may then be evaluated in long- and short-axis planes for distension, luminal abnormalities, wall thickening, masses, and the correct placement of a Foley catheter; if the Foley catheter is in the normal position, the bladder should be partially collapsed around it, and as appropriate, a postvoid residual may be quantified and reported. Spectral, color, and power Doppler imaging may be useful to differentiate vascular from nonvascular structures, and use of color Doppler imaging may assist in the detection of renal calculi. Limited examinations that do not answer the clinical question or incidental findings warranting further investigation should prompt a comprehensive study. The main limitation is operator dependency, requiring appropriate training in image acquisition and interpretation, and ultrasound may be technically limited by factors such as bowel gas, obesity, subcutaneous emphysema, patient positioning, and surgical dressings or tubes.

### Patient information: kidney stones… [^116GM3CA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

While small kidney stones may pass freely through the urinary system, larger kidney stones can become lodged within a ureter, which is the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. Symptomatic kidney stones typically cause sudden onset of severe flank or back pain on one side of the body that can radiate to the groin and may result in blood in the urine, pain with urination, increased frequency of urination, fever and chills, and nausea and vomiting. The preferred imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of kidney stones is a noncontrast abdominal computed tomography scan, which provides information about the size and location of the stones. Ultrasonography may be an alternative option for individuals who are pregnant or for patients who need frequent imaging due to recurrent kidney stones. Initial treatment for symptomatic kidney stones involves pain control.

Nonopioid analgesics, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as intravenous ketorolac, are often used to treat renal colic in patients without kidney disease. Opioids may be prescribed for pain control in individuals with severe renal colic. Patients with symptomatic kidney stones who are dehydrated should be treated with intravenous fluids. For patients with a kidney stone that is 10 mm in diameter or smaller, typical outpatient management involves a 4- to 6-week trial of straining the urine to capture a passed kidney stone. Patients who are not at risk of developing low blood pressure may be treated with an alpha-adrenergic blocker medication to help expel ureteral stones. Risk factors for symptomatic recurrent kidney stones include history of asymptomatic or symptomatic kidney stones, larger stones, and a higher number of kidney stones detected by imaging.

Other risk factors include male sex, younger age, obesity, pregnancy, and having a family history of kidney stones. All patients with symptomatic kidney stones should increase their fluid intake and eat a low-sodium, normal-calcium, moderate-protein diet. Patients at high risk of recurrent symptomatic kidney stones may also benefit from treatment with a thiazide diuretic medication and potassium citrate. The composition of kidney stones and urine collected over 24 hours may be analyzed to help guide preventive therapy for some patients.

### SCAI expert consensus statement for renal artery stenting appropriate use [^111N5fd3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Medium credibility.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) diagnostic considerations emphasize that the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant RAS is critical to determining optimal therapy, that a physical examination provides few specific clues except for the rare systolic/diastolic abdominal bruit radiating to the flank region, and that in patients with a high clinical suspicion who are considered potential candidates for revascularization, a diagnostic evaluation for RAS should be undertaken. RAS because of fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, or trauma are infrequently encountered, and are not covered in this manuscript. Renal artery duplex ultrasonography (RADUS), which utilizes no radiation, is highly sensitive and specific, inexpensive, and can be repeated without risk or discomfort to the patient.

Imaging modality selection for suspected ADPKD in at-risk individuals — ultrasound is prioritized initially, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) used when limitations apply. The Work Group "recommends ultrasound as the first method to consider", and ultrasound "is the most widely used imaging modality in evaluating a person at risk for ADPKD, as it is inexpensive, portable, widely available, and does not require contrast or ionizing radiation". Ultrasound "is insensitive to detecting very small cysts and therefore is not able to rule out ADPKD, especially in young people aged (< 30 years)", and "Ultrasound sensitivity also can be reduced with large body habitus". For equivocal studies in younger adults, "At-risk young adults should undergo MRI if the ultrasound results are equivocal, as MRI offers superior sensitivity for very small cysts", while "with CT, sensitivity for kidney cysts down to 2 mm is high when i.v. contrast is administered". Additionally, "Genetic testing can also clarify a diagnosis, but it is not available in all parts of the world".

### Curbing the use of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury: penny wise or pound foolish? comment on "Renal ultrasonography in the evaluation of acute kidney injury" [^111qBQ25]. Archives of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Licurse score for renal ultrasound" for acute kidney injury.

The Licurse Score for Renal Ultrasound is a clinical calculator used in the field of nephrology. It is specifically designed to predict the likelihood of finding significant pathology on renal ultrasound in patients presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI). The score is based on several clinical parameters including age, sex, baseline creatinine, peak creatinine, and presence of urinary tract symptoms.

The clinical utility of the Licurse Score lies in its ability to guide clinicians in deciding whether to order a renal ultrasound for patients with AKI. A higher score indicates a higher probability of finding significant pathology, thus helping to prioritize patients who are most likely to benefit from this diagnostic procedure.

The Licurse Score is not applicable to patients with chronic kidney disease or those with known renal pathology. It is also not intended for use in patients with AKI due to obvious causes such as post-renal obstruction or glomerulonephritis, as these conditions would necessitate a renal ultrasound regardless of the score.

The Licurse score for renal ultrasound helps assess a patient's risk for hydronephrosis, based on specific health and demographic factors. These factors are evaluated to generate a score that stratifies patients into different risk groups. Here's how it works:

Patients are assessed based on the following criteria:

- **Race**: Non-black individuals receive 1 point, while Black individuals receive 0 points.
- **History of Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections**: If a patient has experienced recurrent infections, they score 1 point; otherwise, they score 0.
- **Diagnosis Consistent with Possible Obstruction**: Conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia or a neurogenic bladder add 1 point to the score when present.
- **History of Congestive Heart Failure**: A history of this condition scores 0 points, while its absence scores 1 point.
- **History of Prerenal Acute Kidney Injury, Use of Vasopressors, Sepsis, or Hypotension**: Patients without this history score 1 point; those with the history score 0.
- **Exposure to Nephrotoxic Medications Before Acute Kidney Injury Episode**: No exposure is worth 1 point and any exposure results in 0 points.
- **History of Hydronephrosis**: Having a documented history of hydronephrosis scores a significant 4 points, while its absence scores 0.

Adding these scores gives a total that can range from 0 to 10. The interpretation of this score distributes patients into low, medium, or high-risk categories for hydronephrosis, with potential intervention requirements:

- **Low-risk Group**: Scores ranging from 0 to 2 place a patient in this category, indicating a 4.0% risk of hydronephrosis on imaging and a 1.1% risk of requiring a stent or nephrostomy tube.
- **Medium-risk Group**: A score of 3 places a patient in this group, which implies a 6.8% risk of hydronephrosis on imaging and a 0.5% risk of needing a stent or tube.
- **High-risk Group**: Scores above 3 signify a 20.9% likelihood of hydronephrosis on imaging and a 4.9% chance of needing an intervention like a stent or nephrostomy tube.

This scoring structure provides a clear framework for evaluating and managing the risk for hydronephrosis, guiding subsequent medical decision-making.

### Common and less-common renal masses and masslike conditions [^113t4NTh]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

As an increasing number of imaging examinations are performed, a greater number of incidental renal lesions are detected. Apart from the usual cysts and solid renal cell carcinomas, a variety of unusual benign and malignant renal lesions exist. Imaging is invaluable in characterizing these lesions and is confirmatory in some benign lesions. Renal cell carcinoma remains the diagnosis of exclusion; however, assessment of the imaging pattern in the appropriate clinical context can improve diagnostic accuracy. The objective of this article is to familiarize the radiologist with the imaging appearance of unusual non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and correlate with histopathologic studies when available.

### The role of routine post-natal abdominal ultrasound for newborns in a resource-poor setting: a longitudinal study [^114MbFHm]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Caliceal diverticular cysts may be congenital or acquired and they communicate with the calyces or renal pelvis. It may be associated with hydronephrosis and diagnosed ante-natally. They may be asymptomatic but about 50% are associated with stones but this was not seen in the case above.

The incidence of incidental adrenal masses on imaging has been put at between 0.6 to 1.3% and is higher with abdominal CT scan. Adrenal tumors and adrenal haemorrhage can be diagnosed with USS and it has been reported that prenatal USS diagnosis of neuroblastoma results in a higher survival rate as it is identified at an early stage. Adrenal haemorrhage results from multiple patho-physiological factors. It is seen in about 1.9 per 1000 live births and it is the commonest cause of adrenal mass in the neonate, usually presenting between day 2 and day 7 of life. It is more commonly seen in neonates than in children or adults because the neonatal gland is about two times larger and therefore prone to hypotension and asphyxia. The neonate with suspected adrenal haemorrhage in this study also had jaundice which is a known association. Other known associations include a palpable flank mass, anaemia and hypovolemic shock but it could also be asymptomatic. Serial imaging with ultrasound until complete resolution is advised for these cases as was done for this patient in whom complete resolution was seen at six months. USS is the examination of choice in neonates with suspected adrenal hematoma. Initial USS typically shows a complex, echogenic mass with inferior displacement of the kidney if the bleed is large. Over time, the mass becomes smaller, cystic and echolucent over a period of weeks. It may also subsequently develop calcifications. The USS appearance is however variable as seen in this case where the initial finding was a hypoechoic mass on second day of life, which subsequently became smaller and echogenic at six weeks and disappeared by six months.

The limitations of this study include the small sample size and the cases lost to follow up, more babies need to be scanned to be able to make pronouncements on the incidences of documented abnormal cases in the study area. Another limitation is that all ultrasound scans were performed by a single operator (AMA). This was because only one portable ultrasound machine was available to perform bedside scans which ensured the cooperation of mothers and performance of scans before discharge from hospital. However, AMA is an experienced sonologist with over twelve years experience as a consultant sonologist.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound [^1128SYZX]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Renal — Because of the highly vascular nature of the kidney, CEUS can be performed with less than the standard dose, and imaging may be performed continuously or intermittently from contrast injection. Intermittent imaging (viewing for 3–5 seconds every 30–60 seconds) may be performed to evaluate washout, which is helpful to differentiate pseudo-masses from true neoplasms, and lesion characterization often requires comparison to adjacent renal parenchyma; therefore, ensuring a segment of parenchyma is within the field of view during the contrast injection is important for comparison with the target lesion.

### Atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas in a young, healthy female [^114PAJHG]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinomas are rare and generally result from trauma to any part of the urinary collecting system. Appropriate imaging is crucial in the timely diagnosis and management of urinomas and for ruling out other etiologies such as subcapsular renal hematomas and perinephric abscesses.

Case Report

A 31-year-old woman with no past medical history or known trauma presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a week of right flank pain, abdominal pain, and intermittent fevers. On point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), she was found to have a complex right perinephric collection, later confirmed with computed tomography (CT) imaging. She was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged after a 3-day hospital admission with instructions to follow up with Urology. A day later, she was readmitted with worsening bilateral flank pain and persistent fevers. Image-guided percutaneous aspirations of her bilateral perinephric fluid collections revealed both urine and blood. A right ureteral stent was then placed with ultimate resolution of her symptoms. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Urinomas without history of trauma are rare and should be on the differential for patients presenting with flank pain and infectious symptoms. Urinomas or other expanding perinephric fluid collections can result in superimposed infection, rupture, secondary hypertension, and renal failure. Here, we present an atypical case of atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas with hemorrhagic components in a young and healthy woman. Our case further outlines the utility of POCUS in the ED for the timely diagnosis and management of this disease process.
