## Question

recommendations for elevated RDW

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about recommendations for elevated red cell distribution width (RDW). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should verify the hematologic differential using MCV and reticulocytes. Next, I will consider non-hematologic drivers such as inflammation, nutrition, and organ dysfunction. After that, I should review disease-specific prognostic implications where RDW meaningfully informs risk. Finally, I will outline management principles, including when to treat the underlying cause, when to repeat RDW, and when to escalate care, while noting limitations and uncertainties in current evidence.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and exclude pre-analytical or analytical artifacts, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a false signal. I should double-check the lab's reference interval, which commonly uses 11.5–14.5% for RDW-CV, and verify instrument calibration and sample integrity, since older samples or improper handling can distort RBC indices and falsely elevate RDW, and I should repeat the CBC if the clinical context is discordant or if the result is unexpected [^a0d254df] [^c40aaa1f].

> Next, I should review the hematologic differential using MCV and reticulocyte count, because RDW elevation reflects anisocytosis and the pattern with MCV narrows causes. Microcytosis with elevated RDW points toward iron deficiency or thalassemia, macrocytosis with elevated RDW suggests B12/folate deficiency or myelodysplasia, and normocytic anemia with elevated RDW can reflect early nutritional deficiency, hemolysis, or anemia of chronic disease, so I need to check hemoglobin, MCV, reticulocytes, and a peripheral smear to anchor the diagnosis before proceeding [^1cd238c5] [^14f6dc31].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anemia alone. I should consider non-hematologic drivers of elevated RDW, including systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional deficits, and organ dysfunction, because RDW correlates with hsCRP and ESR independent of hemoglobin and MCV, and mechanistic modeling suggests slowed RBC turnover with persistence of smaller, older RBCs as a homeostatic response in disease states, which helps explain why RDW rises across diverse conditions even without overt anemia [^f83acf0b] [^031a2a5b].

> I will now examine disease-specific prognostic implications where RDW meaningfully informs risk, but I need to be careful to separate association from causation. In COVID-19, multiple high-quality cohorts show that RDW greater than 14.5% at admission is associated with substantially higher mortality, and increases in RDW during hospitalization track with worse outcomes, supporting its use for risk stratification even after adjustment for age, comorbidities, and other biomarkers [^a356c698] [^dcb7266d] [^cddea7e6]. In community-acquired pneumonia, elevated RDW predicts complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality independent of hemoglobin, reinforcing its prognostic value in acute infections [^c11038c1] [^f1952d03]. In heart failure, RDW independently predicts mortality and correlates with impaired iron mobilization and inflammation, and in critical illness, RDW improves the prognostic performance of severity scores such as SAPS, while in chronic kidney disease, RDW tracks with cardiovascular events and mortality independent of hemoglobin, and in the general population, higher RDW associates with all-cause mortality even among nonanemic individuals [^1a3b1875] [^cfd2081a] [^50534230] [^33541999].

> Wait, let me verify the practical thresholds I am using. Many studies converge on RDW greater than 14.5% as a clinically meaningful cutoff for increased risk, including COVID-19 cohorts and CKD studies, and meta-analytic data in COVID-19 show an approximately 2.7-fold higher mortality risk with RDW above 14.5%, though I should acknowledge heterogeneity and the need for validation across populations and assays [^a356c698] [^121e53c0] [^50534230].

> Now, I should translate this into management principles, starting with treating the underlying cause of anemia or disease rather than targeting RDW itself, because RDW is a marker and not a therapeutic target. For iron deficiency, I should confirm with ferritin, transferrin saturation, and CRP, and treat with iron repletion, noting that RDW may rise transiently with new erythropoiesis before falling as the RBC population normalizes, and for B12/folate deficiency, I should replace the deficient cofactor and monitor hematologic response, expecting RDW to normalize with effective therapy [^b7602805] [^050fa2ca]. In inflammatory anemia of chronic disease, I should optimize disease control and consider iron therapy when appropriate, recognizing that RDW may remain elevated until inflammation abates, and in myelodysplastic syndromes or other marrow failure states, I should refer to hematology for definitive evaluation and management, as RDW elevation here reflects dysregulated erythropoiesis [^985c1a09].

> I need to ensure I do not miss dynamic prognostic information. In acute care settings, I should repeat RDW within 48–72 hours when the initial value is elevated or when the patient deteriorates, because rising RDW during hospitalization independently predicts higher mortality in sepsis and COVID-19, and documenting trajectory can refine risk stratification and trigger escalation of care or palliative discussions when appropriate [^8da0fba7] [^cddea7e6].

> But wait, what if the patient has no anemia and still has elevated RDW. I should double-check for occult inflammation, nutritional deficits, or organ dysfunction, and consider composite markers such as the RDW-to-albumin ratio, which has been associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in large cohorts, while remembering that these are prognostic rather than diagnostic tools and should complement, not replace, clinical judgment and targeted workup [^5ca5cec4] [^456d4cf1].

> I should confirm limitations and uncertainties so we do not overinterpret RDW. Most data are observational, cutoffs vary by lab and population, and RDW is a nonspecific integrative marker influenced by multiple pathways, so it should not be used in isolation to make treatment decisions, and prospective interventional studies are needed to determine whether incorporating RDW into care pathways improves outcomes beyond standard risk models [^87ac2d16] [^62d22b8d].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined approach: verify the result and exclude artifacts, classify anemia with MCV and reticulocytes, treat the underlying cause and expect RDW to normalize with correction of the driver, repeat RDW in acute settings to capture trajectory, and use RDW judiciously for risk stratification in diseases like COVID-19, CAP, heart failure, critical illness, and CKD, while acknowledging that RDW is a marker of systemic stress rather than a causal factor or therapeutic target [^a356c698] [^c11038c1] [^1a3b1875] [^cfd2081a] [^50534230].

Elevated RDW signals **increased mortality and complications** across many conditions, including cardiovascular disease, sepsis, COVID-19, and cancer [^33541999] [^cfd2081a] [^a356c698] [^d8062c0b]. It is a **nonspecific marker** of systemic stress, inflammation, and impaired erythropoiesis, not a disease itself [^031a2a5b] [^f83acf0b]. Management should focus on identifying and treating the underlying cause — anemia, nutritional deficiency, inflammation, or organ dysfunction — and repeating RDW to track response [^b7602805] [^050fa2ca]. RDW can be used for risk stratification, but it is not a standalone diagnostic tool and should be interpreted in clinical context [^a356c698] [^87ac2d16].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated RDW

Elevated RDW reflects **anisocytosis** — variability in RBC size — and is a robust, independent predictor of adverse outcomes across diverse clinical settings [^33541999] [^cfd2081a]. It integrates information on inflammation, oxidative stress, nutritional status, and erythropoietic dysfunction, making it a sensitive but nonspecific marker of systemic disease [^031a2a5b] [^f83acf0b].

---

## Conditions associated with elevated RDW

Elevated RDW is observed in numerous **clinical conditions**, including:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Hematologic disorders | - Iron deficiency anemia <br/> - Vitamin B12/folate deficiency <br/> - Hemolytic anemia <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndromes <br/> - Aplastic anemia [^1cd238c5] [^985c1a09] |
| Cardiovascular diseases | - Heart failure <br/> - Coronary artery disease <br/> - Acute myocardial infarction <br/> - Pulmonary hypertension [^1a3b1875] [^ac4a5e5a] [^97447d64] |
| Inflammatory and infectious diseases | - Sepsis <br/> - Community-acquired pneumonia <br/> - COVID-19 <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease [^8da0fba7] [^c11038c1] [^a356c698] [^7dc68c75] |
| Chronic diseases | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^50534230] [^ee893d3e] [^99068b89] |
| Nutritional deficiencies | - Iron deficiency <br/> - Vitamin B12 deficiency <br/> - Folate deficiency [^1cd238c5] [^b7602805] |

---

## Prognostic implications

Elevated RDW consistently predicts **higher mortality**, cardiovascular events, and complications across populations:

- **General population**: Each 1% increase in RDW associates with a 22% higher all-cause mortality risk [^33541999].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Elevated RDW predicts mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction [^1a3b1875] [^ac4a5e5a].
- **Critical illness**: RDW independently predicts ICU, in-hospital, and 1-year mortality in critically ill patients [^cfd2081a].
- **COVID-19**: RDW > 14.5% at admission associates with a 2.73-fold higher mortality risk and tracks with disease severity [^a356c698] [^121e53c0].
- **Cancer**: Elevated RDW correlates with worse prognosis in upper aerodigestive tract cancers and other malignancies [^d8062c0b].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

When elevated RDW is detected, a **structured evaluation** is recommended:

- **Confirm the result**: Repeat CBC to exclude laboratory error or sample artifact [^notfound].
- **Assess anemia**: Evaluate hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear to classify anemia and identify causes [^14f6dc31].
- **Evaluate nutritional status**: Check iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), vitamin B12, and folate levels [^b7602805].
- **Assess inflammation**: Measure CRP or ESR to identify inflammatory drivers [^f83acf0b].
- **Evaluate organ function**: Assess renal, hepatic, and thyroid function as indicated [^notfound].
- **Consider disease-specific tests**: Based on clinical suspicion (e.g. hemolysis labs, bone marrow studies, COVID-19 testing) [^14f6dc31].

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **treating the underlying cause**:

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Replace iron, vitamin B12, or folate; monitor RDW for normalization as erythropoiesis recovers [^050fa2ca].
- **Anemia of chronic disease**: Treat the underlying inflammatory condition; consider erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in selected cases [^notfound].
- **Hemolytic anemia**: Identify and manage the cause (e.g. autoimmune, drug-induced, hereditary) [^notfound].
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes**: Refer to hematology for disease-modifying therapy and supportive care [^notfound].
- **Critical illness**: Use RDW for risk stratification and early intervention; repeat RDW to track disease trajectory [^a356c698] [^8da0fba7].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

RDW should be **monitored serially** to gauge treatment response and disease progression. In chronic conditions, periodic reassessment helps detect relapse or new pathology. In acute settings, repeating RDW within 48–72 hours can refine risk stratification and guide escalation [^cddea7e6].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Nonspecificity**: RDW is a general marker and not diagnostic; results must be interpreted in clinical context [^9d25ca1e].
- **Population variability**: Reference ranges may differ by lab and population; interpret accordingly [^c40aaa1f].
- **Confounders**: Age, comorbidities, and medications can influence RDW; consider these when interpreting results [^29b12c3c].

---

Elevated RDW is a **nonspecific marker** of systemic stress and impaired erythropoiesis that predicts adverse outcomes across many conditions. Management should focus on identifying and treating the underlying cause, with RDW used as a tool for risk stratification and monitoring response.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^4bc60a57]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 has a high rate of hospitalization, critical care requirement, and mortality. Identifying patients at highest risk for severe disease is important to faciliate early, aggressive intervention and to manage local hospital resources to mitigate the critical care crises that have impacted some hospital systems. In general, COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia, occasional thrombocytopenia, and overall leukopenia at hospital admission. The clinical course for patients who are hospitalized varies dramatically, with early evidence showing that ICU admission and mortality risk are associated with an elevated D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level and a decreasing lymphocyte count. Additional routine biomarkers for patient risk stratification are urgently needed.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a standard component of a routine complete blood count test. RDW quantifies the variation of individual red blood cell (RBC) volumes, which vary from one cell to the next and for the same cell as it circulates during its approximately 115-day lifespan. Elevated RDW is associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality; mortality from heart disease, pulmonary disease, sepsis, influenza, and cancer; complications associated with heart failure, severity of coronary artery disease and viral hepatitis, advanced stage and grade for many cancers; and the development of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, anemia, and many other conditions. RDW appears to be a nonspecific marker of illness that has the potential to provide general quantitative risk stratification that may be particularly useful for a new and unknown disease.

### Role of red blood cell distribution width, as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^121e53c0]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW), an indicator of anisocytosis has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in this ongoing context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the utility of RDW in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive screening of electronic databases was performed up to 30th April 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42020206685). Observational studies or interventional studies, evaluating the impact of RDW in COVID-19 outcomes (mortality and severity) are included in this meta-analysis. Our search retrieved 25 studies, with a total of 18,392 and 3,446 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher RDW levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.31–0.71; I² = 88% and SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.26–0.67; I² = 60%, respectively). In a sub-group analysis of 2,980 patients, RDW > 14.5 has been associated with increased risk of mortality (OR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.96–3.82; I² = 56%). However, the evidences is of low quality. A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.

### Exploring red cell distribution width as a biomarker for treatment efficacy in home mechanical ventilation [^71d3bd44]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) is increasingly used in several conditions of chronic respiratory failure (CRF) resulting in enhanced survival, reduced costs and improved health-related quality of life (HRQL). Guidelines have focused on patient selection and treatment initiation, but there is less data on how patients should be managed in the long term, and what markers are indicative of efficient therapy and increased chance of survival. Monitoring and intermittent analysis of vital signs and respiratory parameters recorded by ventilators are possible tools for evaluating treatment efficacy, but might pose a cumbersome method and are difficult to generalize. Blood gas parameters are regarded as treatment goals, but sampling is painful and results may vary based on sampling time and method, resulting in unreliable detection of insufficient support and dubious outcome prediction. Self-reported parameters such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency Questionnaire (SRI) might be indicative of long-term outcome, but results are subjective and variable. Laboratory biomarkers, especially ones able to reflect persistent effects over a period of time akin to HbA1c measurements in diabetic patients, pose an attractive alternative means of long-term monitoring, but so far no targets have been identified to evaluate treatment efficacy and to predict outcome in HMV patients.

Red cell distribution width (RDW), the variability in size of red blood cells traditionally used to differentiate anaemias, has gained wide recognition in recent years as a chronic disease prognostic marker. RDW and its association to poor outcome has been studied in several disease groups and populations (e.g.: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, community acquired pneumonia, venous thrombosis and in the general population), though it is unclear whether RDW is an independent predictor or rather a common marker of different pathways (inflammation, oxidative stress, aging, nutrition, erythropoiesis) affecting outcome.

As erythropoiesis is directly influenced by hypoxic stimuli, it is reasonable to expect that hypoxic CRF patients would have elevated RDW as a result of increased production of new, larger erythrocytes prompted by episodes of hypoxia. This mechanism is referred to as the erythropoietin risk-pathway model and has been credited in producing elevated RDW values in several conditions that might require HMV, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), muscular dystrophies and quadriplegia. Additionally, several other pathological pathways might contribute to abnormal RDW values in chronic respiratory failure such as inflammation, metabolic disturbances and nutritional issues.

Key messages

- Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of erythrocyte size variability, is a promising independent short- and long-term prognostic marker in ICU patients

- In this large U.S. cohort study including 17,922 patients from different types of ICUs, RDW was a strong and independent outcome predictor for ICU-, in-hospital, and 1-year mortality

- RDW further improved the prognostic accuracy of the SAPS score

### The diagnostic red blood cell distribution width as a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia [^3d748fae]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a marker that describes the degree of heterogeneity of erythrocyte volume. Because it is part of the routine automated output of blood cell counters, the RDW is included in the diagnostic work-up of most hematologic diseases and is easily and inexpensively assessed. Red blood cells (RBCs) typically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, which is why a delayed clearance of older erythrocytes leads to higher RDW levels. Subsequently, a higher RDW mirrors a dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis with either impaired erythropoiesis (including reticulocytosis and macrocytosis; eg, due to toxic effects) or abnormal (prolonged) RBC survival. Although, historically, the clinical meaning of the RDW was limited to the differential diagnosis of anemia, a wider applicability recently became evident. Increased RDW levels are associated with a higher mortality in healthy people, which has been linked to oxidative stress, poor nutritional status, and older age. Data also suggest that a high RDW defines a proinflammatory state, leading to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality, as well as a greater likelihood of developing a variety of malignancies.

### Managing discordance between hbAand glucose management indicator [^1f902bea]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conditions that affect the rate of turnover include:
Acute blood loss: increased red cell turnover leading to falsely low HbA₁c.
Haemolysis, for example, due to drugs (dapsone or penicillin derivates), irregular RBC antibodies or secondary autoimmune reactions: increased red cell turnover leading to falsely low HbA₁c. Elevated LDH and reduced haptoglobin are markers of haemolysis, and elevated reticulocytes are an indication of high turnover of RBC.
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA): HbA₁c may be falsely elevated in mild to moderate IDA but may be lower in severe IDA or with the correction of iron deficiency.
Non‐iron deficiency anaemia: HbA₁c may be falsely low due to a non‐iron deficiency anaemia.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end‐stage renal disease (ESRD): ESRD presents a complicated mixed picture; there may be iron deficiency which may increase HbA₁c, but conversely, this is affected by the use of erythropoietin which will stimulate RBC turnover and increase reticulocyte formation. In addition, the reduction of renal function may reduce the RBC lifespan before overt ESRD. Overall, HbA₁c values tend to be lower than expected in those with ESRD and in persons with more severe CKD (CKD 4). The guidelines for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease recommend not to use HbA 1c when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
Pregnancy: HbA₁c is reduced in the second trimester but is increased in the third trimester.
Homozygous and combined Hb variants (HbSS, HbCC, HbSC etc.): HbA₁c should not be reported if the Hb variant is homozygous, given the pathological processes, including anaemia, increased red cell turnover and transfusion requirements, that adversely impact HbA₁c as a marker of long‐term glycaemic control.

When any condition that could potentially affect RBC turnover is considered, it is important to first correctly identify the issue, then, if possible, treat and resolve the underlying issue before relying on HbA₁c. This may take 6 months, and RBC indices such as red cell distribution width (RDW) can offer a marker of stabilisation of the RBC population.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^a356c698]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, an RDW greater than 14.5% at the time of admission for SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an increase in mortality risk (from 11% to 31%) in a cohort of 1641 patients treated at a large academic medical center network. Risk of mortality associated with RDW remained statistically significant after adjustment for patient age, race, ethnicity, D-dimer level, absolute lymphocyte count, other blood count measures, and 5 major comorbidities. Patients whose RDW increased during admission also had an increased mortality risk. RDW is routinely measured and may be helpful for prioritizing patients for early, aggressive intervention and managing local hospital resource use.

Patients with elevated RDW at admission were 6.12 times more likely to die within 48 hours (23 of 470 patients [4.9%]) than patients with a normal RDW (9 of 1175 patients [0.8%]). This rapid decompensation is consistent with hospital presentation after substantial disease progression, but timing of disease onset was not available for this cohort. Elevated RDW resulted in a larger increase in mortality risk in younger patients (< 70 years) compared with older patients. This finding may reflect the higher overall mortality rate for older patients, dampening an RDW effect measured in terms of relative risk. A contributing factor may be the lower RDW at admission in the younger age groups (Table 1), which implies that an RDW > 14.5% represents a larger change compared with baseline RDW in these younger patients. It is also possible that an RDW greater than 14.5% is a stronger inflammatory marker in younger patients than in older patients, but studies that are specifically designed to test this hypothesis are required. Race and ethnicity were not statistically significantly associated with an increased mortality risk after adjusting for age and RDW, suggesting that neither race nor ethnicity had implications for patient outcomes after admission. Patients who self-reported Black/African American race or Hispanic ethnicity were overrepresented in the admitted hospital cohort (17% Black/African American and 30% Hispanic) compared with 9% and 12% in a Massachusetts population, consistent with a higher risk of infection in these racial and ethnic groups.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^8da0fba7]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We found that an increase in RDW from baseline during the first 72 hours after hospitalization is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, a combination of baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker for mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Although further research is required to determine the precise mechanisms underlying the association between RDW and mortality, this study provides support for future investigations considering changes of RDW and the associated stratification of critically ill patients at risk for mortality.

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^97447d64]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RDW is one of the parameters in complete blood count (CBC) that measures variation in red blood cell size or volume (anisocytosis). The most common cause of an elevated RDW is anemia [evaluated in association with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in differential diagnosis]. Regardless of that higher than normal RDW has also been described as a risk factor for unfavourable clinical course in various diseases in children. RDW is known to be a prognostic marker in adult with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the PAH pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in management.

### Relation of red blood cell distribution width to risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, death, and effect of alirocumab after acute coronary syndromes [^4b12b9d6]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death in patients with cardiovascular disease. The ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial compared alirocumab with placebo in 18,924 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated atherogenic lipoproteins despite optimized statin treatment. This post hoc analysis determined whether RDW independently predicts risk of MACE and death in patients after recent ACS, whether RDW influences MACE reduction with alirocumab, and whether alirocumab treatment affects RDW. Associations of baseline RDW with risk of MACE and death were analyzed in the placebo group in adjusted proportional hazards models. Interactions of RDW and treatment on the risk of MACE and death were evaluated. An increasing quartile of RDW was associated with characteristics that predicted risk of MACE and death including age, hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerotic conditions and events, revascularizations, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. After adjusting for baseline characteristics associated with the risk of MACE or death, baseline RDW remained independently associated with the risk of MACE and death in the placebo group (hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] 1.08 [1.02–1.15] and 1.13 [1.03–1.24] per 1% increase of RDW, respectively, both p < 0.001). There was no interaction of RDW and treatment on MACE or death, nor did alirocumab affect RDW. RDW was associated with an increased risk of MACE and death, independent of established risk factors.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^f1952d03]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and severe morbidity. RDW as a prognostic marker was unrelated with hemoglobin levels on admission.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^41570bef]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume (MCV), an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies, have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs. Because RBCs characteristically decrease in cellular volume across their lifespan, persistence of these older, smaller cells thus increases volume variance, and this clearance delay coincides with and offsets a net decrease in RBC production. These reports suggest the possibility that an elevated RDW in some circumstances may reflect a clinical state in which RBC production and turnover have slowed in the setting of increased production and turnover of leukocytes or platelets such as would occur in inflammation. Although a definitive mechanism for RDW elevation has not yet been established, there is evidence that RDW can provide robust risk-stratification among patients diagnosed with the same acute illness. In this study, our aim was to investigate whether an association exists between mortality risk and elevated RDW measured at hospital admission and during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^89d883a8]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Both RDW and the albumin concentration have been suggested as integrative biomarkers for a multidimensional dysfunctional physiological status that relates to inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutrition, but they represent these pathological aspects from different perspectives. Therefore, considering their essential roles in physiological function, disease, and assessment of aging, the integration of these 2 markers may be valuable for predicting mortality. The ratio of RDW to albumin concentration (RAR), a marker derived from routine laboratory tests, may convey large amounts of information beyond either value alone. Most recently, RAR has emerged as a potential risk biomarker for adverse outcomes in various diseases, including acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and stroke. However, whether RAR is associated with mortality in the general population remains unknown.

To address this knowledge gap, we first hypothesized that elevated RAR is associated with increased risk of mortality in the general population and then examined the potential association bnonetween RAR levels and the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the UK Biobank.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7ed56761]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory illness with a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. Biomarkers are urgently needed for patient risk stratification. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a component of complete blood counts that reflects cellular volume variation, has been shown to be associated with elevated risk for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases.

Objective

To investigate whether an association between mortality risk and elevated RDW at hospital admission and during hospitalization exists in patients with COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included adults diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted to 1 of 4 hospitals in the Boston, Massachusetts area (Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, and Newton-Wellesley Hospital) between March 4, 2020, and April 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was patient survival during hospitalization. Measures included RDW at admission and during hospitalization, with an elevated RDW defined as greater than 14.5%. Relative risk (RR) of mortality was estimated by dividing the mortality of those with an elevated RDW by the mortality of those without an elevated RDW. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

A total of 1641 patients were included in the study (mean [SD] age, 62[18] years; 886 men [54%]; 740 White individuals [45%] and 497 Hispanic individuals [30%]; 276 nonsurvivors [17%]). Elevated RDW (> 14.5%) was associated with an increased mortality risk in patients of all ages. The RR for the entire cohort was 2.73, with a mortality rate of 11% in patients with normal RDW (1173) and 31% in those with an elevated RDW (468). The RR in patients younger than 50 years was 5.25 (normal RDW, 1% [n = 341]; elevated RDW, 8% [n = 65]); 2.90 in the 50- to 59-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 256]; elevated RDW, 24% [n = 63]); 3.96 in the 60- to 69-year age group (normal RDW, 8% [n = 226]; elevated RDW, 30% [104]); 1.45 in the 70- to 79-year age group (normal RDW, 23% [n = 182]; elevated RDW, 33% [n = 113]); and 1.59 in those ≥ 80 years (normal RDW, 29% [n = 168]; elevated RDW, 46% [n = 123]). RDW was associated with mortality risk in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, D-dimer (dimerized plasmin fragment D) level, absolute lymphocyte count, and common comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension (hazard ratio of 1.09 per 0.5% RDW increase and 2.01 for an RDW > 14.5% vs ≤ 14.5%; P < .001). Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network.

### Red cell distribution width improves the simplified acute physiology score for risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients [^49fc0e76]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Strengths of this study are the large number of patients across different types of ICUs and the availability of a rich annotation of the physiological and clinical context, which allowed rigorous adjustment for severity of acute illness and subgroup analyses with high statistical power. We also included 1-year survival data on all the patients.

This study has limitations; as it was a retrospective, observational study, we were not able to assess causes for mortality and/or for elevated RDW. Also, our data provide no additional information about inflammation and oxidative stress. These pieces of information would be necessary to understand better the pathophysiology underlying the observed effects. Also, only admission RDW levels were considered, and it remains unclear whether changes over time of RDW may provide additional prognostic information. Importantly, we used SAPS, and more recent severity-of-illness scores (such as SAPS III or APACHE IV) have shown superior accuracy for outcome prediction; thus, future studies should address whether RDW has the potential also to improve these severity-of-illness scores. We calculated multivariable regression models, including important demographics and different comorbidities, to investigate the independent association of RDW and outcome; yet, co-linearity and missing clinical information on some important patient-history items (that is, transfusion) may limit the interpretation of the models.

### Prognostic significance of red cell distribution width to albumin ratio in ICU patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a retrospective analysis [^203ca790]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a type of metabolic stress liver injury characterized by the presence of 5% or more steatosis in liver cells, which is associated with metabolic risk factors. Due to the potential pathogenesis of NAFLD, an international panel of experts has recommended that its name be changed to "Metabolic dysfunction-related fatty liver Disease" (MAFLD). Currently, NAFLD is recognized as the most common liver disease, and its prevalence is increasing every year, affecting approximately 25% of adults worldwide. Individuals with NAFLD are not only at risk for more severe liver damage, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), liver cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but they also face a heightened risk for extra-hepatic events like metabolic syndrome (MetS), cardiovascular complications, diabetes (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cancers. This situation places a significant economic and healthcare burden on society. Therefore, it is essential to identify simple and reliable biomarkers for early intervention in NAFLD.

Although liver biopsy remains the gold standard for evaluating disease severity and treatment response, its invasive nature and limitations hinder widespread use. In contrast, hematological and imaging techniques have gained much attention due to their noninvasive and reproducible advantages.

Extensive evidence indicates that inflammation significantly impacts the onset and progression of NAFLD by promoting insulin resistance, oxidative stress, liver inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic fibrosis. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a routine laboratory item identifying abnormal size distribution of red blood cells (RBC) in peripheral blood. Elevated RDW is linked to systemic inflammation and various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. Serum albumin reflects nutritional and inflammatory status, and lower albumin levels have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death. Combining these two measures may be a more meaningful assessment of disease prognosis. So far, the red blood cell distribution width/albumin ratio (RAR) is considered a potential risk biomarker for adverse outcomes related to diabetes vascular complications, MetS, CKD, heart failure, and other disorders.

Elevated RDW at Admission and Mortality Risk

Patients whose RDW was greater than 14.5% at admission for a COVID-19 diagnosis had a mortality risk of 31%, whereas those with an RDW of 14.5% or less had a mortality risk of 11%. The RR of mortality for those with an elevated RDW was 2.73 (95% CI, 2.52–2.94). Age has previously been shown to be a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. In patient groups stratified by age, elevated RDW remained associated with increased relative risk of mortality for patients younger than 50 years, 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 80 years or older (Figure 1 and Table 2). For patients in the 70- to 79- year age group, the RR was elevated (1.45) but was not statistically significant. Relative risk was particularly elevated within 48 hours of admission, with patients with a normal RDW of 14.5% or less having a mortality of 0.8% (9 of 1175 patients) within 48 hours of admission, whereas the mortality rate for those with an RDW greater than 14.5% was 4.9% (23 of 470 patients), a risk ratio of 6.12. Risk ratios for different age groups were significantly different compared with each other, suggesting an effect modification, with an elevated RDW having a larger effect on mortality for younger patients (< 70 years) than it had for older patients.

Elevated Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) at Hospital Admission and Mortality Among Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019

Across all age groups, an RDW greater than 14.5% measured at the time of admission was associated with a 31% mortality compared with an 11% mortality for patients whose RDW at admission was ≤ 14.5%. All increases in mortality are statistically significant except in the 70- to 80-year age group. Table 2 details age-stratified and RDW-stratified mortality rates.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^7485eba4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Conditions that elevate red cell distribution width

Apart from its usual application as a hematologic parameter, RDW has been extensively studied as an inflammatory marker, along with its capability to express the activity and severity of various disease states and conditions. Probably the first recorded strong correlation of RDW with laboratory indices of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), came after a retrospective study of 3845 outpatient adults performed by Lippi et al.

Cardiovascular diseases, malignancy, chronic lower respiratory diseases, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease and autoimmune disorders belong to a group of disorders where inflammation and oxidative stress comprise the major pathophysiologic insults. Data from the international literature showed that in these clinical entities, an elevated RDW value was related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and could be used as a predictor of an unfavorable disease course.

Despite the encouraging data concerning its potential as a prognostic marker of morbidity, mortality and unfavorable disease course in various pathologic conditions, in everyday clinical practice RDW remains a parameter used to define and differentiate anemias.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^5ca5cec4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that the RAR, which is derived from blood RDW and serum albumin concentrations, was strongly and independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, as well as mortality due to malignant neoplasm, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, diabetes, and others in the general population. Additionally, since RAR is assessed via routine laboratory tests, it could be recognized as a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensively accessible for identifying individuals in clinical practice at high risk of mortality. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and investigate the potential relationship between RAR and all-cause mortality risk.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^9a990cfb]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Measuring RDW on admission is relatively simple and can be done during routine evaluation at the emergency room. Our data suggest that it may offer the physician another tool in the process of decision making whether to admit a patient diagnosed with CAP, in addition to the various scores that were developed in recent years for this purpose. Indeed, if RDW is proven to be a prognostic factor in older patients admitted with CAP, it might even be incorporated into such scores. In concordance with our data, several studies demonstrated the relation between mortality and elevated RDW in middle aged and older adults. To our knowledge, our study is the first to show the poor prognostic effect of elevated RDW in young patients with CAP.

The major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. In addition, our study examined RDW as a prognostic factor only in patients 60 years old and less. The majority of mortality and severe mortality in patients with CAP is in elderly patients, many of them have chronic hematologic and inflammatory co-morbidities. A larger cohort of this complex population is needed to clarify RDW as an independent risk factor in this population and to validate it prospectively including other inflammatory markers such as CRP, procalcitonin and IL-6. Notably, our study was planned to detect the association between elevated RDW and prognosis of CAP; however, we did not examine whether this observation is unique to CAP or could be demonstrated in other inflammatory and infectious states.

Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Immidiate diagnosis of this disease is crucial, because this condition can lead to appendiceal perforation, potential peritonitis, and even death. We read with great interest the article 'The role of red cell distribution width (RDW) in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study' by Narci et al. and wanted to discuss whether RDW alone provide certain information about the inflammatory status of the patient with acute appendicitis.

### Association between red blood cell distribution width and mortality and severity among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed4e57d9]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence has underscored the potential usefulness of red blood cell distribution width (RDW) measurement in predicting the mortality and disease severity of COVID-19. This study aimed to assess the association of the plasma RDW levels with adverse prognosis in COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive literature search from inception to September 2020 was performed to harvest original studies reporting RDW on admission and clinical outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. RDW levels were compared between cases (patients who died or developed more severe symptoms) and controls (patients who survived or developed less severe symptoms). A total of 14,866 subjects from 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Higher levels of RDW were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients (mean differences = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.47–0.97; I² = 89.51%). Deceased patients had higher levels of RDW compared to patients who survived (mean differences = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.63–1.23; I² = 85.58%). Severely ill COVID-19 patients showed higher levels of RDW, as opposed to patients classified to have milder symptoms (mean differences = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.28–0.94; I² = 82.18%). Elevated RDW levels were associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. This finding warrants further research on whether RDW could be utilized as a simple and reliable biomarker for predicting COVID-19 severity and whether RDW is mechanistically linked with COVID-19 pathophysiology.

### Red cell distribution width is associated with hemoglobin A1c elevation, but not glucose elevation [^ee893d3e]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To investigate the association between red cell distribution width (RDW) and elevation of glucose/glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

Methods

An analysis was conducted using data from a prospective cohort study of adults. People without prediabetes or diabetes (n = 7,795) were followed for a mean of 2.90years (range: 1-7years, 95% confidence interval: 2.86–2.94years). Glucose elevation is defined as fasting glucose levels exceeding 5.6mmol/l, or 2-hour glucose values in the oral glucose tolerance test exceeding 7.8mmol/l. HbA1c elevation is defined as a HbA1c value exceeding a normal limit of 39mmol/mol (5.7%). Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between RDW quartiles and elevation of HbA1c/glucose.

Results

The multiple-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of HbA1c elevation for increased quartiles of RDW were 1.00 (reference), 1.08 (0.89, 1.30), 1.28 (1.07, 1.54), and 1.54 (1.29, 1.85) (P for trend < 0.0001). However, no significant association was observed between RDW and blood glucose (fasting and postprandial).

Conclusions

Elevated RDW is independently related to future HbA1c elevation, but not to glucose elevation. This suggests that RDW may associate with HbA1c through a non-glycemic way, which should be taken into consideration when using HbA1c as a diagnostic criterion of prediabetes or diabetes.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^456d4cf1]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin concentration (RAR) associated with mortality in the general population?

Findings

In this cohort study involving 469 572 participants at baseline and 44 383 deaths during follow-up periods, higher RAR levels were associated with increased risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the RAR, assessed via routine laboratory tests, could be a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensive for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality in clinical practice.

### Practical guidance for the management of iron deficiency in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^14f6dc31]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^87ac2d16]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Patients with many different underlying acute and chronic illnesses would be expected to have a higher baseline RDW, and it is possible that the RDW measured at admission is a nonspecific summary marker of the presence of these illnesses that have been shown to be associated with elevated RDW and may be expected to complicate the COVID-19 clinical course. Regardless of the reasons for the differences in RDW at admission, the association of elevated RDW with increased mortality risk appears to persist after admission, as demonstrated by the higher mortality rate for patients in the present cohort whose RDW increased during hospitalization.

Limitations

This study has limitations. It describes the potential value of RDW for risk stratification of admitted patients with COVID-19, but because the present analysis was limited to a hospitalized cohort, these results may not apply to individuals with COVID-19 who are not hospitalized. Because the time of initial infection was unavailable, these results are not specific to any disease progression time points. The cohort may have been underpowered for evaluation of mortality risk associated with self-reported Black/African American race. In addition, the socioeconomic status, of patients was unavailable, and the potential association of mortality risk with socioeconomic status could not be assessed. The study included few younger patients (206 patients younger than 40 years, 2 deaths), and results should only be considered valid for those older than 40 years. In addition, although results in this study spanned 4 hospitals, they are located in the same geographic region (Boston, Massachusetts). Although other studies support the potential value of RDW for risk stratification in inflammatory scenarios, this study cohort may not be representative of other US and non-US populations.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^7dc68c75]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

RDW in IBD

There are different proposed mechanisms that attempt to explain why RDW is elevated in active IBD and how this is correlated with disease activity. The most probable encountered etiologies involve anemia, and especially iron deficiency anemia (IDA), as well as the impact of inflammation and oxidative stress on the normal process of erythropoiesis.

Anemia in IBD seems to be multifactorial, with an estimated prevalence between 9–74%, while IDA represents the commonest type. Causes implicated include continuous microscopic or macroscopic blood loss from the ulcerated intestinal mucosa, nutritional deficits of vitamins and minerals (iron, folate, B12) due to decreased intake or absorption, effects of medication, and inflammatory insults in the process of hematopoiesis. The RDW value is directly affected and subsequently elevated in IDA, as well as in situations of B12 and folate deprivation, while it is known that the degree and severity of anemia in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to disease activity.

IBD are chronic and relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation through the exertional effect of cytokines — interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ — may cause impaired erythropoietin (EPO) production, alterations of red blood cell life span, diminished responsiveness of bone marrow to EPO and impaired iron metabolism, disrupting the normal process of hematopoiesis. Data from the international literature suggest that anemia in IBD is multifactorial and is considered to be a combination of IDA and anemia of chronic disease (ACD), caused by a series of negative effects of an activated immune system at different levels of erythropoiesis.

The presence of RBC populations with marked heterogeneity in size, as a result of anemia and deficient erythropoiesis due to direct and indirect effects of inflammation and oxidative stress, seems to be an attractive hypothesis that can possibly explain the correlation of RDW with disease activity. The international literature contains a rather small number of publications that aimed to investigate RDW as an index of activity in IBD, or its correlation with clinical and laboratory markers used to express active disease (Table 2).

### Red blood cell distribution width and ischaemic stroke [^9ee78464]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of red blood cell (RBC) size heterogeneity, which is easily calculated by dividing the SD of erythrocyte volumes for the mean corpuscular volume. Recent reporter suggested that, besides haematological diseases and anaemia, many human disorders may be closely associated with the elevated RDW. A literature review has revealed the RDW may be closely related to the development of ischaemic stroke, carotid artery atherosclerosis and cerebral embolism. Higher RDW could independently predict adverse outcomes in patients in these conditions.

### Red blood cell distribution width is a predictor of readmission in cardiac patients [^227b8dc7]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Three-quarters of rehospitalizations (44 billion yearly estimated cost) may be avoidable. A screening tool for the detection of potential readmission may facilitate more efficient case management.

Hypothesis

An elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is an independent predictor of hospital readmission in patients with unstable angina (UA) or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Methods

The study is a retrospective observational cohort analysis of adults admitted in 2007 with UA or NSTEMI. Data were gathered by review of inpatient medical records. The rate of 30-day nonelective readmission and time to nonelective readmission were recorded until November 1, 2011, and compared by RDW group using the 95th percentile (16.3%) as a cutoff.

Results

The median follow-up time of the 503 subjects (average age, 65 ± 13 years; 56% male) was 3.8 years (interquartile range: 0.3–4.3 years). Those readmitted within 30 days were older, had more comorbidities and higher RDW and creatinine levels, and were more likely to have had an intervention. At 3.8 years of follow-up, subjects with high RDW (> 16.3%) were more likely to be readmitted compared to those with normal RDW (≤ 16.3%) (72.28% vs 59.95%, P = 0.003). In multivariable analyses, high RDW was a statistically significant predictor of readmission in general (hazard ratio: 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.02–1.79), P = 0.033) but not of 30-day rehospitalization (odds ratio: 1.34 (95% CI: 0.78–2.31), P = 0.292). Its area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.54 (sensitivity 23% and specificity 85%).

Conclusions

An elevated RDW is an independent predictor of hospital readmission in patients with UA or NSTEMI.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^1cd238c5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical utility of RDW

RDW, a parameter measured automatically in every complete blood count (CBC), is an actual reflection of RBC size variability and heterogeneity. RDW is considered as a reliable index of the anisocytosis of the RBC population circulating in peripheral blood. There are 2 different ways to express RDW statistically: as a coefficient of variation (RDW-CV) and/or a standard deviation (RDW-SD). RDW-SD (expressed in fL) is an actual evaluation of the width of the RBC size distribution histogram and is quantified after determination of the width (in fL) at the 20% height level of that histogram. This index is therefore not influenced by the average size of the RBC population, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).

On the other hand, RDW-CV (expressed in %) is derived from a mathematical formula that includes SD and MCV:

RDW-CV (%) = 1 standard deviation of RBC volume / MCV × 100% and it is affected by variations in RBC size. Anemias were traditionally classified, according to their MCV value, as microcytic (MCV below the reference range), normocytic (MCV within the reference range) and macrocytic (MCV above the reference range). In the early 80s a different approach was proposed for anemia classification using both RDW and MCV.

Based on this classification, 2 distinct entities of anemias were described: one with a homogeneous erythrocyte population and normal RDW, and a second with a heterogeneous erythrocyte population and a greater RDW. The main conditions that influence and elevate RDW value include anemias due to nutritional deficiencies (iron, B12 and folate), hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemias, and sickle-cell anemia (Table 1).

### Exploring red cell distribution width as a biomarker for treatment efficacy in home mechanical ventilation [^bc32390a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data showing greater improvement in self-reported HRQL and sleepiness scales, as well as physical functional status in the group with clinically relevant RDW improvement are promising, as these factors have been reported to be predictive of mortality in HMV, which suggests that RDW change may correspond with improving outcome. Additionally, the data suggesting that RDW improvement at six months of HMV treatment is comparably reliable as improvements in other parameters traditionally used to evaluate treatment efficacy, such as paCO₂, ESS and SRI-SS, while ostensibly having the advantage of more objective, consistent and reliable sampling, makes RDW a promising candidate for future research.

Our study has several limitations, most importantly that it includes a heterogeneous patient population with high probability of other causes influencing RDW values. As this was a preliminary study evaluating the potential role of RDW as a treatment marker for HMV, we aimed to include a mixed-case patient population reflecting the real-life practice of HMV centres. Our results indicate that different patient groups have different RDW values, although we did not investigate whether specific comorbidities might play a role in this. Further studies should focus on the potential confounding roles of comorbidities, which patients are more prone to show elevated RDW values and what predictive role elevated RDW values play. The baseline RDW differences observed based on referral type in our study suggest that patients with hospital referrals (generally booked after an episode of acute exacerbation) might explain the increased RDW values and subsequent improvement we observed, as acute illness often entails blood transfusions, ischemic episodes and septic complications, which have all been reported to cause elevated RDW. As previously reported, acute hypoxia-associated diseases cause RDW elevation with a maximum one month after onset of the condition and normalization about six months later. Although we found similar RDW change kinetics after starting HMV treatment, referral type did not predict RDW improvement in our model. Additionally, as described in the previously referenced study, pleural effusion and pneumothorax is associated with large increases in RDW, while pneumonia leads to smaller RDW increments and most diseases of airway obstruction (asthma, COPD, OSA) do not prompt sudden increase in RDW values, suggesting that the values recorded in the hospital referral group in our prospective study were not the effect of the acute exacerbation precluding the referral but rather a marker of chronic disease severity (e.g. sicker patients were more likely to be recruited to the HMV program in association with an acute exacerbation).

### Usefulness of red cell width distribution (RDW) in the assessment of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^d93c5e6b]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Red cell width distribution (RDW) is known to be a prognostic marker in adults with pulmonary hypertension. The value of this test in the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pediatric population was not yet established. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW in children with PAH and utility of this parameter in the management. Data were collected retrospectively in 61 patients with PAH confirmed by right heart catheterization. RDW was measured at diagnosis, 3 and 12 months after initial therapy, during and after deterioration if occurred. Results were compared with NTproBNP, WHO-FC and oxygen blood saturation. Mean RDW at baseline was 15.3 ± 2.4% (12.1–24.4, median 14.7%) and was elevated in 29 patients (47%). There were no significant difference in clinical status, NTproBNP and hemodynamic parameters among patient with normal and elevated RDW at diagnosis. Poor negative correlation with SaO₂ and SvO₂ was shown. After 3 and 12 months of treatment no significant change of RDW level was found despite of statistically significant improvement of WHO-FC and decrease of NTproBNP level (NS). Episodes of clinical deterioration weren't connected with change of RDW level (16 vs. 15.6% NS). Kaplan–Meier analysis did not show differences in prognosis between patients with normal and elevated RDW. Elevation of RDW was not associated with any measured parameters. Prognostic value of RDW in the pediatric PAH population was not confirmed. Usefulness of RDW in management in PAH pediatric population is limited and required further studies.

### CDC recommendations for lead poisoning prevention in newly arrived refugee children [^10972d06]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Early post-arrival evaluation and therapy — Upon US arrival, all refugee children should have nutritional evaluations performed, and should be provided with appropriate nutritional and vitamin supplements as indicated. Pre-existing health burdens and iron deficiency increase lead absorption through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. At a minimum, the nutritional evaluation should include an evaluation of the children's iron status including a hemoglobin/hematocrit and one or more of the following: an evaluation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) combined with red cell distribution width (RDW); ferritin; transferrin saturation; or reticulocyte hemoglobin content. Evaluate the value of iron supplementation among refugee children, with study of iron supplementation expected to provide needed data on its efficacy to reduce nutritional deficiencies and reduce lead absorption through the GI tract.

| Respirable crystalline silica dust exposure has long been known to be a serious health threat to workers in many industries and occupations. Workers with high exposure to crystalline silica include miners, sandblasters, tunnel workers, silica millers, quarry workers, foundry workers, and ceramics and glass workers Overexposure to respirable crystalline silica dust can has been associated with development of silicosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and airways disease. This in turn can generate large quantities of dust, often containing elevated levels of respirable crystalline silica, which can be liberated into the work environment. |. The outer nozzle incorporates an air exhaust system, which exhausts excess pressure from the bag when it has finished filling. The exhaust system is powered by an eductor, which uses the venturi effect to exhaust the bag at approximately 50 cubic feet per minute.

Depressurizing the bag reduces the "rooster-tail" of product which spews from the bag when it is ejected from the fill station. This study showed that the bag operator's and bag stacker's respirable dust exposures were reduced by 62% and 66%, respectively, when using the extended polyethylene valve, as compared to the standard paper valve. The extended polyethylene valve was a plastic liner 4½ inches inside a standard paper valve. Bulk Loading
- Enclosed cabs. Frequently, bulk loading is performed using a front-end loader to load open-container trailer trucks. This is normally performed outdoors with coarser product material, which does not generate a substantial amount of respirable dust. Nevertheless, the front-end loader should have a structurally competent enclosed cab with an effective filtration and pressurization system.
- Telescoping loadout spout.

Many different manufacturers produce telescoping loadout spouts, which minimize the amount of dust generated during the bulk loading process. Allowing ore to fall or drop significant distances creates more dust than when the drop distance is minimized. To minimize the drop distance, telescoping loadout spouts extend the loading location so that it is directly above the ore. These systems have been used for many years and are effective at minimizing dust liberation during bulk loading. Figure

### Red cell distribution width improves the simplified acute physiology score for risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients [^cfd2081a]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recently, red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of erythrocyte size variability, has been shown to be a prognostic marker in critical illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether adding RDW has the potential to improve the prognostic performance of the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) to predict short- and long-term mortality in an independent, large, and unselected population of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Methods

This observational cohort study includes 17,922 ICU patients with available RDW measurements from different types of ICUs. We modeled the association between RDW and mortality by using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, hematocrit, and severity of illness by using the SAPS.

Results

ICU-, in-hospital-, and 1-year mortality rates in the 17,922 included patients were 7.6% (95% CI, 7.2 to 8.0), 11.2% (95% CI, 10.8 to 11.7), and 25.4% (95% CI, 24.8 to 26.1). RDW was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR per 1% increase in RDW (95%CI)) (1.14 (1.08 to 1.19), P < 0.0001), ICU mortality (1.10 (1.06 to 1.15), P < 0.0001), and 1-year mortality (1.20 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.26); P < 0.001). Adding RDW to SAPS significantly improved the AUC from 0.746 to 0.774 (P < 0.001) for in-hospital mortality and 0.793 to 0.805 (P < 0.001) for ICU mortality. Significant improvements in classification of SAPS were confirmed in reclassification analyses. Subgroups demonstrated robust results for gender, age categories, SAPS categories, anemia, hematocrit categories, and renal failure.

Conclusions

RDW is a promising independent short- and long-term prognostic marker in ICU patients and significantly improves risk stratification of SAPS. Further research is needed the better to understand the pathophysiology underlying these effects.

### Red cell distribution width and risk of coronary heart disease events [^53fc44b5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Red cell distribution width (RDW) has emerged as a powerful predictor of all-cause mortality in variety of cardiovascular settings. However, no data are available associating RDW with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a healthy and nationally representative multiethnic population. A total of 7,556 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 1999 to 2006 (age 41.5 ± 15.8 years, 60% women) were divided into 3 categories according to their 10-year Framingham risk of hard CHD events: < 10% (n = 6,173, reference category), 10% to 20% (n = 1,093, intermediate-risk category), and > 20% (n = 290, high-risk category). Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed evaluating RDW as a predictor of CHD risk. Each unit increase (0.1) in RDW posed a statistically significant greater odds of being in the intermediate-risk category (odds ratio -1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 1.45, p < 0.001) and high-risk category (odds ratio -1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 1.53, p < 0.001) compared to the reference category, after adjusting for race, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume. Additional adjustments with serum iron, vitamin B(12), and folic acid levels did not affect the association. Subsequently, we divided participants into 2 categories according to their anemia status (as defined by the World Health Organization) to evaluate its effect. An RDW level greater than the seventy-fifth percentile in both anemic and nonanemic participants was a significant predictor of greater CHD risk while RDW of the seventy-fifth percentile or less in anemic participants failed to predict CHD (compared to nonanemic participants with similar RDW as the reference category). In conclusion, a higher RDW appears to be a powerful independent predictor of future CHD risk.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^9d25ca1e]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Other studies have noted the potential value of using RDW for a differential diagnosis of pneumonia, or as a marker of complication rates in SARS-CoV-2 infection, either directly or as a component of a machine learning framework. Recent small-scale studies have included RDW in multivariate models along with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratioor hemoglobinfor a differential diagnosis of COVID-19. The results of the present study show that the use of RDW as a univariate marker relative to its predetermined reference interval (≤ 14.5%) is associated with substantially increased mortality risk. We also found that RDW was associated with the highest risk ratio when considered in multivariate models with some other blood count measures (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The only other blood count measure studied with a statistically significant risk ratio was PLT count, and future investigation is warranted given the evidence of thrombotic complications within COVID-19 patients.

The specific mechanism or mechanisms for the RDW alteration associated with COVID-19 remain unclear. RDW is a nonspecific marker of general illness, and is therefore unlikely to be causally associated with COVID-19 disease progression. COVID-19 is associated with altered turnover in all WBC lineages, as noted previously, as well as with altered platelet dynamics in COVID-associated coagulopathy. The association of elevated RDW with COVID-19 severity could be consistent with previous reports (in non–COVID-19 cohorts), suggesting that RDW can become elevated when RBC production kinetics have slowed in the setting of increased WBC and platelet kinetics.

It is unknown whether patients admitted with an RDW greater than 14.5% had higher baseline RDW than those who were admitted with an RDW of 14.5% or less before SARS-CoV-2 infection. RDW usually changes slowly because it reflects the volume variance of a cell population that is turning over at a rate typically no larger than a 1% or 2% per day. The large increase in the elevated RDW group (> 3% shown in Figure 3 A) may suggest a longer duration of disease for these patients at the time of admission, but direct study of the earlier phases of the disease is required to know how quickly RDW may be evolving before hospitalization, and determination of time of initial infection was not possible within this study cohort.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^a7bec852]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that in young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels on admission either alone or in combination with abnormal levels of WBC are associated with significant higher rates of mortality and complicated hospitalization. RDW level as a prognostic marker was unrelated to hemoglobin levels on admission.

RDW is a simple laboratory test used to evaluate variance in the size and form of red blood cells. It is an important marker in the differential diagnosis of anemia. However, RDW was shown to be a predictor of severe morbidity and mortality in several cardiac problems. There is a large body of evidence showing that RDW is a strong predictor for an adverse outcome in these conditions, equivalent to other known markers, such as low ejection fraction, high New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) score and elevated serum B-Type Natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Moreover, it was recently reported that RDW is a strong predictor of mortality in several other conditions such as obesity, malignancies, and chronic kidney disease. Concordant with our findings, Wang et al. reported recently that a graded independent relation between higher RDW and adverse outcomes in ICU patients.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with short-and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis and sepsis [^5654061c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal emergency with a rising global incidence. Epidemiological studies estimate the annual incidence of AP to range from approximately 13 to 135 cases per 100,000 population, depending on regional variations. Globally, the incidence has been increasing at an average annual rate of 3.07%. The most common etiological factors include gallstones, alcohol consumption, hyperlipidemia, and certain medications, such as rifampicin, diuretics, and immunosuppressive agents. Clinically, AP is typically characterized by persistent, radiating abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pathophysiology of AP is complicated, and it is often associated with the activation of gastrointestinal enzymes, kinin system, pancreas damage, and inflammation. While mild cases of AP generally have a favorable prognosis, severe cases — particularly those complicated by sepsis, organ failure, or pancreatic necrosis — are associated with high morbidity and a mortality rate of up to 20%. This systemic involvement creates an environment characterized by oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine release, and impaired microcirculation — all of which can influence hematological parameters. One such parameter is red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a routinely available measure that reflects the variability in red blood cell size.

RDW has been associated with a wide range of clinical conditions. Elevated RDW levels are commonly observed in patients with conditions such as megaloblastic anemia and aplastic anemia. As a key hematological parameter, RDW plays a crucial role in assessing changes in red blood cell volume, thereby aiding clinicians in the classification and diagnosis of different types of anemia. Moreover, elevated RDW has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Increased RDW has also been shown to be related to inflammation. Previous studies have suggested that RDW may be associated with the prognosis of sepsis. He et al. showed that RDW is a risk factor in patients with AP, but this study did not address the impact of concurrent sepsis — a common and often fatal complication of severe AP.

Given the high mortality associated with AP and sepsis, and the potential of RDW as an accessible and cost-effective prognostic biomarker, it is essential to investigate its predictive value in this specific population. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether RDW is independently associated with short-term and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AP and sepsis.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-RDW ratio with contrast-associated acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary angiography: a retrospective study [^d2fe5903]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Contrast‐associated acute kidney injury (CA‐AKI) is a significant concern in medical practice, ranking as the third leading cause of hospital‐acquired acute kidney injury. Its prevalence varies, affecting 1%–2% of the general population, but the risk can be significantly higher, up to 50%, in high‐risk groups. Several established risk factors, including severe chronic kidney disease, hypotension, excessive contrast medium, anemia, and diabetes, have been linked to an increased likelihood of CA‐AKI and have been incorporated into risk stratification models.

Inflammation has been identified as a key player in the development and progression of various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions like CA‐AKI. Numerous studies have highlighted the prognostic value of systemic inflammatory markers in CA‐AKI patients, independent of traditional risk factors. These markers include C‐reactive protein (CRP), interleukin‐6, and white blood cell count.

In addition to established inflammatory markers, red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has gained attention as an informative and cost‐effective indicator of systemic inflammation. A growing body of research has demonstrated the prognostic significance of RDW in inflammation‐related cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and ischemic cardiac conditions. Hemoglobin, on the other hand, is a critical parameter reflecting anemia, which is a traditional risk factor for CA‐AKI. Hemoglobin‐to‐RDW ratio (HRR), a novel metric introduced by Sun et al. is a novel indicator of chronic inflammation combining the prognostic information from hemoglobin and RDW. Accordingly, the accessibility of RDW and HRR in clinical practice for CA‐AKI seems reasonable and potentially valuable.

Therefore, this retrospective study set out to determine the associations of RDW and HRR with CA‐AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), for the sake of aggressive management to reduce the risk of CA‐AKI.

### Increased red cell distribution width: a novel predictor of adverse outcome in patients hospitalized due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^ffa72fe7]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is one of the leading causes for hospitalization and readmission in developed countries. No laboratory indices were consistently found to be associated with readmission risk. Recent evidence attests that red blood cell distribution width (RDW), conveys important information for short and long term prognosis in a variety of medical conditions. Prognostic usefulness of RDW in patients with AECOPD has not been investigated.

Objective

To evaluate the usefulness of RDW in predicting early adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized due to AECOPD.

Methods

Patients hospitalized for AECOPD between 2011 and 2013 were revised. Clinical and laboratory parameters were noted. Participants were followed to determine the incidence of readmission due to AECOPD, readmission from any cause and composite end point of readmission or death during 60 days after discharge.

Results

539 patients were included in the study. The 60-day overall readmission rate was 26.35%, of that, 41.55% were due to AECOPD. The Presence of heart failure, pH below 7.35 at discharge and abnormal RDW were associated with the composite endpoint. The negative predictive value of normal RDW was 80.12%.

Conclusion

Increased RDW is an independent negative prognostic factor associated with adverse outcomes after hospitalization due to AECOPD.

### Red blood cell distribution width and the risk of death in middle-aged and older adults… [^33541999]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results Higher RDW values were strongly associated with an increased risk of death. Compared with the lowest quintile of RDW, the following were adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality: second quintile, HR, 1. 1; third quintile. For every 1% increment in RDW, all-cause mortality risk increased by 22%. Even when analyses were restricted to nonanemic participants or to those in the reference range of RDW without iron, folate, or vitamin B12 deficiency, RDW remained strongly associated with mortality. The prognostic effect of RDW was observed in both middle-aged and older adults for multiple causes of death. Given that the RDW is routinely reported by clinical laboratories as a component of the CBC and it is available for most patients, understanding its prognostic significance could be very valuable for risk stratification in clinical decision making.

However, whether the prognostic effect of RDW is specific to patients with CVD or rather is also valid in the general population is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine whether higher RDW levels are associated with increased risk of death in a large, nationally representative sample of middle-aged and older adults. Findings from the current study are consistent with those of other recently published studies. In a randomized controlled trial of patients with heart failure, Felker et al4 showed that patients with an RDW greater than 15. 8% had nearly a 2-fold increased risk of CVD death or hospitalization as well as death from any cause compared with those with an RDW less than
13. 3%. As a validation, Felker et al4 also showed a 2-fold increased mortality risk comparing the highest RDW quintile with the lowest in a separate clinical cohort of patients with heart failure.

Similarly, Tonelli et al5 analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial of patients with coronary artery disease and reported that death was twice as likely in patients with an RDW greater than 13. 8% vs those with an RDW less than
12. 6%.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^7056c4f2]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have demonstrated that red cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often anemic and have high RDW levels. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes among patients with CKD.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with CKD who were admitted to the department of cardiology of a tertiary hospital in 2011. The patients were divided into 2 groups: normal RDW (RDW < 14.5%) and elevated RDW (RDW ≥ 14.5%). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, blood investigation results, prescriptions, and outcomes were analyzed after a 3-year follow-up period. Six adjustment levels were performed to evaluate the effect of RDW on outcomes.

Results

This study involved 282 patients with CKD: 213 in the elevated RDW group and 69 in the normal RDW group. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values, lower hemoglobin levels, lower serum albumin levels, and higher creatinine levels, compared with the normal RDW group. A linear trend was observed toward higher RDW in patients with deteriorating renal function. In the final adjusted model, RDW ≥ 14.5%, older age, and lower LVEF were associated with an increased risk of major composite CV outcomes.

Conclusion

RDW is a potentially useful cost-effective indicator of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^f9164818]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 °C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10¹²/l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Modulation of red blood cell population dynamics is a fundamental homeostatic response to disease [^031a2a5b]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) volume variation (RDW) has recently been shown to predict a wide range of mortality and morbidity: death due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, renal disease, and more; complications in heart failure and coronary artery disease, advanced stage and worse prognosis in many cancers, poor outcomes in autoimmune disease, and many more. The mechanisms by which all of these diseases lead to increased RDW are unknown. Here we use a semi-mechanistic mathematical model of in vivo RBC population dynamics to dissect the factors controlling RDW and show that elevated RDW results largely from a slight reduction in the in vivo rate of RBC turnover. RBCs become smaller as they age, and a slight reduction in the rate of RBC turnover allows smaller cells to continue circulating, expanding the low-volume tail of the RBC population's volume distribution, and thereby increasing RDW. Our results show that mildly extended RBC lifespan is a previously unrecognized homeostatic adaptation common to a very wide range of pathologic states, likely compensating for subtle reductions in erythropoietic output. A mathematical model-based estimate of the clearance rate may provide a novel early-warning biomarker for a wide range of morbidity and mortality.

### Red blood cell distribution width and 1-year mortality in acute heart failure [^6c80264e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) predicts mortality in chronic heart failure (HF) and stable coronary artery disease. The prognostic value of RDW in more acute settings such as acute HF, and its relative prognostic value compared with more established measures such as N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), remains unknown.

Methods and Results

In a cohort of 205 patients with acute HF, independent predictors of RDW were identified using linear regression analysis. The association between RDW and 1-year survival in the context of other predictors was assessed using Cox's proportional hazards analysis. Red blood cell distribution width was elevated in 67 (32.7%) patients; RDW was independently associated with haematological variables such as haemoglobin (P < 0.001) as well as the use of loop diuretics (P = 0.006) and beta-blockers (P = 0.015) on presentation, but not with nutritional deficiencies, recent transfusion, or inflammatory variables. Log-transformed RDW values independently predicted mortality in multivariable Cox's proportional hazards analysis (hazards ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.06; P = 0.04); when stratified on the basis of RDW and NT-proBNP status, the combination provided additional prognostic information.

Conclusion

Red blood cell distribution width is frequently elevated among patients with acute HF and does not appear to be associated with nutritional status, transfusion history, or inflammation. Red blood cell distribution width independently predicts 1-year mortality in acute HF. The value of RDW appears additive to other established prognostic variables such as NT-proBNP.

### Red cell distribution width predicts out of hospital outcomes in critically ill emergency general surgery patients [^35242be2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

EGS has been shown to confer significant morbidity and mortality, not only during the patient's hospital stay but also after discharge. Therefore, the discovery of predictive factors to stratify EGS patients to better identify those who would benefit from closer follow-up may help prevent adverse outcomes.

There is no current gold standard predictor for mortality after discharge in EGS patients. Our group has identified that patients who are malnourished at the time of ICU admission after EGS have increased 90-day mortality. Although this is a helpful metric that could potentially change management both when in the hospital and in outpatient care, this requires an in-depth evaluation and often the expertise of a dietician. Although increasing age and uninsured status have been found to be correlated with worse outcomes after EGS, these are less specific metrics to use for stratification of patients postdischarge for more intensive follow-up. Therefore, we investigated the potential of RDW as a more specific, one-time laboratory value for use as a prognostic marker for postdischarge mortality.

RDW is a laboratory value that is commonly obtained in postsurgical patients that has prognostic value in multiple disease states. RDW is a precise quantitation of RBC heterogeneity available on virtually all automated hematology analyzers and included in the complete blood count. RDW is a reflection of subtle changes in the red cell volume (mean corpuscular volume (MCV)) and size (anisocytosis). RDW is calculated as the variation in the distribution of RBC volumes divided by the MCV. Specifically, the RDW-CV is calculated from the width of the RBC histogram at 1 SD from the mean divided by MCV×100 and reported as a percentage. The normal RDW-CV is 11.5% to 14.5%. Variation in size of RBCs (anisocytosis) with a normal MCV occurs in subclinical deficiency of iron, folate or B12, as well as Sickle cell disease, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Utility of red cell distribution width in screening for iron deficiency [^e6b1b0d9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the sensitivity of an adult-derived red cell distribution width (RDW) reference limit in the detection of iron deficiency in young children.

Methods

Haematological analysis performed on a cohort of 13-month-old healthy term infants of North European ancestry.

Results

21/98 infants were iron-deficient (> 2.5% hypochromic red cells). Of the remaining 77, 35 with RDW > 13.9% also had evidence of incipient iron deficiency on the basis of significantly lower haemoglobin (11.5 vs 11.8 g/dl, p = 0.046), mean cell volume (75.6 vs 77.8 fl, p = 0.002) and mean cell haemoglobin (25.4 vs 26.2 pg, p = 0.002) values and higher zinc protoporphyrin (55 vs 44 μmol/molhaem, p < 0.001) values than those of the 42 with RDW ≤ 13.9%.

Conclusions

An adult-derived RDW reference limit has utility in screening for iron deficiency at the age of 13 months. The incidence of non-anaemic iron deficiency in this group was 52.8%.

### Red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is associated with low cognitive performance in American older adults: NHANES 2011–2014 [^78dbb02b]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The specific biological mechanisms about association between higher RAR and increased risk of low cognitive performance have not yet been fully elucidated, but may be related to chronic inflammation and poor nutritional status. RAR is a composite indicator integrating RDW and albumin, with increases in RDW and decreases in albumin both contributing to elevated RAR levels. Several studies have indicated that elevated RDW is associated with cognitive decline. A cross-sectional study indicated a "J-shaped" relationship between elevated RDW levels and the likelihood of dementia in older adults. Additionally, a prospective cohort study highlighted a causal impact of RDW on the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Elevated RDW is commonly associated with systemic inflammatory states, which can affect erythropoiesis, red blood cell lifespan, and red blood cell deformability, leading to increased cell anisotropy and subsequently raising RDW levels. Chronic inflammation is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying low cognitive performance. Abnormal deposition of amyloid proteins can lead to excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes in the central nervous system, triggering neuroinflammatory responses. Prolonged inflammatory conditions result in structural and functional damage to neurons, further contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, RDW is used in the differential diagnosis of anemia, which is considered a contributing factor to CI and Alzheimer's disease. In the condition of anemia, pathological changes in red blood cells, including alterations in quantity, volume, distribution, and overall mass, can reduce the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypoxic changes in cerebral blood vessels may be a crucial mechanism in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, leading to low cognitive performance and dementia. Our study also found that participants with higher RAR often had lower hemoglobin levels and a higher risk of low cognitive performance.

### Predictive role of red blood cell distribution width and hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio for mortality in patients with COPD: evidence from NHANES 1999–2018 [^99068b89]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

At present, the specific mechanism underlying the association between RDW, HRR, and mortality remains unclear. As far as we know, the underlying mechanism mainly includes the following aspects: Firstly, research showed that high RDW levels are associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory status. Oxidative stress exerts a significant impact on erythrocyte homeostasis and survival. Consequently, it is plausible that oxidative stress serves as an additional underlying biological mechanism contributing to the elevation of RDW, possibly by accelerating red cell turnover. This, in turn, contributes to the association between anisocytosis and pathological conditions in humans. Inflammation has the potential to influence iron metabolism and bone marrow function, thereby impeding the maturation of erythrocytes induced by erythropoietin. As a result, immature red blood cells are released into circulation, disrupting the clearance process and leading to an increase in RDW. Secondly, elevated RDW is associated with various comorbidities in patients with COPD, such as right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and CVD. The presence of these comorbidities also contributes to an increased risk of mortality in patients with COPD. Other mechanisms that may contribute to increased mortality include hypoxemia, poor nutritional status, and association with exacerbations of COPD. Furthermore, studies have confirmed that hemoglobin levels are associated with the prognosis of patients with COPD, and anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in these patients. Low hemoglobin levels serve as crucial indicators of inflammation processes. HRR is a combined index calculated from hemoglobin and RDW. Therefore, HRR can also reflect the association between these two indicators and COPD. Naturally, additional studies will be required to validate these findings in the future.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^62d22b8d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The results from studies included in this review showed that mean values of RDW were statistically significantly higher in IBD patients compared to controls. With respect to the rather limited data, based on only 2 clinical trials, RDW could be used as an effective marker to differentiate CD from UC in both the active state and remission. In the majority of the aforementioned studies RDW, at different cutoff values, showed a remarkable sensitivity and specificity in detecting active disease, calculated by means of clinical indices, endoscopic scores and laboratory parameters. RDW also showed a positive but variable correlation with well-established inflammatory biomarkers used in everyday clinical practice such as CRP, ESR, and to a lesser extent WBC and PLT, in both anemic and non-anemic IBD patients. Therefore, RDW could be considered an attractive disease activity marker in IBD, as it is calculated automatically in every CBC, has a low cost, is minimally invasive, has no specific technical requirements and can be easily reproduced.

On the other hand, there are certain aspects concerning its broad application that must be elucidated. There was great variability in the thresholds adopted for the assessment of diagnostic accuracy. In addition, the selection of cutoffs was arbitrary and data driven. Most studies were retrospective and were case-control studies. The use of controls in diagnostic accuracy studies usually results in overestimation of both sensitivity and specificity. Large-scale well-designed prospective studies for standardization of the cutoff value of RDW should now be mandatory. It is also necessary to conduct such studies in order to evaluate whether the limited but rather encouraging data are sufficient to establish RDW as a reliable activity index. Finally, there is a need to look deeper and clarify the pathophysiology of this relation. RDW seems to be a promising cost-effective tool that can be used to evaluate and monitor disease activity in IBD, but this requires more extensive and detailed research in the future.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study found that NLR, PLR, and RDW levels were elevated in patients with impaired physical function, and that high levels of NLR and PLR were independently associated with physical function dependence in elderly non-dialysis patients with CKD. As readily available, cost-effective systemic inflammatory markers, NLR, PLR, and RDW hold promise as novel indicators for the prediction and management of physical function in elderly individuals with CKD.

### Red cell distribution width as a potential new biomarker to predict the clinical severity of acute diverticulitis [^974454d7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationships between red cell distribution width (RDW), other inflammation-related markers and clinical features with the clinical and radiological severity of diverticulitis.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included 250 patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis. Radiological diverticulitis severity was determined by the Hinchey classification. Clinical diverticulitis severity was determined based on the treatment applied (invasive versus conservative/medical treatment).

Results

High platelet count (p = 0.001) and high CRP (p < 0.001) were independently associated with the Hinchey Class II-IV. Need for invasive treatment was independently associated with presence of Hinchey stage II-IV (p < 0.001) and high (> 13.75) RDW (p < 0.001). With a cut-off value of > 13.75, RDW was able to predict patients requiring invasive treatment [Sensitivity = 75.86%, Specificity = 63.87%, AUC (95% CI) = 0.657 (0.580–0.734), p < 0.001].

Conclusiosn

RDW, which is an inexpensive and readily-available parameter, may be a supportive measure in the prediction of the clinical severity of diverticulitis. Together with other clinical and laboratory data, RDW could help identify patients with worse prognosis, facilitating appropriate decisions and precautions in their management.

### Red cell distribution width as a marker of activity in inflammatory bowel disease: a narrative review [^1386d14c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Finally, Goyal et al performed a systematic review of the international literature to evaluate the prognostic value of RDW for assessment of disease severity and clinical consequences in both benign and malignant gastrointestinal disorders. The authors included in this review 8 studies where RDW was evaluated in IBD as an index of disease activity, as a marker to differentiate CD from UC, and as an index to evaluate anemia in IBD. They concluded that RDW showed promising potential as an index of disease activity as well as a marker able to differentiate CD from UC. The results of the aforementioned studies indicate the promising potential of RDW as a surrogate marker of disease activity in IBD (Table 3).

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^c11038c1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. While there is much data about risk factors for severe outcome in the general population, there is less focus on younger group of patients. Therefore, we aimed to detect simple prognostic factors for severe morbidity and mortality in young patients with CAP.

Methods

Patients of 60 years old or younger, who were diagnosed with CAP (defined as pneumonia identified 48 hours or less from hospitalization) between March 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 were retrospectively analyzed for risk factors for complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality.

Results

The cohort included 637 patients. 90-day mortality rate was 6.6% and the median length of stay was 5 days. In univariate analysis, male patients and those with co-morbid conditions tended to have complicated disease. In multivariate analysis, variables associated with complicated hospitalization included post chest radiation state, prior neurologic damage, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) > 10.7 mmol/L and red cell distribution width (RDW) > 14.5%; whereas, variables associated with an increased risk of 90-day mortality included age ≥ 51 years, prior neurologic damage, immunosuppression, and the combination of abnormal white blood cells (WBC) and elevated RDW. Complicated hospitalization and mortality rate were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the white blood cell count. Elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective to hemoglobin levels.

Conclusions

In young patients with CAP, elevated RDW levels are associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and severe morbidity. RDW as a prognostic marker was unrelated with hemoglobin levels.

### Association of standard clinical and laboratory variables with red blood cell distribution width [^29b12c3c]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) strongly predicts clinical outcomes among patients with coronary disease and heart failure. The factors underpinning this association are unknown.

Methods

In 6,447 individuals enrolled in the Measurement to Understand the Reclassification of Disease of Cabarrus/Kannapolis (MURDOCK) Study who had undergone coronary angiography between 2001 and 2007, we used Cox proportional hazards modeling to examine the adjusted association between RDW and death, and death or myocardial infarction (MI). Multiple linear regression using the R(2) model selection method was then used to identify clinical factors associated with variation in RDW.

Results

Median follow-up was 4.2 (interquartile range 2.3–5.9) years, and the median RDW was 13.5% (interquartile range 12.9%-14.3%, clinical laboratory reference range 11.5%-14.5%). Red blood cell distribution width was independently associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 per 1% increase in RDW, 95% CI 1.09–1.17), and death or MI (adjusted hazard ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.08–1.16). Twenty-seven clinical characteristics and laboratory measures were assessed in the multivariable linear regression model; a final model containing 18 variables explained only 21% of the variation in RDW.

Conclusions

Although strongly associated with death and death or MI, only one-fifth of the variation in RDW was explained by routinely assessed clinical characteristics and laboratory measures. Understanding the latent factors that explain variation in RDW may provide insight into its strong association with risk and identify novel targets to mitigate that risk.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^27c9f2cf]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A potential independent association was recently demonstrated between high red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and the risk of all-cause mortality in critically ill patients, although the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. Little is known about the impact changes in RDW may have on survival in critically ill patients. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic significance of changes in RDW during hospital stay in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 329 patients who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) and received a standardized resuscitation algorithm (early-goal directed therapy) for severe sepsis or septic shock. The relationship between the changes in RDW during the first 72 hours after ED admission and all-cause mortality (28-day and 90-day) were analyzed by categorizing the patients into four groups according to baseline RDW value and ΔRDW 72hr-adm (RDW at 72 hours – RDW at baseline).

Results

The 28-day and 90-day mortality rates were 10% and 14.6%, respectively. Patients with increased RDW at baseline and ΔRDW 72hr-adm > 0.2% exhibited the highest risks of 28-day and 90-day mortality, whereas the patients with normal RDW level at baseline and ΔRDW 72hr-adm ≤ 0.2% (the reference group) had the lowest mortality risks. For 90-day mortality, a significantly higher mortality risk was observed in the patients whose RDW increased within 72 hours of ED admission (normal RDW at baseline and ΔRDW 72hr-adm > 0.2%), compared to the reference group. These associations remained unaltered even after adjusting for age, sex, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, renal replacement therapy, albumin, hemoglobin, lactate, C-reactive protein and infection sites in multivariable models.

Conclusions

We found that an increase in RDW from baseline during the first 72 hours after hospitalization is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, a combination of baseline RDW value and an increase in RDW can be a promising independent prognostic marker in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^40cf517b]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a coefficient of variation in red blood cell (RBC) volume, is routinely available in reports of complete blood count. RDW is commonly increased because of erythropoiesis deficits or accelerated RBC destruction. RDW increase is often considered as an indicator of anemia caused by iron, cobalamin, or folate deficiency. Recent studies have indicated that patients with higher RDW levels were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and new-onset stroke. Moreover, the level of RDW was positively correlated with mortality in patients with acute or critical illnesses, in those with chronic diseases, and in healthy cohorts. Patel et al. reported a 14% increased risk of death for each 1% increment in RDW in a community-based elderly population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are well-known risk factors for CV events and mortality. RDW significantly increases when CKD progresses from stage 1 to stage 5. According to our review of the relevant literature, few reports have focused on RDW in patients with CKD. Hsieh et al. revealed that RDW was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and infection mortality in CKD stages 3–5. Inadequate erythropoietin production is the primary feature of anemia in patients with CKD. Anemia reduces oxygen delivery and increases cardiac workload, which exacerbates heart failure and increases the risk of CV events. However, anemia is not the only possible explanation of elevated RDW in patients with CKD. The association of RDW with CV events and mortality was observed to be significant after adjustment for hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes during CKD stages 1–5. We hypothesized that elevated RDW is an independent risk factor for CV events and mortality in patients with CKD.

### Association of red blood cell distribution width with short-and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis and sepsis [^15c85a01]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that RDW is related to short- and long-term all-cause mortality in patients with AP and sepsis in the MIMIC-IV database. Cox regression analysis indicated that, even after adjusting for variables, RDW remained significantly related to the primary clinical outcomes, with the differences reaching statistical significance. In our sensitivity analysis restricted to patients without anemia, RDW remained significantly associated with 28-, 90-, and 365-day mortality in univariate Cox regression. However, this association lost statistical significance after adjustment for covariates in the multivariate model. This may be attributed to the reduced sample size in the non-anemic subgroup, which may have limited the statistical power to detect significant associations, particularly after adjustment for multiple covariates. However, further prospective studies with larger non-anemic populations are needed to validate these findings.

The RCS analysis in our study revealed specific turning points for RDW at 12.9%, 17.7%, and 17.7% for 28-, 90-, and 365-day mortality, respectively, suggesting a nonlinear association between RDW and mortality risk. Although we did not perform subgroup analyses based on these thresholds due to limited sample size, these values may hold important clinical significance. For instance, RDW levels exceeding 12.9% could serve as an early warning marker for clinicians to identify patients at increased risk of poor outcomes. Incorporating such thresholds into clinical protocols could potentially escalate care for high-risk patients. Moreover, these turning points may inform future risk stratification models and facilitate individualized prognostic assessments. Further prospective studies and multicenter cohorts are warranted to validate the prognostic utility and generalizability of these RDW thresholds. Establishing evidence-based cutoffs may ultimately support the integration of RDW into routine prognostic scoring systems for acute pancreatitis with sepsis.

4 DISCUSSION

This retrospective cohort study has shed light on the associations of RDW and HRR with CA‐AKI in patients who underwent CAG or PCI. The key findings indicate that both high RDW and low HRR are significantly linked to CA‐AKI and represent independent risk factors for this condition.

CA‐AKI is a formidable complication following CAG or PCI, often contributing to prolonged hospitalization and adverse outcomes. Preventing CA‐AKI is of paramount importance since there is currently no definitive and effective treatment available. Early identification of potential risk factors is the key to better CA‐AKI prevention. Current diagnosis of CA‐AKI mainly relies on clinical presentations of the urinary system and the levels of Scr elevation, but other indexes that could be for routine clinical use are comparatively limited. Ideal indicators of CA‐AKI should be sensitive, cost‐effective, easily obtainable, and noninvasive. Laboratory variables can serve as much more meaningful indicators since the blood sampling test is one of the routine inspections for all admitted patients.

RDW is a measurement of the heterogeneity of circulating erythrocytes, which can be rapidly and easily obtained from blood routine tests. For decades, RDW has been mainly used to diagnose anemia. Recently, RDW is considered to be a novel biomarker for systemic inflammation and studies have proven that there existed a close association between RDW and CRP. In this regard, RDW is gaining widespread attention as an inflammatory indicator and a prognostic biomarker of cardiovascular diseases and renal diseases. Lazzeroni et al. reported the potential of RDW to represent an independent predictor after myocardial revascularization or cardiac valve surgery. Akin et al. and Zhao et al. found that RDW was associated with the development of CA‐AKI in patients with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction and stable angina pectoris. In accordance with previous studies, this study demonstrated that high RDW was an independent risk factor of CA‐AKI in all patients after CAG or PCI, indicating that enhanced surveillance of RDW might help to identify CA‐AKI earlier.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^a0d254df]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Laboratory variables on admission

Serum glucose, creatinine, sodium, hemoglobin, WBC, RDW and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured on admission.

Hemoglobin levels, mean corpuscular volume and RDW were measured on admission and prior to hospital discharge, using the Advia 120 Hematology Analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Deerfield, Illinois, USA). Glucose, BUN and creatinine levels were measured using the "Dimension" (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Deerfield, Illinois, USA).

RDW is reported as coefficient of variation (in percent) of red blood cell volume. The normal range for RDW in our laboratory is 11.5 to 14.5%. The correctness of this normal range was confirmed by analyzing RDW data in 17,293 ambulatory subjects who attended the Rambam Center for Preventive Medicine for a medical examination and health counseling. In this group, mean RDW was 13.1% (median 13.0%) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of RDW of 12.0 to 14.4%.

### Red cell distribution width improves the simplified acute physiology score for risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients [^8a362bbe]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of erythrocyte size variability and has been shown to be a prognostic marker for mortality, mainly in patients with cardiovascular disease and in community-dwelling patients, as well as in general in-hospital patients. Although the mechanisms linking RDW to adverse patient outcomes remain incompletely understood, potential pathways include chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and anemia of different etiologies, among others. The prognostic potential of RDW is of particular interest because it is routinely included in the automated complete blood count (CBC) analyses in hospitalized patients and thus available at no additional cost for clinicians. Recent studies have found RDW to be a prognostic marker for short- and long-term mortality in critically ill patients. The first study in critical illness was conducted in a cohort of 602 patients in China and found that RDW is associated with ICU mortality. Recently, a large 10-year retrospective study from two US centers validated these findings and found RDW to be a robust predictor of the risk of all-cause patient mortality and bloodstream infection in the critically ill. Finally, one report found RDW to be a strong outcome predictor in patients with pneumonia. However, from these studies, it remains unclear whether RDW may improve state-of-the-art risk prediction in unselected critically ill patients.

We therefore aimed to investigate whether adding RDW has the potential to improve the prognostic performance of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) to predict short- and long-term mortality in an independent, large, and unselected population of ICU patients.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^2dff955d]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Impact on clinical practice

On the basis of the above fact, we reiterate the prognostic importance of confirming the diagnosis of true ET in any patient with a reported diagnosis of 'ET'. In this regard, one must carefully examine the complete blood count (anemia or leukocytosis suggest early/prefibrotic MF), peripheral blood smear (increased red cell distribution width, decreased mean corpuscular volume that is not associated with iron deficiency, or leukoerythroblastosis suggests early/prefibrotic MF), serum lactate dehydrogenase (increased levels are more consistent with early/prefibrotic MF) and JAK2 V617F allele burden (diagnosis of ET must be questioned in the presence of > 25% allele burden).

In terms of management, caution is required in the use of aspirin in early/prefibrotic MF because of the increased baseline risk of bleeding. In general, we recommend avoidance of prophylactic aspirin therapy in early/prefibrotic MF, especially in the presence of a bleeding history. This is different from our treatment approach in WHO-defined ET, in which we recommend universal use of aspirin therapy in the absence of clear contraindications, such as clinically relevant acquired von Willebrand syndrome. On the other hand, the indications to use cytoreductive therapy remain similar to those of ET, but might require deeper cytoreduction in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Validation and potential mechanisms of red cell distribution width as a prognostic marker in heart failure [^1a3b1875]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse outcomes have recently been linked to elevated red cell distribution width (RDW) in heart failure. Our study sought to validate the prognostic value of RDW in heart failure and to explore the potential mechanisms underlying this association.

Methods and Results

Data from the Study of Anemia in a Heart Failure Population (STAMINA-HFP) registry, a prospective, multicenter cohort of ambulatory patients with heart failure supported multivariable modeling to assess relationships between RDW and outcomes. The association between RDW and iron metabolism, inflammation, and neurohormonal activation was studied in a separate cohort of heart failure patients from the United Investigators to Evaluate Heart Failure (UNITE-HF) Biomarker registry. RDW was independently predictive of outcome (for each 1% increase in RDW, hazard ratio for mortality 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.12; hazard ratio for hospitalization or mortality 1.06; 95% CI 1.02–1.10) after adjustment for other covariates. Increasing RDW correlated with decreasing hemoglobin, increasing interleukin-6, and impaired iron mobilization.

Conclusions

Our results confirm previous observations that RDW is a strong, independent predictor of adverse outcome in chronic heart failure and suggest elevated RDW may indicate inflammatory stress and impaired iron mobilization. These findings encourage further research into the relationship between heart failure and the hematologic system.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^2f6ca6c8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, RDW > 15% and hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL measured using a simple coulter can be used as a valuable screening tool for identifying children with iron deficiency anemia in a low socio-economic setting. Although it needs to be further investigated in other populations, there is no reason to believe that results will vary from the present study. If these findings are confirmed in other settings as well, it offers a very useful tool for screening iron deficient anemic children without need for more expensive iron status marker investigations.

### The role of red cell distribution width in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: a retrospective case-controlled study [^bacf3434]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical abdominal emergency. Rapid diagnosis is important, because increased time between onset of symptoms and surgical intervention is associated with increased risk of appendiceal perforation and therefore potential peritonitis, sepsis, and death. However, the rate of negative appendectomy (when appendectomy is performed, but the appendix is found to be normal on histological evaluation) ranges from 5% to 42%, and this can be associated with considerable morbidity. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging, particularly in the early stages of appendicitis when clinical manifestations may be quite non-specific or atypical. Different elements of history, examination, and laboratory findings have varying predictive power in the diagnosis of appendicitis, and algorithms and scoring systems for clinical evaluation exist, but appendicitis can nevertheless be easily missed.

The preoperative laboratory tests can be performed easily in primary healthcare settings and often aid primary clinicians with decision making about patients with clinically suspected AA. Several parameters for the diagnosis of AA have been investigated in the literature. RDW, a measure of heterogeneity in the size of circulating red blood cells, is a component of the standard complete blood count and calculated as a percentage of the standard deviation of the red cell volume divided by the mean corpuscular volume. It has been reported that RDW level has clinical implications in various pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, pulmonary embolism, and coronary artery disease. In addition, its predictive role has been shown in inflammatory and infectious pathological diseases including acute pancreatitis, bacteremia, sepsis, and septic shock. In the present study we aimed to seek whether RDW level is important in the diagnosis of AA. No studies in literature have examined this subject before. In addition, it was aimed to show the relationship of RDW level with leukocyte count and CRP level.

* Includes bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, permanent tracheostomy, lung malignancy, past history of thoracic radiotherapy, previous episode of pneumonia, and previous or current active smoking.

As depicted in Table 1, patients who had disturbed renal function tests, anemia, abnormal WBC and elevated RDW on admission had a complicated hospitalization.

The median length of stay was 4 and 12 days in uncomplicated and complicated patients, respectively. In patients who had a complicated course of pneumonia, 90-day mortality was 31% as compared with 3.9% in uncomplicated patients (P < 0.03). Notably, the combination of elevated RDW and abnormal WBC count had the highest OR for complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality (Tables 2 and 3 respectively). We found a statistically significant association between each element of the complicated hospitalization and elevated RDW. For length of stay of more than 10 days, linear regression showed B = 3.5 (95% CI = 1.8–5.1, P < 0.0001). For ICU admission logistic regression showed OR of 1.97 (95% CI = 1.2–3.1, P = 0.004), and for in- hospital mortality, binary regression showed OR of 3.5 (95% CI = 2.4–5).

### Red cell distribution width and mortality in Hemodialysis Patients [^f5382a1b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW) is an index of red blood cell volume variability that has historically been used as a marker of iron deficiency anemia. More recently, studies have shown that elevated RDW is associated with higher mortality risk in the general population. However, there is lack of data demonstrating the association between RDW and mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We hypothesized that higher RDW is associated with higher mortality in HD patients.

Study Design

Retrospective observational study using a large HD patient cohort.

Setting & Participants

109,675 adult maintenance HD patients treated in a large dialysis organization from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011.

Predictor

Baseline and time-varying RDW, grouped into 5 categories: < 14.5%, 14.5% to < 15.5%, 15.5% to < 16.5%, 16.5% to < 17.5%, and ≥ 17.5%. RDW of 15.5% to < 16.5% was used as the reference category.

Outcome

All-cause mortality.

Results

Mean age of study participants was 63 ± 15 (SD) years and the study cohort was 44% women. In baseline and time-varying analyses, there was a graded association between higher RDW and incrementally higher mortality risk. Receiver operating characteristic, net reclassification analysis, and integrated discrimination improvement analyses demonstrated that RDW is a stronger predictor of mortality as compared with traditional markers of anemia, such as hemoglobin, ferritin, and iron saturation values.

Limitations

Lack of comprehensive data that may be associated with both RDW and HD patient outcomes, such as blood transfusion data, socioeconomic status, and other unknown confounders; therefore, the possibility of residual confounding could not be excluded. Also, lack of information for cause of death; thus, cardiovascular mortality outcomes could not be examined.

Conclusions

In HD patients, higher RDW is associated with incrementally higher mortality risk. RDW is also a stronger predictor of mortality than traditional laboratory markers of anemia. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the association between RDW and mortality.

### Higher red cell distribution width and poorer hospitalization-related outcomes in elderly patients [^3aae4279]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Red cell distribution width (RDW), an index for variation of red blood cell (RBC) size, has been proposed as a potential marker for poorer outcomes in several aging-related diseases and conditions. We tested whether greater variability of RBC size, presented as a higher RDW value, predicts poor prognoses among hospitalized patients over 60years old.

Methods

We retrospectively collected data from older hospitalized patients aged ≥ 60years between January 2013 to December 2017 at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in Northern California. The RDW was measured during hospital admission and categorized with 1% intervals (≤ 13.9, 14.0–14.9, 15.0–15.9, 16.0–16.9, 17.0–17.9 and ≥ 18.0%). The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital mortality and secondary outcomes included 30-day re-admission rate and length of hospital stay (in days).

Results

A total of 167,292 admissions from 94,617 patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 6.3%. As the RDW value increased, the rate of in-hospital mortality gradually increased from 2.7% for the lowest RDW category to 12.2% in the highest category (p-trend < 0.001). The overall 30-day re-admission rate after discharge was 12.5% and the rate of 30-day re-admission also increased with increasing RDW categories (7.4% in the lowest group vs. 15.8% in the highest group, p-trend < 0.001). Patients with the highest RDW values at admission stayed 1.5–2.0 times longer in the hospital than patients with lower RDW values who were admitted for the same causes.

Conclusions

Greater variability of RBC size is significantly associated with worse prognosis in hospitalized elderly patients, indicating higher mortality, greater risk of early re-admission, and longer hospital stay days. Risk stratification strategies for hospitalized elderly should include RDW value.

### The red cell distribution width as a prognostic indicator in upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d8062c0b]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the relationship between the Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) and prognosis in upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer.

Methods

PubMed (via the web), Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched. A systematic review and meta-analysis was done to generate the pooled hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS), and recurrence free survival (RFS).

Results

Our analysis included the results of 4200 patients in 8 cohorts. The pooled data demonstrated that an elevated RDW was associated with significantly poorer OS (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.13–1.83), RFS (HR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.13–1.82). The DSS result had high heterogeneity and 95% CI was not pooled.

Conclusions

An elevated RDW may be an indicator of poor prognosis in UADT cancers in certain populations. Further research is needed to confirm this effect.

### Relation between red blood cell distribution width and inflammatory biomarkers in a large cohort of unselected outpatients [^f83acf0b]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Context

A strong independent association has been recently observed between elevated red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and increased incidence of cardiovascular events.

Objective

To assess whether RDW is associated with plasma markers of inflammation since the mechanism(s) underlying this association remain unknown.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed results of RDW, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in a large cohort of unselected adult outpatients who were consecutively referred by general practitioners for routine medical check-up.

Results

Cumulative results of RDW and other factors were retrieved from the database of our laboratory information system for 3845 adult outpatients during a 3-year period. When participants were grouped according to RDW quartiles, there were strong, graded increases of ESR and hsCRP (P < .001), both parameters being up to 3-fold higher in the fourth versus the first quartile. Accordingly, the percentages of those with hsCRP greater than 3 mg/L (from 28% to 63%; P < .001) and ESR greater than 40 mm/h (from 8% to 40%; P < .001) increased steadily across RDW quartiles. In multivariable regression analysis, ESR and hsCRP predicted RDW independently of age, sex, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, and ferritin.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, our study demonstrates for the first time a strong, graded association of RDW with hsCRP and ESR independent of numerous confounding factors. If confirmed in future follow-up studies, this association might provide a rationale to introduce the easy, inexpensive RDW in algorithms for cardiovascular risk prediction.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^f74d9e11]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current strategy to identify iron deficiency anemia relies on markers involving high costs. Reports have suggested red cell distribution width (RDW) as a potential screening test for identifying iron deficiency anemia (IDA) but studies in pediatric populations are lacking. Our study elucidates the discriminative ability of RDW for detecting IDA among young children.

Methods

2091 blood reports of children aged 1–3 years from an urban low socio-economic population of Delhi were analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity of RDW in discriminating IDA using receiver's operating characteristic curve. Hemoglobin and RDW were estimated using coulter, zinc protoporphyrin with AVIV fluorometer and serum ferritin by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

A total of 1026 samples were classified as iron deficient anemia using gold standard. As a marker of overall efficiency, area under the curve for RDW was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81–0.84; p < 0.001). Sensitivity of RDW at cut-off of 18% to detect iron deficiency anemia was 76.5% and specificity 73.1% yielding a positive predictive value of 73% and negative predictive value of 76%. At a cut-off of RDW 16.4%, the sensitivity was 94% and at a cut-off of 21%, the specificity was 95%. Combination of hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL and RDW > 15%, yielded a sensitivity of 99% and specificity of 90%. These data suggest that simple coulter analysis estimating hemoglobin and RDW can be used for identification of children in need for iron therapy.

Conclusions

In India and similar settings, RDW > 15% with hemoglobin ≤ 10.0 g/dL identifies iron deficient anemic children without need for iron status markers which could help reduce cost of management especially in poor settings.

### Elevated red cell distribution width predicts poor outcome in young patients with community acquired pneumonia [^0d38493f]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The association of RDW and complicated hospitalization

Ninety five (55.6%) patients with complicated hospitalization had increased RDW as compared with 123 (26%) patients with uncomplicated admissions (P < 0.0001).

Complicated hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly higher among patients with increased RDW regardless of the WBC count (Figure 1); the complicated hospitalization rate was 15.7% in patients with normal RDW and WBC and 20.3% in patients with only abnormal WBC count, as compared with 33.3% in patients with elevated RDW alone (P = 0.001) and 51.2% in patients with combined abnormal leukocyte count and increased RDW (P < 0.001). As shown in Figure 1, the 90-day mortality was higher in patients with elevated RDW regardless of the WBC count; however, once again the combination of abnormal WBC and elevated RDW was significantly associated with the highest mortality rates.

In order to rule out the possibility that RDW effect on severe morbidity and mortality was unrelated to anemia, we compared complicated hospitalization in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 110 g/L and higher levels of Hb. The two groups were examined in patients with normal and elevated RDW. As depicted in Figure 2, patients with normal RDW had no difference in severe morbidity or mortality regardless of Hb levels. On the other hand, elevated RDW was associated with a significant increase in both complicated hospitalization and 90-day mortality rates irrespective of Hb levels.

### The effect of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose on red cell distribution width: a subanalysis of the FAIR-HF study [^050fa2ca]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Red cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of variability in red blood cell size, is a novel prognostic marker in chronic heart failure (CHF). Iron deficiency contributes to elevated RDW. In the FAIR-HF trial, i.v. ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) improved the 6 min walk test (6MWT) distance in iron-deficient CHF patients. We studied the effect of FCM on RDW and the relationship between RDW and 6MWT distance.

Methods and Results

In FAIR-HF, iron-deficient CHF patients were randomized to FCM or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. From the total cohort (n = 459), we included 415 patients in whom RDW values and 6MWT distance were available for baseline and at least one follow-up visit (after 4, 12, and 24 weeks). Baseline RDW was higher in anaemic (haemoglobin < 12 g/dL) compared with non-anaemic patients [15.2% (14.0–16.8) vs. 14.2% (13.4–15.4), P < 0.0001, median (interquartile range)]. In multivariate analysis, RDW was significantly associated with transferrin saturation (P < 0.001) and C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.002). Treatment with FCM led to a biphasic response; RDW increased within 4 weeks (+0.54% absolute change from baseline, P = 0.01) but fell to values below the placebo group after 24 weeks (-1.0%, P = 0.03). The 6MWT distance and RDW were inversely related at baseline (r = -0.30, P < 0.0001). In all patients, the increase in 6MWT distance after 24 weeks was significantly correlated with a decrease in RDW (r = -0.25, P < 0.0001), even after adjustment for changes in haemoglobin.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency in CHF is associated with high RDW, even after adjustment for the presence of anaemia. Treatment with i.v. FCM in iron-deficient CHF patients decreases RDW.

### Health supervision for children and adolescents with down syndrome [^49ff96e4]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Down syndrome — anemia and iron deficiency screening recommends to obtain a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential plus either ferritin with C-reactive protein (CRP) or serum iron with total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), beginning at 1 year of age and annually thereafter; screening by hemoglobin alone misses iron deficiency/iron insufficiency, and using an elevated red cell distribution width with ferritin or transferrin saturation or serum iron divided by TIBC leads to 100% sensitivity for identifying iron insufficiency, iron deficiency, or anemia.

### Association between red blood cell distribution width to serum calcium ratio and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with diabetic nephropathy: a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV database [^3b298c62]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), reflecting erythrocyte size variability, shows a strong association with systemic inflammatory status as inflammation disrupts erythropoiesis and shortens erythrocyte lifespan. On the other hand, serum calcium (SC) participates in crucial physiological processes including neuromuscular excitability, cardiac electrophysiology, glandular secretion, and coagulation. Previous studies have established hypocalcemia as a validated predictor of poor outcomes in critically ill patients. RDW and SC, as conventional and simple detection parameters, can be obtained through simple venous blood collection. Recently, the ratio of red blood cell distribution width to serum calcium (RCR) has emerged as an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcomes across various diseases due to its clinical accessibility. However, the prognostic significance of the RCR in critically ill patients with DN remains unexplored. This vulnerable population exhibits substantially elevated mortality risk compared to their stable DN counterparts, underscoring the critical need for reliable risk stratification tools in intensive care medicine. The present study, therefore, aims to systematically evaluate the association between RCR and all-cause mortality in this high-risk population, with the potential to offer clinically relevant biomarkers for early identification of at-risk patients and inform targeted therapeutic strategies.

### Iron deficiency and heart failure: diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic perspectives [^1cd3a779]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The red cell distribution width (RDW) reflecting MCV heterogeneity (quantitative index of anisocytosis, i.e. the percentage coefficient of MCV variation) can be considered another parameter of ID. Increased RDW is, however, typical not only for anaemia due to ID, but also anaemia resulting from deficiencies in vitamin B 12 and folic acid, of chronic diseases and sideroblastic anaemia. In HF patients, there are associations between high RDW, and reduced haemoglobin, low MCV, reduced Tsat, increased mortality and hospitalization rates. –

Owing to pathophysiological links and overlaps in regulatory mechanisms of erythropoietin and iron metabolism, – subjects with ID frequently have increased circulating erythropoietin levels, which can be considered another index of iron-restricted erythropoiesis in HF patients, being related to poor outcomes.

Increased soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is another sensitive indicator of ID. Soluble transferrin receptor is the truncated form of transmembrane protein, a receptor for iron–transferrin complex and the major system responsible for the intracellular iron import. It is present on virtually all cells, but a vast majority is localized on erythroid precursors. When iron delivery to target tissues is insufficient for metabolic requirements, the expression of the transferrin receptor increases in order to facilitate intracellular iron influx. Consequently, circulating sTfR (originating from all cells metabolizing iron) quantitatively reflects both the tissue iron demand (tissue iron balance) and the erythroid proliferation rate (total erythroblast mass), but not body iron stores. No study has used this biomarker to indicate and/or guide therapy, and so it should be regarded as a research tool.

Because serum ferritin is a surrogate of iron stores and serum sTfR reflects the tissue iron demand, there is evidence that the combination of these two parameters may describe the iron status more accurately.

### An increase in red blood cell distribution width from baseline predicts mortality in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock [^ea4ed390]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) represents an index of the heterogeneity of the erythrocytes (anisocytosis), which is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of erythrocyte volume by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and multiplying by 100 to express the result as a percentage. RDW is widely available to clinicians because it is routinely reported as part of the complete blood count.

For several decades, RDW has been typically used in combination with the MCV to differentiate the cause of underlying anemia in clinical practice. Recently, highly significant associations have been described between RDW value and all-cause, noncardiac, and cardiac mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, acute and chronic heart failure, peripheral artery disease, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary artery hypertension. Moreover, several studies have reported that RDW shows the predictive value of all-cause mortality in critically ill or intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Although it has been postulated that systemic inflammation, malnutrition, and impaired renal function play a significant role in the underlying pathological processes, the mechanism of the association between increased RDW and mortality remains unclear.

Until now, most previous studies that have investigated the relationship between RDW and clinical outcomes of various cohorts have used a single RDW measurement at initial presentation, and little is known about the potential impact of changes in RDW from baseline on survival in critically ill patients. However, RDW can be considered as a dynamic variable with rapid changes associated with acute disease states such as acute myocardial infarction and acute decompensated heart failure. Thus, we hypothesized that the changes in RDW from baseline can reflect acute disease states and provide more prognostic information than the baseline RDW value alone. Therefore, we investigated whether the change in RDW value between baseline and 72 hours after hospital admission had prognostic value for clinical outcomes in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Red blood cell distribution width and mortality risk in hospitalized adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection… [^cddea7e6]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Patients whose RDW increased during hospitalization had higher mortality compared with those whose RDW did not change; for those with normal RDW, mortality increased from 6% to 24%, and for those with an elevated RDW at admission, mortality increased from 22% to 40%. Conclusions and Relevance Elevated RDW at the time of hospital admission and an increase in RDW during hospitalization were associated with increased mortality risk for patients with COVID-19 who received treatment at 4 hospitals in a large academic medical center network. RDW is the coefficient of variation in RBC volume, or the SD divided by the mean. An increase in RDW must therefore correspond to a decrease in mean RBC volume, an increase in RBC volume variance, or both. Previous studies6, 8, 17, 19 have found evidence in some specific conditions that RDW elevation is caused by delayed clearance of older RBCs.

For all patients, an increasing RDW during hospitalization was associated with increased mortality risk: from 6% to 24% for those with a normal RDW at admission and from 22% to 40% for those with an elevated RDW at admission. Figure 3 shows that the mean RDW in the elevated group is 16. 4 compared with
13. 0 in the nonelevated group. In general, a 1. 25-fold higher RDW reflects a

1. 25-fold smaller MCV, a 1. 25-fold larger SD of the RBC volume distribution, or a combination of smaller changes to both. Patients whose RDW increased during admission also had an increased mortality risk. RDW is routinely measured and may be helpful for prioritizing patients for early, aggressive intervention and managing local hospital resource use. The results of the present study show that the use of RDW as a univariate marker relative to its predetermined reference interval is associated with substantially increased mortality risk. We also found that RDW was associated with the highest risk ratio when considered in multivariate models with some other blood count measures. The only other blood count measure studied with a statistically significant risk ratio was PLT count, and future investigation is warranted given the evidence of thrombotic complications within COVID-19 patients. 32, 33.

### Red cell distribution width associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease [^50534230]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the association of RDW with major composite CV outcomes and mortality in patients with CKD. The elevated RDW group had older patients, a lower proportion of male patients, lower LVEF levels, lower hemoglobin levels, lower albumin levels, and higher serum creatinine levels compared with the normal RDW group. RDW levels exhibited a graded increase across different stages of CKD. RDW ≥ 14.5% was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major composite CV outcomes and a trend toward higher mortality. A greater than 2-fold risk of major composite CV outcomes was observed in the elevated RDW group (HR = 2.581, CI = 1.541–4.322, P < .001). Age and impaired LVEF were additional covariates that were independent predictors of major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. The incidence of outcomes is higher than that reported in a previous study, because our patients were confirmed to have CAD.

Patients with higher RDW levels are often considered to have erythropoietic stress. In the general population, patients with higher RDW levels are likely to be older and have smoking habits, higher body mass index, lower hemoglobin levels, lower mean corpuscular volume, and higher serum creatinine levels. Elevated RDW was correlated with higher serum levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a larger left atrium, and lower LVEF values in patients with CV risk. RDW levels were also positively associated with C-reactive protein, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, and fibrinogen and negatively associated with albumin levels. Consequently, RDW was supposed to be a marker of inflammation, oxidative stress, and nutritional status.

The pathophysiology of elevated RDW toward unfavorable CV outcomes has not been elucidated. Anemia and elevated serum creatinine, commonly occurring in patients with CKD, were risk factors for CV events. Our results reveal that the effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes was independent of hemoglobin and creatinine levels. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies, which have reported that the level of RDW, even within the normal reference range, was associated with a higher risk of CV events and mortality irrespective of anemia, ferritin levels, and renal impairment. There should be other explanations for the poor prognostic effect of RDW on major composite CV outcomes in patients with CKD. Two novel risk factors for CV events, oxidative stress and inflammation, could be possible underlying mechanisms.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^c40aaa1f]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Interpretation of CBC, should consider the following:

Key cut-off values in adults are MCV below 79 fl and an MCH below 27 pg, below which heterozygosity for thalassaemia is indicated. However, each laboratory should establish their own cut-off ranges for these parameters, based on the ethnicity of their patient population(s) and patient age group(s).
Evaluation of CBC in samples more than 24 h after sampling should be made with caution, as the red cells increase in size, leading to falsely raised MCV. On the other hand, the MCH may be stable for up to 5 days, depending on storage conditions (4–20 °C);
In advanced pregnancy the RBC is not a useful parameter, due to possible haemodilution. Furthermore, iron-deficient women who are responding to iron supplementation may have increased RBC.
The RDW may be altered in several cardiac and hepatic conditionsand may have a limited discriminating potential especially in cases with combined iron deficiency.

Haemoglobin (Hb) pattern analysis

For a presumptive identification of abnormal haemoglobins at least two methods should be used. These methods include haemoglobin electrophoresis at pH 8.6 using cellulose acetate membrane, haemoglobin electrophoresis at pH 6.0 using acid agarose or citrate agar gel, isoelectric focusing (IEF), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). More details of these methods are described in the Supplementary information.

There are many recommendations related to the optimum application and interpretation of haemoglobin pattern analysis. The use of both HPLC and CE will maximize the detection of any Hb variant present in a sample and minimize false evaluation of artefacts. With automated systems, standards and controls are essential to verify that the equipment is working satisfactorily. Other important recommendations are summarized in the Supplementary Information.

### Association between red cell distribution width and risk of venous thromboembolism [^92ea1e4f]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

An association between high red cell distribution width (RDW) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been observed. However, it is not known whether this association differs within various manifestations of VTE, nor if there is an interaction between RDW and thrombophilia abnormalities on the risk of VTE.

Aims

To investigate whether RDW is a marker of the risk of VTE; to identify subgroups of patients in which the association between RDW and VTE is stronger; to investigate a possible interaction between RDW and thrombophilia abnormalities.

Methods

Case-control study on 730 patients with a first objectively-confirmed VTE episode (300 unprovoked and 430 provoked) consecutively referred to our Center between 2007 and 2013, and 352 healthy controls. Blood was taken for a thrombophilia work-up and a complete blood count, including RDW, at least three months after VTE.

Results

Individuals with RDW above the 90(th) percentile (> 14.6%) had a 2.5-fold increased risk of VTE compared to those with RDW ≤ 90(th) percentile, independently of age, sex, body mass index, other hematological variables and renal function (adjusted odds ratio: 2.52 [95%CI:1.42–4.47]). The risk was similar for unprovoked and provoked VTE, and slightly higher in patients with pulmonary embolism (adjusted odds ratio 3.19 [95%CI:1.68–6.09]) than in those with deep vein thrombosis alone (2.29 [95%CI:1.22–4.30]). No interaction between high RDW and thrombophilia abnormalities on the risk of VTE was observed.

Conclusion

Our findings confirm RDW as an independent and easily available marker for stratification of the risk of VTE.

### Relation between red cell distribution width and clinical outcomes after acute myocardial infarction [^ac4a5e5a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been associated with adverse outcomes in heart failure and stable coronary disease. We studied the association between baseline RDW and changes in RDW during hospital course with clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Baseline RDW and RDW change during hospital course were determined in 1,709 patients with AMI who were followed for a median of 27 months (range 6 to 48). The relation between RDW and clinical outcomes after hospital discharge were tested using Cox regression models, adjusting for clinical variables, baseline hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Compared to patients in the first RDW quintile, the adjusted hazard ratios for death progressively increased with higher quintiles of RDW (second quintile 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6 to 2.1; third quintile 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.2; fourth quintile 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.4; fifth quintile 2.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 4.7, p for trend < 0.0001). An increase in RDW during hospital course was also associated with subsequent mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.13 for 1-SD increase in RDW, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25). Similar results were obtained for the end point of heart failure. The association between increased RDW and worse outcome was evident in patients with and without anemia. In conclusion, there is a graded, independent association between increased RDW and mortality after AMI. An increase in RDW during hospitalization also portends adverse clinical outcome.

### Ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin level and risk of mortality [^60fa2984]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The identification of new biomarkers for the early detection of increased risk of mortality remains an unmet need. There has been significant progress in establishing the epidemiology of novel blood biomarkers for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, such as serum neurofilament light chain, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, retinol, alpha tocopherol, and beta carotene. Despite this progress, simple, inexpensive, and reliable indicators are still essential for predicting mortality in clinical practice. At present, routine laboratory tests are widely used in primary care and hospitals, and further use of routine clinical biomarkers is expected. For example, several new biomarkers, such as the prognostic nutritional index, ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte, and ratio of platelet to lymphocyte, were derived from routine laboratory tests. These simple integrated biomarkers showed significant associations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the general population. Therefore, there is still substantial interest in the use of routine biomarkers to identify persons who are at risk for mortality.

Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a marker from routine laboratory tests, reflects the degree of heterogeneity in erythrocyte volume. Increased RDW, resulting from impaired erythropoiesis and abnormal red blood cell survival, are associated with a variety of disorders and mortality. Serum albumin, the most abundant circulating protein in the blood, is an important marker of nutritional status and the inflammatory response. The physiological properties of albumin include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet aggregation activities as well as colloid osmotic effects. Several studies have reported that the serum albumin concentration is inversely associated with the incidence of dysfunction, disease, and mortality. Additionally, RDW is positively correlated with chronological age, while serum albumin is negatively correlated with chronological age, and RDW and albumin are associated with phenotypic and biological age and contribute greatly to individual variances in aging pace.
