## Question

USPTF guidelines on dexa scans

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the USPSTF 2025 osteoporosis screening recommendations, specifically who should be screened, how screening should be performed, what to do with the results, how to monitor patients, and how to address differences with other guidelines and evidence gaps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and population to which the USPSTF recommendation applies. Then, I should verify the core recommendations for women and the rationale. Next, I will examine the approach for postmenopausal women younger than 65 years and the role of risk assessment tools. After that, I need to check the position on men and why the evidence is insufficient. I will then review screening modalities and intervals, followed by how to interpret results and link them to treatment. Finally, I should integrate other guideline perspectives, highlight implementation issues, and close with a concise clinical summary and next steps for practice and research.

> Let me first confirm the scope and target population so I don't overgeneralize. The USPSTF 2025 statement addresses adults aged 40 years or older without a known diagnosis of osteoporosis or a history of fragility fracture, and it explicitly does not apply to persons with secondary osteoporosis due to medical conditions or chronic medications associated with bone loss, which require case-finding rather than population screening, so I need to keep that distinction clear in my mind and in my recommendations [^1144oXJw] [^114FiWr3].

> Now, I should verify the core recommendation for women aged 65 years or older. The USPSTF gives a Grade B recommendation to screen all women 65 years or older for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures, concluding with moderate certainty that screening has moderate net benefit, and this remains consistent with the 2018 recommendation while updating the evidentiary base and allowing DXA with or without fracture risk assessment tools [^114FiWr3] [^112uikYV] [^111uCT4K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about younger women; I need to check the approach for postmenopausal women younger than 65 years. The USPSTF recommends a Grade B screening strategy for those at increased risk, using a two-step process: first assess for risk factors or use a validated clinical risk assessment tool, then proceed to DXA for those identified as high risk, with the USPSTF emphasizing that example 10-year risk thresholds should not be used as rigid cutoffs but rather to inform shared decision-making about further testing, which I should explicitly communicate to avoid misapplication [^114FiWr3] [^114D43xw] [^111uCT4K].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base supporting this two-step approach so I don't overstate it. The USPSTF reviewed randomized trials using FRAX-based strategies that invited high-risk individuals for DXA and showed reductions in hip and major osteoporotic fractures, supporting the plausibility and effectiveness of risk stratification followed by targeted DXA, even though the trials did not directly compare universal DXA versus risk-tool-first strategies head-to-head in the same population [^1168w1fD].

> I should confirm the position on men, because this is often misunderstood. The USPSTF issues an I statement for men, concluding that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures, and explicitly notes that this is not a recommendation against screening but a call for more research. Clinicians should use clinical judgment in men, particularly when risk factors are present, and the recommendation does not apply to men with secondary osteoporosis or on bone-losing medications, where case-finding is appropriate [^112kSEYg] [^112JUWAe] [^114FiWr3].

> Let me think about screening modalities and intervals, and I should double-check the technical guidance. Screening can include central DXA BMD of the lumbar spine and hip, with or without fracture risk assessment, and the USPSTF acknowledges that evidence on optimal screening intervals is limited; in practice, repeating DXA every 2–3 years is reasonable, with shorter intervals considered when risk is higher or treatment is initiated, and serial monitoring should ideally use the same facility and equipment to ensure comparability and apply least significant change principles [^114FiWr3] [^117EHujD] [^113FWFCD].

> Next, I should review how to interpret results and link them to action, and I need to ensure I'm precise about thresholds. Osteoporosis is diagnosed by a T-score of −2.5 or lower at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or one-third radius, and women identified with osteoporosis should be further evaluated for secondary causes and offered evidence-based pharmacotherapy, given convincing evidence that treatment reduces vertebral and hip fractures in postmenopausal women, which operationalizes the screening benefit into improved outcomes [^116ngQh9] [^117KsQdR].

> But wait, what if other guidelines disagree? I should reconcile those differences transparently. ACOG aligns with USPSTF for universal screening at 65 and selective screening in younger postmenopausal women based on risk assessment, whereas AAFP historically discouraged DXA in women under 65 and men under 70 without risk factors, reflecting cost-effectiveness concerns. Endocrine and bone societies often endorse broader case-finding in men and younger adults with risk factors, and emerging data suggest under-screening in men and after fragility fractures, reinforcing the need to individualize beyond USPSTF's population screening stance in special populations [^116hhKKD] [^117MxMuQ] [^111TKS6Z].

> I will now examine special populations and secondary causes where case-finding is warranted, and I should confirm the common triggers. Men and women on prolonged glucocorticoids, individuals with primary hyperparathyroidism, men on androgen deprivation therapy, patients with inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, and those with hypogonadism are scenarios where DXA is recommended by disease-specific guidelines, and vertebral fracture assessment should be considered when height loss, glucocorticoid exposure, or age thresholds are met, because prevalent vertebral fractures materially change risk and management [^114eU93L] [^113KrW7g] [^113pSeNG] [^112mZo5y] [^112NG1Zt].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation and quality considerations so my recommendations are actionable. Real-world adherence to screening in women 65 and older is variable, and precision in DXA acquisition, analysis, and interpretation matters; facilities should perform precision studies, calculate least significant change, and use the same systems for follow-up, while clinicians should review images and raw data to detect artifacts and ensure valid comparisons, which reduces misclassification and inappropriate treatment decisions [^1179TuMq] [^113FWFCD] [^114VFyvg].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical synthesis to ensure internal consistency. For primary prevention in community-dwelling adults without prior fragility fractures, screen all women 65 and older with DXA, use a two-step risk assessment approach for postmenopausal women younger than 65 to target DXA, and recognize that evidence is insufficient for routine screening in men while maintaining vigilance for high-risk men who may benefit from case-finding. Throughout, integrate FRAX judiciously without rigid thresholds and apply the same equipment and quality safeguards for serial monitoring [^114FiWr3] [^114D43xw] [^113FWFCD].

> Finally, I should confirm the research gaps and next steps so we don't overstate certainty. The USPSTF highlights the need for better evidence on screening strategies in men, optimal start and stop ages, screening intervals, and validation of primary care–feasible risk tools across diverse populations, and clinicians should document shared decision-making in men and high-risk younger adults while advocating for equitable access to high-quality DXA and osteoporosis care pathways [^111ept1K] [^112JUWAe] [^113o2KQg].

---

The USPSTF recommends **routine DXA screening for all women aged ≥ 65 years** [^114FiWr3] and for **postmenopausal women < 65 years at increased risk** [^116SHDPp], using a formal clinical risk assessment tool (e.g. FRAX) [^114D43xw]. For men, the USPSTF concludes that **evidence is insufficient** [^112kSEYg] to recommend routine screening; clinicians should use clinical judgment for men with risk factors [^114FiWr3]. DXA is the **preferred test** [^112dWsGE] and can be performed with or without fracture risk assessment tools [^111uCT4K]. Screening intervals are not specified; repeat testing every 2–3 years is reasonable based on clinical judgment and risk profile [^117EHujD].

---

## USPSTF recommendations for women

### Women aged 65 years and older

For women aged 65 years and older, the USPSTF **recommends screening** [^113TBHaJ] for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing (DXA) to prevent osteoporotic fractures (Grade B) [^112uikYV]. This recommendation is based on moderate certainty that screening has a moderate net benefit in this population [^116rcbRG].

---

### Postmenopausal women younger than 65 years

For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years, the USPSTF **recommends screening** [^116SHDPp] for those at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool (e.g. FRAX) (Grade B) [^114FiWr3]. The USPSTF emphasizes that the results of risk assessment should inform decisions about further screening with DXA, rather than using specific risk thresholds mechanistically [^111uCT4K].

---

## USPSTF recommendations for men

For men, the USPSTF **concludes that evidence is insufficient** [^112kSEYg] to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis (Grade I statement) [^112uikYV]. Clinicians should use clinical judgment, considering individual risk factors such as age, low body weight, smoking, alcohol use, and medications associated with bone loss [^114FiWr3].

---

## Recommended screening method

DXA is the **preferred screening method** [^112dWsGE] for osteoporosis, providing accurate and reproducible measurements of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and hip [^111PBdE6]. The USPSTF notes that screening can include DXA with or without fracture risk assessment tools, such as FRAX [^111uCT4K].

---

## Screening intervals

The USPSTF **does not specify exact screening intervals** [^112JUWAe]; repeat DXA testing every 2–3 years is reasonable based on clinical judgment, risk factors, and patient preferences [^notfound].

---

## Clinical risk assessment tools

Several **clinical risk assessment tools** are available to identify individuals at increased risk of osteoporosis, including:

- **FRAX**: Estimates 10-year fracture risk based on clinical risk factors, with or without BMD [^1168w1fD].
- **OST (Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool)**: Simple tool based on age and weight [^112j8CW2].
- **ORAI (Osteoporosis Risk Assessment Instrument)**: Incorporates age, weight, and estrogen use [^116WNybN].

These tools help identify individuals who may benefit from further screening with DXA [^111uCT4K].

---

## Summary of USPSTF recommendations

| **Population** | **Recommendation** | **Grade** |
|-|-|-|
| Women ≥ 65 years | Screen with DXA | B |
| Postmenopausal women < 65 years | Screen if increased risk (FRAX) | B |
| Men | Insufficient evidence | I |

---

The USPSTF recommends **routine DXA screening** for women aged ≥ 65 years and for postmenopausal women < 65 years at increased risk, while evidence is insufficient for routine screening in men. DXA is the preferred screening method, and screening intervals should be individualized based on clinical judgment and risk factors.

### A critical appraisal of the quality of adult dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry guidelines in osteoporosis using the AGREE II tool: an euroAIM initiative [^112FhAxG]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Between June and July 2016 we searched for DXA guidelines using PubMed, EMBASE, Google and the Wiley Online Library, using the following keywords: "dual energy X-ray absorptiometry", "DXA", "DEXA", "bone densitometry", "Guidelines", "Official Positions", "Osteoporosis" and their expansions. Once guidelines had been retrieved, their references were also screened for further papers to include. We excluded from the results of our search those papers that were not primarily focused on DXA, such as national/international osteoporosis guidelines in which DXA was briefly mentioned in the context of a more comprehensive disease evaluation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: guidelines issued by national and international medical societies; full-manuscript available in English; guidelines must mainly contain recommendation on DXA, irrespective of other densitometric techniques; guidelines must focus mainly on the adult population (age > 18 years).

The evaluation of guideline quality was made using the AGREE II instrument through the official website dedicated online platform. The AGREE II protocol consists of 23 different items organised in 6 domains: domain 1 = "Scope and Purpose" (items 1–3); domain 2 = "Stakeholder Involvement" (items 4–6); domain 3 = "Rigor of Development" (items 7–14); domain 4 = "Clarity of Presentation" (items 15–17); domain 5 = "Applicability" (items 18–21); domain 6 = "Editorial Independence". These six domains are followed by two additional items ("Overall Assessment"), which includes "the rating of the overall quality of the guideline and whether the guideline would be recommended for use in practice". Table 1 shows a detailed description of all AGREE II items.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for osteoporosis in men, more specifically with respect to evaluation for fractures, ES 2012 guidelines recommend to obtain vertebral fracture assessment using DEXA in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis if there is a suspicion of previously undiagnosed vertebral fractures. Consider obtaining lateral spine radiographs if vertebral fracture assessment is unavailable or technically limited.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114FiWr3]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF osteoporosis screening recommendations — Women 65 years or older: Screen for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures (Grade: B), and postmenopausal women younger than 65 years with 1 or more risk factors for osteoporosis: Screen for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures (Grade: B). These recommendations apply to adults 40 years or older without known osteoporosis or history of fragility fractures and do not apply to persons with secondary osteoporosis due to an underlying medical condition or chronic use of a medication associated with bone loss. Screening includes dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone mineral density (BMD), with or without fracture risk assessment; screen women 65 years or older with DXA BMD, with or without fracture risk assessment. For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years, the USPSTF suggests first assessing for the presence of 1 or more risk factors for osteoporosis, and for women assessed to be at increased risk, screen for osteoporosis with DXA BMD, with or without fracture risk assessment. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for osteoporosis in men, and clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for osteoporosis in men.

Repeat BMD technical considerations

When possible, repeat BMD measurements should be conducted in the same facility with the same DXA system, same software, same scan mode, and same patient positioning and same hip and forearm to enable precise and accurate comparisons over time. Additionally, scans should be obtained at a facility with a skilled DXA technologist who has performed precision assessment. It is critical that both the initial and subsequent scans are of high quality and use the same protocol. Modern DXA systems include a 'copy' feature and other modifications to assist those performing and analyzing the scan to ensure that repeat scans are comparable to measurement parameters used in the previous scan. Quantitative BMD comparison with serial measurments is based on absolute BMD values in g/cm², and not T-scores or Z-scores. Each centre should calculate its own measurement (precision) error for each skeletal site using 30 duplicate or 15 triplicate scans from a representative group of patients in their practice. This value, known as the least significant change (LSC), is calculated with a 95% level of confidence as 2.77 × the precision error. The ISCD recommends evaluation of changes in BMD using absolute values, although reporting of changes is often expressed as percentages, which is easier for clinicians and patients to interpret [. When the precision error is 1%, the LSC is 2.8% and when the precision error is 2% the LSC is 5.6%.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteoporosis and bone mineral density: 2022 update [^112dWsGE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis constitutes a significant public health risk. An estimated 10.2 million adults in the United States > 50 years of age have osteoporosis, a systemic condition that weakens the bones increasing the susceptibility for fractures. Approximately one-half of women and nearly one-third of men > 50 years of age will sustain an osteoporotic fracture. These fractures are associated with a decrease in quality of life, diminished physical function, and reduced independence. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary imaging modality used to screen for osteoporosis in women > 65 years of age and men > 70 years of age. DXA may be used in patients < 65 years of age to evaluate bone mass density if there are additional risk factors. In certain situations, vertebral fracture assessment and trabecular bone score may further predict fracture risk, particularly in patients who are not yet osteoporotic but are in the range of osteopenia. Quantitative CT is useful in patients with advanced degenerative changes in the spine. Given the proven efficacy of pharmacologic therapy, the role of imaging to appropriately identify and monitor high-risk individuals is critical in substantially reducing osteoporosis-associated morbidity and mortality, and reducing the considerable cost to the health care system. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115ceMto]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The latest ISCD 2023 update adds the following:
Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy.
Follow-up BMD testing should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management.
Follow-up BMD testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed, but should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention.
Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment.
Repeat BMD testing intervals must be individualized considering an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors which are associated with bone loss.
Shorter intervals between BMD testing may be indicated in the presence of factors associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. Examples include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies, medical disorders such as malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases, and other conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.
If changes in BMD are outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care.
A DXA report (baseline and follow-up) should state that a follow-up exam is recommended as long as a valid comparison is available, and the precise timing depends particular clinical circumstances.
If the DXA interpreter has adequate clinical information, a precise timing for the next BMD should be recommended; otherwise, a general recommendation about repeat testing should still be part of the report.

### Identifying younger postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using USPSTF-recommended osteoporosis risk assessment tools [^112j8CW2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source and Participants

We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a large-scale prospective study of postmenopausal women. Across 40 US clinical centers, healthy postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years were enrolled in either the WHI observational study or the WHI clinical trials and were followed up for over 30 years using a battery of health, lifestyle, and psychosocial metrics. The WHI clinical trial was composed of 3 randomized clinical trials studying low-fat dietary modification, menopausal hormone therapy, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The goal of the WHI observational study was to evaluate common causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly cardiovascular, cancer, and osteoporotic outcomes. The Institutional Review Board at each enrolling institution approved the WHI. All participants provided written informed consent. WHI approval and participant consent also apply to the present study. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

The WHI Bone Density Substudy measured osteoporosis at the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spine via BMD measurements at 3 of 40 clinical centers (Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Birmingham, Alabama). Participants (n = 11 461 women) underwent hip and anteroposterior lumbar spine BMD testing via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic QDR 2000 or QDR 4500 [Hologic Inc]). Standard protocols were used for positioning and analysis of DXA measurements. Quality assurance included review of lumbar spine and hip phantom scans at each center, use of calibration phantoms across clinical sites, flagging of scans with specific problems, and review of a random sample of all scans.

The current study analyzed WHI Bone Density Substudy participants younger than 65 years who reported at baseline that they were not using prescription osteoporosis drug therapies (bisphosphonate, calcitonin, or selective estrogen receptor modulator) and who had available data for calculation of osteoporosis risk. Data were collected from October 1993 to December 1998and analyzed between September 23, 2023, and April 10, 2024.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1144oXJw]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF osteoporosis screening — update and scope: The statement updates the "2018 USPSTF recommendation on screening for osteoporosis" and notes that in 2018 the USPSTF "recommended screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool". For the current statement, "screening can include DXA BMD, with or without fracture risk assessment", and the supporting systematic review evaluated benefits and harms in "adults 40 years or older with no known diagnosis of osteoporosis or history of fragility fracture".

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^115nW17Z]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis (screening), ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain bone mineral density testing with central/axial DEXA in patients with nonmetastatic cancer who have ≥ 1 risk factors for osteoporotic fracture. Obtain other bone mineral density testing, such as quantitative ultrasound or calcaneal DEXA, in settings where DEXA is not available or technically feasible.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^117KsQdR]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF bisphosphonate therapy for low bone density — trial scope and pooled effects indicate that 21 RCTs compared a bisphosphonate with placebo, most conducted among postmenopausal women and often using T-score thresholds, with 6 of 21 trials requiring T scores in the osteoporotic range. Across 10 trials, vertebral fractures were reduced (pooled RR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.45–0.66; 10 RCTs; 9015 participants]), corresponding to an ARD of 18 fewer vertebral fractures per 1000 participants treated (95% CI, 23 to 13 fewer). Across 6 trials, hip fractures showed a pooled RR of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.45–1.00; 6 trials; 12 055 participants), corresponding to an ARD of 3 fewer hip fractures per 1000 participants (95% CI, 0 to 5 fewer).

### Prevalence and treatment of osteoporosis prior to elective shoulder arthroplasty [^111uhx1M]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed for demographic information, preoperative osteoporosis risk factors (Table 1), previous DEXA testing, and osteoporosis pharmacotherapy (prescription within 6 months before or after surgery). The expanded Care Everywhere Network of the EMR was also reviewed to include available electronic data from participating outside medical facilities. DEXA was assessed by the lead author for accuracy before extraction of BMD data and T-scores. Inaccurate DEXA results because of improper default identification of bone edges and regions of interest were excluded. The lowest T-score from either the average of 2+ lumbar vertebrae (excluding vertebrae with degenerative or surgical changes) or proximal femur (femoral neck and total femur) was recorded. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), National Bone Health Alliance, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria for BMD testing (Table 2) and pharmacologic osteoporosis treatment (Table 3) were applied to all patients. The term "appropriately screened" was used to describe patients for whom BMD testing was indicated and who had undergone DEXA in the 2 years before surgery. The term "appropriately treated" was used to describe patients for whom treatment was indicated (Table 3) and who received a prescription for antiosteoporosis pharmacotherapy within 6 months before or after surgery. Previous osteoporosis medications included bisphosphonates, denosumab, raloxifene, abaloparatide, or teriparatide. The FRAX calculator was used to estimate fracture risk without BMD for all patients. A separate calculation of FRAX with BMD was completed for those who had DEXA testing in the 2 years preoperatively.

Statistical analysis was completed using Microsoft Excel. Continuous variables were compared using 2-sample t tests assuming unequal variance. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. An a priori power analysis was not completed because the aim of the study was not to detect a difference between groups. In some areas, descriptive statistics were used because the intention was not to detect differences between groups but rather to profile the bone health of all patients presenting for shoulder arthroplasty.

No outside funding was involved in this project.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112U34QD]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) evidence assessment and population — Population is adults 40 years or older without known osteoporosis or history of fragility fractures. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older has moderate net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk has moderate net benefit. For men, the USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms for screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men cannot be determined.

### EAA clinical guideline on management of bone health in the andrological outpatient clinic [^113k2744]. Andrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for osteoporosis in men, more specifically with respect to patients with hypogonadism (X-ray), EAA 2018 guidelines recommend to obtain dorsolumbar spine X-ray when osteoporotic fractures are suspected based on medical history, physical examination, and/or the presence of localized bone pain. Obtain an X-ray to confirm the diagnosis of severe osteoporosis, (1, Moderate) but do not obtain an X-ray for the diagnosis of osteoporosis or osteopenia. (1, High) (Multiple grades) Do not use other techniques other than DEXA and X-ray for the diagnosis of osteoporosis or osteopenia and osteoporotic fractures. (1, Moderate).

### ACG clinical guideline: preventive care in inflammatory bowel disease [^114eU93L]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density screening in inflammatory bowel disease — A low threshold should be maintained for screening individuals who have used glucocorticoids at any time, and BMD measurement (with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan) is recommended in all patients starting oral corticosteroid therapy specifically in those who have used oral corticosteroid therapy for longer than 3 consecutive months in a dose ≥ 7.5 mg/day of prednisone-equivalent in the absence of baseline BMD measurement; the minimal dose cutoff is supported by data that the relative risk of vertebral fracture increases from 2.6 with doses of 2.5–7.5 mg/day to 5.2 with doses > 7.5 mg/day.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^11716KnZ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Part IV: Clinical indications for DXA and VFA

The majority of international guidelines incorporate a case finding strategy based on clinical risk factors. Although screening by DXA is nominally recommended in the USA for all women aged 65 years or older, and men aged 70 years or older, in practice there is little systematic application of this policy. The MRC SCOOP study in the UK demonstrated a 28% reduction in the risk of hip fracture in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial of primary care screening, using FRAX hip fracture probability. Meta-analysis of these findings with trials in the Netherlands and Denmark have demonstrated evidence for screening efficacy and informed a recent IOF position paper supporting implementation of screening for high fracture risk. Various approaches have been suggested internationally to optimise screening efficiency; strategies such as targeting older individuals and use of automated systems which identify those at high risk from primary care records, offer potential ways forward.

For younger adults, DXA testing is recommended for those with a previous fracture or other major risk factors for osteoporosis and fracture such as chronic glucocorticoid use or hypogonadism, (see Tables 4 and 5, and the Statements based on IWG consensus). Other risk factors include lifestyle choices, medical conditions and medications associated with increased fracture risk or accelerated bone loss or those taking or being considered for osteoporosis treatment. A comprehensive list has been developed by the IWG.

### GPs' perceptions of the role of DEXA scanning: an exploratory study [^1138psoc]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Current recommendation are that women with clinical indicators of low bone mineral density should be offered a DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometer) scan to help assess the need for treatment, but little is known about GPs' attitudes towards DEXA scans.

Objective

Our aim was to explore GPs' beliefs about diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, including the role that DEXA scanning can play.

Methods

Semi-structured interviews with five GPs in the North Staffordshire area were used to explore how GPs make decisions about diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, including the use of scans and the application of potential clinical risk factors to decisions about screening and treatment.

Results

The decision-making process about whether and who to scan is complex and was influenced by a range of factors including issues of diagnosis, treatment, patient pressure and 'external' factors such as practice protocol and the perceived local availability of scans.

Conclusions

GPs found it difficult to decide who and when to scan despite guidelines for primary care. Perceived local availability of DEXA scans is important and has implications for raising awareness.

### Dexa for osteoporosis… [^113av5i7]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Don't use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry screening for osteoporosis in women under age 65 or men under 70 with no risk factors. DEXA is not cost effective in younger, low-risk patients, but is cost effective in older patients. Sources: U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, American College of Preventive Medicine, National Osteoporosis Foundation. In the United States, by 2012 approximately 12 million people over the age of 50 are expected to have osteoporosis. The preferred method for diagnosing osteoporosis is bone mineral density testing, which looks at important sites of osteoporotic fractures with high accuracy and moderate cost, and involves modest radiation exposure. Guidelines from multiple organizations, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the U. S.

Preventive Services Task Force, and the National Osteoporosis Foundation, recommend beginning duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry screening for osteoporosis at age 65 in women and men at age 70 with no risk factors. Risk factors for osteoporotic fractures include: a family history of osteoporosis, previous fractures, white race, dementia, poor nutrition, cigarette smoking, alcoholism, low weight and body mass index, estrogen deficiency, early menopause or prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea, long-term low calorie intake, history of falls, and inadequate physical activity.

Bone mineral density measurement sites and techniques (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) — preferred and not recommended: DXA of the lumbar spine and proximal femur (hip) provides accurate and reproducible BMD measurements at important sites of osteoporosis-associated fracture, and optimally both hips should be initially measured; these axial sites are preferred over peripheral sites for both baseline and serial measurements, and the most reliable comparative results are obtained when the same instrument and, ideally, the same technologist are used for serial measurements at a high-quality DXA facility; diagnostic criteria, therapeutic studies, and cost-effectiveness data have been based primarily on DXA measurements of the total hip, femoral neck, and/or lumbar spine (L1 to L4) and are the preferred measurement sites, and the 1/3 radius can also be used as a diagnostic site particularly when other preferred sites are not available; use of other subregions within the proximal femur (i.e. Ward's triangle or trochanter) or of an individual vertebra has not been validated and is not recommended; several other techniques are available, and peripheral bone density measurements can identify patients at increased risk for fracture, but the diagnostic DXA criteria established by the WHO and recommended by AACE apply only to the axial measurements and distal 1/3 of the radius; thus, other technologies should not be used to diagnose osteoporosis but may be used to assess fracture risk.

Obesity risk assessment — BMI and waist circumference measurement — Measures used to estimate body fat and quantify risk include BMI, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, bioimpedance, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Because obesity/overweight defined by BMI is the most studied and standardized approach, we recommend its measurement for primary screening of individuals needing weight loss; a USPSTF document found good evidence supporting the use of BMI to identify adults at increased risk of future morbidity and mortality, and BMI should be interpreted with caution in persons of Asian ancestry, older adults, and muscular adults. Increased waist circumference has been associated with increased cardiometabolic and ASCVD risk; central adiposity captured by waist circumference may be missed when BMI is used as the only measure of obesity. Waist circumference measurement is recommended in all patients with BMI < 35 kg/m², and elevated waist circumference is defined as ≥ 40 inches (≥ 102 cm) in men and ≥ 35 inches (≥ 88 cm) in women. Combining waist circumference and BMI may be the best approach for assessing obesity-related risk, and counseling and comprehensive lifestyle interventions, including calorie restriction and adjunctive therapies, have been associated with significant reductions in waist circumference and improvement in cardiometabolic risk profiles.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115JPHTD]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale — screening for osteoporosis: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that centrally measured dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone mineral density (BMD) can accurately predict osteoporotic fractures in women and that clinical risk assessment tools have sufficient accuracy to identify osteoporosis in women and predict certain osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate direct evidence that screening for fracture risk in women 65 years or older provides a moderate benefit in preventing fractures and convincing evidence that treatment of women 65 years or older with osteoporosis provides a moderate benefit in preventing fractures; for postmenopausal women younger than 65 years with risk factors for osteoporosis, it found adequate evidence that screening can detect osteoporosis and fracture risk and convincing evidence that treatment provides a moderate benefit in preventing fractures, while evidence on benefits in men was inadequate. Based on the nature of screening and the low likelihood of serious harms, the USPSTF found adequate evidence to bound the harms of screening for osteoporosis as no greater than small and adequate evidence that the harms of treatment for osteoporosis are small in women, with inadequate evidence on harms in men. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older has moderate net benefit and that screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk has moderate net benefit, while due to a lack of available data the evidence is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms for screening in men cannot be determined.

### Recommendations for improving women's bone health throughout the lifespan [^113o2KQg]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Increasing access and coverage for DXA screening

Currently, the health care system performs poorly in assessing bone health, and screening recommendations are not satisfactorily modeled for secondary prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) recommend bone measurement screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years and older and in women younger than 65 who are at increased clinical risk. However, rapid bone loss can occur in women through the early postmenopausal years, leading to increased risk for osteoporosis. As such, the Working Group highlighted that another underutilized window of opportunity to engage women around the topic of PBM and bone health is during the transition to menopause (perimenopause).

Awareness of declining bone mass tends to increase in postmenopausal conversations, and usually only after an inciting event (e.g. a bone fracture) or around 65 years of age, when broader screening is recommended for women without certain risk factors. The average age of menopause in the United States is 51 years old; waiting to engage women more than 10 years postmenopause is a missed opportunity to introduce preventive lifestyle practices and potential treatment options that may preserve bone density and reduce fall and fracture risk as estrogen levels decline and compromise bone health in midlife and later.

Thus, the Working Group resolved that reducing the consensus guidelines' recommended age for screening to the perimenopause window would provide women and their health care providers with an opportunity to establish a baseline assessment of bone health before the majority of rapid postmenopausal bone loss occurs. Using this preventive approach, BMD and other measures of bone health (e.g. vertebral imaging and height) would then be monitored throughout and after the menopause transition to assess risk of fracture or osteoporosis development.

Notably, the USPSTF is in the process of updating its osteoporosis screening recommendations. In June of 2022, the USPSTF Final Research Plan was released with a Draft Recommendation forthcoming. The SWHR encourages bone health researchers, health care providers, and other stakeholders in bone and women's health to support the review process with comments and expert feedback when appropriate.

Part V: Summary and future directions

DXA is widely used to diagnose osteoporosis, assess fracture risk, and monitor changes in BMD. The clinical utility of DXA is highly dependent on the quality of the scan acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. Healthcare professionals are best equipped to manage patients when BMD measurements are performed accurately and precisely and when interpretation follows well-established standards. VFA, when feasible, can be used in selected patients in whom a DXA is performed. The strengths of DXA include its wide availability, well-validated system including large normative databases, ease of performance and very low radiation dose. DXA services should also regularly audit their practice and performance.

Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be established for each DXA facility, with team training that includes physicians and technologists, to optimize DXA quality and reduce the error rate of DXA measurements. In the future, there may be additional applications of DXA beyond those described here. Specifically, TBS is used as a determinant of bone "quality" to complement quantitative measurements. There are emerging periprosthetic and orthopedic uses of DXA, atypical femur fractures (AFF) assessment tools and bone strain index (BSI) parameters that may soon have clinical applicability. Hip axis length (HAL) can be assessed with DXA and may be associated with hip fracture risk in postmenopausal women. Finally, DXA-based 3D modelling is a new technology to assess the trabecular and cortical bone compartments of the hip and may contribute to the monitoring of therapy. All these developments are of interest to our imaging field, but more evidence is needed to make recommendations for the application of these novel imaging techniques in clinical practice, e.g. for whole body composition with DXA.

Facilities that are needed but are not available for clinicians should be listed on a research agenda and proposed to our DXA community. The launch of a world-wide survey of the DXA community, to provide information about the distribution and types of DXA machines, including training and certification on DXA and protocols followed would be of interest as well, and how well the DXA vensors are included for the installation, cross-calibration, quality control and also technical and clinical education on the use of the new DXA system.

In conclusion, this updated DXA practice guideline provides recommendations to assist imaging specialists and clinicians in requesting, performing and interpreting DXA and VFA. The updated DXA practice guideline did not include applications in pediatrics, but will be followed in another publication of IWG.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

Components of the final DXA report

The final DXA and VFA reports should follow a standard template and may include recommendations on additional diagnostic work-up (e.g. radiograph of the spine, evaluation of secondary causes of osteoporosis) and indications for treatment. See Tables 2 and 3 and the ISCD website.

Table 2
Components of DXA report

Table 3
Components of VFA report

Overall, inadequate awareness and knowledge of potential pitfalls and nonadherence to the ISCD Official Positions in DXA interpretation may lead to inaccuracies in BMD readings. Aiming to reduce reporting errors, a DXA interpretation template based on ISCD recommendations has been developed. Implementing a DXA reporting template may reduce major errors, shorten reporting time and improve report quality.

DXA Reporting:

The acquisition of non-dominant/left hip or is appropriate to generate data for reporting T-scores (or Z-scores).
When both hips have been scanned, the lowest T-score (or Z-score) of the right or left femoral neck or total hip should be used for diagnostic classification, but not the mean T-score (or Z-score).
When both hips have been scanned on repeat tests, mean bilateral total hip BMD should be used for monitoring.
Preferred terminology is to use "hip" when describing the site instead of " femur" or "total proximal femur". Use "bilateral hips" when referring to both hips.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^1129EmHG]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Bone density loss — more than one third of men over age 50 years with testosterone deficiency have bone density loss, and the Panel recommends that men who present with low-trauma bone fractures (LTBF) have their testosterone measured; clinicians might also consider obtaining a bone densitometry (DEXA) scan to establish a baseline measurement. In older men, a meta-analysis of 3 observational studies of patients aged 60–74 years showed no significant BMD difference between low and normal testosterone groups (mean difference -0.19 g/cm², CI: -0.44, 0.05). In contrast, one study of 162 men aged 65–88 years with total testosterone < 300 ng/dL found low testosterone was a significant independent predictor of lower BMD after adjustment (p < 0.05). In younger men, a retrospective review of 399 men (mean age 37 years) with a mean total testosterone of 308 ng/dL found that 35% had osteopenic BMD and 3% had osteoporosis; BMD increased in patients treated with testosterone therapy, and the authors concluded that younger testosterone-deficient men may benefit from routine DEXA scans, particularly with concomitant low E2 and low BMI.

Statements based on IWG consensus:

DXA BMD measurement should be performed at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck and, if indicated one-third radius.
Consider DXA in all women at the age ≥ 65 years, men age > 70 years, and women and men age ≥ 50 years with risk factors for osteoporosis (Table 4).
Evaluate for prevalent vertebral fractures with VFA or standard radiography in patients ≥ 50 years with specific risk factors, or with a T-score < -1.0 in older men and women, historical height loss > 4 cm, self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or long-term glucocorticoid therapy (Table 5).
Consider DXA in younger adults (premenopausal women and men under 50 years) with specific diseases, and/or medical drugs and/or fracture.
Each DXA facility should determine its precision error and calculate the least significant change (LSC), to be repeated when a new DXA system is installed.
In accordance with the established WHO operational definition, osteoporosis is diagnosed based on a T-score of − 2.5 or lower in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or one-third radius. The lowest T-score at any of these measured sites should be used for diagnosis.
Some societies presumed a diagnosis of osteoporosis in the presence of low-trauma major fracture (hip, spine, forearm, humerus, pelvis).
The NHANES III reference database is recommended for T-score calculation and depending on the society based on 20–29 years aged White women or same sex-type.
Recommend follow-up DXA as indicated, depending on clinical circumstances.
Follow-up of patients should ideally be conducted in the same facility with the same DXA system, if the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to recommended standards.
The frequency of BMD testing in clinical practice may be influenced by the patient's clinical state, national clinical guidelines, cost and reimbursement. Suggested intervals between BMD testing are typically 1–5 years after starting or changing therapy.
Procedural certification and repeated audits are recommended.

Outcomes

In line with routine clinical practice and osteoporosis treatment guidelines, we established the primary outcome of this study as osteoporosis defined by a BMD DXA measurement T score of –2.5 or lower at 1 or more of 3 anatomical locations: femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine. T scores were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III phase 1 normative reference database per the World Health Organization 2007 technical report. The secondary outcome was osteoporosis defined by a DXA measurement T score of –2.5 or lower only at the femoral neck.

Clinical Risk Assessment Tools

The 3 clinical risk assessments tools examined in this study were OSIRIS, ORAI, and OST (formulas provided in the eTable in Supplement 1). OSIRIS scores are based on age, weight (kilogram), current estrogen use, and prior low-impact fracture.ORAI scores are based on age, weight (kilogram), and use of estrogen.OST scores are based on weight (kilogram) and age (0.2 × [body weight (kilogram) – age [years]), truncated to yield an integer. We calculated OSIRIS, ORAI, and OST scores using the current study cohort's baseline data. Weight was measured at each clinical center using standardized protocols. Current use of estrogen (oral or transdermal) and history of fractures were reported via the baseline self-assessment questionnaire. The primary analysis examined guidelines-recommended score cutoffs or thresholds for the tools (OSIRIS score < 1, ORAI score > 8, and OST score < 2) in predicting osteoporosis.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older has moderate net benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that screening in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk has moderate net benefit, while the evidence is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms for screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men cannot be determined. To achieve the benefit of screening to reduce morbidity and mortality from fractures, women found to have osteoporosis should be further evaluated, counseled, and, if appropriate, receive evidence-based management.

### Consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology on the quality of dxa scans and reports [^114VFyvg]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

High-quality dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans are necessary for accurate diagnosis of osteoporosis and monitoring of therapy; however, DXA scan reports may contain errors that cause confusion about diagnosis and treatment. This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology consensus statement was generated to draw attention to many common technical problems affecting DXA report conclusions and provide guidance on how to address them to ensure that patients receive appropriate osteoporosis care.

Methods

The DXA Writing Committee developed a consensus based on discussion and evaluation of available literature related to osteoporosis and osteodensitometry.

Results

Technical errors may include errors in scan acquisition and/or analysis, leading to incorrect diagnosis and reporting of change over time. Although the International Society for Clinical Densitometry advocates training for technologists and medical interpreters to help eliminate these problems, many lack skill in this technology. Suspicion that reports are wrong arises when clinical history is not compatible with scan interpretation (e.g., dramatic increase/decrease in a short period of time; declines in previously stable bone density after years of treatment), when different scanners are used, or when inconsistent anatomic sites are used for monitoring the response to therapy. Understanding the concept of least significant change will minimize erroneous conclusions about changes in bone density.

Conclusion

Clinicians must develop the skills to differentiate technical problems, which confound reports, from real biological changes. We recommend that clinicians review actual scan images and data, instead of relying solely on the impression of the report, to pinpoint errors and accurately interpret DXA scan images.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^1133jfzD]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Part I: Technical procedures DXA

Quality control

Both precision and accuracy are necessary in DXA scanning to ensure that the data are clinically meaningful. The precision (reliability) of BMD measurements depends on the technical stability of the instrument, the ability of the technologist to position the patient consistently with repeat scans over time, and the correct analysis of the DXA images. Quality assurance and control procedures vary by manufacturer; some require scanning a calibration block that analyzes, checks and calibrates mechanical function, radiation quality, and absorption coefficient of tissue-equivalent materials. It is also recommended that a spine phantom be scanned daily before use, or at least three times a week, with plotting and reviewing of the phantom data. If the results fall outside the acceptable limits and surpass the set thresholds for service, the scanner should be evaluated by a field service engineer.

Each DXA facility should determine its precision error and calculate the least significant change (LSC) for the machine, repeating when a new DXA system is installed. To perform a precision analysis, see the online International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) 2019 document and the updated version of 2023. Importantly, precision assessment is not research, but a minimum standard in clinical practice.

Cross-calibration procedures are necessary for precise longitudinal assessment when replacing scanners (the same model is usually preferred) or validating measurements between systems (in different institutes). This process is complex and requires detailed knowledge of the process and advanced planning. When replacing a DXA system with another of the same manufacturer and model, cross-calibration should be done by scanning the phantom ten times on each scanner. The measures should be within 1%, but preferably within 0.5%. When replacing an entire system from the same manufacturer but a different technology, or one from a different manufacturer, the LSC using patients representative of the clinic population and sites to be scanned is required on both the old and new systems.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for osteoporosis in men, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ES 2012 guidelines recommend to consider monitoring bone mineral density by DEXA at the spine and hip every 1–2 years to assess the response to treatment. Consider reducing the frequency of measurements if bone mineral density appears to reach a plateau. Consider obtaining a bone turnover marker at 3–6 months after initiation of treatment using a bone resorption marker (such as serum C-telopeptide of type I collagen or serum or urine N-telopeptide of type I collagen) for antiresorptive therapy and a bone formation marker (such as serum procollagen I N-propeptide) for anabolic therapy.

Screening

Bone density screening is essential for early detection of patients at risk for SREs, but is not performed consistently in men. Results of a study by the US Department of Veterans Affairs suggest that routine screening is warranted among patients with prostate cancer (Table 2). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the most widely used method to measure BMD. The World Health Organization (WHO) and many national health agencies recommend that BMD be monitored in patients with prostate cancer (Table 2). As per WHO guidelines, baseline DEXA scans are recommended. Although computed tomography and other imaging techniques might be used to assess bone mineralization, the widespread application to clinical practice is limited for these modalities.

### Recommendations for measurement of bone mineral density and identifying persons to be treated for osteoporosis [^111S7VTX]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines exist for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women. These guidelines present a uniform set of recommendations. Unfortunately, studies have shown a low rate of screening and treatment, particularly in high-risk groups, such as patients who have experienced a fracture. It is hoped that quality improvement projects, such as that being conducted by the American Medical Association in conjunction with numerous specialty societies, will lead to an improvement in physician practices in this area that will result in a reduction in morbidity and mortality from osteoporotic fractures.

### Do guidelines matter? Implementation of the ACG and AGA osteoporosis screening guidelines in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients who meet the guidelines' criteria [^114rnqZS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) have both recently issued guidelines (the "Guidelines") regarding the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to determine the yield of implementing the Guidelines' recommendations in a prospective cohort of IBD patients and identify the prevalence of bone loss, risk factors, and potential influence on management.

Methods

One hundred consecutive IBD patients who fulfilled the Guidelines' criteria underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning (DEXA) scanning of the lumbar vertebrae and bilateral hips. Demographic data, risk factor information, and changes in therapy based on screening were collected and analyzed.

Results

Indications for screening were history of prolonged past or concurrent steroid use (92%), postmenopausal status (7%), and history of low trauma fracture (7%). Forty-four percent of patients had osteopenia of either the lumbar spine or the hips, 12% had osteoporosis of either the spine or hips, and 44% had normal bone density. In a univariate analysis, factors predicting a greater likelihood of osteoporosis (but not osteopenia) were a diagnosis of Crohn's disease (vs. ulcerative colitis), low body mass index in women, and postmenopausal status. Specific therapies based on DEXA findings were initiated in 69% of patients: oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation in 69% and an oral bisphoshphonate in 20%.

Conclusions

Implementation of the Guidelines led to the detection of osteopenia or osteoporosis and initiation of specific therapies in a majority of patients who met the Guidelines' criteria for DEXA screening.

The International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) periodically holds Position Development Conferences for the purpose of establishing standards and guidelines for indications, acquisition, and interpretation of bone density tests. Topics are selected for consideration by the ISCD Scientific Advisory Committee, reviewed by scientific working groups, and presented to an international panel of experts. Topic categories addressed to date include indications for bone density testing, selection of reference databases for T-scores and Z-scores, clinical applications for central and peripheral bone densitometry, serial bone density testing, instrument precision assessment, phantom scanning and calibration testing, requirements for a bone density report, nomenclature, and diagnosis of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, premenopausal women, men, and children. After an open session for public comment and discussion, the panel convenes for consideration of each topic and makes recommendations for positions to the ISCD Board of Directors. Recommendations that are accepted become the Official Positions of the ISCD. This Special Report summarizes the methodology of the ISCD Position Development Conferences and presents selected Official Positions of general interest.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^113TdJGi]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

When using DXA to monitor BMD over time at the lumbar spine and total hip, only changes which meet or exceed the LSC should be considered significant and noted as such. The ISCD recommends that the maximal acceptable LSC for a technologist is 5.0% for the total hip and 5.3% for the lumbar spine. In clinical practice, the absolute change in BMD in gm/cm² is preferred over % change for LSC. Given variability in machines and systems from one imaging center to the next, the LSC from the manufacturer should not be used without confirmation. Similarly, a change in BMD between instruments that are not cross-calibrated cannot be reliably reported since it is not possible to know if BMD has actually changed, or if the change is solely due to measurement error in the absence of knowledge of the LSC. Finally, if a patient has a known diagnosis of osteoporosis based on prior imaging, a follow-up scan does not change the original diagnosis. Rather, the repeated imaging is used to monitor changes in BMD over time. Even if T-scores improve to > -2.5, the diagnosis of osteoporosis is durable. Preferable patients should return to the same DXA machine that was used to perform their most recent prior study, provided that the facility in vivo precision and LSC values are known and do not exceed established maximum values.

Alternatively, a DXA machine of one manufacturer enables comparison by using conversion factor for different machine. See also part IV, Clinical Indications.

### Osteoporosis: what are the implications of DEXA scanning' high risk' women in primary care? [^113TgD4m]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Current recommended practice for the use of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans in screening for osteoporosis is to concentrate on women at 'high risk'.

Objective

We have applied such a screening strategy, in a general practice setting, to estimate the number of women requiring scans.

Methods

A two-phase survey was carried out: (i). postal screen of clinical indicators for low bone mineral density (BMD) to define women at 'high risk'; and (ii). DEXA scanning of the sample at 'high risk' set in two general practices in North Staffordshire. Computerized general practice records were used to define a purposive sample of 1001 women, to receive the screening tool, consisting of three equal size groups (i). those with an early hysterectomy; (ii). those receiving oral corticosteroids on repeat prescription; and (iii). those on the practice cervical smear register. A random sample of women defined at 'high risk' by the screening tool were invited to have a DEXA scan. The main outcome of interest was the presence of low BMD as measured by a DEXA scanner.

Results

Sixty-five out of 95 women invited (68%) agreed to undergo a DEXA scan: median age = 52 years (interquartile range 44–64 years). Twenty-nine of these 65 women (45%) were classified with low BMD (WHO criteria): 90% had densities below their age-matched mean. Extrapolating from the observed findings to the main study practice (n = 9000 total population), we estimate that 162 women would be defined at 'high risk', and, if all were offered a scan, 105 would comply and 56 would be defined with low BMD.

Conclusions

Using this approach, we estimate the unmet need, in women, for DEXA scans to be 180 per 10000 total practice population. Allowing for scan uptake, this would define approximately 60 women per 10000 total practice population with low BMD. The application of this screening strategy has identified a group of women who might benefit from treatment or prophylaxis for osteoporosis.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116Tzc5F]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — population and risk assessment applies to nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years seen in primary care settings who have overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 and ≥ 30, respectively) and no symptoms of diabetes, and overweight and obesity are the strongest risk factors. Clinicians should consider screening at an earlier age in disproportionately affected groups and at a lower BMI in Asian American persons; the ADA suggests that a BMI of 23 or greater may be an appropriate cut point in Asian American persons, and a difference in body fat composition in Asian persons results in underestimation of risk based on BMI thresholds used to define overweight in the US.

### Screening for osteoporosis: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^1127hjix]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis.

Methods

The USPSTF evaluated evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of risk assessment instruments for osteoporosis and fractures, the performance of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and peripheral bone measurement tests in predicting fractures, the harms of screening for osteoporosis, and the benefits and harms of drug therapy for osteoporosis in women and men.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women aged 65 years or older and in younger women whose fracture risk is equal to or greater than that of a 65-year-old white woman who has no additional risk factors. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis in men. (I statement).

### ACR appropriateness criteriaOsteoporosis and Bone mineral density [^111mHFqo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a considerable public health risk, with 50% of women and 20% of men > 50 years of age experiencing fracture, with mortality rates of 20% within the first year. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary diagnostic modality by which to screen women > 65 years of age and men > 70 years of age for osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women < 65 years of age with additional risk factors for fracture, DXA is recommended. Some patients with bone mineral density above the threshold for treatment may qualify for treatment on the basis of vertebral body fractures detected through a vertebral fracture assessment scan, a lateral spine equivalent generated from a commercial DXA machine. Quantitative CT is useful in patients with advanced degenerative bony changes in their spines. New technologies such as trabecular bone score represent an emerging role for qualitative assessment of bone in clinical practice. It is critical that both radiologists and referring providers consider osteoporosis in their patients, thereby reducing substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost to the health care system. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: treatment of metastatic carcinoma and myeloma of the femur [^1144LY6L]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Imaging findings and atypical fractures — in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that imaging findings of lateral cortical thickening may be associated with increased atypical femur fracture risk (Strength of Recommendation: Consensus). Atypical femur fracture (AFF) radiographs typically show thickening of the lateral cortex ("beaking") in the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur, and a transverse radiolucency through the lateral thickening is concerning for impending fracture and is sometimes referred to as the "dreaded black line"; in 70% of patients, fracture is preceded by prodromal thigh pain. The incidence of atypical femur fractures in one large population study was 55 per 100,000 person-years, compared with 1 per 100,000 person-years in bisphosphonate-naive patients, yet an estimated 162 osteoporosis-related fractures are prevented for every 1 AFF that may be associated with antiresorptive treatment. Reported risk modifiers include that Asians may be up to 8 times more at risk for AFF than whites and that concurrent use of glucocorticoids is associated with increased risk of AFF. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Images (DEXA) scanning has been shown to be effective in screening for lateral cortical thickening, and because one retrospective review noted a 40% of AFFs occur in the diaphysis, it is important that screening DEXA scans are extended to include the diaphysis.

### Adherence to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 2002 osteoporosis screening guidelines in academic primary care settings [^1179TuMq]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is very common in older women in the United States. Osteoporotic fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality, as well as high healthcare costs. Since 2002, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening for osteoporosis of all women aged ≥ 65. Our objective was to determine adherence to osteoporosis screening guidelines by primary care internists in a large academic medical center and to assess if adherence varies based on provider gender or practice location.

Methods

This was a retrospective electronic medical record (EMR) review. All women aged ≥ 65 who were seen in the General Internal Medicine Center (GIMC) or the Women's Health Care Center (WHCC) at the University of Washington Medical Center by internal medicine attending physicians between January 1, 2006, and February 2, 2008, were included in the study. We determined if the patient had a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) study in the EMR database. We calculated the percentage of patients screened per provider and also compared the rate of screening for male vs. female providers and for GIMC vs. WHCC providers.

Results

Of the 1363 women included in the study, 70% had documentation of a DEXA study. Adherence to screening recommendations for individual providers varied from 33% to 100%. Screening was more likely to occur in the WHCC than in the GIMC (79.2% vs. 66.7%, p < 0.001). Although women providers were more likely to screen than their male counterparts (72.2% vs. 66.1%, p = 0.023), this relationship did not hold true after excluding women providers from the WHCC.

Conclusions

We found good adherence to the USPSTF 2002 guidelines for osteoporosis screening in women aged ≥ 65 years by primary care physicians in a large urban academic medical center. The practice site and not gender of the provider resulted in significantly different screening rates.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^112SFqTs]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The introduction of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology in the 1980s revolutionized the diagnosis, management and monitoring of osteoporosis, providing a clinical tool which is now available worldwide. However, DXA measurements are influenced by many technical factors, including the quality control procedures for the instrument, positioning of the patient, and approach to analysis. Reporting of DXA results may be confounded by factors such as selection of reference ranges for T-scores and Z-scores, as well as inadequate knowledge of current standards for interpretation. These points are addressed at length in many international guidelines but are not always easily assimilated by practising clinicians and technicians. Our aim in this report is to identify key elements pertaining to the use of DXA in clinical practice, considering both technical and clinical aspects. Here, we discuss technical aspects of DXA procedures, approaches to interpretation and integration into clinical practice, and the use of non-bone mineral density measurements, such as a vertebral fracture assessment, in clinical risk assessment.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive… [^111uCT4K]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF indicates US Preventive Services Task Force. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that centrally measured DXA BMD can accurately predict osteoporotic fractures in women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools have sufficient accuracy to identify osteoporosis in women and predict certain osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, in women and men. Centrally measured DXA was the test used to determine eligibility for participants enrolled in nearly all trials of bone-conserving pharmacotherapies. 1 Thus, screening can entail DXA with or without fracture risk assessment. The USPSTF does not intend that these 10-year risk levels be used as mechanistic thresholds for determining who should receive further screening with DXA. Rather, it is suggested that the results of risk assessment be used to help inform decisions about further screening with DXA.

When deciding whether to screen for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men, clinicians should consider the following factors. This recommendation updates the 2018 USPSTF recommendation on screening for osteoporosis. In 2018, the USPSTF recommended screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older and in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. 45 For the current recommendation, the USPSTF has noted that screening can include DXA BMD, with or without fracture risk assessment. The current recommendation is otherwise generally consistent with the 2018 recommendation. Central DXA measures BMD at central bone sites and is the established standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

Additionally, centrally measured DXA was the test used for determining T scores and determining eligibility among participants enrolled in nearly all trials of bone-conserving pharmacotherapies. Still, given that screening trials enrolled participants based on fracture risk, and that the goal of treating osteoporosis is to prevent fracture, the USPSTF reviewed studies that reported on the accuracy of centrally measured BMD for predicting fracture. The USPSTF found no studies that included men. Two RCTs used a 2-step screening intervention consisting of a FRAX risk assessment on participants assigned to screening and then invited those with a high fracture risk score for DXA.

BMD interpretation

Absolute BMD values differ between the vendors due to inherent differences in how each technology works. However, for diagnostic classification, this value is converted into a T-score and/or Z-score value which is a patient's BMD represented in standard deviations in comparison to a reference population, with a precision of 1 decimal place. The ISCD guidance recommends that T-scores are preferred in postmenopausal women, perimenopausal women, and men over the age age 50 years, whereas Z-scores for younger individuals. On the other hand the International Osteoporosis Foundations (IOF) supports the use of T-scores in premenopausal women and men under the age of 50 years as well. As described in Part I, the standard skeletal sites for DXA measurement are the hip (total hip and femoral neck) with the femoral neck being designated by the IOF as the reference site for epidemiological studies, the L1-L4 region of the lumbar spine, and radius. However, in chronic arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, BMD should not be measured at the radius, because there is local, juxta-articular bone loss resulting in a lower BMD than in other parts of the skeleton. BMD in g/cm² is used primarily for input into fracture risk algorithms (e.g. FRAX) and to monitor the skeletal effects of osteoporosis. Incorporating ethnicity into FRAX (US, South Africa and Singapore versions) aims to help calibrate interventions appropriately, addressing racial disparities in fracture risk assessment and intervention thresholds. It is important to note that the significance of ethnicity varies by location; for instance, black individuals in the US exhibit lower fracture probabilities than Caucasians. However, their fracture risk remains higher than that of African black individuals, partly due to differing fracture rates and lower mortality risks in the US population. Despite the widespread acceptance of FRAX, it is advised that it be considered as an important reference platform rather than a definitive gold standard tool in fracture risk assessment. Applying the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, a T-score value less than or equal to -2.5 at the lumbar spine, one-third (33%) radius, femoral neck, or total hip is consistent with osteoporosis, while T-values ≥ -1.0 at these ROIs represent normal BMD. Diagnostic classification is based on the lowest T-score at any of the recommended DXA regions. Caution is advised when performing forearm measurements, as this is not the most relevant site for fracture risk assessment. A T-score between − 2.5 and − 1.0 is defined as "osteopenia", "low bone mass" or "low bone density" Table 1). In children and adolescents, premenopausal women, and men under the age of 50 years, the ISCD recommendation is to use Z-scores, although IOF has recommended use of T-scores in younger men and premenopausal women who are no longer growing. In these younger populations, a Z-score ≤ -2.0 is defined by ISCD as "bone mineral density below the expected range for age", with the suggestion that the terms osteopenia or osteoporosis should not be used to classify BMD measurements in these patients. In contrast, the IOF recommends that, in order to ensure consistency with the WHO operational definition of osteoporosis, a T-score ≤ -2.5 in premenopausal women and men younger than 50 years may be viewed as diagnostic of osteoporosis in the presence of skeletal fragility. Indeed the IOF and ESCEO positions solely recognise this WHO operational definition as the clinical diagnostic criterion for osteoporosis, maintaining a distinction between diagnostic and intervention thresholds, and avoiding conflation of risk factor with outcome. However, in recent years, some other societies (EANM, ASBMR and CSEM) have pragmatically proposed that a diagnosis of osteoporosis may be presumed in the presence of a prior low-trauma major osteoporotic fracture, even with a normal BMD (hip, spine, forearm, humerus, pelvis). This, however, does not exclude other sites, including fracture of the humerus, ribs, tibia (excluding the ankle) and other femoral fractures. It is also possible that the vertebral fracture sustained in the remote past may have been in association with a significant trauma. Historical information may be of value to clarify this.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1168w1fD]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening trials using FRAX-based 2-step strategies — intervention structure and pooled outcomes show that two RCTs (SCOOP and ROSE) used a FRAX risk assessment without BMD and then invited high-risk participants (≥ 15% risk for MOF in ROSE; at or above the age-based hip fracture risk threshold in SCOOP) for DXA; the mean or median 10-year FRAX-estimated MOF risk was 19% in SCOOP, 20% in ROSE, and 24.6% in SOS, with respective 10-year estimated hip fracture risks of 8.5%, 6.7%, and 11.6%. A pooled analysis found reduced hip fractures (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73–0.93; 3 RCTs; 42 009 participants]) and MOF (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88–0.99; 3 RCTs; 42 009 participants]), corresponding to an ARD of 5 fewer hip fractures (95% CI, 7 to 2 fewer) and 6 fewer MOF (95% CI, 12 to 1 fewer) per 1000 participants over 3 to 5 years.

### Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in clinical practice: new guidelines and concerns [^111YkDtu]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent policy and guideline updates that have significant consequences for the clinical use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis and, thus, the prevention of fractures and associated morbidity and mortality.

Recent Findings

Recent policy trends have sought to reverse reimbursement declines for DXA services, whereas updated guidelines have attempted to restrict the candidates for bone density testing. Recent literature reflects the ongoing controversy of repeat DXA testing.

Summary

Patient access to DXA scans has been threatened by declining reimbursement and, therefore, access to diagnosis and fracture prevention. There have been successful efforts to reverse this trend, but the future remains uncertain. The complexities and omissions of updated guidelines for obtaining DXA testing may serve again to restrict initial access, and the recent controversy of repeat DXA testing may make monitoring results of therapy more difficult.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112JUWAe]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Response to public comment — clarifications and scope: The USPSTF clarifies that the statement is not a recommendation against screening; it indicates that the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms and is a call for more research, and in the absence of evidence clinicians and their patients should decide together whether to be screened. The recommendation does not apply to individuals, including men, who have medical conditions or are taking medications associated with bone loss. The USPSTF clarified that screening can include dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with or without fracture risk assessment and that it suggests using a 2-step approach for postmenopausal persons younger than 65 years, with Table 2 providing examples of tools for identifying persons younger than 65 years who may benefit from screening. The USPSTF notes that the evidence related to screening intervals for osteoporosis is limited and specifies that more research is needed on screening in transgender persons.

Vertebral fracture assessment and lateral spine imaging — indications and thresholds: Vertebral fracture is the most common osteoporotic fracture and indicates a high risk for future fractures, and Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can often be done at the same time with DXA; lateral spine imaging with standard radiography or VFA with DXA is indicated when T-score is less than −1.0 and one or more of the following is present: women aged ≥ 70 years or men aged ≥ 80 years, historical height loss > 4 cm (> 1.5 in), self-reported but undocumented prior vertebral fracture, or glucocorticoid therapy equivalent to ≥ 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for ≥ 3 months. In patients with unexplained height loss or back pain, thoracic and lumbar spine radiography or VFA by DXA is indicated if prevalent vertebral fractures would alter clinical management; although these thresholds for height loss have > 90% specificity, the sensitivity and reliability of standard radiography are poor, and if fracture is diagnosed by VFA, then additional imaging should be done to confirm the impression of fracture.

Bone mineral density (BMD) monitoring — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Ideally, BMD monitoring should occur at the same facility using the same dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine, the same technologist if possible, and the same regions of interest for spine and hip; the 1/3 radius site is acceptable when spine and hip sites are not evaluable, whereas other peripheral sites should not be used for monitoring. AACE recommends a repeat DXA 1 to 2 years after initiation of therapy until bone density is stable, with longer intervals between testing when there is continued BMD stability, and significant change is likely to occur earlier at the spine than at the hip. Skeletal status can also be examined by assessing asymptomatic vertebral fractures with repeat X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine or VFA.

Background

Osteoporosis is a known, modifiable risk factor for lower extremity periprosthetic fractures. Unfortunately, a high percentage of patients at risk of osteoporosis who undergo THA or TKA do not receive routine screening and treatment for osteoporosis, but there is insufficient information determining the proportion of patients undergoing THA and TKA who should be screened and their implant-related complications.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What proportion of patients in a large database who underwent THA or TKA met the criteria for osteoporosis screening? (2) What proportion of these patients received a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) study before arthroplasty? (3) What was the 5-year cumulative incidence of fragility fracture or periprosthetic fracture after arthroplasty of those at high risk compared with those at low risk of osteoporosis?

Methods

Between January 2010 and October 2021, 710,097 and 1,353,218 patients who underwent THA and TKA, respectively, were captured in the Mariner dataset of the PearlDiver database. We used this dataset because it longitudinally tracks patients across a variety of insurance providers throughout the United States to provide generalizable data. Patients at least 50 years old with at least 2 years of follow-up were included, and patients with a diagnosis of malignancy and fracture-indicated total joint arthroplasty were excluded. Based on this initial criterion, 60% (425,005) of THAs and 66% (897,664) of TKAs were eligible. A further 11% (44,739) of THAs and 11% (102,463) of TKAs were excluded because of a prior diagnosis of or treatment for osteoporosis, leaving 54% (380,266) of THAs and 59% (795,201) of TKAs for analysis. Patients at high risk of osteoporosis were filtered using demographic and comorbidity information provided by the database and defined by national guidelines. The proportion of patients at high risk of osteoporosis who underwent osteoporosis screening via DEXA scan within 3 years was observed, and the 5-year cumulative incidence of periprosthetic fractures and fragility fracture was compared between the high-risk and low-risk cohorts.

Results

In total, 53% (201,450) and 55% (439,982) of patients who underwent THA and TKA, respectively, were considered at high risk of osteoporosis. Of these patients, 12% (24,898 of 201,450) and 13% (57,022 of 439,982) of patients who underwent THA and TKA, respectively, received a preoperative DEXA scan. Within 5 years, patients at high risk of osteoporosis undergoing THA and TKA had a higher cumulative incidence of fragility fractures (THA: HR 2.1 [95% CI 1.9 to 2.2]; TKA: HR 1.8 [95% CI 1.7 to 1.9]) and periprosthetic fractures (THA: HR 1.7 [95% CI 1.5 to 1.8]; TKA: HR 1.6 [95% CI 1.4 to 1.7]) than those at low risk (p < 0.001 for all).

Conclusion

We attribute the higher rates of fragility and periprosthetic fractures in those at high risk compared with those at low risk to an occult diagnosis of osteoporosis. Hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons can help reduce the incidence and burden of these osteoporosis-related complications by initiating screening and subsequently referring patients to bone health specialists for treatment. Future studies might investigate the proportion of osteoporosis in patients at high risk of having the condition, develop and evaluate practical bone health screening and treatment algorithms for hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons, and observe the cost-effectiveness of implementing these algorithms.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115YdXGM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up VFA or radiographic lateral spine imaging should be used in patients with continued high risk [e.g. historical height loss > 4 cm (> 1.5 inches)], self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or glucocorticoid therapy equivalent to ≥ 5 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for greater than or equal to three months).

When used to monitor the effects of treatment, the frequency of BMD measurements should be guided by a number of factors, including the therapy used, availability of resources, national guidelines and reimbursement policies, and the clinical site being measured. Changes are generally greater at the lumbar spine than total hip and greater for osteoanabolic therapy than antiresorptive therapy. These data suggest the most likely result will be 'no change' for non-anabolic treatments if a DXA scan is repeated within 2–3 years from the beginning of anti-resorptive therapy. In addition, an incident fragility fracture while on treatment is generally regarded as an indication for bone densitometry. Based on the ISCD minimum acceptable LSC of 5% for the total hip and 5.3% for the lumbar spine, significant changes in BMD are unlikely to be seen before 3 years in individuals treated with most anti-resorptive drugs but may be evident in the LS after one year with anabolic therapies.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1135nCF5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

By 2020, approximately 12.3 million individuals in the United States older than 50 years are expected to have osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fractures, particularly hip fractures, are associated with limitations in ambulation, chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, and decreased quality of life, and 21% to 30% of patients who experience a hip fracture die within 1 year. The prevalence of primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis without underlying disease) increases with age and differs by race/ethnicity. With the aging of the US population, the potential preventable burden is likely to increase in future years.

Objective

To update the 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for osteoporosis.

Evidence Review

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for and treatment of osteoporotic fractures in men and women, as well as risk assessment tools, screening intervals, and efficacy of screening and treatment in subgroups. The screening population was postmenopausal women and older men with no known previous osteoporotic fractures and no known comorbid conditions or medication use associated with secondary osteoporosis.

Findings

The USPSTF found convincing evidence that bone measurement tests are accurate for detecting osteoporosis and predicting osteoporotic fractures in women and men. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that clinical risk assessment tools are moderately accurate in identifying risk of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that drug therapies reduce subsequent fracture rates in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found that the evidence is inadequate to assess the effectiveness of drug therapies in reducing subsequent fracture rates in men without previous fractures.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years and older. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis with bone measurement testing to prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk of osteoporosis, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men.

Use of risk assessment to guide central dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years — Approaches to identify those at increased risk could reasonably focus on assessing fracture risk or risk of osteoporosis using one of several risk assessment tools. The USPSTF does not intend that example 10-year risk levels be used as mechanistic thresholds for determining who should receive further DXA; rather, it is suggested that results of risk assessment be used to help inform decisions about further screening with DXA.

Figure 1.
This algorithm outlines the proposed preoperative bone health optimization initiative, including criteria for DXA testing and how to apply results in surgical planning.

Current initiatives to assess bone health before elective surgery are based on opinion, rather than evidence. The 2019 ISCD positions note that research is needed to identify how to identify orthopedic patients who need BMD testing. Thus, the population which would benefit from preoperative BMD remains unclear. At our tertiary referral center, a screening protocol to determine which orthopedic surgical patients should undergo bone mineral density testing has been developed. The protocol is based on ISCD and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for BMD testing then applied to the preoperative assessment of orthopedic surgical patients. This study's objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of our simple screening protocol to identify orthopedic surgical patients at high risk of osteoporosis for preoperative DXA.

Repeat BMD and VFA measurements, clinical indications

Repeat BMD testing in combination with clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers, if available, and other factors, including height loss and trabecular bone score, can be used to determine whether treatment should be initiated in untreated individuals. The BMD repeat testing interval depends on the overall clinical need as well as the baseline value. For example, a patient who is taking high dose glucocorticoids may lose bone much more rapidly, particularly in the setting of cancer and active rheumatoid arthritis. Those with low BMD and rapid loss are among those at greatest risk of fracture. On the other hand, less frequent assessment may be appropriate in older individulas. A US study of almost 5,000 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 67 years demonstrated that the average time to transition to a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) was 17 years for those with a T-score > -1.5, 5 years for women with T-score between − 1.50 and − 1.99, and 1 year for women with a T-score between − 2.0 and − 2.49) for 10% of the total population considered. These data provided some guidance on appropriate intervals for BMD testing in untreated individuals.

"Own the Bone" guidelines encourage physicians to prescribe bisphosphonates and order DEXA bone scans for all patients after first time fragility fractures. Yet, these data show that certain factors including age, sex, and comorbidities including tobacco use and obesity markedly influence how physicians devise their patient's treatment plan. Notably, these data found that women are 2 times likely to have DEXA bone scans ordered and about 2.5 times more likely to be prescribed bisphosphonates when compared with men. This puts men at a disadvantage in receiving proper screening and treatment for osteoporosis, putting them at added risk for future fragility fractures. In addition, these data revealed that older patients are less likely to obtain DEXA scans and diphosphonate prescriptions after first-time fragility fractures. This suggests that the older patient demographic that the AOA set out to serve with the "Own the Bone" program are at greater risk of not receiving proper osteoporosis screening.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111ept1K]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF osteoporosis screening — research needs and gaps emphasize that more research is needed on the benefits and harms of screening and of different screening strategies. Evidence gaps include studies in men; evaluation of screening approaches using bone mineral density (BMD) alone, fracture risk assessment tools alone, and their combination in postmenopausal women; and development and validation of primary care–feasible risk assessment tools to predict hip and nonhip major osteoporotic fractures and to identify osteoporosis in women and men. Research should include populations broadly representative of the US population with sufficient numbers of postmenopausal women younger than 65 years and men to allow reporting on accuracy in these groups. Additional analyses are needed to inform optimal start and stop ages and screening interval in women, and research is needed on the benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy to prevent fractures in men with primary osteoporosis without a history of fragility fractures.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115uHHNz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Bone health in prostate cancer — risk assessment and screening: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) increases the risk of bone loss, with risk exacerbated by more potent androgen suppression, longer duration of therapy or delayed testosterone recovery, and concurrent prednisone use. Fracture risk can be assessed using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), and when utilizing the FRAX algorithm select YES for secondary osteoporosis for individuals with hypogonadism; ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis". A previous major osteoporotic fracture is considered clinical osteoporosis and warrants bone antiresorptive drug therapy independent of bone mineral density. A baseline dual-energy x‑ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan should be obtained before starting ADT in patients at increased risk for fracture based on FRAX screening and being considered for antiresorptive therapy, whereas for low‑risk patients the baseline DEXA scan can be omitted. Because exact FRAX thresholds are not defined, one approach sets the threshold at 10‑year risk of a major osteoporotic fracture equal to that of a 65‑year old white women, defined as 8.4% in the United States.

Prostate cancer — bone health during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — ADT was associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk, and bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy; in a population-based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration had a lower fracture risk than medical castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94; p = 0.01). A baseline bone mineral density study should be considered for the patients on ADT; the National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include calcium (1000–1200 mg daily) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily), and additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) at specified sites and a 10-year probability of hip fracture greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%; fracture risk can be assessed using FRAX®, and ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis" using the FRAX® algorithm. Evidence includes a phase 3 study that randomized 1468 patients in which, at 24 months, denosumab increased bone mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared to placebo. When drug therapy is warranted by absolute fracture risk, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is recommended; a baseline DEXA before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA after one year is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry; use of biochemical markers of bone turnover is not recommended, and there are no existing guidelines on the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be measured when DEXA scans are obtained.

### Perioperative bone mineral density assessment in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^1147sqsj]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Despite American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines that recommend bone mineral density (BMD) assessment via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) for PHPT patients, adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of preoperative and postoperative DEXA scan practices among PHPT patients at a single academic medical center between 2000 and 2018. Patient data, including demographics and history of bone pathology, was analyzed to identify factors influencing adherence to BMD assessment guidelines.

Results

Of the 3384 PHPT patients evaluated for surgery, only 45.4% (n = 1535) underwent preoperative DEXA scan. Women were significantly more likely to undergo preoperative DEXA than men (49.9% versus 29.0%, P < 0.001). Female sex, age ≥ 65 y, and a history of bone pain or fractures were significant positive predictors of preoperative DEXA scan. Of patients with 2-y follow-up who did not receive a preoperative DEXA (n = 145), only 13.8% (n = 20) received a postoperative DEXA.

Conclusions

This study highlights gaps in the adherence to national guidelines for DEXA screening among PHPT patients. This underscreening may contribute to increased morbidity due to unidentified osteoporosis. Efforts must be made to improve clinical practice and bring it into line with best practice as recommended by national guidelines.

Bone health in prostate cancer — foundational measures and pharmacologic treatment thresholds: Treatment for osteoporosis is advised according to guidelines for the general population from the Bone and Osteoporosis Foundation, which include 1) calcium 1000–1200 mg daily from food with supplements if intake is insufficient and 2) vitamin D3 with serum levels of 30–50 ng/mL with supplements prescribed if needed. These guidelines also include pharmacologic treatment for patients aged ≥ 50 years with low bone mass (T‑score between -1.0 and -2.5) at the femoral neck or total hip by DEXA with a 10‑year probability of hip fracture ≥ 3% or a 10‑year probability of a major osteoporosis‑related fracture ≥ 20% based on FRAX screening.
