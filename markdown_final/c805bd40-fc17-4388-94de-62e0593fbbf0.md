## Question

Treatment and diagnosis of atrial tachycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnosis and treatment of atrial tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining atrial tachycardia and its subtypes. Then, I should verify the initial diagnostic approach, including ECG features and how to distinguish focal from macroreentrant forms. Next, I will review acute management by hemodynamic stability, including vagal maneuvers, adenosine, rate-control agents, and cardioversion. After that, I need to check ongoing management options, including rate control, rhythm control with antiarrhythmics, and catheter ablation. Finally, I should consider special populations, evidence gaps, and a concise decision algorithm, making sure each step aligns with guideline-backed recommendations and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't anchor prematurely on a single mechanism. Atrial tachycardia is a regular atrial rhythm greater than 100 bpm with discrete P waves and atrial activation originating outside the sinus node; mechanisms include automaticity, triggered activity, or microreentry, with focal AT arising from a single site and macroreentrant forms (including cavotricuspid isthmus–dependent flutter and non–CTI-dependent flutters) involving larger circuits, whereas multifocal AT is irregular with at least three distinct P-wave morphologies and variable rates [^113vxAhR] [^112y8zAT] [^112EnCEe].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and clinical significance before moving to diagnostics. Focal AT accounts for roughly 3% to 17% of SVTs referred for ablation, and incessant SVT can lead to tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy in up to 10% of ablation referrals; focal AT is more often right atrial than left atrial in origin, and sinus node reentrant tachycardia is a specific microreentrant focal AT with abrupt onset/termination and P waves similar to sinus rhythm [^113qNdGq] [^116ULct4] [^1135RKYn].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic approach, starting with rhythm documentation. A 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is essential to identify discrete P waves, measure atrial rate, and analyze P-wave morphology for localization. Positive P waves in I, II, and aVF suggest a cranial origin, and shorter P-wave duration suggests a paraseptal site, while an isoelectric baseline between P waves supports focal AT rather than flutter, and if the diagnosis is uncertain, ESC recommends obtaining a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia whenever feasible [^113qNdGq] [^1158nKcM].

> Hold on, I should verify how to distinguish focal from macroreentrant forms on ECG. Macroreentrant atrial flutter typically shows constant flutter-wave morphology with atrial rates often above 250 bpm and no isoelectric interval, whereas focal AT has discrete P waves with intervening isoelectric segments and rates usually 100 to 250 bpm; typical CTI-dependent flutter often presents with 2:1 AV conduction around 150 bpm, and non–CTI-dependent flutters may follow atrial scarring or prior ablation with variable surface ECG patterns [^112y8zAT] [^111NSxia] [^111RXuvn].

> Let me consider adjunctive diagnostic tools when the ECG is non-diagnostic. Ambulatory monitoring (Holter or event recorder) helps correlate symptoms with arrhythmia and quantify burden, echocardiography is indicated if structural heart disease is suspected, and an electrophysiology study with mapping is both diagnostic and potentially curative when the mechanism remains unclear or ablation is planned. ESC also emphasizes obtaining a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia whenever possible to refine diagnosis and guide therapy [^112JSatt] [^114WF76M] [^1158nKcM].

> Next, I should review acute management with a stability-first mindset. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, immediate synchronized cardioversion is Class I. If stable, I need to check for vagal maneuvers, adenosine, and rate-control agents, while remembering that synchronized cardioversion is not appropriate for rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, which could perpetuate instability if misapplied [^114kygUT] [^115yDZr6].

> I need to ensure I sequence acute pharmacologic therapy correctly. For stable suspected focal AT, intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are Class I options for rate control or termination depending on mechanism; adenosine is Class IIa and can be both therapeutic and diagnostic, often effective for triggered focal AT but less reliable for automatic or microreentrant forms; if first-line agents fail or are contraindicated, IV amiodarone or ibutilide are Class IIb options for rhythm conversion or rate slowing, with ibutilide showing modest termination rates in focal AT [^113qauDu] [^117DZtt9] [^113i1feu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought adenosine might be broadly effective for focal AT, but I should double-check mechanism-specific responses. Adenosine is more likely to terminate triggered focal AT and may unmask atrial activity to aid diagnosis, yet it is less effective for automatic or microreentrant focal AT; thus, if adenosine fails, I should not assume a ventricular tachycardia by default and should proceed with guideline-directed rate control or consider synchronized cardioversion if the patient deteriorates or if drug therapy fails in a stable patient [^117DZtt9] [^115yDZr6].

> Let me verify ongoing management options and align them with patient preferences and comorbidities. Rate-control strategies with beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable for symptom control, while rhythm-control options include flecainide or propafenone in patients without structural or ischemic heart disease, and amiodarone or sotalol when structural heart disease is present or other agents are contraindicated; ESC also suggests considering ivabradine combined with a beta blocker if monotherapy fails, though evidence is limited and patient selection matters [^116Cm1Vh] [^113vndDN] [^112sb6qW].

> I should confirm the role of catheter ablation because recurrence and incessant tachycardia can drive cardiomyopathy. Catheter ablation is a Class I alternative to pharmacologic therapy for symptomatic focal AT, with high success rates and low complication rates in experienced centers; ablation is particularly attractive for drug-refractory cases, intolerable adverse effects, or patient preference for definitive therapy, and EP study with mapping localizes the focus for targeted ablation [^111Yd6id] [^112KfHVK] [^114WF76M].

> But wait, what if the AT is actually a macroreentrant flutter or a post–AF ablation tachycardia. Non–CTI-dependent flutters and post-AF ATs often require more extensive mapping and may involve multiple circuits; specialized techniques such as epicardial or chemical ablation are sometimes needed, and success rates are generally lower than for typical CTI flutter, reinforcing the need for expert centers and tailored strategies [^1135G9US] [^111RXuvn].

> I need to check special populations and contexts so I don't overgeneralize. In older adults, management should be individualized, balancing invasive ablation against long-term pharmacologic commitments and frailty. In patients with adult congenital heart disease or complex substrates, ablation may be technically challenging yet still appropriate in expert hands. And after AF ablation, new or unmasked ATs are common, warranting careful mapping and, when indicated, concomitant ablation of additional clinically significant SVTs or flutters to reduce recurrence [^11633QLL] [^114btwzM] [^113vhWXs].

> Hold on, I should verify evidence gaps and research priorities to set expectations. Antiarrhythmic options for SVTs are limited and often extrapolated from AF, with variable efficacy across mechanisms. Shared decision-making is repeatedly emphasized given nuanced trade-offs, and future work should address mechanism-targeted pharmacologics, improved mapping, and quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness outcomes alongside procedural safety [^115T9igq] [^1124u1iY].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Start with ECG during tachycardia to distinguish focal from macroreentrant forms; if unstable, proceed to synchronized cardioversion; if stable, use vagal maneuvers and adenosine for diagnosis and possible termination, then IV beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil for rate control or rhythm termination; if refractory, consider IV amiodarone or ibutilide; for ongoing care, tailor rate versus rhythm control to symptoms and comorbidities, and offer catheter ablation as a Class I alternative for symptomatic focal AT, integrating patient preferences through shared decision-making [^114kygUT] [^113qauDu] [^111Yd6id] [^1124u1iY].

Atrial tachycardia (AT) is a regular atrial rhythm > 100 bpm with discrete P waves and an isoelectric baseline [^112y8zAT], distinct from atrial fibrillation/flutter [^112y8zAT]. Diagnosis relies on **12-lead ECG** during tachycardia [^1158nKcM] to identify P waves and exclude AF/AFL; if needed, use ambulatory monitoring or an electrophysiology study [^112hLYBw] [^114WF76M]. Acute management prioritizes **hemodynamic stability**: unstable patients need immediate synchronized cardioversion [^115yDZr6]; stable patients receive IV beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil for rate control, with adenosine or ibutilide for rhythm conversion if needed [^113qauDu] [^112QGQC9]. Long-term therapy includes oral beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil [^1173EaiJ]; flecainide or propafenone if no structural heart disease [^113vndDN]; and amiodarone or sotalol if structural heart disease is present [^116Cm1Vh]. Catheter ablation is **highly effective** (85–95%) [^112KfHVK] and is first-line for symptomatic or drug-refractory AT [^111Yd6id] [^1115D9Xp].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **Symptoms**: Palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, chest discomfort, dizziness, syncope, and occasionally tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy [^116VGhWU] [^1154Ee5z].

- **Initial evaluation**: 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is essential [^1158nKcM]; if not available, use ambulatory ECG or event monitors [^116EnEdC].

- **ECG features**: Regular rhythm > 100 bpm, discrete P waves, isoelectric baseline, and P waves distinct from sinus P waves [^113qNdGq].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude AF, AFL, AVNRT, AVRT, and MAT by analyzing P waves, atrial rate, and AV conduction [^112oYoDT].

- **Electrophysiology study**: Indicated for unclear diagnosis, drug-refractory cases, or before ablation [^114WF76M].

---

## Acute management

### Hemodynamically unstable patients

In hemodynamically unstable patients, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is recommended [^115yDZr6] [^1171T1qz].

---

### Hemodynamically stable patients

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| IV beta-blockers | First-line rate control | Metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV q5min (max 15 mg) | Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia |
| IV diltiazem | First-line rate control | 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus; repeat 0.35 mg/kg if needed | Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia |
| IV verapamil | First-line rate control | 2.5–5 mg IV over 2 min; repeat every 15–30 min (max 20 mg) | Monitor for hypotension, bradycardia |
| Adenosine | Diagnostic/therapeutic | 6 mg IV rapid push; repeat 12 mg if needed | Effective for triggered AT; less for automatic/reentrant |
| Ibutilide | Rhythm conversion | 1 mg IV over 10 min; repeat once if needed | Monitor for QT prolongation, torsades |
| Synchronized cardioversion | Drug-refractory or unstable | 50–100 J biphasic | Sedation/anesthesia required |

---

## Chronic management

### Pharmacological therapy

- **First-line**: Oral beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil for rate control [^1173EaiJ].

- **Second-line**: Flecainide or propafenone if no structural heart disease [^113vndDN].

- **Third-line**: Amiodarone or sotalol for structural heart disease or refractory cases [^116Cm1Vh].

- **Combination therapy**: Consider ivabradine plus beta-blocker if monotherapy fails [^112sb6qW].

---

### Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is **highly effective** (85–95%) [^112KfHVK] and is first-line for symptomatic or drug-refractory AT [^111Yd6id]. Success rates are 85–95% with low recurrence, and complications are uncommon but include vascular injury, cardiac tamponade, and phrenic nerve injury [^1173aYpf].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include regular visits to assess symptoms, **arrhythmia burden**, and drug adverse effects. ECG or **ambulatory monitoring** is used to detect recurrence and evaluate drug efficacy. Patient education should cover symptom recognition, **when to seek care**, and trigger avoidance.

---

## Special considerations

- **Post-AF ablation AT**: Common; requires specialized mapping and ablation techniques [^1135G9US] [^116eCeRS].

- **Congenital heart disease**: Requires individualized management and expert centers [^114btwzM].

- **Elderly patients**: Individualize therapy balancing risks and benefits [^11633QLL].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

- **Acute management**: Stability-first approach with synchronized cardioversion for unstable patients; IV beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil for stable patients; adenosine or ibutilide for rhythm conversion if needed [^113qauDu].

- **Chronic management**: Oral rate-control agents; flecainide or propafenone if no structural heart disease; amiodarone or sotalol for structural heart disease; catheter ablation for symptomatic or drug-refractory cases [^116Cm1Vh] [^111Yd6id].

- **Follow-up**: Regular monitoring, patient education, and individualized care plans [^1124u1iY].

---

Atrial tachycardia is a regular atrial arrhythmia diagnosed by ECG and managed acutely with rate control or cardioversion; chronic therapy includes antiarrhythmic drugs or catheter ablation, with **ablation offering high success and low recurrence**.

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT) — definition and characteristics: Focal AT can be sustained or nonsustained, and the atrial rate is usually between 100 bpm and 250 bpm; in adults it is usually benign, although AT-mediated cardiomyopathy has been reported in up to 10% of patients referred for ablation of incessant SVT, and nonsustained focal AT is common and often does not require treatment; the origin can be estimated from P‑wave morphology on a standard 12‑lead ECG and is ultimately confirmed by mapping during EP studies when successful ablation is achieved; focal AT originates more frequently from the right atrium than from the left atrium; sinus node reentrant tachycardia is an uncommon type of focal AT with a microreentrant circuit in the region of the sinoatrial node that produces a P‑wave morphology identical to sinus tachycardia, and distinguishing features include an abrupt onset and termination and often a longer RP interval than during normal sinus rhythm.

### Catheter ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation [^112KfHVK]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Supraventricular arrhythmias are relatively common, often persistent, and rarely life-threatening cardiac rhythm disturbances that arise from the sinus node, atrial tissue, or junctional sites between the atria and ventricles. The term "supraventricular arrhythmia" most often is used to refer to supraventricular tachycardias and atrial flutter. The term "supraventricular tachycardia" commonly refers to atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, an entity that includes Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Atrial fibrillation is a distinct entity classified separately. Depending on the arrhythmia, catheter ablation is a treatment option at initial diagnosis, when symptoms develop, or if medical therapy fails. Catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardias, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation offers patients high effectiveness rates, durable (and often permanent) therapeutic end points, and low complication rates. Catheter ablation effectiveness rates exceed 88 percent for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial flutter; are greater than 86 percent for atrial tachycardia; and range from 60 to 80 percent for atrial fibrillation. Complication rates for supraventricular tachycardias and atrial flutter ablation are 0 to 8 percent. The complication rates for atrial fibrillation ablation range from 6 to 10 percent. Complications associated with catheter ablation result from radiation exposure, vascular access (e.g., hematomas, cardiac perforation with tamponade), catheter manipulation (e.g., cardiac perforation with tamponade, thromboembolic events), or ablation energy delivery (e.g., atrioventricular nodal block).

Palpitations and paroxysmal SVTs — Heart rhythm specialists are frequently involved in the diagnosis of unspecified palpitations including suspected paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and trainees should understand the differential diagnosis of palpitations including sustained versus nonsustained arrhythmias, atrial arrhythmias versus ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), and arrhythmic versus nonarrhythmic etiologies. Trainees should develop approaches for evaluating patients and appropriately select diagnostic modalities such as electrocardiogram (ECG), ambulatory monitors, exercise stress testing, and electrophysiology (EP) testing, and trainees should understand indications for treatment across observation, lifestyle modification, medications, and catheter ablation.

### Atrial fibrillation therapy now and in the future: drugs, biologicals, and ablation [^1167eAuj]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex disease with multiple inter-relating causes culminating in rapid, seemingly disorganized atrial activation. Therapy targeting AF is rapidly changing and improving. The purpose of this review is to summarize current state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for treatment of AF. The review focuses on reviewing treatment as it relates to the pathophysiological basis of disease and reviews preclinical and clinical evidence for potential new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, including imaging, biomarkers, pharmacological therapy, and ablative strategies for AF. Current ablation and drug therapy approaches to treating AF are largely based on treating the arrhythmia once the substrate occurs and is more effective in paroxysmal AF rather than persistent or permanent AF. However, there is much research aimed at prevention strategies, targeting AF substrate, so-called upstream therapy. Improved diagnostics, using imaging, genetics, and biomarkers, are needed to better identify subtypes of AF based on underlying substrate/mechanism to allow more directed therapeutic approaches. In addition, novel antiarrhythmics with more atrial specific effects may reduce limiting proarrhythmic side effects. Advances in ablation therapy are aimed at improving technology to reduce procedure time and in mechanism-targeted approaches.

Related arrhythmias — atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia — are described in the context of atrial fibrillation (AF), as AF may occur in isolation or in association with other arrhythmias, most commonly atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter may arise during treatment with antiarrhythmic agents prescribed to prevent recurrent AF. Atrial flutter in the typical form is characterized by a saw-tooth pattern of regular atrial activation called flutter (f) waves on the ECG, particularly visible in leads II, III, aVF, and V1, and in the untreated state, the atrial rate in atrial flutter typically ranges from 240 to 320 beats per minute. Atrial flutter commonly occurs with 2:1 AV block, resulting in a regular or irregular ventricular rate of 120 to 160 beats per minute (most characteristically about 150 beats per minute), and atrial flutter may degenerate into AF and AF may convert to atrial flutter, with the ECG pattern fluctuating between atrial flutter and AF. Atrial flutter is usually readily distinguished from AF, but when atrial activity is prominent on the ECG in more than 1 lead, AF may be misdiagnosed as atrial flutter, and focal atrial tachycardias, AV reentrant tachycardias, and AV nodal reentrant tachycardias may also trigger AF.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia — sinus node modification outcomes and use: Radiofrequency ablation to modify the sinus node can reduce the sinus rate, with acute procedural success reported as 76% to 100% in nonrandomized cohorts, but symptoms commonly recur after several months, with IST recurrence in up to 27% and overall symptomatic recurrence (IST or non-IST atrial tachycardia) in 45% of patients; complications can be significant, and sinus node modification should be considered only for patients who are highly symptomatic and cannot be adequately treated by medication, and then only after informing the patient that the risks may outweigh the benefits of ablation.

Atrial flutter — catheter ablation indications (ACC/AHA/HRS 2015 SVT guideline) — Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF. Catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options.

AF catheter ablation — indications and first-line use in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL): In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF (Class 1, Level A). In patients with symptomatic or clinically significant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future atrial arrhythmias (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who are being managed with a rhythm-control strategy, catheter ablation as first-line therapy can be useful to improve symptoms (Class 2a, Level B-R).

### Practice implications of the atrial fibrillation guidelines [^113hdVtZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common and complex cardiac arrhythmias. Using currently available evidence, leading medical societies have established recommendations for the optimal management of atrial fibrillation. These guidelines have recently been updated by 4 consensus groups: the European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Chest Physicians, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and a task force of 3 societies from the United States: the American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society. The present review focused on the similarities and differences among these recently updated guidelines. Key revisions included updated information on newer treatments for rhythm control, treatment options to reduce atrial fibrillation complications, and updated anticoagulant management for thromboprophylaxis.

Acute treatment of suspected focal atrial tachycardia — algorithm: The flow begins with "Suspected focal atrial tachycardia" and evaluates "Hemodynamically stable"; "No" leads to "Cardioversion* (Class I)". If stable, it asks "Diagnosis of focal atrial tachycardia established"; if "Yes", treat with "IV beta blocker, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class I)" and then "IV amiodarone or IV ibutilide (Class IIb)". If the diagnosis is not established, use "IV adenosine (Class IIa)" and, if "If ineffective or not feasible", perform "Cardioversion* (Class I)". The figure cautions "For rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion is not appropriate. IV indicates intravenous".

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Synopsis and epidemiology of AFL and post-ablation AF risk: AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall incidence of 88 per 100 000 person-years, and the incidence increases with age; it is 2.5 times more common in men than in women and is more likely with underlying heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because of the high effectiveness of CTI ablation, many physicians may elect to discontinue oral anticoagulation > 1 month after ablation in the absence of previously detected AF, but subsequent AF after CTI-dependent AFL ablation has been reported as 34% over 14 months. Non–CTI-dependent or "atypical" AFL or atrial tachycardia after AF ablation should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF, and this section refers to treatment of "typical" (CTI-dependent) AFL.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — definition and electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics — is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial activation with consequent deterioration of atrial mechanical function. On the ECG, AF is characterized by the replacement of consistent P waves by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that vary in amplitude, shape, and timing, associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response when atrioventricular (AV) conduction is intact, and regular cardiac cycles (R-R intervals) are possible in the presence of AV block or ventricular or AV junctional tachycardia. The ventricular response to AF depends on electrophysiologically (EP) properties of the AV node and other conducting tissues, the level of vagal and sympathetic tone, the presence or absence of accessory conduction pathways, and the action of drugs, and in patients with implanted pacemakers, diagnosis of AF may require temporary inhibition of the pacemaker to expose atrial fibrillatory activity. A rapid, irregular, sustained, wide-QRS-complex tachycardia strongly suggests AF with conduction over an accessory pathway or AF with underlying bundle-branch block, and extremely rapid rates (over 200 beats per minute) suggest the presence of an accessory pathway or ventricular tachycardia.

Evidence gaps and future research needs — "SVTs, even with the exclusion of AF, are among the most common arrhythmias that require medical intervention". Since 2003, "catheter ablation is even better established, with a high degree of success and low complication rate, especially for the most common types of SVT, such as AVNRT and AVRT", while "drug options, on the other hand, are relatively unchanged". Notably, "vagal maneuvers are recommended in many circumstances as first-line intervention in patients with SVT, but they are often ineffective", there is "great variation in the way these maneuvers are administered", and "research on the best technique of vagal maneuvers, with dissemination of the findings, is necessary".

Non–isthmus-dependent atrial flutters — definition, diagnostics, and post–atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation occurrence are described as follows: These arrhythmias are "macroreentrant ATs that are not dependent on conduction through the CTI", with circuits including "a path around the mitral annulus (perimitral flutter), re-entry involving the left atrial roof, and re-entry around regions of scarring in the right or left atrium", and they "often occur in patients with atrial scarring from prior heart surgery or ablation but also may occur in any form of heart disease or may be idiopathic". After prior AF ablation, "the ECG appearance is less useful in predicting the flutter circuit", though "the presence of a positive or biphasic (but dominantly positive) deflection in V1, accompanied by deflections in other leads inconsistent with typical counterclockwise atrial flutter, suggests the presence of an atypical flutter". "Definitive diagnosis requires EP study and intracardiac mapping". Treatment is more complex because "Catheter ablation of non–CTI-dependent flutter requires more extensive mapping than does ablation of CTI-dependent flutter, and success rates are lower", and after AF ablation, "The development of a microreentrant or macroreentrant left AT after AF ablation occurs in approximately 5% of patients".

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) management — research and surveillance priorities emphasize that antiarrhythmic drug options are limited and evidence is often extrapolated from atrial fibrillation (AF), that efficacy differs by tachycardia mechanism including potential differences for class III agents between AF and atrial flutter, and that limited data exist for less common SVTs such as junctional tachycardia and multifocal atrial tachycardia (AT). The document states that "we must consider the role of electronic medical records, registries, and national datasets" when trials are not feasible, outlines collaborative multicenter registries with national societies, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration to capture safety and long-term outcomes, and notes that "Mandatory postmarket surveillance data collection on new drugs for SVT could also be considered by the US Food and Drug Administration as a condition for drug approval". It highlights unresolved mechanisms in inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) and an increasing number of SVT patients in specific groups such as after ablation (especially AF), adult congenital heart disease (ACHD), and advanced age, creating opportunities for clinical research. Priorities include new pharmacological therapies when ablation is not an option or has failed, investigation of atrial channel–selective drugs under AF study for AT, further study of mapping and ablation to maximize success with minimal risk, assessment of new personal monitoring and implantable devices and the impact of shared decision making on outcomes, and investigation of quality-of-life improvement strategies alongside cost-effectiveness studies.

Recommendations for acute treatment of SVT of unknown mechanism — adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with regular SVT (COR I; LOE B-R). In randomized trials adenosine effectively terminated atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia or atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia with success rates ranging from 78% to 96%; it should be administered via proximal IV as a rapid bolus infusion followed by a saline flush. Adenosine may also be useful diagnostically to unmask atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, though termination of these atrial arrhythmias is uncommon, and continuous ECG recording during administration may help distinguish drug failure from successful termination with immediate arrhythmia reinstitution.

### Catheter ablation of atrial tachycardia following atrial fibrillation ablation [^115cSmRf]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial tachycardias represent the second front of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. They are frequently encountered during the index ablation for patients with persistent AF and are common following ablation of persistent AF, occurring in half of all patients who have had AF successfully terminated. An atrial tachycardia is rightly seen as a failure of AF ablation, as these tachycardias are poorly tolerated by patients. This article describes a simple, practical approach to diagnosis and ablation of these atrial tachycardias.

### Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation-related cardiomyopathies: potential mechanisms and current therapies [^1177mnDX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of new-onset ventricular contractile dysfunction, termed arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC). Although cardioembolic stroke remains the most feared and widely studied complication of AF, AIC is also a clinically important consequence of AF that portends significant morbidity and mortality to patients with AF. Current treatments are aimed at restoring sinus rhythm through catheter ablation and rate and rhythm control, but these treatments do not target the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC. Here, we describe the clinical features of the various AIC subtypes, discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving the progression from AF to AIC, and review the evidence surrounding current treatment options. In this review, we aim to identify key knowledge gaps that will enable the development of more effective AIC therapies that target cellular and molecular mechanisms.

### Review of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias [^113HPR2h]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines present a synopsis of extensive internal evidence and technology reviews, with a particular focus on clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness within the NHS in England. This approach has delivered a novel perspective on arrhythmia management, with important distinctions from other policymakers' recommendations. For example, when compared with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society (HRS)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines on atrial fibrillation (AF), NICE advocates unique strategies regarding arrhythmia detection, stroke and bleeding risk stratification, and rhythm control (NICE CG 196). Likewise, for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death, NICE TA314 not only recommends device therapy based on New York Heart Association class and ECG findings, but also incorporates quality-adjusted life year data from analysis of key randomised controlled trials. This review examines the NICE guidelines, together with those from the AHA/HRS/ACC and ESC, on the management of AF and ventricular arrhythmias and highlights the key common features and discrepancies between these important documents.

Shared decision making in SVT — "It is important that the patient be included in clinical decision-making processes, with consideration of his/her preferences and goals for therapy, as well as his/her unique physical, psychological, and social situation". "In selected cases, personalized, self-directed interventions can be developed in partnership with the patient, such as vagal maneuvers and 'pill-in-the-pocket' drug therapy". "Shared decision making is especially important for patients with SVT", and "SVT treatment can be nuanced and requires expert knowledge of EP processes and treatment options". Options "are highly specific to the exact type of arrhythmia and can depend on certain characteristics of a particular arrhythmia (eg, whether there is pre-excitation)", so "a detailed explanation of the benefits and risks must be included in the conversation", with patients "encouraged to ask questions" and clinicians using "lay terminology" to provide "the best possible understanding of all management options in terms of risks, benefits, and potential effects on quality of life".

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113pHCEE]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) mechanisms and pathophysiology — rate characteristics, triggers, and substrate — are outlined as AF is a chaotic, rapid (300–500 bpm), and irregular atrial rhythm. AF results from electrophysiological and structural abnormalities that disrupt impulse generation or cellular connections, often arising from ectopic action potentials most commonly generated in the pulmonary veins (PVs) of the left atrium (LA) or from reentrant activity promoted by heterogeneous conduction due to interstitial fibrosis. Atrial ectopy can generate runs of tachycardia, while persistent AF requires a substrate that is either sufficiently large or sufficiently heterogeneous to sustain reentry, and the ECG abnormalities likely reflect a shared phenotype across diverse etiologies.

### Mapping and ablation of post-AF atrial tachycardias [^1135G9US]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial tachycardias are commonly encountered in patients undergoing catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Unlike typical atrial flutter that can be readily recognized and ablated, these post-AF tachycardias can arise from a wide variety of locations and involve a multiplicity of mechanisms. Apart from diagnostic challenges, radiofrequency ablation to eliminate the tachycardias may require multiple approaches. In addition, specialized techniques such as epicardial and chemical ablation may be required for definitive treatment. This review describes the various mechanisms and approaches to mapping and ablation of these challenging tachycardias.

Surgical ablation — electrophysiologists must be able to evaluate and manage patients who undergo surgical ablation for arrhythmias, which is currently most commonly performed for the treatment of AF, and options have broadened to include stand-alone surgical procedures as well as hybrid approaches in which catheter ablation and EP testing are performed in the same setting or at a later date; surgical ablation may also be utilized for the treatment of VT. The trainee must know the pathophysiological basis of arrhythmia surgery and must also know the indications, techniques, and potential complications, develop the skill to identify patients likely to benefit and to follow patients after surgery, understand both intraoperative and standalone options for management of the left atrial appendage, and must understand the potential for lesion gaps that place the patient at risk for atrial flutter, which may require subsequent catheter ablation.

Concomitant arrhythmia ablation during AF procedures — utility and limits: During ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation of previously documented or inducible sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or atrial flutter (AFL) is described as useful to reduce recurrent arrhythmias, but when AF alone or inducible SVT is targeted in patients with both AF and AFL the likelihood of recurrent arrhythmias is high. Prophylactic cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation without documented or inducible AFL likely has minimal benefit. A comparative study reported cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as first-line treatment for AFL is equally effective as standard CTI ablation for preventing recurrent atrial arrhythmia and better at preventing new-onset AF.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1154Ee5z]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy — definition and pathophysiology — is a reversible cause of heart failure (HF) characterized by left ventricle (LV) myocardial dysfunction caused by increased ventricular rate, first described in 1913. The degree of dysfunction correlates with the duration and rate of the tachyarrhythmia, and reversibility with treatment of the arrhythmia is the rule, although this may not be complete in all cases. Virtually any supraventricular tachycardia with a rapid ventricular response can induce cardiomyopathy, and ventricular arrhythmias including frequent premature ventricular complexes can also induce cardiomyopathy; experimental models show detrimental cardiac effects of chronic atrial and ventricular pacing in dogs and pigs.

Adult narrow QRS tachycardia — differential diagnosis algorithm: Begin with Narrow QRS tachycardia (QRS duration < 120 ms). If the rhythm is not regular, consider atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia/flutter with variable AV conduction, or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). If regular but P waves are not visible, consider AVNRT or other mechanism with P waves not identified. If P waves are visible and the atrial rate is greater than ventricular rate, the diagnoses are atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia. If P waves are visible and the atrial rate is not greater than ventricular rate, evaluate RP interval short (RP < PR); if No (RP > PR), consider atrial tachycardia, PJRT, or atypical AVNRT, and if RP interval is short then assess RP < 90 ms, which leads to AVRT, atypical AVNRT, or atrial tachycardia.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Sinus node reentrant tachycardia — an uncommon focal atrial tachycardia — is characterized by paroxysmal episodes with rates generally 100 bpm to 150 bpm, and confirmation of the reentrant mechanism requires an electrophysiology study with induction during programmed stimulation, demonstration of entrainment, and localization to the sinus node region; if the diagnosis is uncertain clinically, vagal maneuvers may be attempted to better identify the mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia.

Synopsis of AF catheter ablation — catheter ablation is now established as an effective option for rhythm control in patients with AF and AFL, but additional ablation targets beyond isolation of PVI as a routine strategy have not reduced AF recurrence or burden in RCTs; achieving durable pulmonary vein isolation with ablation has been associated with less recurrent arrhythmias, whereas other endpoints such as termination of AF or noninducibility have not been associated with improved outcomes; significant complications include stroke and TIAs, pericardial effusion, and vascular complications, and the most serious complication after the ablation procedure is development of an esophageal atrial fistula, although PV stenosis can occur.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial premature beats (APBs) and non‑sustained atrial tachycardia (NSAT) — clinical significance and treatment: APBs and NSAT are common in older individuals, with frequent APBs considered markers of atrial electrical vulnerability and predictors of incident AF, and atrial ectopic beats are markers of increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular death in older individuals. There is no consensus whether suppressing APBs/NSAT reduces AF or cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but efficacy of sotalol, flecainide, and propafenone for sustained atrial tachycardia can be extrapolated to frequent APBs and NSAT. In left ventricular systolic dysfunction, amiodarone and beta‑blockers are the preferred option if AAD treatment is indicated, and when frequent APBs/NSAT occur with structural heart disease, optimizing therapy of the underlying condition may reduce arrhythmia burden and deter arrhythmia‑induced cardiomyopathy. Consensus statements note that symptomatic patients with frequent APBs and NSAT might be treated with beta‑blockers, sotalol, flecainide, or propafenone, and that in structural heart disease such patients might be treated with amiodarone or beta‑blocker, with optimization of the underlying condition recommended.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^111QhaVZ]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation affects at least 1% of the population and causes marked society-wide morbidity and mortality. Current management of atrial fibrillation including antithrombotic therapy and management of concomitant conditions in all patients, rate control therapy in most patients, and rhythm control therapy in patients with severe atrial fibrillation-related symptoms can alleviate atrial fibrillation-related symptoms but can neither effectively prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation nor suppress atrial fibrillation-related complications. Hence, there is a need for better therapy of atrial fibrillation.

The etiology of atrial fibrillation is complex. Most of the causes of atrial fibrillation which are known at present perpetuate themselves in vicious circles, and presence of the arrhythmia by itself causes marked damage of atrial myocardium. These pathophysiological insights suggest that early diagnosis and comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation, including adequate therapy of all atrial fibrillation-causing conditions, rate control, and rhythm control therapy, could help to prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and reduce atrial fibrillation-related complications. Such a therapy should make use of safe and effective therapeutic modalities, some of which have become available recently or will become available in the near future. The hypothesis that early diagnosis and early, comprehensive therapy of atrial fibrillation can improve outcomes requires formal testing in controlled trials.

### Atrial fibrillation: common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation. Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic, but symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or other recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests. Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli. Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently. Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or in some patients based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as first-line rhythm control. Conversion to sinus rhythm with catheter ablation may be considered in patients who are unable or unwilling to take rate or rhythm control medications long-term or if medications have been ineffective.

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113qNdGq]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT) — definition, epidemiology, ECG localization, and mechanisms: Focal AT is characterized as a fast rhythm from a discrete origin and can be sustained or nonsustained, with the atrial rate usually between 100 and 250 bpm. In referral populations, focal AT represents approximately 3% to 17% of patients referred for SVT ablation, and AT-mediated cardiomyopathy has been reported in up to 10% of patients referred for ablation for incessant SVT. Diagnosis is suspected when ECG criteria are met and algorithms use P-wave morphology on a standard 12-lead ECG; positive P waves in leads I, II, and aVF suggest a cranial atrial origin, and shorter P-wave duration correlates with paraseptal origin versus free wall. The precise location is ultimately confirmed by mapping during EP studies when successful ablation is achieved. Mechanistically, an automatic AT can be transiently suppressed by adenosine or overdrive pacing and may be terminated by beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil; a triggered AT can be terminated by adenosine or overdrive pacing with variable response to these drugs; and a microreentrant AT can be induced and terminated by programmed stimulation, with drug response dependent on circuit location.

### Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardia: an ED-oriented algorithmic approach [^116iPp5U]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias is a common diagnostic conundrum encountered by emergency physicians. Although a number of published algorithms are available to assist the clinician in evaluating features of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), many of these are too cumbersome, requiring multiple decisions and introducing treatment suggestions within the diagnostic framework. To optimize the diagnosis of the narrow complex tachycardia, we propose 3 separate algorithms tailored to address varying levels of available clinical information. The static algorithm depends only on the 12-lead ECG without the benefit of historical data or diagnostic interventions. The comparative algorithm requires a baseline ECG to which the presenting ECG is compared. The dynamic algorithm encourages the clinician to take advantage of diagnostic maneuvers to further elucidate the tachycardia mechanism. Each of these algorithms requires the clinician to answer either "yes" or "no" for each criterion and does not include treatment recommendations.

### Atrial septal defect in adulthood: a new paradigm for congenital heart disease [^114btwzM]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Atrial septal defects (ASDs) represent the most common congenital heart defect diagnosed in adulthood. Although considered a simple defect, challenges in optimal diagnostic and treatment options still exist due to great heterogeneity in terms of anatomy and time-related complications primarily arrhythmias, thromboembolism, right heart failure and, in a subset of patients, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Atrial septal defects call for tertiary expertise where all options may be considered, namely catheter vs. surgical closure, consideration of pre-closure ablation for patients with atrial tachycardia and suitability for closure or/and targeted therapy for patients with PAH. This review serves to update the clinician on the latest evidence, the nuances of optimal diagnostics, treatment options, and long-term follow-up care for patients with an ASD.

### Update on medical management of atrial fibrillation in the modern era [^116UKMQL]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

The management of atrial fibrillation involves control of the ventricular response rate, anticoagulation to reduce the risk of stroke and attempts to maintain sinus rhythm. The approach to patients with atrial fibrillation has become increasingly complex as therapeutic options have expanded. The ultimate reasons to treat atrial fibrillation include improvement in symptoms, reduction in adverse outcomes and improvement in survival. Despite increasing interest in non pharmacological approaches to treat and potentially cure atrial fibrillation, drugs remain the primary method to treat most patients. This review updates the present state-of-the-art regarding medical management of atrial fibrillation based on present and emerging evidence.

Atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia classification — Macroreentrant atrial tachycardia/atrial flutter is characterized by constant regular P-wave/flutter wave morphology with rate typically > 250 bpm* and mechanism of macroreentry, whereas focal atrial tachycardia shows discrete P waves with an isoelectric segment, rate typically 100–250 bpm*, and mechanisms of microreentry or automaticity. Cavotricuspid isthmus dependent flutter is a right atrial reentry dependent on conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus and can be cured by ablation creating conduction block in the cavotricuspid isthmus, while not cavotricuspid isthmus dependent ("Atypical Atrial Flutter") is reentry that is not dependent on conduction through the cavotricuspid isthmus, with circuits usually defined by atrial scars from prior heart surgery, ablation, or idiopathic, where location determines ablation approach and risks and multiple reentry circuits can be present. Typical atrial flutter includes counterclockwise atrial flutter with ECG flutter waves negative in II, III, aVF and positive in V1, and clockwise atrial flutter (reverse typical atrial flutter) with ECG flutter waves positive in II, III, aVF and negative in V1, with V1 typically opposite in polarity to inferior leads; atypical flutter may be suggested on ECG by P-wave polarity that does not fit typical atrial flutter (for example, concordant P-wave polarity between V1 and inferior leads).

### Diagnosis and management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia [^116VGhWU]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), defined as tachyarrhythmias that originate from or conduct through the atria or atrioventricular node with abrupt onset, affects 168 to 332 per 100 000 individuals. Untreated PSVT is associated with adverse outcomes including high symptom burden and tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

Observations

Approximately 50% of patients with PSVT are aged 45 to 64 years and 67.5% are female. Most common symptoms include palpitations (86%), chest discomfort (47%), and dyspnea (38%). Patients may rarely develop tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy (1%) due to PSVT. Diagnosis is made on electrocardiogram during an arrhythmic event or using ambulatory monitoring. First-line acute therapy for hemodynamically stable patients includes vagal maneuvers such as the modified Valsalva maneuver (43% effective) and intravenous adenosine (91% effective). Emergent cardioversion is recommended for patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Catheter ablation is safe, highly effective, and recommended as first-line therapy to prevent recurrence of PSVT. Meta-analysis of observational studies shows single catheter ablation procedure success rates of 94.3% to 98.5%. Evidence is limited for the effectiveness of long-term pharmacotherapy to prevent PSVT. Nonetheless, guidelines recommend therapies including calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, and antiarrhythmic agents as management options.

Conclusion and Relevance

Paroxysmal SVT affects both adult and pediatric populations and is generally a benign condition. Catheter ablation is the most effective therapy to prevent recurrent PSVT. Pharmacotherapy is an important component of acute and long-term management of PSVT.

Ablation is increasingly used to treat AF, since recent trials of pharmacological therapy for AF have been disappointing. Ablation has been shown to improve maintenance of sinus rhythm compared to pharmacological therapy in many multicenter trials, although success rates remain suboptimal. This review will discuss several trends in the field of catheter ablation, including studies to advance our understanding of AF mechanisms in different patient populations, innovations in detecting and classifying AF, use of this information to improve strategies for ablation, technical innovations that have improved the ease and safety of ablation, and novel approaches to surgical therapy and imaging. These trends are likely to further improve results from AF ablation in coming years as it becomes an increasingly important therapeutic option for many patients.

### Atrial fibrillation [^1124KDUb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, and increases in prevalence with increasing age and the number of cardiovascular comorbidities. AF is characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat that can be asymptomatic or lead to symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnoea and dizziness. The condition can also be associated with serious complications, including an increased risk of stroke. Important recent developments in the clinical epidemiology and management of AF have informed our approach to this arrhythmia. This Primer provides a comprehensive overview of AF, including its epidemiology, mechanisms and pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, prevention and management. Management strategies, including stroke prevention, rate control and rhythm control, are considered. We also address quality of life issues and provide an outlook on future developments and ongoing clinical trials in managing this common arrhythmia.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) acute treatment — vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position; the practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned. Adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and can be considered as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent in narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias; it will acutely terminate AVNRT in approximately 95% of patients and will unmask atrial activity in arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or AT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT when adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, whereas oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.
