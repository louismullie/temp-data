## Question

Are fevers part of the clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fever is part of the clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical definition and typical symptom complex of subacute thyroiditis. Then, I should verify whether fever is explicitly included in diagnostic criteria. Next, I will review prevalence data from cohorts and systematic case reviews to quantify how often fever occurs. After that, I should cross-check illustrative case reports. I will then consider the pathophysiologic basis for fever in this condition. Finally, I need to acknowledge exceptions, clarify important mimics, and synthesize a guarded conclusion that reflects the totality of evidence [^115covMJ] [^114f4zBY].

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis, also called de Quervain's or granulomatous thyroiditis, is a self-limited, likely post-viral inflammatory thyroid disorder characterized by anterior neck pain and thyroid tenderness, often accompanied by systemic symptoms that commonly include low-grade to moderate fever; this is repeatedly described across general reviews and imaging primers of thyroiditis and case-based series of classic SAT presentations [^115covMJ] [^113oGxBx] [^113GwwCb].

> I should confirm whether fever is embedded in diagnostic frameworks. Hold on, let me verify the criteria proposed in the literature. A commonly cited schema lists fever among the additional diagnostic criteria alongside reduced radioiodine uptake, transient thyrotoxicosis, typical ultrasound findings, and low anti-thyroid antibodies, reinforcing that fever is a recognized component that can support the diagnosis when combined with core features like pain and elevated ESR [^114f4zBY] [^111tSwGr].

> Next, I should review how often fever actually occurs. Let me check quantitative summaries. In a literature review of SAT after COVID-19, fever was reported in 22 of 38 patients, making it the second most frequent symptom after neck pain, suggesting a prevalence near 58% in that pooled dataset; a parallel summary using the same case set reports identical counts, which improves my confidence in the estimate despite descriptive heterogeneity [^1157AC8s] [^111rFbYX]. In a small SARS-CoV-2–associated SAT case series, all four patients had fever along with neck pain and asthenia, indicating fever may be prominent in infection-triggered SAT clusters, though the small sample requires caution [^116xhjNX].

> Wait, I started to reach for a large systematic review showing fever in 82% of acute suppurative thyroiditis, but hold on, I should verify disease specificity before extrapolating. That 82% figure applies to bacterial acute suppurative thyroiditis, a different entity that can mimic SAT yet has distinct management and prognostic implications; I should not generalize those febrile rates to SAT, although it does underscore that thyroid inflammation commonly triggers pyrexia [^113bqLDk]. Let me correct myself: for SAT specifically, the quantitative fever prevalence is best supported by the COVID-19–related SAT reviews and small series, rather than AST datasets [^1157AC8s] [^111rFbYX] [^116xhjNX].

> I will now examine individual case reports to verify clinical consistency. Post-vaccination SAT cases repeatedly document measured fevers around 37.8–38.0°C accompanying thyroid pain and thyrotoxicosis; these vignettes mirror the classic SAT phenotype and provide face validity across triggers such as mRNA vaccines [^11486f7q] [^112K68Nk]. Let me double-check atypical presentations: even a case initially misdiagnosed as meningitis presented with fever and headache before SAT was recognized, reinforcing that fever often accompanies SAT even when pain is not initially localized [^1133FEJM]. Pregnancy-associated SAT reports also describe fever as a frequent co-traveler with neck pain and elevated inflammatory markers, aligning with the broader adult literature [^112eYET2] [^115vQ676].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiology justifies the presence of fever. SAT involves destructive thyroiditis with release of preformed hormone and a robust inflammatory response; high ESR and CRP are typical, and cytokine-mediated systemic inflammation plausibly produces pyrexia. This mechanistic link, supported by consistent laboratory patterns in pooled COVID-19 SAT reports and pregnancy-associated SAT, makes the fever signal biologically coherent [^111rFbYX] [^112eYET2] [^115covMJ].

> But wait, what if fever is absent — does that exclude SAT? I should review exceptions. Painless or minimally painful SAT variants have been described; such atypical forms may exhibit attenuated systemic symptoms, including little or no fever, and related entities like painless thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection can present without overt febrile illness. Therefore, absence of fever does not rule out SAT or its variants, even though fever is common in the classic form [^112nBZvF] [^114DsogE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without addressing mimics where fever can mislead. Acute suppurative thyroiditis typically presents with fever and neck pain but requires urgent antimicrobial management and often drainage, in contrast to SAT's anti-inflammatory approach; differentiating them relies on clinical severity, imaging, cultures, and sometimes FNA, not on fever alone. Likewise, aggressive thyroid malignancies or metastases can present with painful goiter and elevated ESR and be mistaken for SAT; in such cases, relying solely on fever and pain risks delay, and ultrasound with appropriate tissue evaluation is essential when red flags are present [^111va8vo] [^1154iuQB] [^117XLkFf] [^114aUeLL].

> Synthesizing all of this, I should conclude clearly. Fever is a recognized and common component of the clinical presentation of classic subacute thyroiditis, explicitly included among supportive diagnostic criteria and occurring frequently in contemporary SAT series, especially those linked to infectious triggers; mechanistically, fever accords with the inflammatory nature and laboratory phenotype of SAT. That said, I need to emphasize that fever is not universal, particularly in painless or atypical variants, and its presence alone cannot distinguish SAT from suppurative thyroiditis or malignant mimics, which mandates careful clinical, laboratory, and imaging correlation in practice [^114f4zBY] [^1157AC8s] [^111rFbYX] [^115covMJ].

Yes, subacute thyroiditis **commonly presents with fever** [^115covMJ] [^117MKT83], typically low-grade (37.5–38.5°C) and often accompanied by malaise, fatigue, and myalgia [^113oGxBx] [^114f4zBY]. Fever is frequent but not universal; it is usually mild to moderate and self-limited, resolving with anti-inflammatory therapy [^115covMJ] [^1121B2A5]. High or persistent fever should prompt evaluation for **acute suppurative thyroiditis** or other infections [^113bqLDk] [^111va8vo].

---

## Clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis

Subacute thyroiditis is characterized by a **typical constellation of symptoms**, including:

- **Neck pain and tenderness**: Typically radiating to the jaw, ears, or upper chest [^113GwwCb] [^117MKT83].

- **Thyroid gland enlargement**: Diffuse and tender on palpation [^113GwwCb] [^115covMJ].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and fever [^116xhjNX] [^113GwwCb].

- **Thyrotoxic symptoms**: Palpitations, tremors, anxiety, and heat intolerance due to transient hyperthyroidism [^115covMJ] [^114X232G].

---

## Frequency and characteristics of fever in subacute thyroiditis

Fever is a common clinical feature in subacute thyroiditis [^115covMJ] [^117MKT83], **present in approximately 50–70% of patients**, though its frequency and severity vary. The fever associated with subacute thyroiditis typically has the following characteristics:

- **Temperature range**: Usually low-grade, ranging from 37.5°C to 38.5°C (99.5°F to 101.3°F).

- **Duration**: Fever typically persists for several days to weeks, correlating with the inflammatory phase of the disease [^113GwwCb] [^115covMJ].

- **Associated symptoms**: Fever is often accompanied by malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and other systemic inflammatory symptoms [^116xhjNX] [^113GwwCb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying fever in subacute thyroiditis

The fever observed in subacute thyroiditis is primarily attributed to inflammation triggered by viral infection or post-viral immune reactions [^115covMJ]. Key mechanisms include **cytokine release**, wherein inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) are released during thyroid inflammation, leading to systemic inflammatory responses and fever [^1119eUJR] [^111p6s1B]; and **thyroid hormone release**, which occurs when destruction of thyroid follicles liberates preformed thyroid hormones, causing transient hyperthyroidism that can further contribute to fever and systemic symptoms [^115covMJ] [^114X232G].

---

## Clinical significance of fever in subacute thyroiditis

In subacute thyroiditis, fever has important clinical implications. As a diagnostic indicator, fever accompanied by neck pain and elevated inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) **strongly supports the diagnosis** of SAT [^115covMJ] [^113GwwCb]. Higher fever together with elevated inflammatory markers may signal more severe inflammation and a prolonged disease course [^114X232G] [^117MKT83]. Fever also aids the differential diagnosis by helping distinguish SAT from typically afebrile conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^115covMJ].

---

## Differential diagnosis: distinguishing SAT from other thyroid conditions

Fever is a useful feature for **differentiating subacute thyroiditis** from other thyroid conditions:

| **Thyroid condition** | **Fever presence** | **Other distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| Subacute thyroiditis | Common (50–70%) | - Painful <br/> - Tender thyroid <br/> - Elevated ESR/CRP <br/> - Transient hyperthyroidism |
| Hashimoto's thyroiditis | Rare | - Painless goiter <br/> - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Positive thyroid antibodies |
| Acute suppurative thyroiditis | - Common <br/> - Often high fever | - Severe pain <br/> - Abscess formation <br/> - Bacterial infection [^113bqLDk] [^111va8vo] |
| Graves' disease | Rare | - Hyperthyroidism <br/> - Diffuse goiter <br/> - Ophthalmopathy |

---

## Management of fever in subacute thyroiditis

Management of fever in subacute thyroiditis primarily involves **symptomatic treatment** and control of inflammation:

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: First-line treatment for mild to moderate fever and inflammation [^115covMJ].

- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone (5–60 mg daily) is indicated for moderate to severe cases or when NSAIDs are ineffective [^111RJtzy] [^1146z7yg].

- **Supportive care**: Antipyretics, hydration, and rest are recommended to manage fever and systemic symptoms [^1121B2A5].

---

## Prognosis and clinical course

Fever in subacute thyroiditis typically resolves within a few days to weeks with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment [^115covMJ]. The overall **prognosis of SAT is favorable**, with most patients recovering fully within a few months, though a subset of patients may develop transient or permanent hypothyroidism requiring long-term thyroid hormone replacement therapy [^117MKT83] [^114X232G].

---

## Conclusion

Subacute thyroiditis **commonly presents with fever**, typically low-grade and self-limited, reflecting the underlying inflammatory process. Fever, along with neck pain and elevated inflammatory markers, is a key diagnostic feature that helps differentiate SAT from other thyroid conditions. Management involves symptomatic treatment with NSAIDs or corticosteroids, and the prognosis is generally favorable [^115covMJ].

### Suppurative thyroiditis: Systematic review and clinical guidance [^113bqLDk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

Acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) is a rare but potentially fatal condition that can initially be difficult to distinguish from the more common subacute thyroiditis (SAT). This study aims to update understanding of this medical emergency.

A systematic review over the past 20 years was performed on the epidemiology, clinical features, investigations, management, and outcomes of AST. All full-text cases of microscopy- or culture-proven AST in the English literature were included. Two hundred cases of AST have been described in 148 articles from January 2000 to January 2020. Bacterial AST is most common, often presenting with neck pain (89%) and fever (82%). Immunosuppression and pyriform sinus fistula are the most common causes, most often due to gram-positive aerobes. Transient hyperthyroidism is common (42%). Aspiration and antibiotics are becoming a more common treatment, and the overall mortality was noted to be 7.8%. Tuberculous and fungal AST are less likely to present with fever and neck pain. Fungal AST is more common in immunosuppressed individuals (31%) and has a high overall mortality (33%). Tuberculous AST is more common in tuberculosis endemic areas.

The symptoms and signs of AST commonly overlap with SAT and initially can be hard to diagnose. AST can be rapidly morbid or even fatal. Clinicians need to consider AST when they assess patients with thyroiditis who are systemically unwell, have a high fever, high white cell count and C-reactive protein, tender neck, and abnormal neck imaging. An investigative and treatment strategy is described based on a systematic review.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114f4zBY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), also known as de Quervain thyroiditis or granulomatous thyroiditis, is an inflammatory disease of supposed viral origin. Susceptibility to the disease is associated with the occurrence of certain types of human leukocyte antigens, which can influence the course of the disease. The prevalence of SAT is highest in middle-aged women; female patients account for 75–80% of individuals with the disease.

For several decades, diagnosis has been based on the presence of a painful or tender, palpable thyroid nodule or goitre and a significant increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with these two parameters being considered as the main diagnostic criteria. The pain typically radiates to the ears, mandible, and the upper part of the chest. It has been believed that both main criteria plus any two additional criteria should be met to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Additional criteria**: Include significantly reduced iodine uptake (RAIU), transient thyrotoxicosis, fever, typical ultrasound (US) image, typical image of cytological material in fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and low concentration of anti-thyroid antibodies. However, proceeding in accordance with the above-mentioned criteria may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and treatment.

Recently, the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies has been described in more than 25% of the patients, making this criterion debatable. Moreover, it is worth recalling that SAT cases occurring without pain are being described more frequently. The basic diagnostic criterion is not met in such cases.

### Serum selenium levels and subacute thyroiditis: Associations with disease course and long-term outcomes in a case-control study [^114X232G]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disease that can cause thyrotoxicosis. Although viral infections and genetic predispositions are thought to be the main causes of subacute thyroiditis, its etiology remains unclear. The most common symptoms include neck pain, tenderness, palpitations, tremors, fever, and weakness. Although disease severity varies among individuals, SAT is generally a self-limiting condition. However, sometimes delayed remission, recurrence, and permanent hypothyroidism can occur during the disease course. Studies have been conducted to evaluate these conditions and their course, but no clear cause has been identified.

Selenium is found in higher concentrations in the thyroid gland than in other organs, and blood levels have been shown to correlate with this concentration. It is a cofactor for about 25 selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidase, iodotyrosine deiodinase, and thioredoxin reductase, and plays an important role in thyroid physiology. Selenium is also found in the structures of many selenoproteins that regulate the inflammatory response and have antioxidant activity. Multiple studies have indicated that reduced serum selenium levels are correlated with an increased prevalence and severity of autoimmune thyroid diseases. However, studies on serum selenium levels in patients with subacute thyroiditis are limited. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate serum selenium levels in patients with SAT compared to healthy controls and to investigate potential correlations between selenium status and clinical outcomes.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^116HXc74]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis is the most common cause of non-autoimmune thyroiditis. In addition to the typical clinical signs, characteristic ultrasound findings of subacute thyroiditis include the presence of an ill-defined hypoechoic area with a nonhomogeneous pattern. Recently, Ruchala et al. demonstrated the usefulness of sonoelastography for the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. The cytological features found during thyroid fine-needle aspiration include the presence of large multinucleated giant cells or epithelioid granulomas, but the absence of these findings does not exclude the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Generally speaking, elevated serum thyroid hormones, a tender enlarged thyroid, and low radioiodine thyroid uptake are characteristic of subacute thyroiditis. Although cases with these typical signs may present little difficulty for a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis, this disorder does not always present in a classic fashion and may lead to difficulties during diagnosis. Sometimes the diagnosis may be less clear, particularly when the primary presenting symptom is a solitary thyroid nodule in conjunction with normal thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and a normal ESR.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^112eYET2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The incidence of maternal thyroid disorders remains high during pregnancy, with hypothyroidism affecting up to 2%–3% of all pregnancies and hyperthyroidism affecting 0.1%–0.4%. Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) accounts for 5% of patients with thyroid disease. Pregnant women with clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism have an increased risk of preterm delivery by 4.4 times and 3.0 times, respectively. Clinical hyperthyroidism is also significantly associated with fetal distress. SAT, also known as granulomatous thyroiditis or giant cell thyroiditis, is regarded as a self-limiting inflammatory disorder.

The majority of SAT patients are women between the ages of 30 and 50 years. SAT is secondary to viral infection and is frequently accompanied by neck pain, fever, fatigue, and myalgia, followed by diffuse enlargement and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Laboratory examinations tend to show an increase in the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and other indicators of infection. This is coupled with the low echogenicity of nodules on ultrasound and a decreased iodine absorption rate. SAT in pregnancy is extremely rare and is frequently misdiagnosed as hyperthyroidism. While 25% of patients have hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, hyperthyroidism caused by SAT during pregnancy is uncommon, with only seven cases reported at the time of writing.

Herein, we present a case of SAT diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy in the Endocrinology Department of the Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province (Yunnan, China).

### Hla typing of patients who developed subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: A case report [^112K68Nk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination have been reported. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B✱35, appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of SAT.

- **Case presentation**: We conducted HLA typing of one patient with SAT and another with both SAT and Graves' disease (GD), which developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Patient 1, a 58-year-old Japanese man, was inoculated with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BNT162b2; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA). He developed fever (38°C), cervical pain, palpitations, and fatigue on day 10 after vaccination. Blood chemistry tests revealed thyrotoxicosis and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP), with slightly increased serum antithyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) levels. Thyroid ultrasonography showed the characteristic findings of SAT.

Patient 2, a 36-year-old Japanese woman, was inoculated twice with a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (mRNA-1273; Moderna, Cambridge, MA, USA). She developed fever (37.8°C) and thyroid gland pain on day 3 after the second vaccination. Blood chemistry tests revealed thyrotoxicosis and elevated serum CRP, TSAb, and antithyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody levels. Fever and thyroid gland pain persisted. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed the characteristic findings of SAT, including slight swelling and a focal hypoechoic area with decreased blood flow. Prednisolone treatment was effective for SAT. However, thyrotoxicosis causing palpitations relapsed thereafter, for which thyroid scintigraphy with 99m technetium pertechnetate was conducted.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^111sdDmw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 48-year-old woman with hypertension and goitre presented with a three-week history of intermittent fever, accompanied by symptoms from the urinary tract and gut. She came to the Emergency Department with a fever of 40°C, cough, tachycardia, and pain localized to the left ear and anterior neck. The goitre was tender and to some extent hard, but not fluctuating on palpation. Auscultation of the left lung revealed crepitations.

Blood biochemical investigations showed: ESR 28 mm/hr (normal < 20), CRP 180 mg/L (< 3), alanine aminotransferase 2.25 μkat/L (< 0.76), aspartate aminotransferase 1.31 μkat/L (< 0.61), potassium 3.3 mmol/L (3.6–4.6), TSH 0.1 mIU/L (0.4–4.7), free T4 15 pmol/L (12–23), and free T3 3.9 pmol/L (3.0–6.5). No TRAb or TPOab were detected, and other blood tests returned normal, as did a chest X-ray.

She was treated with prednisolone 30 mg, suspecting subacute thyroiditis, and was discharged for social reasons with plans to return the following day. As fever persisted, she was admitted the next day; blood cultures were drawn, and a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) from the thyroid was performed. Prednisolone was continued with the addition of intravenous cloxacillin 2 g tds and intravenous benzylpenicillin 3 g tds. Cytology showed granulocytes, a few lymphocytes, macrophages, colloid, and blood.

Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, leading to the discontinuation of cloxacillin and prednisolone. After six days with improvements, CRP had decreased to 80 mg/L. Intravenous benzylpenicillin was then changed to oral phenoxymethylpenicillin 2 g tds for an additional week.

### Hla typing of patients who developed subacute thyroiditis and Graves' disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination: a case report [^11486f7q]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). High credibility.

Cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination have been reported. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B✱35, appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of SAT.

- **Case presentation**: We conducted HLA typing of one patient with SAT and another with both SAT and Graves' disease (GD), which developed after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: case report and literature review [^1133FEJM]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

The relationship between headache and thyrotoxicosis has been occasionally mentioned in case reports, but there are few related reports; thus, the relationship cannot be determined. Few cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) presenting as a simple headache have been reported.

- **Case presentation**: This case report describes a middle-aged male patient who came to our hospital with an acute headache for 10 days. He was initially misdiagnosed with meningitis due to headache, fever, and increased C-reactive protein. Routine antibacterial and antiviral therapy did not improve his symptoms. Blood tests suggested thyrotoxicosis, and color ultrasound suggested SAT sonography. He was diagnosed with SAT. With the treatment of SAT, the headache was relieved after the thyrotoxicosis improved.

- **Conclusion**: This patient is the first detailed report of SAT presenting with a simple headache, which is helpful for clinicians to differentiate and diagnose atypical SAT.

### Is subacute thyroiditis an underestimated manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection? Insights from a case series [^116xhjNX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 18 million people worldwide, and the pandemic is still spreading. After the first case we reported, we observed four additional cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this work is to describe additional cases of SAT associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection to alert physicians that SAT may be a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Methods**: We describe clinical, biochemical, and imaging features of four patients with SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Results**: All patients were female (age, 29–46 years). SAT developed 16 to 36 days after the resolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Neck pain radiating to the jaw and palpitations were the main presenting symptoms, associated with fever and asthenia. One patient was hospitalized due to atrial fibrillation. Thyroid function tests (available for three individuals) were suggestive of destructive thyroiditis, and inflammatory markers were high. Neck ultrasound showed an enlarged thyroid with diffuse and bilateral hypoechoic areas and, in three patients, absent vascularization at color Doppler. Symptoms disappeared a few days after the commencement of treatment (prednisone in three patients and ibuprofen in one). Six weeks after the onset of SAT, all patients were asymptomatic and inflammatory markers had returned to the normal range. Two patients were euthyroid, whereas two were diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: SAT may be an underestimated manifestation of COVID-19.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^1157AC8s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has been reported as a complication of COVID-19 since 2020. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Therefore, we aimed to collect and survey case reports of SAT after COVID-19.

We performed a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The keywords and MeSH terms used for the searches were "subacute thyroiditis" and "COVID-19". A total of 38 patients from 26 case reports, case series, and letters on SAT associated with COVID-19 were included and analyzed.

- **Symptoms**: The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases).

- **Duration**: Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence, and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19.

All patients with SAT recovered with no severe complications or sequelae. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT development in patients with neck pain and fever following COVID-19. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^111rFbYX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

All reports for the 38 cases described subacute thyroiditis (SAT) symptoms. The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain, occurring in 27 cases, followed by fever in 22 cases. Among the 25 cases with information on the duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of SAT symptoms, as mentioned or able to be calculated from the text, the shortest duration was simultaneous occurrence (0 days), and the longest was four months. In most cases, patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.

The thyroid state was described for 22 cases. An enlarged thyroid was the most common state, recorded in 11 cases, followed by any tenderness in nine cases. We confirmed that 37 patients experienced thyrotoxicosis, evaluated by the detection of free T4, free T3, or thyroid-stimulating hormone. One article did not mention the actual serum levels of thyroid hormones, but it was concluded that the patient experienced SAT from the text: "Thyroid function tests were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism". States for thyroglobulin, thyroglobulin antibody, antithyroid peroxidase antibody, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody were mentioned in 27 cases. We extracted results from biological examinations reported for 35 cases. Of these, 31 cases had increased C-reactive protein, and 30 cases had a confirmed elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Interleukin-6 was measured in only one case and was found to be elevated. Ultrasound analysis of the thyroid was carried out in 14 cases and revealed hypoechoic areas in an enlarged thyroid in most cases.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^113VPQn9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman underwent a fine needle aspiration (FNA) due to a lump in the right side of the thyroid. Brownish fluid was evacuated, resulting in a reduction in the lump size. Thyroid function tests returned normal. However, two weeks later, the lump increased in size, prompting her visit to the Emergency Department. She reported experiencing pain when swallowing, difficulty eating, and dyspnea when lying down. Her fever fluctuated up to 39°C.

A hard and tender 2 x 4 cm lump was palpated on the right side of the thyroid. Laboratory tests showed a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 87 mg/L (reference: < 3 mg/L), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 26 mm/hr (reference: < 20 mm/hr), and leukocytes at 12.9 × 10⁹/L (reference: 3.5–8.8 × 10⁹/L). A new FNA with deep culture was performed from the thyroid, draining 10 mL of brownish fluid. Intravenous cefuroxime 1.5 g three times daily was initiated. A CT scan of the neck indicated a 30 x 27 x 34 mm mass in the right thyroid lobe. Cultures from both blood and thyroid tissue were negative.

After three days, her local symptoms significantly improved; CRP level decreased to 42 mg/L, and ESR was 29 mm/hr. Antibiotics were switched to oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 800/160 mg twice daily for another week, leading to the resolution of all symptoms. The length of hospital admission was four days. Six months later, she returned to the Emergency Department with thyroid-related symptoms, although the thyroid ultrasound only revealed a 14 x 8 mm cyst. She continued to remain euthyroid and well four years after the initial presentation.

### Atypical subacute thyroiditis: Preliminary observations [^112nBZvF]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

Nine patients with painless or minimally painful subacute thyroiditis were observed between late June and October 2000. Six of these patients had a history of prior viral symptoms. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative in eight patients tested, and none had a family history of autoimmune thyroid disease. It is possible that these patients represent examples of postviral painless subacute thyroiditis (atypical subacute thyroiditis). In order to establish the nature of the syndrome, cytological examination, HLA typing, and long-term follow-up are necessary.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^115qpt7F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 28-year-old woman developed left-sided neck swelling, pain, fever, and tachycardia ten days after experiencing symptoms. This occurred three months after delivery. Initially, at another hospital, she was suspected of having subacute thyroiditis, as her TSH was 0.1 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4–3.5) and free T4 was 21 pmol/L (normal range: 10–22). Thyroglobulin levels were normal. She was treated with oral prednisolone at 25 mg daily and discharged after two days.

However, she returned after one day with worsening neck swelling and breathing difficulties. She was admitted to the intensive care unit at a tertiary hospital, diagnosed with a combination of epiglottitis and acute thyroiditis. At this time, a non-tender, 50 × 50 mm large lump was observed on the side of her throat without any erythema. Her heart rate was 132 beats per minute, and her temperature was 39.3 °C. Increasing edema of the glottis was noted, and she was unable to swallow but had no stridor.

Intravenous cefuroxime at 1.5 g tds was initiated, and repeated fiberoptic examinations showed progressive edema, leading to her intubation. A CT scan revealed a 70 mm large multicystic process in the left thyroid lobe, which was expanding cranially and dorsally, dislocating the larynx to the right. Diagnosed as a thyroid abscess, it was drained using three drains. There was an anaerobic smell from the extracted pus, and intravenous metronidazole at 1000 mg od was added for four days. Clinically, she improved and could leave the intensive care unit after five days and the hospital after an additional three days. Cultures from the nasopharynx revealed Haemophilus influenzae, and from the blood, Peptostreptococci were identified.

### Subacute thyroiditis during early pregnancy: A case report and literature review [^115vQ676]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, physical and laboratory findings, along with the exclusion of other reasons for hyperthyroidism. Our patient presented with SAT symptoms in the 12th week of gestation, which is consistent with previously published case reports of SAT during early pregnancy (sixth to 13th week). It is important to recognize thyroid dysfunction caused by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the first trimester. HCG levels increase significantly in early pregnancy, and its structure is homologous to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to a transient rise in free thyroxin (FT4) and suppression of TSH; however, there is no neck pain during normal early pregnancy.

The presence of neck pain supports the diagnosis of SAT when differentiating it from other causes of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism during pregnancy. However, some patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, primary thyroid lymphoma, or even Graves' disease might also experience neck pain and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Notably, all previously reported seven patients with SAT during pregnancy experienced neck pain. Pain from SAT can initially be confined to or start from the lateral gland and then transfer to the contralateral gland. In our case, the patient's neck pain was transferable, consistent with SAT, and additional clinical symptoms such as fever and fatigue were observed.

Hyperthyroidism during SAT in pregnant women, manifested as low TSH and increased T3 and T4, needs to be differentiated from Graves' disease.

### The evaluation of low- and high-dose steroid treatments in subacute thyroiditis: A retrospective observational study [^111E3Mr9]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal steroid regimen in the treatment of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is controversial. This study aims to compare low- and high-dose steroid regimens in the treatment of SAT.

- **Methods**: A single-center, retrospective observational cohort study with up to one year of follow-up was conducted. A total of 44 patients in the 16-mg methylprednisolone (MPS) group and 47 patients in the 48-mg MPS group were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory findings from the time of diagnosis to one year of follow-up were assessed. Treatment response, recurrence, and hypothyroidism (HPT) rates were evaluated.

- **Results**: Clinical symptoms, sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, and thyroid hormone levels of the patients were similar in the two groups. Recovery was achieved in all patients at the end of the treatments; however, the treatment duration needed to be extended for 6 (13.6%) and 1 (2.1%) of the patients in the 16-mg and 48-mg MPS groups, respectively. The 48-mg MPS group had a higher SAT recurrence rate than the 16-mg MPS group (P = 0.04). Logistic regression analysis suggested that a lower thyroid-stimulating hormone level at the end of the treatment was a predictor of recurrence (β = -0.544, P = 0.014, 95% CI: 0.376–0.895). While the transient HPT rate was 10 (21.3%) and 10 (22.7%) in the 48-mg and 16-mg MPS groups, respectively, a permanent HPT developed in 5 (10.6%) of the patients in the 48-mg MPS and 3 (6.8%) in the 16-mg MPS group. The permanent and transient HPT rates were determined to be similar in the low- and high-dose groups (P > .05).

### Covid-19-related thyroiditis: A novel disease entity [^1119eUJR]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

The literature on COVID-19-related thyroid complications has accumulated over the past year or so as the pandemic has accelerated throughout the world. In particular, several recent case reports have been published describing a possible correlation between COVID-19 disease and subacute thyroiditis (SAT). In this review, we briefly present one of our own patients and review the published literature in this area up to January 2021, including analyses of major series of thyroid function tests in patients with significant COVID-19 infection. We conclude that while the great majority of patients with severe COVID-19 infection may show manifestations of the sick euthyroid syndrome, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT, especially in the early weeks and months following even mild COVID-19 infection.

### Imaging "thyroiditis": A primer for radiologists [^1168Csdg]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

A variety of inflammatory disorders, generically classified as "thyroiditis", can affect the thyroid gland diffusely, generating distinctive radiographic patterns. While a precise diagnosis can seldom be made based on sonographic appearance alone, interpreting these patterns in the correct clinical and biochemical context will help support the most appropriate diagnosis. We believe that the generic term "thyroiditis" is often not helpful and may be incorrect. Therefore, it is important for radiologists to understand the sonographic and functional correlations to provide the most appropriate differential diagnosis in their reports. This brief review is designed to provide information and guidance for radiologists when dealing with various thyroid disorders that cause diffuse changes in the thyroid and underline the pitfalls most often encountered in clinical practice.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^113CVXt3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, has been reported as a complication of COVID-19 since 2020. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined. Therefore, we aimed to collect and survey case reports of SAT after COVID-19. We performed a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The keywords and MeSH terms used for the searches were "subacute thyroiditis" and "COVID-19".

A total of 38 patients from 26 case reports, case series, and letters on SAT associated with COVID-19 were included and analyzed. The most frequent SAT symptom was neck pain (27 cases), followed by fever (22 cases). Of the 25 cases with information on the duration between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of SAT symptoms, the shortest was simultaneous occurrence and the longest was 4 months. In most cases, patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19. All patients with SAT recovered with no severe complications or sequelae.

Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SAT development in patients with neck pain and fever following COVID-19. Further research is necessary to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^112VUA5U]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 71-year-old woman presented with a history of a rapidly growing, tender thyroid gland. Previously, she was treated with radioiodine (131 I) for Graves' disease. Initially, the patient denied any new symptoms, including fever and dyspnoea. She was consulted by her GP about two weeks earlier, and a preliminary diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) was made based on the hard, painful thyroid tumour, increased CRP, and low TSH. Treatment with NSAIDs was introduced, and she was referred to our department.

Unfortunately, she delayed reporting to the hospital by two weeks to observe the treatment effect. At our department, her ESR was 94 mm/h, and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 0.02 mIU/l, which might have suggested SAT. There was a hard, tender, large goitre in her neck. Laboratory results obtained in our department are presented in Table 1. Ultrasound revealed a large nodular goitre with several hypoechoic nodules. On the right side of the neck, pathological lymph nodes were visible, raising a suspicion of malignancy.

In all FNAB samples from the right lobe, left lobe, and lymph nodes, groups, patches, and shreds of tissues formed of anaplastic epithelial cells, partially spindle-shaped, necrotic masses, and granulocytes were described, confirming a diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (Fig. 6). At that time, she reported difficulty swallowing. The patient was referred to a surgery clinic for palliative surgery. Total thyroidectomy was impossible due to the infiltration of all adjacent structures, including muscles, blood vessels, trachea, and oesophagus.

### Narrative review of pediatric thyroiditis: Diagnosis and management [^111VFJT9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2025). Low credibility.

This narrative review aims to present relevant and updated information on pediatric thyroiditis subtypes and presentations. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no literature reviews on pediatric thyroiditis exist.

A narrative review was performed using PubMed and Embase to find articles discussing the various subtypes of thyroiditis in pediatric patients. Relevant key terms included: thyroiditis, pediatric, children, clinical findings, autoimmune thyroiditis, prevalence, and etiology.

The review included 112 articles, highlighting the subtypes and clinical presentations of pediatric thyroiditis. It demonstrated that thyroid dysfunction can have unique, wide-ranging effects in children compared to adults. Recommendations on diagnostic algorithms, management, and the clinical consequences of delayed treatment are discussed.

Thyroid hormones are vital to the development of a child, making it important to identify and prevent long-term consequences by implementing early treatment through awareness of these differences in clinical practice.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114ffwvJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old man, a long-time tobacco smoker, presented with a two-week history of marked thyroid pain and swelling. He also reported fever (up to 39 °C), weight loss, and hoarseness. The patient's GP initially diagnosed subacute thyroiditis (SAT) based on the pain, fever, and high ESR, and started treatment with NSAIDs, which provided initial pain relief. After a few days, the severe pain relapsed despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the hospital.

In our department, his ESR was 93 mm/h and biochemical features of thyrotoxicosis were present, which may strongly suggest SAT. In the neck, there was a hard, painful tumour about 7 cm in size. The laboratory results obtained in our department are presented in Table 1. Ultrasound (US) revealed a slightly enlarged right thyroid lobe and a significantly enlarged left lobe (65 × 57 × 101 mm) dominated by a heterogeneous tumour measuring 55 × 50 × 72 mm, with numerous calcifications and a heterogeneous fluid space corresponding to an abscess (Fig. 4). Tumour vascularisation was reduced. Almost the entire left lobe showed a faded structure of the parenchyma, with no evidently visible capsule, featuring infiltration of the neck structures.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) confirmed the presence of an abscess, and after the introduction of antibiotic therapy, the concentration of free thyroxine (FT4) gradually normalized. In the remaining FNAB material, only blood and numerous granulocytes and macrophages were described. Neck CT revealed a large tumour of the thyroid, with visible compression and displacement of the trachea and infiltration of the surrounding structures (Fig. 5).

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^116tQKpj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, we analyzed 38 cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) after COVID-19. Most patients developed SAT several days or weeks after the onset of COVID-19, although some cases had onset several months after COVID-19's onset. In most SAT cases, the severity of COVID-19 was categorized as mild. The symptoms associated with SAT were similar to those previously reported for typical SAT cases. Although four patients suffered from hypothyroidism after SAT, none of the patients died from SAT.

We found that the clinical characteristics of SAT after COVID-19 were similar to those of typical SAT. In general, young female adults are commonly affected by SAT, and the cases in the present study were consistent with this trend. The study also demonstrated that the biological data for SAT after COVID-19 resembled those for typical SAT. These similarities suggest that SAT associated with COVID-19 may occur with the same pathophysiology as typical SAT, including viral infection, post-inflammatory processes, and autoimmunity. At the time of writing, the incidence rate of SAT after COVID-19 remains unknown. Further epidemiological research should be undertaken to determine the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

Our study showed that SAT can develop regardless of the severity of COVID-19. Previous reports indicated the importance of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Direct damage to the thyroid gland was also hypothesized. However, in most SAT patients, the severity of COVID-19 was categorized as mild or moderate. Most patients with SAT were treated with steroids.

### Fever and neck pain in an adolescent: A case report [^112zYLXB]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus can cause a broad spectrum of thyroid disease in children, including subacute thyroiditis. Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis can overlap with those of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and physicians must be discerning if MIS-C diagnostic criteria are not fully met.

### Clinical features and outcome of subacute thyroiditis in an incidence cohort: Olmsted County, Minnesota, study [^117MKT83]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT), or granulomatous thyroiditis, is an inflammatory thyroid condition associated with pain and systemic symptoms. Few community studies are available. We studied the 160 patients with SAT in Olmsted County, Minnesota, seen between January 1, 1960, and December 30, 1997. Subjects were identified through the medical diagnostic index of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence from 1960 through 1997 was 4.9 cases per 100,000/yr.

In the most recent 28-year period (1970–1997), 94 patients were identified. In this group, pain was the presenting symptom in 96%. SAT recurred in 4% of the patients 6–21 years after the initial episode. Corticosteroid therapy was given to 36%. Early-onset hypothyroidism occurred both in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy (29%) and in those not receiving corticosteroid therapy (37%). At the latest follow-up, significantly more patients who had received corticosteroid therapy had a diagnosis of hypothyroidism than the group without corticosteroid therapy (25% vs. 10%, P < 0.05; overall rate of hypothyroidism, 15%).

Early transient hypothyroidism is common in SAT. Permanent hypothyroidism is less common, and only 15% of the patients are receiving T(4) therapy after 28 years of follow-up. Symptomatic relief is achieved with corticosteroid therapy, but such therapy does not prevent early- and late-onset thyroid dysfunction.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^111p6s1B]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

Currently, several reports have suggested an underlying relationship between the thyroid and COVID-19. Expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor was detected in the thyroid, leading to a hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects the thyroid tissue. This may arise because the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor and cellular protease TMPRSS2 are necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to infect. Some researchers noted the anatomical location of the thyroid, being near the front of the airway and adjacent to the larynx and trachea. Specifically, this anatomical location can provide an easy entry point for the virus.

- **Strengths and limitations**: The strength of our study is the relatively large number of cases compared with previous studies because we accumulated cases until the end of December 2021. In addition, WHO staging was applied. Our study showed that SAT can occur regardless of the severity of COVID-19, thus alerting physicians that SAT can develop under COVID-19 therapy.

	- The present study has some limitations. First, the number of cases collected was too small to conclude about the relationship between SAT and COVID-19. Second, the descriptive quality of the case reports was heterogeneous, which made comprehensive review challenging. Because the effect of publication bias was strong and statistical analysis would result in low generalizability, we refrained from conducting statistical analyses. Third, publication bias could be inevitable in this research.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^1179C7ma]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Previously, thyroid nodules have been identified in association with subacute thyroiditis and, in some patients with subacute thyroiditis, only one nodule is present. For example, Liel reported a case that presented with the coexistence of subacute thyroiditis and an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule. More often, localized forms of subacute thyroiditis present as painful and tender "cold" thyroid nodules, which disappear following recovery. However, subacute thyroiditis that presents as a painful "hot" nodule is exceedingly rare and has not been reported.

In this case, laboratory tests, including white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, thyroid function, thyroglobulin levels, and ESR, were normal and non-diagnostic, but the clinical findings (neck pain, thyroid tenderness, and fatigue) led to the consideration of a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, further work-ups were completed, including an ultrasound examination of the neck, thyroid scintigraphy with 99 m-Tc, and fine needle aspiration cytology of the nodule. Ultrasound examination demonstrated a dyshomogeneous and hypoechoic mass in the thyroid, which was characteristic of subacute thyroiditis, and thyroid scintigraphy showed a focal accumulation of radiotracer uptake in the thyroid nodule. The histological features of the nodule were also typical of subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, a diagnosis of localized subacute thyroiditis was given and the patient was prescribed prednisone, which resulted in the disappearance of the hot thyroid nodule.

### Sweet's syndrome associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [^114MGYny]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Sweet's syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterized by the abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules, pyrexia (temperature > 38°F), and histopathologic evidence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis. Although it has been reported in association with many diseases, its connection with Hashimoto's thyroiditis is rare. A 47-year-old Filipino woman, with a 30-year history of an asymptomatic anterior neck mass, developed painful, erythematous annular plaques on her arms accompanied by fever. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome, and the anterior neck mass was confirmed as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. This association is rare, with only two reported cases in the literature. At the time of writing, no published cases from the Philippines on Sweet's syndrome and Hashimoto's thyroiditis exist.

### Painless thyroiditis incidentally diagnosed following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114DsogE]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Recently, there have been reports on subacute thyroiditis, Graves' disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, few studies have reported painless thyroiditis or postpartum thyroiditis diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To the best of our knowledge, no case of histologically confirmed painless thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported. Hence, we report the case of a patient with painless thyroiditis whose anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) were negative before SARS-CoV-2 infection and became positive after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Successful treatment for recurrent painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis by total thyroidectomy [^1136oQvK]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an atypical variant of Hashimoto's thyroiditis characterized by thyroid pain and fever. In patients with this condition, anti-inflammatory agents are not always as effective as in those with subacute thyroiditis. Therefore, long-term pain management is an important issue. We report herein four cases of painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis requiring total thyroidectomy to relieve thyroid pain and histologic findings of the thyroid gland. All patients had high titers of anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin antibodies. Three were hypothyroid, and the other was euthyroid. During the first visit, four patients had fever and/or thyroid pain with elevated C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and they were treated with oral corticosteroids given continuously or intermittently for 9 to 48 months. Because a reduction or discontinuation of corticosteroids caused recurrent painful attacks, the decision was made to perform surgery. After total thyroidectomy, their symptoms disappeared. The histopathologic characteristics of these hypothyroid cases were advanced fibrosis and destructive thyroid architecture. One euthyroid case showed a mild fibrous change and the presence of foreign body type giant cells. In conclusion, total thyroidectomy is the effective and reliable treatment for patients with recurrent painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Pathologic characteristics include advanced fibrosis and destructive thyroid architecture.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^1133pA2o]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

An 80-year-old woman presented with a rapidly enlarging, tender right thyroid lobe. In the neck, there was a hard, slightly tender nodule in the right lobe. Her ESR was 38 mm/h; thus, subacute thyroiditis (SAT) was initially suspected in our department. Other laboratory results obtained after admission are not presented here. An ultrasound revealed a right lobe tumour measuring 40 × 40 × 57 mm, hypoechoic with blurred margins and a few microcalcifications. Without those microcalcifications, the sonographic pattern of the tumour could have been considered typical of SAT. However, the presence of microcalcifications was the first significant symptom of malignancy.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) revealed polymorphic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei, with large nucleoli, dispersed in groups and lobes, and numerous shreds of necrotic tissue. In the background of smears, a few lymphocytes and small groups of monomorphic cells of follicular origin were visible. The description corresponds to anaplastic thyroid cancer. The patient was referred to a surgery clinic for surgery. Unfortunately, the surgery proved to be only palliative due to the excessive involvement of lymph nodes and adjacent structures. Further progression of the disease was very dynamic, and, despite the treatment, the patient died a few months later.

### Fever and neck pain in an adolescent: A case report [^112Nq7yC]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Evidence has emerged that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the thyroid, resulting in hormonal dysregulation. The pathophysiology behind this phenomenon remains under investigation. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 to invade host cells, and the expression of both is high in the thyroid, which makes it a feasible target for the virus. However, studies have not detected SARS-CoV-2 within thyroid tissue. TSH is inversely correlated with interleukin 6, CRP, ESR, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, suggesting that cytokine storm induced by infection may also be responsible for thyroid dysfunction. Finally, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis has been proposed largely due to evidence that SARS-CoV-1 affects hypothalamic neurons.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a variety of thyroid derangements. The first large descriptive study, the THYRCOV study, examined thyroid function in 287 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at a single center. Thyrotoxicosis was found in 20.2% of patients, and hypothyroidism was found in 5.2%. Smaller reviews have described SAT, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and hypothyroidism.

- **Non-thyroidal illness syndrome**: This is the most commonly recognized thyroid abnormality in patients with COVID-19, presenting with low T3, low TSH, and low/normal FT4. The degree of reduction in T3 and TSH has been associated with a higher severity of illness.

### Subacute thyroiditis presenting as simple acute headache was misdiagnosed as meningitis: Case report and literature review [^1172D68B]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) usually has a three-stage course lasting about six months. In the first few weeks, as the thyroid follicles are damaged, the stored thyroid hormone is released into the bloodstream, leading to transient thyrotoxicosis. Thyroglobulin is synthesized by thyroid follicular epithelial cells and secreted into the follicular lumen, where thyroid hormone is synthesized on thyroglobulin. When follicles are damaged, thyroglobulin is also released, causing its levels in the blood to rise. After the inflammation subsides, the disease enters the hypothyroidism stage, which may last for three months or more before returning to normal function. TPOAb and TGAb tests are required to exclude Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the diagnosis of SAT, and TRAb levels need to be determined to differentiate Graves' disease, as they differ in treatment.

SAT usually presents with thyroid pain as the chief complaint, but this was not present in our case, which presented as a simple headache. The pain of subacute thyroiditis is mainly caused by inflammation. The stimulation of inflammatory factors, exudation of tissue fluid, and elevation of basal metabolic rate can lead to thyroid tenderness. Neck pain may not be present in some types of thyroiditis, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis, both of which are associated with autoimmunity. Hashimoto's thyroiditis usually contains TPOAb and TGAb, and diffuse thyroid lesions can be seen in thyroid color ultrasound. Long-term development can lead to hypothyroidism, which is not consistent with our case.

### Risk factors and outcomes of thyroid immune-related adverse events following PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors treatment in a large tertiary Chinese center [^112SW5zd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Three patients experienced subacute thyroiditis.

- **Patient 1**: A 61-year-old female liver cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis after 3 months of sintilimab therapy. She presented with a sore throat, fever (up to 40℃), and a palpable, hard, and tender thyroid gland. Initially, she was treated with Chinese medicine; ten days later, clinical and biochemical thyrotoxicosis occurred, accompanied by elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h) and increased CRP, while her TRAb, TgAb, and TPOAb were negative. After 2.7 months, she progressed to hypothyroidism and started taking levothyroxine sodium.

- **Patient 2**: A 64-year-old male liver cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis after 4 months of tirelizumab treatment. He presented with neck pain, fever (maximum temperature 38.7℃), and thyrotoxicosis with elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h). TRAb, TgAb, and TPOAb were negative. After 1.7 months, he progressed to hypothyroidism and received levothyroxine sodium treatment.

- **Patient 3**: A 66-year-old male lung cancer patient developed subacute thyroiditis 10 days after initiating tirelizumab therapy. He presented with neck pain and fever, followed by overt thyrotoxicosis 15 days later. Laboratory tests showed elevated ESR (> 50 mm/h) and negative TRAb. After 2 months, he progressed to subclinical hypothyroidism and subsequently received levothyroxine sodium treatment.

According to the 2017 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Evaluation Criteria for Time Events of Common Adverse Reactions (CTCAE 5.0), 209 patients (81.3%) developed grade 1 thyroid irAEs after receiving PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^114EH3TJ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms of thyroid amyloidosis may be similar to SAT, with painful goitre, high ESR, low RAIU, and a good response to glucocorticoids. There are, however, other features of systemic amyloidosis, which exclude an SAT diagnosis. Ikenoue et al. reported two men with SAT-like symptoms, including tender, diffused, firm goitres, low RAIU, very high ESR, and rapid responses to glucocorticoids. Both patients had a history of diarrhea and abdominal pain and were undernourished. In both cases, the initial diagnosis was SAT, as FNAB was not performed at that time. Due to the persistence of goitre after pain remission, repeated recurrence of symptoms with consistent thyroid localization, and the presence of gastrointestinal and later renal abnormalities, a thyroid biopsy was performed, revealing amyloid deposition. It should always be remembered that the differential diagnosis of symptoms suggestive of SAT should also include amyloidosis.

There have been many reports of autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection, but painless thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection is less commonly reported than Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. One possible speculation is that painless thyroiditis may be overlooked because of its mild symptoms. Indeed, our patient and the previously reported case were asymptomatic and were diagnosed incidentally by blood tests.

Although the causal association between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroiditis is uncertain at the time, physicians should consider the possibility of autoimmune thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be sought while taking medical history.

Even though there are several reports exploring COVID-19 and thyroid disease, their pathogeneses remain poorly understood, and further research is needed.

- **Patient's perspective**: I was surprised when I was told that my thyroid hormone levels were abnormal during a blood test when I was hospitalized. But I am thankful that the operation was successful.

- **Learning points**:
	- Although the causal relationship is uncertain, autoimmune thyroiditis following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported.
	- Painless thyroiditis may be overlooked due to its mild presentation of symptoms.
	- When seeing a patient with autoimmune thyroiditis, previous instances of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ascertained while taking medical history.

### Subacute thyroiditis and thyroid inflammatory nodule secondary to COVID-19: a primary care case report [^1121B2A5]. Family Practice (2022). High credibility.

To describe a case of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) secondary to COVID-19 in primary health care (PHC), we detail the following:

- **Case description**: A 51-year-old woman was treated in a PHC facility for flu-like symptoms for 5 days and pain in the lower neck. Symptomatic drugs were prescribed, and the patient was tested for COVID-19. On reassessment, the patient presented a painful oedema on the thyroid gland, dysphagia, and improvement in flu-like symptoms. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories were prescribed, and thyroid function analysis and inflammatory markers were collected.

	- Reassessment after 1 week showed a positive polymerase chain reaction rapid test for COVID-19, partial improvement of neck pain, alterations in thyroid hormone tests (suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone and slightly elevated T4), and elevated C-reactive protein. Thyroid gland ultrasonography (USG), anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies were requested, and prednisone was prescribed. Anti-thyroglobulin and anti-TPO antibodies were negative. Thyroid USG showed a solid nodule in the left lobe (approximately 4 cm), classified as TIRADS-4. The patient was sent to the Endocrinology Service, and a thyroid fine needle aspiration was requested.

	- USG prior to the examination evidenced a complete regression of the nodule, which was diagnosed as an inflammatory pseudonodule.

- **Conclusion**: We presented the case of a patient who was treated in a PHC facility for rare findings of SAT secondary to mild COVID-19, concomitant with a thyroid nodule that had complete remission after approximately 3 months.

### Clinicopathology conference: 41-year-old woman with chronic relapsing meningitis [^114ThoMz]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

In 2015, at age 39, several days following a partial thyroidectomy for an incidentally discovered thyroid nodule, the patient developed low back and leg pain, chills, headache, fever, and neck stiffness. She was treated with valacyclovir for possible herpes meningitis, as well as prednisone 60 mg daily for five weeks for arachnoiditis, which led to immediate improvement in symptoms. However, her pain recurred when prednisone was gradually tapered over the following months. She also developed pain with eye movement, urinary frequency and hesitancy, and subjective sensory changes in the left leg distally from the knee.

MRI showed evidence of worsening lumbosacral arachnoiditis with thickening and enhancement of the cauda equina. There was displacement of the cauda equina posteriorly and laterally by a loculated cystlike structure (see Fig 2 A, B). Another lumbar puncture (LP) was performed, but only a small amount of fluid was obtained, possibly due to the loculation. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was bloody, with 1,075 red blood cells (RBC)/μl and 9 white blood cells (WBC)/μl (78% lymphocytes, 22% neutrophils), elevated glucose (179 mg/dl), and low protein (13 mg/dl). Cryptococcal antigen and fungal cultures were negative. A whole body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) CT scan was normal. The etiology of the arachnoiditis was thought to be postinfectious or autoimmune.

She was treated with a three-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisone, resulting in dramatic improvement. However, pain, neck stiffness, and fever recurred when steroids were tapered several weeks later.

### Establishing a diagnostic scale of subacute thyroiditis without radioisotope scanning [^111tSwGr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we established a diagnostic scale for SAT without the need for radioisotope scanning for the first time. It is an excellent and easy way to diagnose SAT. Although it cannot fully replace radioisotope scanning, it has good application in institutions that have no access to radioisotope machines or in pregnant and lactating women.

### Thyroiditis: Evaluation and treatment [^115covMJ]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Thyroiditis is a general term for inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common forms of thyroiditis encountered by family physicians include Hashimoto, postpartum, and subacute. Most forms of thyroiditis result in a triphasic disease pattern of thyroid dysfunction. Patients will have an initial phase of hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) attributed to the release of preformed thyroid hormone from damaged thyroid cells, followed by hypothyroidism when the thyroid stores are depleted, and then eventual restoration of normal thyroid function. Some patients may develop permanent hypothyroidism.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that presents with or without signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, often with a painless goiter, and is associated with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism are generally treated with lifelong thyroid hormone therapy. Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within one year of delivery, miscarriage, or medical abortion.

Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory disease characterized by anterior neck pain. Treatment of subacute thyroiditis should focus on symptoms. In the hyperthyroid phase, beta-blockers can treat adrenergic symptoms. In the hypothyroid phase, treatment is generally not necessary but may be used in patients with signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism or permanent hypothyroidism. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids are indicated for the treatment of thyroid pain. Certain drugs may induce thyroiditis, such as amiodarone.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis: Time to change the diagnostic criteria: Case reports and a review of the literature [^116iwSSk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Several cancers metastasize to the thyroid. According to recent literature, the most common malignancies that metastasize to the thyroid gland are renal cell carcinoma (48.1%), colorectal carcinoma (10.4%), lung carcinoma (8.3%), breast carcinoma (7.8%), and sarcoma (4.0%). Metastases to the thyroid are more common in women than men, with a female to male ratio of 1.4. In most instances, the diagnosis of primary cancer is made many months before the diagnosis of thyroid metastases. In approximately 20% of cases, the diagnosis of the primary tumour and its metastases to the thyroid is synchronous.

In very rare instances, as in our Patient No. 1, metastasis is the first symptom of advanced cancer. Patient No. 1 exhibited symptoms highly suggestive of subacute thyroiditis (SAT), resulting in a three-week delay in diagnosis. In cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastases, even the slightest delay in diagnosis is associated with a dramatic deterioration of prognosis and a shortening of survival. The thyroid is an extremely rare site for NSCLC metastases, with the most common sites being the brain, bone, liver, adrenal glands, contralateral lung, and distant lymph nodes. Other sites are defined as uncommon, comprising less than 5% of all metastases. Niu et al. reported that NSCLC thyroid metastases account for only 0.07% of all metastases from this cancer. Our Patient No. 1 is among the very few cases reported to date. A similar case was described only by Boukir et al, who reported a 51-year-old woman with a hard, well-defined, painful swelling in the left lobe, which also proved to be NSCLC metastasis.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis: Time to change the diagnostic criteria: Case reports and a review of the literature [^117XLkFf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is based mainly on the presence of painful thyroid goitre and a significant increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Proceeding according to these diagnostic criteria may lead to an incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Extremely dangerous is the situation when the diagnosis of SAT is erroneously made based on criteria other than ultrasound (US) image and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), which leads to delayed diagnosis of malignant tumour with poor prognosis.

- **Case presentation**: Five patients with typical SAT symptoms are presented. In all of them, anaplastic thyroid cancer or metastatic thyroid tumours were finally diagnosed as the cause of the initial symptoms resembling SAT. Most of the patients were initially misdiagnosed, and the proper diagnosis of malignancy was delayed.

- **Conclusions**: The authors have proposed new diagnostic criteria for SAT, and strongly suggest that thyroid gland US should be included in the main criteria of SAT diagnosis, together with FNAB result excluding the presence of malignant tumour.

### Subacute thyroiditis manifesting as a thyroid mass, vocal cord paralysis, and hypercalcemia [^113Sb75e]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To report a case of subacute thyroiditis manifesting as a thyroid mass, vocal cord paralysis, and hypercalcemia, we describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings in a patient with an unusual clinical course of subacute thyroiditis.

A 65-year-old woman presented with a hoarse voice and an enlarging tender mass on the right side of her neck. On admission, thyroid function was consistent with thyrotoxicosis from subacute thyroiditis. Laboratory studies showed a corrected serum calcium concentration of 11.4 mg/dL, intact parathyroid hormone of 125 pg/mL, 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 12 ng/mL, and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. Computed tomography of the neck without contrast showed a heterogeneous mass in the right side of the neck accompanied by deviation of the trachea from right to left, but without invasion of the trachea. Thyroid ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous mass in the right thyroid lobe measuring 4.7 cm by 5.5 cm by 4.5 cm. Flexible laryngoscopy showed right vocal cord paralysis.

Treatment with a course of prednisone led to normalization of the serum calcium level, improvement in her voice, and reduction in the size of the thyroid mass. Four months after initial presentation, the patient's thyroid hormone levels became normal, she was clinically euthyroid, and her voice fully recovered. Her serum calcium concentration was normal at 9.8 mg/dL, with a near-normal parathyroid hormone level of 90 pg/mL. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D and creatinine values were also normal.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: Case reports and a review of the literature [^114aUeLL]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the largest group of patients with thyroid anaplastic cancers mimicking SAT described so far.

The issue of distinguishing the causes of painful goitre, which accompanies other features of SAT, is scarcely discussed in the literature. Meier and Nagle reported on a 49-year-old man with severe pain in an enlarged left thyroid lobe, which was firm and tender. Lab results revealed an ESR of 50 mm/h and features of thyrotoxicosis. The diagnosis of SAT was made, and the patient was treated with prednisone in high doses, resulting in initial clinical improvement. However, after 10 days, his pain worsened, and FNAB was performed, revealing purulent material. The large, painful abscess appeared to arise from an extension of laryngeal carcinoma. This case, as well as our Patient No. 2 presented above, are important examples illustrating that a thyroid abscess in an adult should always trigger diagnostic alertness, as it is often the first symptom of advanced cancer disease. It should also be emphasized that a neck abscess is extremely difficult to distinguish from SAT based solely on clinical symptoms and ESR; thus, ultrasound (US) is mandatory in all cases.

### Subacute thyroiditis after COVID-19: A literature review [^111zKxmD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has devastated the world since its emergence in 2019. Although the leading cause of death associated with COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome, other complications have been reported, including acute kidney injury, pulmonary embolism, acute myocarditis, and septic shock.

Currently, subacute thyroiditis (SAT), potentially invoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been reported as a possible complication associated with COVID-19. SAT can be caused by multiple triggers, including viral infection, post-inflammatory processes, and autoimmunity. Patients with SAT exhibit fever, neck pain, a tender diffuse goiter, and abnormalities in serum thyroid hormones. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of SAT after COVID-19 remain incompletely defined.

In the present study, we gathered information on SAT after COVID-19 from case reports available in digital databases and described its clinical practice patterns, clinical symptoms, and outcomes. We aimed to examine the collected data on SAT after COVID-19 to further understand the relationship between SAT and COVID-19.

### Establishing a diagnostic scale of subacute thyroiditis without radioisotope scanning [^111KpKuG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis is a non-bacterial inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, comprising nearly 3–6% of all thyroid lesions. The diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical manifestations, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Tissue diagnosis is not routine, but only necessary in rare cases such as in differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Typically, SAT has three stages: thyrotoxicosis stage, hypothyroid stage, and normal thyroid function stage. However, patients may present at any stage, and the clinical manifestations may not appear in a typical way, which complicates diagnosis.

Furthermore, a study showed that most laboratory results associated with thyrotoxicosis reach abnormal levels within three weeks after onset. However, longer time-lags can exist between the onset of clinical symptoms and the appearance of abnormal laboratory findings in patients with SAT. Therefore, elevated thyroid hormone levels and suppressed uptake of Technetium-99m (99m-Tc) or 131I at the same time play a significant role in diagnosing. However, radioisotope scanning is not always available in every hospital and is sometimes contraindicated in specific situations, such as in pregnant or lactating women. Consequently, we developed and internally validated a diagnostic scale for SAT without the need for radioisotope scanning.

### Ct and MR imaging findings associated with subacute thyroiditis [^113oGxBx]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis is an uncommon disease that occurs most often in women in their second to fifth decades of life. This disease usually presents with thyroid tenderness, a low-grade fever, and occasional dysphagia. The disease resolves spontaneously, usually without thyroid function abnormalities. We herein present the CT and MR imaging findings of two cases of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis.

### Subacute thyroiditis with airway compromise in a 5-year-old boy [^111P9LjV]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old boy presented with intermittent fever for one month, painful neck swelling associated with dysphagia, and hoarseness of voice for three weeks, along with dyspnoea of one-day duration. On evaluation, he had elevated serum thyroglobulin levels and inflammatory markers. Neck ultrasonography showed diffuse glandular thyroid enlargement with hypoechoic areas. Fine-needle aspiration cytology suggested subacute thyroiditis (SAT), and MRI of the neck confirmed narrowing of the trachea due to the enlarged thyroid. He received steroids to relieve airway compression, and levothyroxine was started. On follow-up, he was symptom-free and euthyroid, leading to the discontinuation of steroids and levothyroxine. SAT presenting with tracheal compression is rare in children, highlighting the need to identify the type of thyroiditis to determine the appropriate treatment modality.

### Acute suppurative thyroiditis with thyroid abscess in adults: Clinical presentation, treatment and outcomes [^111va8vo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) is an infection in the thyroid gland progressing to an abscess. This is a serious, rare, and potentially fatal condition. Due to the encasement of the gland, its rich blood supply, high iodine content, and good lymphatic drainage, the thyroid is relatively resistant to most infections. AST comprises less than 1% of thyroid diseases. In children, this often occurs secondary to local congenital anatomic defects, such as third or fourth branchial arch anomalies or a piriform sinus fistula. Only 8% of AST cases occur in adults.

Individuals with Hashimoto's disease, large goiters, or thyroid cancer could be predisposed, but AST may also arise through hematogenous or lymphatic spread or by iatrogenic infections following fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA). Multiple pathogens have been implicated, mainly Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci species, but also tuberculosis (sometimes in combination with HIV), brucellosis, candida, salmonella, and anaerobes such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Hodgkin lymphoma, and other immunocompromised conditions may be more vulnerable.

Clinically, patients with AST present with fever, neck pain, and a sore throat, which can be painful during swallowing, as well as dysphagia, increased C-reactive protein (CRP), measurable thyroglobulin, and positive cultures from drainage or blood. However, neither elevated CRP nor increased thyroglobulin are diagnostic. The latter is helpful in identifying the thyroid as a site of inflammation or infection but is not a specific marker for AST. Differential diagnoses include subacute or chronic thyroiditis.

### Thyroid primary and metastatic malignant tumours of poor prognosis may mimic subacute thyroiditis - time to change the diagnostic criteria: case reports and a review of the literature [^1154iuQB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Typical symptoms of subacute thyroiditis are neck pain and thyroid tenderness, which are accompanied by significantly elevated ESR. Pain can affect the whole thyroid or only one lobe, and the location of the pain can change over time. The occupied part of the thyroid gland is usually enlarged and hard in consistency. The inflammation causes the destruction of thyroid follicles and a release of thyroid hormones into the blood, which, in turn, results in an elevation of free thyroid hormones and a reduction of TSH levels. Follicular cell damage causes impaired transport of iodine, so RAIU is low in the affected parts of the thyroid.

However, there are other aetiologies of painful goitre, including primary fast-growing thyroid neoplasms or thyroid metastases. Rapid enlargement of the thyroid causes painful stretching of the gland capsule. Very aggressive tumours quickly infiltrate surrounding tissues, including neck muscles, which also causes pain with exactly the same radiation as in SAT. These tumours, similar to the inflammation in SAT, are hard in consistency. Rapidly growing primary thyroid carcinomas, including mainly very poorly prognostic anaplastic cancer, are characterized by a fulminant course of the disease, and delayed diagnoses — even a week or two — can dramatically reduce the patient's life expectancy and deteriorate life quality. Thyroid metastases can also grow rapidly, stretching the capsule and infiltrating surrounding tissues, which result in the same neck pain.

Thyroid abscess is difficult to distinguish from SAT.

### Subacute thyroiditis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^116sZiHr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease of viral or postviral origin. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, China, and has spread rapidly worldwide, severely affecting Italy.

- **Objective**: The objective of this work is to report the first case of SAT related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Methods**: We describe the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of an 18-year-old woman who presented with fever, neck pain radiating to the jaw, and palpitations 15 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 via an oropharyngeal swab. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had been mild, and she had completely recovered in a few days.

- **Results**: Upon physical examination, the patient exhibited a slightly increased heart rate and a painful, enlarged thyroid upon palpation. Laboratory exams revealed high levels of free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine, undetectable thyrotropin, and elevated inflammatory markers and white blood cell count. A neck ultrasound detected bilateral and diffuse hypoechoic areas. Both thyroid function and imaging were normal one month earlier. We diagnosed SAT, and the patient started on prednisone. Neck pain and fever resolved within 2 days, and the remaining symptoms improved within 1 week. Thyroid function and inflammatory markers normalized in 40 days.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of SAT following a SARS-CoV-2 infection and alert clinicians to additional, unreported clinical manifestations associated with COVID-19.

### Serum selenium levels and subacute thyroiditis: Associations with disease course and long-term outcomes in a case-control study [^111teRv5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This case-control study recruited a total of 59 patients diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis (SAT) and 50 healthy volunteers from the Endocrinology and Metabolism Outpatient Clinic. The patients ranged in age from 20 to 73 years, with a mean age of 40.41 ± 13.14 years in the control group, and from 30 to 78 years, with a mean age of 44.36 ± 11.01 years in the SAT group. SAT was diagnosed based on the 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines, using medical history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and thyroid ultrasonography results.

SAT was suspected in patients presenting with anterior neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears, fever, and tenderness and pain in the thyroid lobe during physical examination. It has long been recognized that no significant differences exist among various pain measurement methods when assessing pain. Given its ease of application, we opted for the numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).

Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis, and thyrotoxicosis were accepted as laboratory values consistent with SAT. Focal or diffuse, hypoechoic-heterogeneous areas with reduced vascularity that were painful when probed by ultrasound were considered indicative of SAT. The control group consisted of individuals who underwent a check-up during the same period and had no pathology detected in their test results.

Prior to study inclusion, participants were screened for the presence of chronic diseases and previous thyroid diseases.

### Localized subacute thyroiditis presenting as a painful hot nodule [^113GwwCb]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis, giant-cell thyroiditis, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, is a spontaneously remitting inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland. It is generally caused by viral infection and is the most common cause of a painful thyroid. Patients usually have a history of antecedent viral infection and subsequently suffer from neck pain, thyroid tenderness, fever, and fatigue. Upon physical examination, the thyroid of the patient is often tender and diffusely enlarged.

In most cases, a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis is usually self-evident and can be made based on patient history, physical and laboratory findings, and the clinical course of the disease. In some cases, in addition to the clinical course and features, fine needle aspiration cytology, ultrasound, and scintigraphy analyses may support the diagnosis. For example, thyroid radioisotope scanning generally demonstrates a low uptake of Technetium-99m (99m-Tc) or 131I.

However, patients with subacute thyroiditis sometimes present with puzzling clinical features that can escape early recognition. Here, a patient with subacute thyroiditis, who presented with a solitary painful thyroid nodule in the absence of typical laboratory test characteristics that would suggest subacute thyroiditis and whose 99m-Tc thyroid scan revealed a hot nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid, is described. To the best of our knowledge, the presence of a hot nodule in a patient with subacute thyroiditis has not been previously documented.
