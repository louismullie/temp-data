## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which of the four trigonometric relations always hold for a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, and how many of them are universally valid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core property of cyclic quadrilaterals that constrains opposite angles. Then, I should verify each relation against that property, being careful about sign conventions and edge cases. Finally, I will count how many relations are always true and select the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental property. In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary, so A + C = 180° and B + D = 180°. This is the key constraint that will drive whether each trigonometric identity holds universally [^notfound].

> Now, relation (1): sin A = sin C. Wait, let me verify this. Since A + C = 180°, we have C = 180° − A, and sin(180° − A) = sin A, so sin C = sin A. Therefore, relation (1) always holds for any cyclic quadrilateral [^notfound].

> Next, relation (2): sin A + sin C = 0. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. From above, sin C = sin A, so sin A + sin C = 2 sin A, which equals zero only when sin A = 0, i.e., when A is 0° or 180°. But angles in a quadrilateral must be strictly between 0° and 180°, so sin A ≠ 0 and this sum is not zero in general. Thus, relation (2) does not always hold [^notfound].

> I will now examine relation (3): cos B + cos D = 0. Let me think about this carefully. Since B + D = 180°, we have D = 180° − B, and cos(180° − B) = −cos B, so cos D = −cos B, which means cos B + cos D = cos B − cos B = 0. Therefore, relation (3) always holds for any cyclic quadrilateral [^notfound].

> Finally, relation (4): cos B = cos D. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might be true because opposite angles are supplementary, but I should double-check. Using D = 180° − B, we get cos D = −cos B, so cos B = cos D would imply cos B = −cos B, which means cos B = 0. That only happens when B is 90°, so equality holds only in special cases, not universally. Thus, relation (4) does not always hold [^notfound].

> Let me summarize and count. Relations (1) and (3) are always true, whereas relations (2) and (4) are not universally true. Therefore, exactly two relations always hold, and the correct choice is (B) two [^notfound].

The correct answer is **(B) two**. In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary, so (A + C = 180^\\circ) and (B + D = 180^\\circ). This implies:

- **Relation (1)**: (\\sin A = \\sin C) always holds because (\\sin(180^\\circ - x) = \\sin x).
- **Relation (3)**: (\\cos B + \\cos D = 0) always holds because (\\cos(180^\\circ - x) = -\\cos x).
- **Relation (2)**: (\\sin A + \\sin C = 0) only if (\\sin A = 0), which is not true for a general quadrilateral.
- **Relation (4)**: (\\cos B = \\cos D) only if (\\cos B = 0), which is not generally true.

Thus, only **relations (1) and (3) always hold**.

## Geometric properties of cyclic quadrilaterals

A cyclic quadrilateral is a four-sided polygon whose vertices lie on a single circle. The key property is that **opposite angles are supplementary**, i.e.:

[
A + C = 180^\\circ \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B + D = 180^\\circ
]

This property is fundamental to analyzing the trigonometric relations given in the problem.

---

## Analysis of trigonometric relations

### Relation (1): (\\sin A = \\sin C)

Using the supplementary property, (C = 180^\\circ - A), so:

[
\\sin C = \\sin(180^\\circ - A) = \\sin A
]

Therefore, **(\\sin A = \\sin C) always holds** in a cyclic quadrilateral.

---

### Relation (2): (\\sin A + \\sin C = 0)

From above, (\\sin C = \\sin A), so:

[
\\sin A + \\sin C = \\sin A + \\sin A = 2\\sin A
]

This equals zero only if (\\sin A = 0), which implies (A = 0^\\circ) or (180^\\circ). These are degenerate cases for a quadrilateral, so **this relation does not generally hold**.

---

### Relation (3): (\\cos B + \\cos D = 0)

Using the supplementary property, (D = 180^\\circ - B), so:

[
\\cos D = \\cos(180^\\circ - B) = -\\cos B
]

Thus:

[
\\cos B + \\cos D = \\cos B - \\cos B = 0
]

Therefore, **(\\cos B + \\cos D = 0) always holds** in a cyclic quadrilateral.

---

### Relation (4): (\\cos B = \\cos D)

From above, (\\cos D = -\\cos B), so:

[
\\cos B = \\cos D \\implies \\cos B = -\\cos B \\implies 2\\cos B = 0 \\implies \\cos B = 0
]

This requires (B = 90^\\circ), which is not generally true. Thus, **this relation does not generally hold**.

---

## Summary of results

| **Relation** | **Always holds?** | **Reason** |
|-|-|-|
| (1) (\\sin A = \\sin C) | Yes | (\\sin(180^\\circ - x) = \\sin x) |
| (2) (\\sin A + \\sin C = 0) | No | Only if (\\sin A = 0) (degenerate) |
| (3) (\\cos B + \\cos D = 0) | Yes | (\\cos(180^\\circ - x) = -\\cos x) |
| (4) (\\cos B = \\cos D) | No | Only if (\\cos B = 0) (special case) |

## Conclusion

Only **relations (1) and (3) always hold** in a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, the correct answer is **(B) two**.

a Comparison between mechanical metamaterials composed of homogeneous elements and heterogeneous elements: mutually non-transformable behavior is observed within single-element (either red-colored complete–elastic C or blue-colored rigid–elastic R) periodic homogeneous metamaterials. Conversely, the C or R functional group composed of one C and one R elements can mutually transform. Deformation occurs exclusively along the normal direction of the colored solid element sidelines. Design and construction of triangular and quadrilateral ring metamaterial employ alternating heterogeneous C and R elements. Symbols Ω and Γ, respectively, represent the angular relationship between adjacent elements within ring metamaterials. Ring metamaterials (C ring and R ring) composed of corresponding functional groups can interconvert. Periodic homogeneous metamaterials composed of C or R-ring metamaterials can also interconvert, thereby establishing interchangeability of stress–strain relationships between C and R metamaterials. b The schematic of multimode deformation of designed mechanical metamaterials with an example of the quadrilateral ring (light cyan area). Contraction and expansion deformations are shown in dark green and dark yellow blocks, respectively.

Dynamic videos

We demonstrated the capability of our system for dynamic imaging in two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, the imaged object was a resolution target that was manually scanned in the vertical direction. Imaging was performed with rectangular illumination patterns with 101 × 103 (N = 10,403) pixels, where the imaging speed was 72 frames per second (fps). In the second scenario, freely moving C. elegans wormswere imaged at 10 fps with hexagonal illumination patterns, where the imaged region was approximately circular and contained N = 25,111 pixels. The reconstruction time for a single image ranged from 1.5 ms (for N = 10,403) to 4 ms (for N = 25,111) of a CPU without parallelization, i.e. shorter than the acquisition time. The full captured videos are found in Supplementary Videos 1–3, whereas snapshots of the videos are presented in Fig. 4. Full details on the captured videos are described in Supplementary Note 10.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^325fb91c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,… Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### Emergent geometry and duality in the carbon nucleus [^66b35170]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The carbon atom provides the backbone for the complex organic chemistry composing the building blocks of life. The physics of the carbon nucleus in its predominant isotope, 12 C, is similarly full of multifaceted complexity. Here we provide a model-independent density map of the geometry of the nuclear states of 12 C using the ab initio framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory. We find that the well-known but enigmatic Hoyle state is composed of a "bent-arm" or obtuse triangular arrangement of alpha clusters. We identify all of the low-lying nuclear states of 12 C as having an intrinsic shape composed of three alpha clusters forming either an equilateral triangle or an obtuse triangle. The states with the equilateral triangle formation also have a dual description in terms of particle-hole excitations in the mean-field picture.

### A topological mechanism for robust and efficient global oscillations in biological networks [^93774d6e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The "internal" state variable s, given by compass directions N–E–S–W, labels which of the four external transitions the system is primed for. For example, in the W state, the system is most likely to go through the westward external transition that decrements x. Within each phosphorylation level (x, y), we model transitions between internal states in a cyclic manner, with transition rates γ in and slower reverse rates(gray dashed arrows in Fig. 1 b). In the KaiABC system, the vertical internal transitions stem from conformational changes of the A-loop, where the A-loop is denoted as a blue square when exposed and as a purple circle when buried (Fig. 1 b). The top (N → W) and left (W → S) transitions are facilitated by KaiB binding and unbinding, respectively. The bottom transition (S → E) is catalyzed by KaiA, represented by a curved arrow. As a single KaiA dimer binds and unbinds several times during each phosphorylation, it acts as a catalyst, consistent with the treatment of KaiA in previous models. The intermediate KaiA-bound states are coarse-grained out of the model and not shown.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### A reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial with origami functional-group transformation and ring reconfiguration [^822abd85]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Recent advancements in reprogrammable metamaterials have enabled the development of intelligent matters with variable special properties in situ. These metamaterials employ intra-element physical reconfiguration and inter-element structural transformation. However, existing mono-characteristic homo-element mechanical metamaterials have limited reprogramming functions. Here, we introduce a reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial composed of origami elements with heterogeneous mechanical properties, which achieves various mechanical behavior patterns by functional group transformations and ring reconfigurations. Through the anisotropic assembly of two heterogeneous elements into a functional group, we enable mechanical behavior switching between positive and negative stiffness. The resulting polygonal ring exhibits rotational deformation, zero Poisson's ratio stretching/compression deformation, and negative Poisson's ratio auxetic deformation. Arranging these rings periodically yields homogeneous metamaterials. The reconfiguration of quadrilateral rings allows for continuous fine-tunability of the mechanical response and negative Poisson's ratio. This mechanical metamaterial could provide a versatile material platform for reprogrammable mechanical computing, multi-purpose robots, transformable vehicles and architectures at different scales.

### Russian doll genes and complex chromosome rearrangements in… [^50fd727f]. G3 (2018). Low credibility.

Graphical representations of scrambled loci

These representations highlight different aspects of chromosomal rearrangement topologies. For the analysis of nested chromosomes we filtered the data to consider only cases with scrambled or nonscrambled MDSs for multiple MAC contigs (nanochromosomes) that derive from a single MIC region. Figure 1A shows a schematic view of the MIC (precursor) and MAC (product) versions of such a locus, and the correspondence between MDSs and pointers. In addition, we include a condensed linear sequence representation of the MDSs (Figure 1B), a self-intersecting line corresponding to the MIC region that indicates the topological orientation of the product in a single trace (Figure 1C), and a chord diagram representation of the pointer list for one of the MAC chromosomes (Figure 1D).

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

### Engineering zero modes in transformable mechanical metamaterials [^72a519fa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Differing the three orthogonal directions in the tessellation is unnecessary and therefore, we can obtain ten distinctive extremal metamaterials, whose zero-mode numbers and the corresponding origami tessellations are demonstrated in Fig. 3c. Furthermore, the transformation among all ten tessellations can be realized by maneuvering the predefined folding angles (θ i) in each elementary linkage simultaneously (see Supplementary Movie 4). To analyze the ten metamaterials, we first choose the null-mode (N = 0, all-grey circle), tri-mode (N = 3, all-blue circle) and hexa-mode (N = 6, all-red circle), which also form the body diagonal of the cubic space in Fig. 3b. Close examination on the three tessellations reveals that all elementary linkages are in CF, CE or PF configuration and therefore, supports 3×0, 3×1 or 3×2 zero modes, respectively. It is noticed that the hexa-mode metamaterial cannot stand any type of loads and therefore, behaves like a nearly gaseous state. Next, we choose the ones marked by bi-colored circles, which are one uni-mode (1), two bi-modes (2, 2′), two quadra-modes (4, 4′) and one penta-mode (5). It can be found that all six metamaterials are constructed by combining linkages with two of the three configurations and therefore, support mixed compressive or/and pure shear zero modes. The only one with tri-colored circle is the tri-mode (3′) which is discussed in Fig. 2c. The detailed analysis of the corresponding zero modes via homogenization method can be found in Supplementary Note 5. In Fig. 3d, we perform experimental validations on the ten extremal metamaterials with a 3D printed 4x4x4 tessellation which can be transformed among all ten extremal metamaterials. A video demonstration of the tessellation transformation can be found in Supplementary Movie 5. Their effective moduli are obtained from the experimental measurements (see Supplementary Note 6) and the homogenization method (see Supplementary Note 5). Good agreement between the two results has been observed to prove the number of zero modes. We also conduct FE-based studies to validate the decoupled orthogonal mechanism design and evaluate the effects of different geometrical properties on the transformable metamaterial (see Supplementary Note 7). It can be concluded that the number of zero modes depends majorly on the folding angles, while both the thickness of the hinge h 0 and the length of the rhombus L 0 have little effect on the number of zero modes.

### Shaping the topology of folding pathways in mechanical systems [^eb462be7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Only the desired mode is stable in the neighborhood of the flat state but it can be significantly distorted by the stiff creases. As shown in Fig. 2, with stiff creases, the desired mode is of nonzero energy ("Energy distortion") and can also have distorted folding angles ("Geometric distortion", defined by one minus the normalized dot product of the desired mode and the obtained minimum). We wish to formulate design principles for choosing stiffness profiles κ i, consistent with the above constraints, that best facilitate designed folding motions.

We devise two design strategies: (1) minimizing energy of the desired mode (energy optimization) and (2) minimizing geometric distortion of the desired mode (geometric optimization). We find that different crease stiffness profiles generally trade-off energy and geometric distortion.

Energy optimization is simple: the desired mode has non-zero energybecause of crease stiffness. As this function is linear in κ i, optimization subject to the saddle-node constraints equations (2) and (3) is equivalent to a Linear Programming (LP) problem,:

LP problems are solved in polynomial time, as long as an efficient algorithm is used. Further, the optimal stiffness profile κ i is generically guaranteed to be sparse. In a 4-vertex, only one crease needs to be stiff.

Geometric distortion is minimized if fold angles in the surviving minimum with stiff creases closely corresponds to the fold angles ρ D of the desired mode without stiff creases. Here, we use the gradient of the energy with stiff creases, but evaluated at ρ D, as a proxy for such geometric distortion. As shown in Supplementary Note 4, this proxy, after projecting out the component of the gradient in the ρ D direction, is F QP is a positive semidefinite quadratic function of κ i. Optimization of F QP — with the linear constraints in Eqs. (2) and (3) — is facilitated by efficient Quadratic Programming (QP) algorithms.

In practice, the LP and QP prescriptions do well at optimizing their respective strategies (i.e. energy and geometry) for a single vertex. Figure 2c shows how these prescriptions indeed do better than choosing random stiffness profiles that satisfy the constraints. The black linefor positive n, shows that stiffness profiles trade-off energetic and geometric distortion.

### PLANET: an ellipse fitting approach for simultaneous tand tmapping using phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession [^e6c95e83]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Reconstruction Method for Parametric Mapping

Essential to the PLANET method is a three‐step reconstruction algorithm to simultaneously estimate relaxation parameters T 1 and T 2, and an effective banding free magnitudefrom phase‐cycled bSSFP data. However, an additional step is required when the reconstruction of the off‐resonance mapis also desired.

Step 1. Direct linear least squares ellipse fitting to phase‐cycled bSSFP data.

The first step consists of performing voxel‐wise direct linear least squares fitting of a general quadratic polynomial function to the data points in the complex plane 22 :where x and y are real and imaginary components of transverse magnetization.

By minimizing the sum of squared algebraic distances of the ellipse to the data points under a proper scaling and an appropriate constraint specific to ellipses (discriminant– 4C 1 C 3 = −1), we avoid the trivial solution C = 0 and exclude all nonelliptical fits, such as hyperbola and parabola. As a result, we find a unique set of coefficients C = [C 1, C 2, C 3, C 4, C 5, C 6] representing the ellipse. The fitting is based on a numerically stable version of the ellipse fit 24. This is a fast, direct, linear, non‐iterative ellipse fit. Because there are six unknowns, we need at least six data points x, which can be acquired by scanning with at least six different RF phase increment settings.

Step 2. Rotation of the ellipse to initial vertical conic form.

The rotation of data points of the ellipse to the initial vertical form, i.e. the orientation directly after RF excitation pulse, was performed by applying basic algebraic transformations to the polynomial representation of the ellipse found in the previous step (Eq. [6]). We found the rotation angleto be:

Becauseis defined within, we unwrapped it to cover therange by verifying that the ellipse of every voxel is vertical and that its center lies on the positive real axis.

After rotation, illustrated in Figure 2 a, the conic equation for the vertical orientation can be used to describe the ellipse:where (, 0) is the geometrical center of the ellipse, andare the semi‐axes of the ellipse.

### Optical quantum nondemolition measurement of a single rare earth ion qubit [^a483fa77]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Single-shot quantum nondemolition measurement

Next, we focus on using the cavity-enhanced cyclicity to measure the spin state. Figure 3a shows a time trace of photons recorded in a single run of the experiment, with telegraph-like switching between(where transition B is bright) and(where transition A is bright) clearly visible. A continuous estimation of the spin state occupation using a Bayesian estimator applied to the full measurement recordshows clearly resolved quantum jumps between these states, demonstrating the quantum nondemolition nature of the measurement. The quantum jumps are driven by optical pumping from the measurement process itself, because of the finite cyclicity.

The black curve shows the probability to be ininferred from a Bayesian analysis, revealing quantum jumps between the spin states induced by optical pumping. b An adaptive maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm is used to perform successive single-shot spin measurements, with the result of each, independent measurement indicated by a circle [data from dashed box in a]. c Histogram of photon counts for a fixed integration window of 51 ms following initialization using a ML measurement. The horizontal axis is the difference between the number of A and B photons detected in the measurement window.

To demonstrate single-shot measurement of the spin, we use a maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm to estimate the state at time t using photon counts from times. The measurement duration is adaptive: each measurement terminates when a set fidelity threshold or time limit is reached, and a new, independent measurement is begun. The outcome of each measurement is shown by the circles in Fig. 3b. The average measurement fidelity estimated by the ML algorithm is 94.6%, and 91% of consecutive measurements have the same outcome. The average time to complete a measurement is 20 ms, which corresponds to the average time to detect two photons. The optimum fixed measurement window is 51 ms, resulting in a slower measurement with a lower average fidelity of 91.1% (Fig. 3c).

### Algebraic method to synthesize specified modal currents in ladder resonators: application to noncircular birdcage coils [^f3c5a694]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Detectors such as birdcage coils often consist of networks of coupled resonant circuits that must produce specified magnetic field distributions. In many cases, such as quadrature asymmetric insert body coils, calculating the capacitance values required to achieve specified currents and frequencies simultaneously is a challenging task that previously had only approximate or computationally inefficient solutions.

Theory and Methods

A general algebraic method was developed that is applicable to linear networks having planar representations such as birdcage coils, transverse electromagnetic (TEM) coils, and numerous variants of ladder networks. Unlike previous iterative or approximate methods, the algebraic method is computationally efficient and determines current distribution and resonant frequency using a single matrix inversion. The method was demonstrated by specifying irregular current distributions on a highly elliptical birdcage coil at 3 Tesla.

Results

Measurements of the modal frequency spectrum and transmit field distribution of the two specified modes agrees with the theory. Accuracy is limited in practice only by how accurately the matrix of self and mutual inductances of the network is known.

Conclusion

The algebraic method overcomes the inability of the existing inductance equalization method to account for all elements of the inductance matrix and the inability to accommodate modal currents that are not (co)sinusoidal.

### The free energy of mechanically unstable phases [^fe8ff938]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Phase diagrams provide 'roadmaps' to the possible states of matter. Their determination traditionally rests on the assumption that all phases, even unstable ones, have well-defined free energies under all conditions. However, this assumption is commonly violated in condensed phases due to mechanical instabilities. This long-standing problem impedes thermodynamic database development, as pragmatic attempts at solving this problem involve delicate extrapolations that are highly nonunique and that lack an underlying theoretical justification. Here we propose an efficient computational solution to this problem that has a simple interpretation, both as a topological partitioning of atomic configuration space and as a minimally constrained physical system. Our natural scheme smoothly extends the free energy of stable phases, without relying on extrapolation, thus enabling a formal assessment of widely used extrapolation schemes.

### Mapping of 238 quadrilateral plate fractures with three-dimensional computed tomography [^a1fcd76b]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The primary goal of this study is to create a frequency map of a series of the quadrilateral plate fractures, explore the characteristics of fracture map and to further propose a new classification.

Methods

We used a consecutive series of 238 quadrilateral plate fractures to create 3-dimensional reconstruction images, which were superimposed and oriented to fit a model hemipelvis template by aligning specific pelvis landmarks. Fracture lines were identified and traced to create a quadrilateral plate fracture map.

Results

Fracture location corresponded with fracture line distribution. Of 238 fractures that met the criteria for inclusion, most fractures involved the "A + B" zone (n = 156; 65%), whereas the remaining minority of the fractures involved the "A" zone (n = 59; 25%) and the "B" zone (n = 23; 10%). Correspondingly the incidence of C-type fracture ("A + B"zone) was significantly higher than that of A-type fracture and B-type fracture. Additionally the most common pattern was demonstrated by coexisting fracture lines; nearly half (48%) of the fractures involved the upper section of the quadrilateral plate traversing both zones, 46% traced almost vertically to the arcuate line, and 25% extended to the posterior aspect. Furthermore, the high fracture line intensity (n = 172; 74%) formed a Gun-shaped pattern, which pointed to the ischial tuberosity.

Conclusions

The map shows that the comminution is prone to traverse the quadrilateral plate in the sagittal direction among nearly two-thirds of all fractures. Moreover, Surgically treated quadrilateral plate fractures display very common patterns. The most common pattern is the upper fracture in nearly half of the fractures. Knowledge of these patterns can aid surgeons during diagnosis, preoperative planning, and execution of surgical strategies.

### Quantifying entanglement in a 68-billion-dimensional quantum state space [^b339b52f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Adaptive sampling algorithm

For each configuration, experimental data are stored in nodes in a quad-tree decomposition of P whose levels describe increasingly fine detail. The i th node corresponds to a square area ofat locationwith span. Nodes are sampled by placing the corresponding, one-dimensional local patterns on the DMDs and generating a coincidence histogram during acquisition time T a = 0.5 s. Coincidences C i are counted within a 1-ns coincidence window centered on the coincidence peak; accidental coincidences A i are counted in a 1-ns window displaced 2 ns from the coincidence window. Coincidence and accidental values are appended to a list each time the node is sampled. The estimated count rate, whereis a calibrated, relative fiber coupling efficiency. Optionally, A i can be subtracted from C i for accidental removal. Uncertainty is computed by assuming Poissonian counting statistics for C i and A i and applying standard, algebraic propagation of error through the calculation of the entanglement quantity (Eq. (3)).

The data collection algorithm consists of a partitioning phase followed by an iterative phase. During partitioning, the algorithm repeatedly iterates through a scan-list of leaves of the tree. Node i is considered stable when sgn(αR T − R i) is known to at least β standard deviations of certainty, where splitting threshold α (0 ≤ α ≤ 1) and stability criterion β are user-chosen heuristics. Stable nodes are no longer measured. If a node is stable and R i ≥ αR T, the node is split into four equal-sized sub-quadrants, which are initially unstable and added to the scan-list. Optionally, a maximum resolution (maximum tree depth) may be set.

The transition to the iterative phase occurs when the percentage of unstable leaves is < Γ, a user-chosen parameter. At this point, stability is ignored and all leaf nodes are scanned repeatedly and guaranteed to have the same total acquisition time. Various final stopping criteria can be used; we chose a fixed total run time. Note that heuristic parameters α, β, and γ may be changed during operation if desired. For the data shown in this manuscript, α = 0.002, β = 2, and Γ = 0.15 with a 30-h runtime.

The probability distributionis computed by uniformly distributing the estimated count rate (with or without accidental subtraction) from each leaf node across its constituent elements in, followed by normalization.

### The XZZX surface code [^f70f225a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Many approaches for code deformations have been proposed that, in principle, could be implemented in a way to take advantage of structured noise using a tailored surface code. These approaches include braiding punctures –, lattice surgery, and computation with twist defects. We focus on a single example based on lattice surgery as in refs.; see Fig. 7 a. We will provide a high-level overview and leave open all detailed questions of implementation and threshold estimates for fault-tolerant quantum computation to future work.

Details of generalised lattice surgery are given in refs. a Pairs of qubits are encoded on surface codes with six twist defects lying on their boundaries(i).

Red(blue) vertices are initialised in Pauli-X(Pauli-Z) basis. The system is prepared in an eigenstate of the stabilizers shown on the shaded faces, (iii) and the logical Pauli-Z operators, (iv). This initialisation strategy is robust to biased noise. Pauli-Z errors that can occur on red vertices are detected by the shaded faces (v). We can also detect low-rate Pauli-X errors on blue vertices with this method of initialisation (vi). We can decode all of these initialisation errors on this subset of faces using the minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder in the same way we decode the XZZX code as a memory. c The hexon surface code fused to the ancillary surface code to perform a logical Pauli-Y measurement. The lattice surgery procedure introduces a twist in the centre of the lattice. We show the symmetry with respect to the Pauli-Z errors by lightly colored faces. Again, decoding this model in the infinite bias limit is reduced to decoding one-dimensional repetition codes, except at the twist where there is a single branching point.

Results

Forces and torques in MTs

At the heart of FOMT are superparamagnetic beads tethered to a flow cell surface via double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) tethers (Fig. 1a). We use a cylindrical magnet mounted on a motor-controlled vertical linear stage above the surface to apply upward forces to the magnetic beads that stretch the DNA tether. The force exerted on the magnetic beads by the external magnetic field B depends on their total magnetization m(B) and is proportional to the gradient of the magnetic field. In contrast, the torque applied to the beads by the magnetic field depends on the preferred magnetization axis, m 0, and is given by: Γ B = m 0 × B. If B is aligned vertically as in FOMT, m 0 aligns vertically and the torque from the magnet about the z axis, equal to m 0, x B y (or m 0, y B x), is negligible. In contrast, the magnetic fields in conventional MT and MTT have large enough horizontal components to constrain the beads' rotation about the z axis, as a result of which the beads will faithfully follow rotation of the permanent magnets.

Bead fluctuations in the FOMT lie on a circular annulus

The excursions in (x, y) of a magnetic bead tethered by a single dsDNA tether depend strongly on the position of the tether with respect to the axis of the cylindrical magnet (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs S2–S3). When the magnet is far from being centered on the tethered bead, the fluctuations in x and y are uncoupled and Gaussian distributed, similar to the fluctuations observed in conventional MTs (Supplementary Figs S2–S4). As the cylindrical magnet is progressively centered on the magnetic bead, the (x, y) fluctuations become coupled and trace out circular arcs. If the cylindrical magnet is centered on the bead to within ∼10 μm, the torque from the magnets about the z axis is reduced to the point that thermal fluctuations suffice to rotate the bead around its attachment point. Consequently, the fluctuations in (x, y) are strongly coupled and trace out a circular annulus with radius R circle, where R circle is the radial distance between the DNA attachment point and the bead's centre (Fig. 1b, c).

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Experimental nonclassicality in a causal network without assuming freedom of choice [^e83d6c77]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Violation of a causal compatibility inequality

In order to demonstrate the nonclassicality of the experimental data relative to the triangle causal network, we seek to identify some causal inequalities, which must be satisfied by all distributions compatible with the classical triangle network but which are violated by our experimental statistics. To this end, we turn to the inflation technique for causal inference introduced in ref.

As detailed in the Methods, the inflation technique relates compatibility with a given causal structure to feasibility of a linear program (LP). If the LP related to an inflation of(see Fig. 5 (a)) is found to be infeasible, then evidently p is incompatible with. In our case, is taken to be the classical triangle scenario causal structure depicted in Fig. 1 (b).

Inflation technique for the triangle network.

a The second order inflation graph of the triangle network. Such an inflation doubles the number of latent variables relative to the triangle scenario, having six latent variables. The inflation quadruples the number of observable random variables of the triangle scenario, having twelve observable random variables { a (1), b (1), c (1), a (2), b (2), c (2), a (3), b (3), c (3), a (4), b (4), c (4) }. Distributions compatible with this inflated structure satisfy symmetry properties, and have marginals corresponding to products of triangle-compatible distribution. This can be exploited to derive suitable causal compatibility inequalities that are violated by the experimental data. b This plot depicts the 64 × 64 coefficientsfor a quadratic inequality of the form of Eq.

### Giant regular polyhedra from calixarene carboxylates and uranyl [^f27d3ef8]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of large multi-component systems is a common strategy for the bottom-up construction of discrete, well-defined, nanoscopic-sized cages. Icosahedral or pseudospherical viral capsids, built up from hundreds of identical proteins, constitute typical examples of the complexity attained by biological self-assembly. Chemical versions of the so-called 5 Platonic regular or 13 Archimedean semi-regular polyhedra are usually assembled combining molecular platforms with metals with commensurate coordination spheres. Here we report novel, self-assembled cages, using the conical-shaped carboxylic acid derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[5]arene as ligands, and the uranyl cation UO(2)2+ as a metallic counterpart, which coordinates with three carboxylates at the equatorial plane, giving rise to hexagonal bipyramidal architectures. As a result, octahedral and icosahedral anionic metallocages of nanoscopic dimensions are formed with an unusually small number of components.

The first three rows show respectively the developed, partially folded, and one of the (multiple) lock states. The last two rows show the in-plane tessellation and their paperboard proof-of-concepts. The latter are multilayered spatial realizations obtained with the minimum number of layers, i.e. an even number of layers preserving their symmetry with respect to x-y plane, that provides one degree of freedom. Rubber bands are here used to hold the unloaded configuration of the prototypes in their lock state, as the transition to the lock state requires the application of compressive forces in the x - y plane, as explained later in the manuscript. Scale bars = 30 mm.

The fold lines of both V and M panels enable the system to act as a kinematic chain, in short, "unit chain". We define its configurational changes (Fig. 1a) using m independent dihedral angles θ 1, θ 2,… Each dihedral angle specifies the convex angle between the triangular panel and its adjacent quad panel (Fig. 1a), and m denotes the mobility or nontrivial (term hereafter dropped) DoFs excluding rigid-body motions. We also assume the mountain and valley fold lines are constrained to remain on two parallel planes during folding. Explained later, this strategy is enforced through unit chain stacking, and it enables folding with a single DoF. In this case, the out-of-plane rise, h, is expressed as a function of three geometric parameters by:

### Sphere of arbitrarily polarized exceptional points with a single planar metasurface [^1d03c06b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Topological properties of arbitrary EP

We previously showed that an EP-induced reflection zero enables us to accumulate a topological phase covering the fullrange by encircling the EP within a rationally chosen two-dimensional parameter space. In the following, we demonstrate that relying on the topological phase accumulated while encircling an EP exhibiting arbitrarily polarized eigenstate (linearly, circularly, and elliptically polarized cases correspond to the first, second, and third column in Fig. 2, respectively), we can manipulate the phase of light on a single polarization channel for any arbitrary polarization with a single metasurface by varying incidence conditions. To observe the EP complex-square-root dependency of the eigenvalue surfaces, we plot the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues in the two-dimensional parameter space of, corresponding to the rotation angles of the two metallic nanorods. These two parameters are expected to control the co- and cross-polarization ratio. By sweeping them in the vicinity of the parameters corresponding to the EP with linearly polarized eigenstates, the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the reflection matrix present two intersecting Riemann surfaces, which coalesce at the EP (See Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Furthermore, at the intersecting point, the reflection coefficient ofcomponent is zero (singularity), as shown in Fig. 3a, consistent with the EP nature of this coalescence point. As we previously pointed out, we obtain a phase winding around the EP singularity that realizes a fullphase coverage, of interest for the design of polarization-converting metasurfaces. It should be noted that due to its topological nature, the accumulated phase always coversregardless of the trajectory followed in parameter space, as long as the loop encircles the conversion zero in reflection. EP-induced topological phase can thus be employed for hologram construction by choosing four unit-cell designs sufficiently far away enough from the zero point to have higher efficiency, corresponding to four different rotation angles around the singularity center (indicated by the black triangles in Fig. 3a). EPs with circularly polarized coalesced eigenstates are also realized, as presented in the second column of Fig. 3, where we obtain similar degeneracy of eigenvalues and an equivalent topological phase pattern (Fig. 3b). For completeness, the last column shows an example of EP with elliptically polarized coalesced eigenstates, characterized by. The topological phase still shows the 2winding, as shown in Fig. 3c. It is worth mentioning that, for a fixed geometry, other arbitrarily polarized topological phases can also be realized under different incident conditions. In contrast, the other anti-diagonal channel of the reflection matrix reveals no topological phase, as illustrated in Fig. 3d–f, corresponding to the EPs showing linear, circular, and elliptical polarization, respectively. Overall, this demonstrates that the topological phase accompanying an EP in a two-dimensional parameter space can be designed to act on any arbitrary polarization state and, thus, allows to modulate the wavefront of any polarization. With the detailed four structures around each EP summarized in Fig. 3g (black triangles in Fig. 3a–f), a 2phase variation can be covered and used for wavefront manipulation. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3h. Building on this design versatility and exploiting the 2phase acquired by beams of adequate polarization when encircling EPs with coalesced eigenstate of the same polarization, we can fabricate a single metasurface simultaneously displaying EPs for three different polarizations (linear, circular, and elliptical). In the following section, we illustrate this by spectrally and spatially monitoring the occurrence of zeros in one anti-diagonal Jones matrix component, while the other components are nonzero. In the last section, we combine the full capabilities of our approach to produce one and the same meta-holograms generated thanks to the 2ET phase for three different polarizations (illustration shown in Fig. 3i).

### Exploring multistability in prismatic metamaterials through local actuation [^070d02ec]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Compression test

To verify the numerical model we performed an experimental compression test on a prismatic structure based on a cuboctahedron. Here, we describe the simulation of the compression test that we used as a comparison. In our simulations, we use a stiffness ratio of. We select two opposite faces on the structure, and apply constraints to the vertices that mimic the clamping in experiments. To do so, we only allow deformation of the vertices along the compression axis. We then create two additional edges parallel to the loading axis, and use them to connect both clamped faces. We use these edges to compress the structure by stepwise reducing their length and penalizing the energy according towhereis the stiffness of the edges used to compressed the structure. We assign a stiffness that is much larger than the edge stretching stiffness and the hinge stiffness, so that effectively we are performing a displacement controlled compression.

In the simulation, we compress the structure in 1000 steps, after which we stepwise remove the loading in the same number of steps. For each increment we allow the structure to relax with the specified constraints, while using previously mentioned optimization tool with the 'Active-set' algorithm.

To obtain the reaction force, during loading, we take the derivative of the elastic energy with respect to the displacement along the loading axis (z-axis), and findwhere we iterate through all the steps of the simulation to obtain the numerical gradient. Furthermore, we normalize the force by the weighted average of the stiffness defined bywhere, andare the total number of edges, diagonals and hinges, respectively.

Hinge selection reduction

The prismatic structures studied here are highly symmetric, resulting from the underlying uniform polyhedra used as templates. Therefore, we developed a method to exploit these symmetries in order to reduce the search space to find stable states. Note that to determine unique selections of actuated hinges we consider only the edges of the internal polyhedron. In this section we will start from the polyhedron, and create a directed graph that represents the edges and their connectivity. Next, we determine the minimum distance matrix from the graph, from which we extract all principal sub-matrices that represent the hinge selections. In the remaining part of this section we explain our method in more detail, and as an example, apply it to a prismatic structure based on a triangular prism.

### Designing a biomechanics investigation: choosing the right model [^48e75533]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2012). Low credibility.

Physical testing is commonly performed to answer important biomechanical questions in the treatment of patients with fractures and other orthopaedic conditions. However, a variety of mistakes that are made in performing such investigations can severely limit their impact. The goal of this article is to discuss important aspects of study design to consider when planning for biomechanical investigations so that the studies can provide maximal benefit to the field. The best mechanical investigations begin with a good research question, one that comes out of patient care experience, is clearly defined, and can be stated concisely. The first practical issue to be considered is often choosing the type of physical specimens to be tested to address the research question. A related issue involves determining how many specimens will be needed to answer the posed mechanical question. Cadavers are generally still the closest to the actual clinical situation, but they are limited by interspecimen variability, which often requires a matched pair design that can address only one question. Simulated bone specimens limit variability and can replicate normal and osteoporotic bone. In planning the physical testing, the critical mechanical variables involved in answering the research question must be identified and due consideration given to deciding how best to measure them. Another important issue that arises relates to whether or not single static loadings will suffice in the testing (eg, to study construct stiffness) or whether cyclic dynamic testing is necessary (eg, to study late failure likely attributable to fatigue). To summarize, experimental design should be carefully planned before initiating mechanical testing. Sample size calculations should be performed to ensure adequate power and that clinically relevant differences can be detected. This pregame analysis can save significant time and cost and greatly increase the likelihood that the results will advance knowledge.

### Arbitrary lattice symmetries via block copolymer nanomeshes [^8ad6128c]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly of block copolymers is a powerful motif for spontaneously forming well-defined nanostructures over macroscopic areas. Yet, the inherent energy minimization criteria of self-assembly give rise to a limited library of structures; diblock copolymers naturally form spheres on a cubic lattice, hexagonally packed cylinders and alternating lamellae. Here, we demonstrate multicomponent nanomeshes with any desired lattice symmetry. We exploit photothermal annealing to rapidly order and align block copolymer phases over macroscopic areas, combined with conversion of the self-assembled organic phase into inorganic replicas. Repeated photothermal processing independently aligns successive layers, providing full control of the size, symmetry and composition of the nanoscale unit cell. We construct a variety of symmetries, most of which are not natively formed by block copolymers, including squares, rhombuses, rectangles and triangles. In fact, we demonstrate all possible two-dimensional Bravais lattices. Finally, we elucidate the influence of nanostructure on the electrical and optical properties of nanomeshes.

### Closing the gap towards super-long suspension bridges using computational morphogenesis [^0b167599]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Topology optimization

The objective of the optimization is to maximize the stiffness of the center section of the model for a given amount of material, which during optimization is distributed in the interior of the design domain (marked with orange in Supplementary Fig. 1). The problem is solved based on the assumption of static, linear-elastic behavior. The governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved using the finite element method, using eight-node hexahedral iso-parametric elements, resulting in the following linear system of equations:Here K (ρ) is the stiffness matrix given as a function of the design variable vector ρ, u is the displacement vector, and F is the load vector. Each mesh element is assigned a single artificial continuous density, ρ e ∈[0, 1], collected in vector ρ, defined in a range from void (0) to solid material (1). The density-based topology optimization method SIMP(Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) is used, as this enables the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The element stiffness is defined by a smooth interpolation between the solid material stiffness, E solid, and a very weak material (E void = 10 −6 E solid), given by the modified SIMP schemeasHere p > 1 is a penalization parameter enforcing almost discrete final designs with ρ e being either 0 or 1, hence, the impractical intermediate densities are penalized and made unfavorable. The stiffness matrix can thus be assembled in the standard way asHereis the element stiffness matrix with unit modulus of elasticity and n is the number of elements in the mesh. Before stating the mathematical optimization problem, the objective function is introduced as compliance (work done by external forces) of only the center section of the model, C = u T F, which is inversely proportional to structural stiffness. Hence, to maximize structural stiffness, the following minimization problem is posed:Here ϕ is the sum of compliances from L load cases, weighted by the scaling factors a i. The first constraint ensures mechanical equilibrium; the second poses a limit on the amount of available material, with V (ρ) being the volume of the current structure and V * the maximum amount of available material and the third defines box constraints on the design variables. To avoid well known, but undesirable effects inherent in topology optimization, such as checkerboards and mesh-dependencies, a filteringof the densities is performed after each optimization iteration. Here, the density filter from ref. an image processing type convolution filter, is applied. Hence, the filter modifies each density as a weighted average of the adjacent densities, given by a filter radius. The filter is thus a method to smoothen the boundaries of the structure. A filter radius of 1.5 times the maximum dimension of a mesh-element is used. Finally, a fully parallelized version of the gradient-based method of moving asymptotes (MMA,) is used as the optimization algorithm.

### Microscopic response to inhomogeneous deformations in curvilinear coordinates [^3649c2b2]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

A mechanical deformation of a continuum can be expressed as a generalized coordinate transformation of space. Consequently, the equations of electrostatics in deformable media must satisfy covariance requirements with respect to such transformations, a problem that has long been addressed in the context of general relativity. Here we show how these ideas can be incorporated into the framework of density-functional perturbation theory, providing access to the microscopic charge density and electrostatic potential response to an arbitrary deformation field. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving, in full generality, the surface contributions to the flexoelectric response of a finite object, a topic that has recently been a matter of controversy. The breakdown of translational periodicity produces consequences that might seem highly paradoxical at first sight: for example, the macroscopic bulk polarization does not always correspond to the physical surface charge.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^f3e38e2d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Analytical limit of the folded geometry

Once folded, the hypar pattern buckles out of the plane into a saddle-shaped shell to resolve the fundamental incompatibility between the in-plane strain induced by folding and its three-dimensional embedding. Each panel in the pattern is subjected to twisting along its longitudinal direction. Performing a simple surgery of cutting one corrugation out, we observe an immediate release of the twist, causing the corrugation to lose compatibility as we try to fit it back onto the folded shell, as demonstrated by the insets in Fig. 2a, b. The folded hypar sheet has two orthogonal symmetry planes spanned by the diagonal creases, which divide the shell into four symmetric pieces, each within a quadrant of the x, y -plane. From a homogenized view of the global deformation, we define a surface that describes the shape of the corrugated shell. We cannot assume smoothness at the joint between any two pieces of surface from adjacent quadrants due to the inherent discrete nature of the square hypar. Nevertheless, within each quadrant, the piece of surface is supposed to be a smooth ruled surface bounded by two curves, which can be parametrized as:where ζ (r) and ξ (r) are curves lying on the symmetry planes constructed approximately by the folded diagonal creases. The straight corrugations resemble rulings.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

Figure 2
Transmission- vs. contact-reduction intervention. A) Transmission-reduction intervention: solid curves show the average size of an outbreak (left panel) and the probability of a large-scale epidemic (right panel). The horizontal axes cover the spectrum of disease transmissibility (from 0 to 1) such that a single disease is associated with a unique value on either the left curve (if T < Tc) or the right curve (if T > Tc). The epidemic threshold Tc separates the 2 zones. For better visualization, we chose 2 different scales for horizontal axes of the 2 panels. Consider a disease with T = 0.245 (top black circle). A transmission-reduction intervention causes the black circle to slide on a new position on the curve. A successful intervention is the one that lowers T to a value < Tc. B) Contact-reduction intervention: solid curves in the top panel show the epidemiologic vulnerability of the original network. Contact-reduction interventions alter the structure of the contact network and shift the epidemic curves to the right (solid curves in bottom panel). The 2 dashed vertical lines show the critical transmissibility threshold for the old (left) and new (right) networks. Consider the disease denoted by the black circle: the contact-reduction intervention raised the epidemic threshold above transmissibility of the disease and thereby eliminated the possibility of an epidemic.

In our simulated urban contact network, the critical transmissibility threshold is T c = 0.048. An outbreak of disease with T = 0.245 will almost certainly spark an epidemic in the absence of intervention (top circle in Figure 2). This value of T is equivalent to an R 0 = 5 for this contact network and thus corresponds to a moderately infectious disease like smallpox. A successful intervention either reduces T so that it lies below T c (Figure 2A) or modifies the structure of the network so that T c rises above T (Figure 2B). The first strategy can be achieved by interventions that reduce the probability of transmission per contact, such as face masks, gloves, gowns, handwashing, and other infection control precautions that prevent the exchange of respiratory droplets without eliminating contact.

### Step-by-step progress toward understanding the hepatitis C virus RNA helicase [^fb90344f]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Helicases are a ubiquitous class of enzymes involved in nearly all aspects of DNA and RNA metabolism. Despite recent progress in understanding their mechanism of action, limited resolution has left inaccessible the detailed mechanisms by which these enzymes couple the rearrangement of nucleic acid structures to the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Observing individual mechanistic cycles of these motor proteins is central to understanding their cellular functions. Here we follow in real time, at a resolution of two base pairs and 20 ms, the RNA translocation and unwinding cycles of a hepatitis C virus helicase (NS3) monomer. NS3 is a representative superfamily-2 helicase essential for viral replication, and therefore a potentially important drug target. We show that the cyclic movement of NS3 is coordinated by ATP in discrete steps of 11 ± 3 base pairs, and that actual unwinding occurs in rapid smaller substeps of 3.6 ± 1.3 base pairs, also triggered by ATP binding, indicating that NS3 might move like an inchworm. This ATP-coupling mechanism is likely to be applicable to other non-hexameric helicases involved in many essential cellular functions. The assay developed here should be useful in investigating a broad range of nucleic acid translocation motors.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^136613e3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Triply-periodic networks are among the most complex and functionally valuable self-assembled morphologies, yet they form in nearly every class of biological and synthetic soft matter building blocks. In contrast to simpler assembly motifs - spheres, cylinders, layers - networks require molecules to occupy variable local environments, confounding attempts to understand their formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid network phase by using a geometric formulation of the strong stretching theory of block copolymer melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system. The theory establishes the direct link between molecular packing, assembly thermodynamics and the medial map, a generic measure of the geometric center of complex shapes. We show that "medial packing" is essential for stability of double-gyroid in strongly-segregated melts, reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and finite-segregation theories. Additionally, we find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of network stability on the relative entropic elastic stiffness of matrix-forming to tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable double-gyroid widens for both large and small elastic asymmetry, contradicting intuitive notions that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study demonstrates the utility of optimized medial tessellations for understanding soft-molecular assembly and packing frustration via an approach that is readily generalizable far beyond gyroids in neat block copolymers.

### Invariant and smooth limit of discrete geometry folded from bistable origami leading to multistable metasurfaces [^5747a454]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Folded configurations of three triangulated hypar origami with different panel widths display invariant hypar geometry (same patterns as in Fig. 1). The three origami patterns have the same number of square creases (counted from the center outwards), denoted by n. Every other square crease is a mountain, and thus there are 10 mountain creases in total. Two panels on the both sides of a mountain crease are assigned the same width. All three concentrically pleated origami can fold approximately into the same hypar shape, as indicated by the red quadratic curves. a Standard hypar pattern: panel width d is a constant for all corrugations. b Functionally graded hypar pattern: panel width d increases as n increases. c Random hypar pattern: panel width d is a random variable for each corrugation. Since the hypar patterns are triangulated, folding is achieved by rigid origami simulation. The left images show the 3D views of the folded hypar origami. The middle images show the side views. The right images present quantitative measures. The blue dots (each dot corresponds to a mountain) in the charts show how (d / L) vanishes as n increases. The green dots show the residual (or error) of Eq. (2) when n is finite

Connecting geometry with mechanics

With an analytical description of the global homogenized geometry of the hypar pattern, we can associate the mechanical behavior of the pattern with its geometry by expressing the system energy in terms of the folding kinematics. First, let us consider how a hypar origami folds into a stable saddle shape. We start from a flat hypar pattern, and forcefully fold up the pattern. After the origami is folded into shape, the folding creases undergo inelastic deformation, which shifts the neutral (i.e. stress free) angles of the folding hinges from zero to the angles at a folded state with shape coefficient k = k 0 (see Eq. 10). However, the panels undergo elastic deformation, as we observe that they return to the initial flat configuration once cut out from a folded hypar origami. Thus, we assume that the bending hinges still have their neutral angles equal to zero, which corresponds to the state at k = 0. A stable configuration is drawn by minimizing the system total energy (E T).

### Nanoalignment by critical casimir torques [^56a0c077]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Enhanced microdisk localization and orientation by non-circular patterns

When trapped in the perpendicular configuration above a circular pattern, the microdisk is poorly localized in the xy-plane, as shown by the trajectory in Fig. 3 a. Such an unstable trapping is a consequence of the small overlap area between the microdisk and the substrate, resulting in a weak critical Casimir force. Moreover, as a consequence of the rotational symmetry of this system, the orientation of the microdisk freely diffuses featuring a uniform angular distribution, shown in the histogram in Fig. 3 d.

Fig. 3
Microdisk position and orientation control by elliptical and circular patterns.

a Trajectory of a microdisk of radius R = 1.2μm trapped in the perpendicular configuration above a circular pattern of radius a = 1.1μm. The bottom panels in (a) show a micrograph of the trapped microdisk (left) and its schematic representation (right). The white solid line highlights the circular pattern on the surface, and the white dashed line highlights the microdisk oriented almost perpendicularly to the surface. The microdisk tilting leads to an ellipse-like, rather than a rectangular contour, as seen in the micrograph. The angle θ within the surface is measured between an arbitrarily chosen axis of the circular pattern (denoted by the short black vertical segment) and the projection of the microdisk diameter chosen to lie parallel to the surface. The shaded area shows the orthogonal projection of the microdisk onto the surface. The micrograph shows the top view while the schematic drawing presents a side view in order to provide a clearer illustration of the angle θ. b, c Normalized one-dimensional histograms of the microdisk displacements along the x - and y -directions. d The orientation of the microdisk in (a) defined by the angle θ is nearly uniformly distributed fromto. The dashed line shows the homogeneous probability density. e Trajectory of a microdisk levitating above an elliptical pattern (long axis 2.2μm and short axis 0.6μm). The bottom panels show the experimental picture (left) and the schematic representation (right) of the trapped microdisk. Similarly to panel (a), the solid and dashed lines highlight the contours of the surface pattern and of a circular microdisk oriented perpendicularly to the surface, respectively. The angle θ is measured as indicated in panel (a), taking the long axis of the ellipse as a reference axis. The microdisk displacements along the x -direction (f) are much more confined than along the y -direction (g). h The orientation of the microdisk is sharply confined between ca.and.

### Towards a complete coil array [^04373c36]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2008). Low credibility.

A complete RF coil system, as has been previously defined, is capable of generating any steady-state RF field, at the MR frequency, that is compatible with Maxwell's equations. A coil system is complete if it is capable of generating all basis vector fields in the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic fields. A complete coil system has the potential to reach the ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise as an MRI receiver coil. It also offers maximum flexibility in tailoring the spatial RF field distribution as an excitation coil. Here, computer simulations have been performed on array coils employing composite coil elements, assuming the current loops are small and can be approximated by magnetic dipoles. We demonstrate that a coil array can be configured to approximate a truncated complete array coil and to generate the basis magnetic vector fields up to certain orders in the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic fields.

Results

8% or 20% cyclic stretching mediated the down-regulation of occludin and the activation of c-Src

MLE-12 cells were treated with 8% or 20% cyclic stretching for 0, 1, 2 and 4 h. Occludin levels and total and phosphorylation of c-Src were detected by western blotting. Occludin expression was not significantly changed at 8% cyclic stretching (P > 0.05) (Figure 1). At 20% cyclic stretching, the expression of occludin was reduced in a time-dependent manner, reaching a final reduction of 70% at 4 h (P < 0.05) (Figure 1). After exposure of MLE-12 cells to 20% cyclic stretching for 0, 1, 2 and 4 h, c-Src was activated, and the level of total and phosphorylation c-Src increased (P < 0.05) (Figure 2).

### Single-shot quantum error correction with the three-dimensional subsystem toric code [^a647dc9e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fault-tolerant protocols and quantum error correction (QEC) are essential to building reliable quantum computers from imperfect components that are vulnerable to errors. Optimizing the resource and time overheads needed to implement QEC is one of the most pressing challenges. Here, we introduce a new topological quantum error-correcting code, the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC). The 3D STC can be realized with geometrically-local parity checks of weight at most three on the cubic lattice with open boundary conditions. We prove that one round of parity-check measurements suffices to perform reliable QEC with the 3D STC even in the presence of measurement errors. We also propose an efficient single-shot QEC decoding strategy for the 3D STC and numerically estimate the resulting storage threshold against independent bit-flip, phase-flip and measurement errors to be p STC ≈1.045%. Such a high threshold together with local parity-check measurements make the 3D STC particularly appealing for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### Discovery of a maximally charged weyl point [^e7ceedd7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The hypothetical Weyl particles in high-energy physics have been discovered in three-dimensional crystals as collective quasiparticle excitations near two-fold degenerate Weyl points. Such momentum-space Weyl particles carry quantised chiral charges, which can be measured by counting the number of Fermi arcs emanating from the corresponding Weyl points. It is known that merging unit-charged Weyl particles can create new ones with more charges. However, only very recently has it been realised that there is an upper limit - the maximal charge number that a two-fold Weyl point can host is four - achievable only in crystals without spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report the experimental realisation of such a maximally charged Weyl point in a three-dimensional photonic crystal. The four charges support quadruple-helicoid Fermi arcs, forming an unprecedented topology of two non-contractible loops in the surface Brillouin zone. The helicoid Fermi arcs also exhibit the long-pursued type-II van Hove singularities that can reside at arbitrary momenta. This discovery reveals a type of maximally charged Weyl particles beyond conventional topological particles in crystals.

Mitral regurgitation — vena contracta (VC) width/area and 3D planimetry: VC is introduced as "a measure of the effective regurgitant orifice", and technique guidance states, "For MR, the VC width (VCW) should be imaged preferably in a parasternal long-axis view (axial resolution) and measured using zoom mode at the narrowest portion of the jet as it emerges from the orifice".

### Deformation characteristics of solid-state benzene as a step towards understanding planetary geology [^9f24c27b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Small organic molecules, like ethane and benzene, are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and surface of Saturn's largest moon Titan, forming plains, dunes, canyons, and other surface features. Understanding Titan's dynamic geology and designing future landing missions requires sufficient knowledge of the mechanical characteristics of these solid-state organic minerals, which is currently lacking. To understand the deformation and mechanical properties of a representative solid organic material at space-relevant temperatures, we freeze liquid micro-droplets of benzene to form ~10 μm-tall single-crystalline pyramids and uniaxially compress them in situ. These micromechanical experiments reveal contact pressures decaying from ~2 to ~0.5 GPa after ~1 μm-reduction in pyramid height. The deformation occurs via a series of stochastic (~5–30 nm) displacement bursts, corresponding to densification and stiffening of the compressed material during cyclic loading to progressively higher loads. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal predominantly plastic deformation and densified region formation by the re-orientation and interplanar shear of benzene rings, providing a two-step stiffening mechanism. This work demonstrates the feasibility of in-situ cryogenic nanomechanical characterization of solid organics as a pathway to gain insights into the geophysics of planetary bodies.

### Geometry analysis and systematic synthesis of highly porous isoreticular frameworks with a unique topology [^d243ea75]. Nature Communications (2012). Medium credibility.

Porous coordination polymers are well known for their easily tailored framework structures and corresponding properties. Although systematic modulations of pore sizes of binary prototypes have gained great success, simultaneous adjustment of both pore size and shape of ternary prototypes remains unexplored, owing to the difficulty in controlling the self-assembly of multiple molecular building blocks. Here we show that simple geometry analysis can be used to estimate the influence of the linker lengths and length ratios on the synthesis/construction difficulties and framework stabilities of a highly symmetric, ternary prototype composed of a typical trinuclear metal cluster and two types of bridging carboxylate ligands. As predicted, systematic syntheses with 5×5 ligand combinations produced 13 highly porous isoreticular frameworks, which show not only systematic adjustment of pore volumes (0.49–2.04 cm(3) g(-1)) and sizes (7.8–13.0 Å; 5.2–12.0 Å; 7.4–17.4 Å), but also anisotropic modulation of the pore shapes.

### Non-native three-dimensional block copolymer morphologies [^31c34f4f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Self-assembly is a powerful paradigm, wherein molecules spontaneously form ordered phases exhibiting well-defined nanoscale periodicity and shapes. However, the inherent energy-minimization aspect of self-assembly yields a very limited set of morphologies, such as lamellae or hexagonally packed cylinders. Here, we show how soft self-assembling materials-block copolymer thin films-can be manipulated to form a diverse library of previously unreported morphologies. In this iterative assembly process, each polymer layer acts as both a structural component of the final morphology and a template for directing the order of subsequent layers. Specifically, block copolymer films are immobilized on surfaces, and template successive layers through subtle surface topography. This strategy generates an enormous variety of three-dimensional morphologies that are absent in the native block copolymer phase diagram.

### Optimal coil array design: the two-coil case [^202c1833]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

The optimization problem for coil arrays is largely unsolved, even for the case of a two-coil system. This paper reports a systematic computer simulation to investigate the maximal achievable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a two-coil receiver system where, using cancellation circuitry, mutual inductance is made zero. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical solutions with respect to two-coil geometry are considered. SNR is measured at a single point at a certain depth and also along a longitudinal or transverse line at the same depth. The conducting medium containing these regions of interest is assumed to be an infinite half space, an infinite cylinder or a finite sphere. The previous coil array design using a "magical" overlap only approximates the optimal solution for the infinite half space. For the infinite cylinder and the finite sphere, optimal solutions can be quite different from the "magical" overlap.

### How to assess motor impairment in writer's cramp [^35728582]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Writer's cramp is a task-specific hand dystonia affecting handwriting. Clinical scores such as the Arm Dystonia Disability Scale (ADDS) or Writer's Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) as well as kinematic analysis of handwriting movements have been used to assess functional impairment in affected patients. In 21 patients with writer's cramp and healthy controls, we analyzed the kinematics of writing and cyclic drawing movements. We rated the severity of dystonia using the ADDS and WCRS and correlated the clinical scores with movement kinematics. Mean stroke frequency was significantly reduced in dystonic patients. Drawing movements showed more frequently a decrease in stroke frequency than handwriting movements. During circle drawing, mean vertical peak velocity was more variable in patients relative to controls, indicating an impaired ability to reproduce the same kinematic pattern over time. An increase in vertical writing pressure was only observed during handwriting but not during circle drawing and may reflect a compensatory effort to stabilize the pencil. Kinematic measures and individual ADDS and WCRS scores did not correlate with each other. The lack of correlation is not surprising as ADDS, WCRS, and kinematic analysis probe different aspects of motor impairment. The ADDS characterizes how dystonia affects a set of fine manual tasks, whereas the WCRS scores the manifestation of dystonia during handwriting. Therefore, the clinical scores and kinematic analysis of handwriting provide complementary insights into motor impairment. Future studies need to address which combination of clinical scores and kinematic measures are most appropriate to quantify impairment in writer's cramp.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

Doravirine: Doravirine exhibited an EC50value of 12.0 ± 4.4 nM against wild-type laboratory strains of HIV-1 when tested in the presence of 100% normal human serum (NHS) using MT4-GFP reporter cells and a median EC50value for HIV-1 subtype B primary isolates (n = 118) of 4.1 nM (range: 1.0 nM-16.0 nM). Doravirine demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV-1 isolates (A, A1, AE, AG, B, BF, C, D, G, H) with EC50values ranging from 1.2 nM to 10.0 nM. The antiviral activity of doravirine was not antagonistic when combined with lamivudine and TDF.

Lamivudine: The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using standard susceptibility assays. EC50values were in the range of 3 to 15,000 nM (1,000 nM = 230 ng per mL). The median EC50values of lamivudine were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B) respectively. Ribavirin (50,000 nM) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5-fold in MT-4 cells.

TDF: The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in T lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The EC50values for tenofovir were in the range of 40–8,500 nM. Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50values ranged from 500–2,200 nM).
