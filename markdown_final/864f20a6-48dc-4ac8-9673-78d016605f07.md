## Question

What is the recommended clindamycin dosage for MRSA?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the recommended clindamycin dosing is for MRSA infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the clinical syndrome because dosing and suitability vary by site and severity. Then, I should differentiate adult versus pediatric dosing. Next, I will consider route of therapy and IV-to-PO conversion. After that, I need to verify local susceptibility patterns and the D-test requirement. Then, I will set typical durations by syndrome. I should also check special populations and contraindications. Finally, I will summarize practical dosing by common scenarios and close with monitoring and safety considerations, making sure each point is grounded in the guidelines and regulatory labeling.

> Let me first confirm the importance of syndrome classification, because clindamycin's role and dose hinge on whether we are treating uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), complicated SSTI, bone/joint disease, pneumonia, bacteremia, or central nervous system involvement, and I need to ensure we avoid settings where clindamycin is inappropriate such as MRSA CNS infections where vancomycin or linezolid-based regimens are preferred based on IDSA guidance [^114Z8V8r] [^112GryLW] [^114STJ9T].

> Now, I will delineate adult versus pediatric dosing, and I should double-check the specific MRSA-directed recommendations and label ranges before finalizing. For adults with MRSA-complicated SSTIs, IDSA lists clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO every 8 hours as an option, recognizing it is generally used when the isolate is susceptible and toxin suppression is desirable [^114kNGcE]. For adults with less severe infections or alternative indications, oral ranges of 150–300 mg QID are used for anaerobic pulmonary or intra-abdominal infections and 300–450 mg every 6–8 hours for MSSA SSTIs per labeling, but these are not the target MRSA doses we rely on for complicated disease, so I need to keep the higher MRSA SSTI dose distinct from MSSA and anaerobe regimens [^1132GvZS] [^113Z8h3n] [^116ckGpj] [^114sL5GV]. For pediatrics, I should confirm the 10–13 mg/kg/dose IV every 6–8 hours (total around 40 mg/kg/day) strategy for stable patients in whom clindamycin is appropriate, with oral step-down guided by susceptibility, recognizing general pediatric labeling of 20–40 mg/kg/day IV/IM in 3–4 divided doses and 8–16 mg/kg/day PO in 3–4 divided doses, and lower dosing in neonates at 15–20 mg/kg/day divided 3–4 times [^111CExig] [^11275UM4] [^112zFgt2] [^112xNy84] [^116mY3eB] [^1153Vazd] [^114USt1Y]. Wait, I initially thought 600 mg PO TID is always acceptable for adults, but let me correct that: many regions cap the oral dose at 450 mg TID for tolerability even though 600 mg TID IV is standard, and some European guidelines allow up to 900 mg per dose IV, so I should specify the local oral maximum where relevant [^112b3pnG].

> Next, I should review route and IV-to-PO conversion, and I need to ensure bioavailability and tolerance are considered. For serious disease, start IV at 600 mg every 8 hours in adults or 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours in pediatrics, then convert to PO once clinically improving and when susceptibility is confirmed, recognizing that many programs cap oral dosing at 450 mg TID for adults due to gastrointestinal tolerability concerns despite adequate systemic exposure with oral therapy [^114kNGcE] [^112b3pnG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using clindamycin empirically without confirming local resistance and inducible resistance testing, because this is a common pitfall that leads to failures. I need to check that local clindamycin resistance among MRSA is low, typically less than 10%, and ensure a D-test is performed when an isolate is clindamycin-susceptible but erythromycin-resistant; a positive D-test means report as resistant and avoid clindamycin due to inducible MLSB resistance and risk of clinical failure, with CA-MRSA SSTIs generally more likely to be clindamycin-susceptible than HA-MRSA [^111CExig] [^11275UM4] [^1169PV6p] [^113PKhkW] [^1144yKbf] [^1178amu9].

> I will now examine duration of therapy by syndrome, and I should double-check ranges while allowing for individual response. For uncomplicated purulent SSTI after adequate drainage, typical durations are 5–10 days, while complicated SSTI often require 7–14 days depending on debridement and response, with longer courses for bone/joint infections and duration in pneumonia individualized to clinical stability and resolution of systemic features [^114Z8V8r] [^114LP8SG].

> Let me consider special populations and contraindications, and I should confirm dose adjustments. I need to ensure that no dose adjustment is required in renal impairment and that no adjustment is generally needed in chronic liver disease across IV and other labeled formulations, while remembering clindamycin/lincomycin hypersensitivity is a contraindication and that clindamycin should not be used for MRSA infective endocarditis where vancomycin or daptomycin are recommended alternatives per IDSA pediatric guidance, with pregnancy-specific dosing applying only to topical or intravaginal formulations rather than systemic MRSA therapy [^116VJrBm] [^112SMTLf] [^113vSsDG] [^114xdM1x] [^115kjpqr] [^116Z3DCM] [^114Rr8LM] [^111xntgB] [^116hRYfE].

> Now I will translate this into practical scenario-based dosing for skin and soft tissue infection in the outpatient setting, but wait, I should first confirm that incision and drainage is the cornerstone for abscesses and that antibiotics are added based on host factors and response. For outpatient purulent CA-MRSA SSTI with confirmed susceptibility and D-test negativity, adults can receive clindamycin 600 mg PO every 8 hours for about 7–10 days, acknowledging that many programs cap oral dosing at 450 mg TID for tolerability, and children can receive 10–13 mg/kg/dose IV every 6–8 hours with conversion to appropriate oral dosing when stable, provided local resistance is low and the isolate is susceptible [^114knaFf] [^112b3pnG] [^111CExig] [^1166kUD4] [^113KrirW] [^117MdSXz].

> For hospitalized complicated SSTI, I should confirm we pair source control with appropriate empiric coverage and then narrow to clindamycin only if criteria are met. Adults may receive clindamycin 600 mg IV every 8 hours as part of MRSA-active therapy pending cultures, with pediatrics at 10–13 mg/kg/dose IV every 6–8 hours, and duration typically 7–14 days adjusted to clinical response and debridement adequacy [^114kNGcE] [^114LP8SG].

> For bone and joint infections such as pediatric MRSA septic arthritis or osteomyelitis, let me verify that clindamycin is acceptable empirically in stable children in low-resistance settings and that oral step-down dosing is feasible. The pediatric recommendation is 10–13 mg/kg/dose IV every 6–8 hours when the local clindamycin resistance rate is under 10% and the child is stable without bacteremia, with oral step-down commonly 30–40 mg/kg/day divided TID based on retrospective data showing 30 mg/kg/day may be effective, while adults typically require alternative MRSA-active regimens based on severity and susceptibilities [^111CExig] [^115u8V9V].

> For MRSA pneumonia, I need to check that vancomycin remains standard for hospitalized patients and that clindamycin can be considered in stable pediatric cases as empiric therapy when local resistance is low, with a plan to switch to oral therapy if the strain is susceptible and the patient is improving clinically, while ensuring no concurrent bacteremia that would preclude clindamycin [^11275UM4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, what about Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and adjunctive toxin suppression strategies. I initially thought of recommending adjunctive clindamycin routinely, but hold on, I should verify current evidence and guideline positions before making that claim. The SNAP randomized platform trial protocol uses adjunctive clindamycin 600 mg IV TID for 5 days in adults and 15 mg/kg/dose IV TID in children with a 600 mg/dose cap, but IDSA 2011 did not recommend adjunctive clindamycin for SAB and definitive clinical outcome data are still pending, so adjunctive use remains investigational and should not be routine outside trials or specific toxin-mediated scenarios [^112b3pnG] [^112Rvjjp].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure close follow-up at 48–72 hours to confirm clinical response, watch for gastrointestinal intolerance and the elevated risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea with clindamycin relative to no antibiotics and to TMP-SMX, and maintain vigilance for Clostridioides difficile infection especially with prolonged or repeated exposure, adjusting therapy if intolerance or lack of response emerges [^115FF4Ke].

> To close the loop, here is the concise dosing synthesis I should verify for accuracy. Adults with MRSA infections where clindamycin is appropriate: 600 mg IV or PO every 8 hours, typically 7–10 days for uncomplicated SSTI after adequate drainage and longer for deeper or more severe infections, recognizing many programs cap oral dosing at 450 mg TID for tolerability and that use should follow confirmation of susceptibility and a negative D-test when indicated [^114kNGcE] [^112b3pnG] [^1169PV6p]. Children with MRSA infections where clindamycin is appropriate: 10–13 mg/kg/dose IV every 6–8 hours, not exceeding about 40 mg/kg/day, with oral step-down using label-supported ranges and clinical data guiding 30–40 mg/kg/day divided TID in musculoskeletal infections, provided local resistance is low and D-testing supports use [^111CExig] [^116mY3eB] [^115u8V9V].

---

Clindamycin is a key oral or IV option for MRSA SSTIs when susceptibility is confirmed and the D-test is negative [^1166kUD4]. The **standard adult dose is 300–450 mg PO q6–8h or 600 mg IV q8h** for 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response [^114sL5GV] [^114kNGcE] [^114LP8SG]. In pediatrics, use 10–13 mg/kg/dose IV/PO q6–8h (max 600 mg/dose) for 7–14 days [^111CExig] [^11275UM4]. Always **confirm susceptibility and perform a D-test** to rule out inducible resistance before use [^113PKhkW] [^1169PV6p].

---

## Recommended clindamycin dosing regimens for MRSA infections

### Adult dosing

In adults, **oral dosing** is 300–450 mg PO every 6–8 hours for 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response [^114LP8SG] [^114kNGcE]; **intravenous dosing** is 600 mg IV every 8 hours [^114kNGcE] for 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response.

---

### Pediatric dosing

In children, **IV/PO dosing** is 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (max 600 mg/dose) [^111CExig] for 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response.

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

### Inducible clindamycin resistance (D-test)

Perform a **D-test** on erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin-susceptible isolates to detect inducible resistance [^113PKhkW]; a positive result predicts treatment failure, and clindamycin should be avoided [^1169PV6p].

---

### Adverse effects and monitoring

Adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and risk of **C. difficile infection** [^115FF4Ke]; monitor for these during therapy. Monitoring should include assessing **clinical response** and **adverse effects**, with therapy adjusted as needed.

---

### Special populations

In special populations, no dose adjustment is required for **renal impairment** [^116VJrBm] or **hepatic impairment** [^114xdM1x] [^113vSsDG].

---

## Clinical scenarios for clindamycin use in MRSA infections

Clindamycin is appropriate for MRSA SSTIs when susceptibility is confirmed and the D-test is negative [^1166kUD4]; however, it is **not recommended for MRSA bacteremia or endocarditis** [^114Rr8LM] due to limited evidence and the risk of resistance emergence.

---

## Alternative antibiotics for MRSA infections

When clindamycin is unsuitable because of **resistance or intolerance**, consider:

- **Vancomycin**: First-line for severe MRSA infections [^114kNGcE].
- **Linezolid**: 600 mg PO/IV BID [^114kNGcE] [^117MdSXz].
- **Daptomycin**: 4 mg/kg IV once daily [^114kNGcE] [^112tXnJR].
- **TMP-SMX**: Alternative oral option [^114kNGcE] [^116Ubdzu] [^116zAVhn].
- **Doxycycline or minocycline**: Alternative oral options [^114kNGcE] [^116XRX5P].

---

Clindamycin is effective for MRSA SSTIs when susceptibility is confirmed and the D-test is negative [^113KrirW]; the **standard adult dose is 300–450 mg PO q6–8h or 600 mg IV q8h** for 7–14 days, individualized to clinical response [^114sL5GV] [^114kNGcE] [^114LP8SG].

### Is it time to replace vancomycin in the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections [^111m3NJf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

For more than four decades, vancomycin has been the antibiotic of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Recently, infections due to isolates with high but susceptible vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations have been associated with additional treatment failures and increased patient mortality. These poorer outcomes may be partially explained by the inability to attain appropriate vancomycin levels in these patients. However, assumptions that these poor outcomes are solely due to the failure to achieve optimal serum levels of vancomycin are premature.

The availability of effective alternatives further erodes the position of vancomycin as first-line therapy. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistance and cost considerations necessitate a more measured approach when using alternative antimicrobials. Collectively, the available data suggest that the optimal therapy for MRSA infections remains unclear. In the absence of further data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines remain relevant and inform clinicians of best practice for treating patients with MRSA infections.

### Does adjunctive clindamycin have a role in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia? A protocol for the adjunctive treatment domain of the Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) randomized controlled trial [^112b3pnG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Table 2 details the interventions and the recommended doses of clindamycin for adult and pediatric participants. Adjunctive clindamycin will be given for 5 days. The recommended clindamycin doses are 600 mg administered three times daily intravenously in adults and 15 mg/kg per dose, with a maximum dose of 600 mg three times daily intravenously in children. These recommendations are based on French and UK guidelines, which allow up to 900 mg per dose. Notably, the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for MRSA did not recommend adjunctive clindamycin in 2011; updates are currently in progress. A hollow-fiber model supports 600 mg as an appropriate dose to inhibit exotoxin production. Clindamycin is the preferred agent; however, if it is unavailable, it can be replaced by lincomycin.

Table 2. Dosing Table for Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) Adjunctive Domain (Clindamycin) Intervention

Administering clindamycin orally is permissible for sites and investigators who prefer oral dosing for reasons of cost, convenience, or antimicrobial stewardship. The oral dose is capped at 450 mg given three times daily, as this is the maximum licensed dose in most regions, and higher doses tend to have poor gastrointestinal tolerability. Study investigators viewed a 5-day course as the shortest duration likely to have clinical impact, while considering the possibility of adverse effects, particularly Clostridioides difficile–associated diarrhea. An initial short-course treatment strategy was also believed to balance the likelihood that any effect of adjunctive clindamycin will be a…

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pakistan, 1996–2003 [^1171hwAy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

During the last seven years, resistance in MRSA isolates has steadily increased to most of the antimicrobial drugs such as gentamicin (69% in 1996 and 88% in 2003), ciprofloxacin (87% in 1996 and 94% in 2003), clindamycin (60% in 1996 and 70% in 2003), and rifampicin (20% in 1996 and 60% in 2003). However, resistance to co-trimoxazole and doxycycline has decreased. In 1996, 15% (32/212) of our MRSA isolates were susceptible to co-trimoxazole, whereas in the first nine months of 2003, 43% (222/516) of the isolates were susceptible (p < 0.0001). Similarly, susceptibility to doxycycline increased from 34% in 1996 to 49% in 2003 (p = 0.0005).

Antimicrobial drug susceptibility of the isolates was tested by the modified Kirby-Bauer technique, and results were interpreted according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria. Methicillin resistance was tested using 1 µg oxacillin disks (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) on Mueller-Hinton agar containing 4% sodium chloride. Plates were incubated at 35°C for 24 hours.

We agree with Bishara et al. that the increase in susceptibility is likely due to decreased use of these antimicrobial drugs for staphylococcal infections in clinical practice. The use of co-trimoxazole in our hospital decreased from 48 daily doses per 1,000 hospital days in 1996 to 35 daily doses in 2003, while use of doxycycline decreased from 12 daily doses per 1,000 hospital days in 1996 to 9 daily doses in 2003. These antimicrobial drugs offer an inexpensive alternative to glycopeptides for the treatment of MRSA infections.

### Clinical importance of purulence in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections [^1144yKbf]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The so-called community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains are more frequently susceptible to non-β-lactam antibiotics (including clindamycin) than healthcare-associated MRSA strains. We assessed whether predictive clinical characteristics of presumptive MRSA infections can be identified to guide the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy.

- **Methods**: A clinical syndrome was assigned to each inpatient and outpatient at the University of Chicago Medical Center with an MRSA infection in 2004 to 2005. Antimicrobial susceptibilities and molecular characteristics of MRSA isolates were assessed. Patients were stratified by lesion characteristics.

- **Results**: Of the MRSA isolates from 262 patients with purulent skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), 231 (88%) were susceptible to clindamycin, 253 (97%) contained staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) IV, and 245 (94%) contained Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) genes, which are characteristics associated with community-associated MRSA strains. The presence of a purulent SSTI had a positive predictive value of 88% for a clindamycin-susceptible MRSA isolate. Among 87 isolates from a nonpurulent SSTI, 44% were susceptible to clindamycin and 34% contained pvl genes. In 179 invasive MRSA disease isolates, 33% were clindamycin-susceptible and 26% carried pvl genes.

- **Conclusions**: A purulent MRSA SSTI strongly predicted the presence of a clindamycin-susceptible MRSA isolate. The presence of pvl genes was almost universal among MRSA isolates causing purulent SSTIs; this was less common in nonpurulent SSTIs.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, specifically concerning antibiotic therapy and MRSA coverage, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering any of the following regimens if coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-acquired MRSA is necessary:

- **Clindamycin alone**: Effective as a standalone option.
- **TMP/SMX**: A reliable alternative.
- **A tetracycline in combination with a β-lactam, such as amoxicillin**: Provides broad coverage.
- **Linezolid alone**: Suitable for complex cases.

### Treatment approaches for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections [^112UdjhF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

This review addresses therapeutic approaches to community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, focusing on recently published data in the English-language medical literature dating from June 2004 to July 2005.

- **Recent findings**: During the reviewed time period, the overall understanding of the epidemiology and virulence of community-acquired MRSA has continued to advance. This same period has also seen numerous works dealing with newer and emerging anti-staphylococcal antimicrobial agents. Important clinical trials involving linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, dalbavancin, and telavancin have been completed. At the same time, owing to the cost of newer agents and the broad susceptibility pattern of community-acquired MRSA, many older antimicrobial agents (long-acting tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and clindamycin) have also been reexamined.

- **Summary**: As data accumulates, the newer antimicrobial agents active against community-acquired MRSA continue to demonstrate their value. Despite the appeal and abundant publications involving newer agents, older antimicrobials certainly retain a therapeutic role. Considerable work needs to be done prospectively to evaluate older agents for community-acquired MRSA disease. The most important therapeutic intervention for the majority of community-acquired MRSA infections is adequate drainage of purulent fluid collections. Antimicrobial selection for community-acquired MRSA infections should be governed by disease severity and susceptibility patterns.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy for children with acute osteomyelitis [^111qyVP9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has complicated the conventional management of osteomyelitis. While oral clindamycin is commonly used to treat acute CA-MRSA osteomyelitis, the emergence of inducible clindamycin resistance among CA-MRSA isolates has made alternative therapy necessary. The excellent oral bioavailability, susceptibility profile, favorable palatability, and low cost of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) make this drug an attractive option for treating osteomyelitis, yet its clinical efficacy for osteomyelitis has not been established.

- **Methods**: Between October 1998 and September 2009, 20 children who received a TMP-SMX-containing regimen for acute osteomyelitis at All Children's Hospital were identified from hospital records, and their cases were reviewed for clinical outcome and drug safety.

- **Results**: Patients ranged in age from 9 months to 17 years. Twelve (60%) of the patients were male. Causative pathogens were found in 8 (40%) cases, of which 5 were CA-MRSA and 3 were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven patients (55%) received TMP-SMX as their primary therapy. The median dose of TMP-SMX was 16.4 mg/kg/d. During TMP-SMX therapy, 8 patients (40%) experienced adverse events; all were considered mild. The duration of total therapy was 26 to 59 days, with a median of 40 days. All 20 patients were considered cured of their infection at the end of therapy.

- **Conclusion**: Orally administered TMP-SMX appears to be a useful and well-tolerated therapy for the treatment of acute osteomyelitis.

### News, views, and reviews. Less may be more for MRSA: The latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies [^113NfFz6]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of skin infections has evolved over time, and new evidence suggests that less acute intervention may be as good or better. For acute treatment, evidence from the emergency medicine literature shows that empiric oral antibiotics may not improve outcomes relative to incision and drainage alone. The use of packing material for wounds after draining does not lead to a decreased rate of recurrence, more rapid healing, or fewer physician visits, but it does cause more pain. For patients with multiple or recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, a comprehensive decolonization or eradication strategy is the most effective at preventing further recurrences. Several decolonization approaches exist and can be tailored to find the most appropriate method for a particular individual.

### Sequential parenteral to oral clindamycin dosing in pediatric musculoskeletal infection: A retrospective review of 30 mg/kg/d versus 40 mg/kg/d [^115u8V9V]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Children with musculoskeletal infection in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalent communities are often treated with oral clindamycin. Guidelines recommend approximately 40mg/kg/d for MRSA infections. This study investigates the clinical practice of using 30mg/kg/d of clindamycin as an alternative for outpatient dosing.

- **Methods**: Children with musculoskeletal infection treated with outpatient clindamycin from 2009 to 2014 were studied by retrospective review. The amount of clindamycin administered was determined from dose, interval, and duration of outpatient treatment. Hospital readmission, surgeries, and sequelae were assessed. Severity of illness was determined for children with osteomyelitis. The readmission rate of 25 children treated with 40mg/kg/d was compared with that of 190 children treated with 30mg/kg/d. The reason for readmission was evaluated to consider whether the antibiotic dosing strategy was a potential factor.

- **Results**: Among 215 children studied, the average outpatient duration of treatment was 32.8 days. There was no significant difference in the rate of readmission between dosing cohorts. Severity of illness scores (0–10 scale) was significantly higher among readmitted children with osteomyelitis (mean 9.8 ± 0.4) than among those with osteomyelitis who were not readmitted (mean 2.9 ± 3.2), P = 0.001. Sequelae were more common in the high-dose group and were noted in 3 children (12%) in that cohort compared with 6 children (3.2%) in the low-dose cohort (P > 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Oral dosing of 30mg/kg/d was effective for managing pediatric musculoskeletal infections in MRSA prevalent communities.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^111pS5Gp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be added for patients at risk for CA-MRSA and subsequently for patients who do not respond to beta-lactam therapy within 48 to 72 hours or who have chills, fever, a new abscess, increasing erythema, or uncontrolled pain.

Although in cellulitis, swabs and aspirates of the leading edge of the site of infection have a low yield of around 10%, when possible, antibiotic treatment should be modified based on the antimicrobial susceptibilities of organisms obtained.

- **Simple abscesses**: Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. Antibiotics are not needed. For a simple superficial abscess or boil, incision and drainage is the primary treatment, and antibiotics are not needed. Simple abscesses should not extend into deeper tissues or have multiloculated extension.

- **Complex abscesses**: Complex skin and subcutaneous abscesses are typically well circumscribed and respond to incision and drainage. Antimicrobial therapy is required if systemic signs of sepsis are present, in immunocompromised patients, if source control is incomplete, or for abscesses with significant cellulitis. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed toward the likely pathogens involved. Therapy for community-acquired MRSA should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA. Inadequate resolution should prompt consideration of further drainage, resistant pathogens, or host immune failure.

The cornerstone of treatment involves adequate drainage and targeted antimicrobial therapy based on clinical evaluation and the consideration of potential resistant organisms.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) skin infections [^116HeCRE]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). High credibility.

In the United States, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as the predominant cause of skin infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and clindamycin are often used as first-line treatment options, but clinical data are lacking.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of outpatients with skin and soft tissue infections managed from July 1 to December 31, 2006. Patients younger than 18 years of age were excluded, as were those who had no clinical admission or progress notes; were hospitalized within the 90 days before admission; were hospitalized with polymicrobial, surgical site, catheter-related, or diabetic foot infections; or were discharged to places other than home. Patient demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses, cultures, prescribed antibiotics, susceptibilities, surgical procedures, and health outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into two cohorts for further analysis: TMP-SMX and clindamycin. The primary study outcome was composite failure, defined as an additional positive MRSA culture from any site 5 to 90 days after treatment initiation or an additional intervention during a subsequent outpatient or inpatient visit. Baseline characteristics and failure rates were compared using χ(2), Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

- **Results**: A total of 149 patients were included in this study. These patients had a median age of 36 years; 55% were men, 71% were Hispanic, 42% were uninsured, and 60% received an incision and drainage procedure.

- **Is a shorter course** of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
- **Is topical therapy** (such as iodine, honey, silver, or other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy?
- **Do other adjunctive measures**, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

For infective endocarditis, especially in pediatric patients, the 2011 IDSA guidelines recommend the following:

- **Antibiotic therapy for MRSA**:
	- Administer vancomycin at 15 mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 2–6 weeks, depending on factors such as the source of the infection, presence of endovascular infection, and metastatic foci of infection, in pediatric patients with bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by MRSA.

- **Alternative option**:
	- Consider administering daptomycin at 6–10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily as an alternative.

It is advised not to use clindamycin or linezolid in pediatric patients with infective endocarditis.

### Antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections: The challenge of outpatient therapy [^115w8uoj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are becoming increasingly prevalent in both community and hospital settings. Certain strains are notorious for causing skin and soft tissue infections in patients with no established risk factors. In this article, we report our findings on the dynamic antibiotic resistance pattern of MRSA and the outpatient prescription trend for such infections within our community.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 1,876 patients evaluated in the emergency department of an urban community hospital from 2003 to 2012. Data regarding culture isolates and associated antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic treatment, site of specimen collection, age, race, and sex were collected and analyzed.

- **Results**: Analysis of 1,879 culture specimens yielded 2,193 isolates. In some cases, a single specimen yielded polymicrobial growth. Staphylococcus aureus represented 996 isolates (45.4%); 463 were methicillin-susceptible (21.1%) and 533 (24.3%) were methicillin-resistant. Most patients were prescribed a single- or poly-drug regimen of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Antimicrobial resistance analysis indicated that MRSA became increasingly resistant to the aforementioned antibiotics over time: 10% and 6% in 2012 vs. 3.5% and 3.4% in 2007 for clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a particularly virulent, rapidly adaptive pathogen that is becoming increasingly difficult to combat with existing treatments.

The incidences of inducible clindamycin resistance at two hospitals — an inner-city hospital and a suburban community hospital — were 7% and 12% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 20% and 19% for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and 14% and 35% for coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. Given the variability of inducible resistance to clindamycin found in our two hospitals, we conclude that susceptibility testing of staphylococci should include the disk diffusion induction test (D-test).

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). These guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. They discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, the management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116XRX5P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with SSTI, oral antibiotic options include clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline), and linezolid. If coverage for both β-hemolytic streptococci and CA-MRSA is required, the options include clindamycin alone or TMP-SMX or a tetracycline in association with a β-lactam (e.g. amoxicillin) or linezolid alone.

For hospitalized patients with severe SSTI, in addition to surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics, empirical therapy for MRSA should be considered pending culture data. Options include intravenous (IV) vancomycin, PO or IV linezolid 600 mg twice daily, daptomycin 4 mg/kg/dose IV once daily, clindamycin 600 mg IV or PO 3 times a day, and tigecycline 100 mg IV LD, then 50 mg twice daily.

Glycopeptides have been, for many years, the microbiological agents of choice for difficult Gram-positive infections. Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics.

Increased resistance to glycopeptides has encouraged the development of new agents active against Gram-positive bacteria, particularly for severe soft tissue infections where aggressive antimicrobial management is always recommended. Examples of such agents include linezolid, tigecycline, and daptomycin. Linezolid has been considered an agent of choice in complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs). It has the advantages of an early intravenous-to-oral switch, with the oral preparation having v

### Contrasting pediatric and adult methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates [^1117inkx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We have continued to use clindamycin for initial empiric therapy of mild or moderately ill pediatric patients likely to have a CA-MRSA infection because a better alternative therapy is not available. The results of TMP-SMX therapy for CA-MRSA have been reported for relatively few patients; therapy was frequently unsuccessful despite in vitro susceptibility of the infecting MRSA strains. Tetracyclines are not suitable for young children, and linezolid is prohibitively expensive. Our policy is to abandon clindamycin when susceptibility testing or D-test results suggest the possibility of treatment failure, usually 2–4 days into the treatment course, or for severe illness when CA-MRSA is suspected. At the time of writing, this approach has been suitable.

The pattern of clindamycin resistance among adult CA-MRSA isolates has been more complex. At UCH, more than half of the CA-MRSA isolates from adults were resistant to clindamycin. Similarly, at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, also in Chicago, from 1998 to 1999, few MRSA isolates were clindamycin susceptible among those that were collected within less than 72 hours after admission from adults with no known hospitalizations in the previous 2 years.

In contrast, more recent studies of CA-MRSA infections and MRSA colonization isolates have demonstrated low rates of clindamycin and other non–β-lactam resistance among MRSA isolates from young and urban poor adults. For example, 9 of 67 patients with MRSA infections in a military-beneficiary population in Texas from 1999 to 2001 had no risk factors for HA-MRSA.

Regarding medical management for hospital-acquired pneumonia, specifically with respect to definitive antibiotic therapy for MRSA, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend administering IV vancomycin in pediatric patients with MRSA pneumonia.

Consider administering IV clindamycin at 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (totaling 40 mg/kg/day) as empirical therapy. This is advised if the clindamycin resistance rate is low (< 10%) in stable patients without ongoing bacteremia or bloodstream infection, with the transition to oral therapy if the strain is susceptible.

Consider administering PO/IV linezolid as an alternative at 600 mg BID for individuals ≥ 12 years old and at 10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for those < 12 years old.

### Contrasting pediatric and adult methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates [^111V7TkK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolates from children have a low rate of clindamycin resistance. Studies conducted in multiple cities, including Houston, Corpus Christi, Memphis, Nashville, Louisville, Providence, and Chicago, demonstrate high rates of clindamycin susceptibility among these isolates, ranging from 67% to 100%. The two studies with the lowest susceptibility rates were conducted in Providence from 1997 to 2001 with a 74% rate and in Louisville from 1999 to 2001 with a 67% rate. These lower rates may have been due to geographic variation or represent an earlier phase in the CA-MRSA epidemic.

A possible confounder in calculating clindamycin resistance rates is the 2004 CLSI guideline. According to this guideline, each isolate that initially tests susceptible to clindamycin and resistant to erythromycin should be tested for inducible clindamycin resistance by the D-test. If the test result is positive, that isolate should be considered resistant. Published data from before 2004 may not have included D-test results in reporting clindamycin resistance rates among MRSA isolates. However, the impact of the new CLSI guideline does not change the conclusions derived from our data, although the rate of clindamycin resistance among all pediatric MRSA isolates in our sample would increase from 15.4% to 24.9% when the new guideline was considered.

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-e/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^111cQDs1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The prevalence of CA-MRSA varies worldwide, ranging from less than 1% in some countries to more than 50% in others, with the prevalence being higher in children than in adults.

Clindamycin has been used to treat CA-MRSA, although clindamycin resistance is now very common. Like penicillin, clindamycin has activity against group A and B streptococci and S. aureus. It has virtually no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, clindamycin is bacteriostatic, and its use is at high risk for the development of Clostridioides difficile infection.

Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), doxycycline, and minocycline are effective against CA-MRSA. However, they have no activity against group A and B streptococci. Therefore, if coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin, linezolid or tedizolid alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam agent (amoxicillin, cephalexin) or azithromycin in the case of beta-lactam allergy.

For many years, glycopeptides have been the microbiological agents of choice in complicated Gram-positive infections. Frequent use of vancomycin as the drug of choice for treatment of infections caused by MRSA has putatively led to the selection of the isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin.

Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides such as in vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and in vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRA) remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations have been observed.

### Risk factors associated with clindamycin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in hand abscesses [^1125s6ri]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

To identify risk factors for clindamycin resistance in acute hand abscesses caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we performed a retrospective review of 247 consecutive culture-positive hand abscesses from 2010 to 2012 at an urban hospital. Historical and laboratory data from patients with abscesses that grew MRSA, with and without clindamycin resistance, were compared in a multivariate analysis.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus grew on culture from 103 abscesses; 16% of those isolates were resistant to clindamycin. Multivariate analysis showed that younger age, intravenous drug use, and nosocomial acquired MRSA were significant risk factors for clindamycin resistance. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use and nosocomial acquired MRSA were, respectively, 11 and 5 times more likely to have clindamycin resistance. History of MRSA infection and human immunodeficiency virus were not identified as risk factors.

Patients with a history of intravenous drug use or recent contact with health care facilities appear to be a potential reservoir for emerging multidrug-resistant MRSA. Selection of clindamycin as an empiric antibiotic should be especially avoided for these groups.

Type of study/level of evidence: Prognostic III.

### Antibiotic selection for MRSA: Case presentations and review of the literature [^112kBa9L]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasingly prevalent in both community and hospital settings. Initially, MRSA was a difficult-to-treat infection, predominantly isolated in hospitalized patients. With the introduction of vancomycin and other newer antibiotics, successful treatment of nosocomial or hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) has become commonplace. More recently, MRSA has also evolved independently within communities. These community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains initially had more limited resistance profiles, but selective pressures have broadened resistance in many areas. Given the evolution of resistance among MRSA isolates, choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy is challenging.

This paper presents three cases of HA- and CA-MRSA from an inner-city, tertiary care center and reviews recent literature regarding antibiotic selection and administration.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: Does it work, which combination, and for which patients [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by standards.

In addition, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration, with an early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (e.g. with combination therapy), followed by a consolidation phase (i.e. monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

### Randomized controlled trial of cephalexin versus clindamycin for uncomplicated pediatric skin infections [^113gEFYz]. Pediatrics (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare clindamycin and cephalexin for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused predominantly by community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It was hypothesized that clindamycin would be superior to cephalexin, an antibiotic without MRSA activity, for treating these infections.

Patients aged 6 months to 18 years with uncomplicated SSTIs not requiring hospitalization were enrolled from September 2006 through May 2009. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 7 days of either cephalexin or clindamycin. The primary and secondary outcomes measured were clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours and resolution at 7 days. Cultures were obtained and tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin status.

Of the 200 enrolled patients, 69% had MRSA cultured from wounds, with most being USA300 or its subtypes, positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and clindamycin susceptible, consistent with CA-MRSA. Spontaneous drainage or a drainage procedure was performed in 97% of the subjects. By 48 to 72 hours, 94% of subjects in the cephalexin arm and 97% in the clindamycin arm showed improvement (P = .50). By 7 days, all subjects were improved, with complete resolution in 97% in the cephalexin arm and 94% in the clindamycin arm (P = .33). Fevers and age less than 1 year, but not initial erythema greater than 5 cm, were associated with early treatment failures, regardless of the antibiotic used.

In conclusion, this study found no significant difference between cephalexin and clindamycin in the treatment of uncomplicated pediatric skin infections.

### Increasing clindamycin resistance among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 57 northeast United States military treatment facilities [^111nSNyB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has led many practitioners to utilize clindamycin for treating CA-MRSA disease. However, some caution against this approach due to the potential for inducible clindamycin resistance, instead relying on drugs such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).

- **Aim**: To analyze the change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns of S. aureus isolates from 2001 to 2004 in a closed healthcare system, a period during which the use of clindamycin and TMP-SMX increased by 99% and 62%, respectively.

- **Methods**: S. aureus cultures from 57 military hospitals and clinics were compared between the periods 2001–2002 and 2003–2004. The comparison focused on body site and antibiotic sensitivity, particularly regarding the potentially inducible clindamycin-susceptible erythromycin-resistant pattern. A portion of these cultures was evaluated using a double disk diffusion test (D test).

- **Results**: The number of S. aureus-positive cultures obtained from wound sites rose significantly in both pediatric (138 to 215) and adult groups, with P < 0.05. Throughout this period, over 96% of the isolates remained susceptible to TMP-SMX. Additionally, five methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and two MRSA among 41 pediatric isolates, as well as 36 MSSA and 43 MRSA among 437 adult S. aureus specimens, were found to be D test-positive.

- **Conclusions**: By late 2004, most S. aureus isolates from this region remained susceptible to beta-lactams. Furthermore, most of the MRSA isolates were still susceptible to clindamycin and did not demonstrate inducible resistance.

### Contrasting pediatric and adult methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates [^111AkHwA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The reasons behind the disparities in clindamycin susceptibility rates among community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates obtained from adults remain unclear. Possible explanations include regional variation or characteristics of the patient populations sampled. Notably, the two studies with high clindamycin resistance rates were both conducted in Chicago at tertiary medical centers. In contrast, community-based surveys among adults have demonstrated a high rate of clindamycin susceptibility. This finding may reflect exposure to a community MRSA isolate pool similar to that affecting pediatric populations in many urban centers.

Unlike clindamycin, erythromycin resistance has been common among both pediatric and adult CA-MRSA isolates. In hospitalized children with MRSA infections at UCH during 1988–1990 and 1993–1995, 74.3% carried isolates resistant to erythromycin. Our rate, 88.1% in pediatric isolates, is slightly higher. Erythromycin resistance has also been common among CA-MRSA isolates colonizing and infecting children at many urban centers from 1990 to 2002, with rates ranging from 52% to 100%. In adults, recent studies have shown similarly high rates of erythromycin resistance, 60.9%–80%, among CA-MRSA strains in selected populations, including soldiers, jail inmates, and homeless and impoverished urban adults.

Regarding medical management for infective endocarditis, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy for MRSA, the 2011 IDSA guidelines recommend administering a loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg (actual body weight) of vancomycin in seriously ill patients. This includes patients with sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, or infective endocarditis who have a suspected MRSA infection. It is advisable to prolong the infusion time to 2 hours and administer an antihistamine before the loading dose to mitigate the risk of red man syndrome and possible anaphylaxis associated with large doses of vancomycin.

### Failure of clindamycin treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus expressing inducible clindamycin resistance in vitro [^113PKhkW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We report a case of a surgical site infection caused by clindamycin-susceptible, erythromycin-resistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that did not respond to treatment with clindamycin. The MRSA isolate obtained after treatment was resistant to clindamycin but was found to be identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to the clindamycin-susceptible isolate obtained before treatment.

A post hoc erythromycin-induction test (D test) confirmed the presence of in vitro inducible macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance (iMLS) in the pretreatment isolate. Erythromycin induction testing confirmed in vitro iMLS in 90 (56%) of 161 erythromycin-resistant, clindamycin-susceptible clinical S. aureus isolates overall and in a significantly higher proportion (78%) of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates from pediatric patients. Our clinical laboratory currently tests all S. aureus isolates for iMLS before reporting clindamycin susceptibility.

### Does adjunctive clindamycin have a role in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia? A protocol for the adjunctive treatment domain of the staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) randomized controlled trial [^111hkjyp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The SNAP trial provides the opportunity to inform best practice and clinical care worldwide in the use of adjunctive clindamycin (or lincomycin) for all SAB. The available sample size is substantially larger than in any clinical trial for SAB at the time of writing, with recruitment progressing on target, and the study design provides early opportunities to discover either benefit or harm through iterative scheduled analyses after every 500 participants reach the primary outcome.

In contrast to the presumed benefits of adjunctive treatment with clindamycin, other in vitro models have suggested possible drug interactions that diminish the efficacy of the backbone β-lactam antibiotics for SAB treatment. In vitro data addressing drug interactions for the treatment of SAB suggest that clindamycin in combination with a cell wall–active antibacterial agent may result in diminished clearance efficacy of antibiotics against S. aureus, but there are no supporting in vivo or clinical trial data for this. The SNAP trial provides the opportunity to answer this question definitively, with the additional benefit of including all susceptibility phenotypes of SAB in the same clinical trial, thus answering the question concerning PSSA, MSSA, and MRSA to inform clinicians caring for patients globally.

The choice of dose and duration of clindamycin for the adjunctive domain was clinically derived, using experience to balance possible adverse effects with optimal dosing. Clinicians determined the shortest duration thought to have an effect, based on the available in vitro evidence and guidelines. Alternatives consider the varying individual patient needs and conditions.

### Clindamycin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for uncomplicated skin infections [^116Ubdzu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Skin and skin-structure infections are common in ambulatory settings. However, the efficacy of various antibiotic regimens in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is unclear.

- **Methods**: We enrolled outpatients with uncomplicated skin infections who had cellulitis, abscesses larger than 5 cm in diameter (smaller for younger children), or both. Patients were enrolled at four study sites. All abscesses underwent incision and drainage. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for 10 days. Both patients and investigators were unaware of the treatment assignments and microbiologic test results. The primary outcome was clinical cure 7 to 10 days after the end of treatment.

- **Results**: A total of 524 patients were enrolled (264 in the clindamycin group and 260 in the TMP-SMX group), including 155 children (29.6%). One hundred sixty patients (30.5%) had an abscess, 280 (53.4%) had cellulitis, and 82 (15.6%) had a mixed infection, defined as at least one abscess lesion and one cellulitis lesion. S. aureus was isolated from the lesions of 217 patients (41.4%); the isolates in 167 (77.0%) of these patients were MRSA. The proportion of patients cured was similar in the two treatment groups in the intention-to-treat population (80.3% in the clindamycin group and 77.7% in the TMP-SMX group; difference, -2.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.2 to 4.9; P = 0.52) and in the populations of patients who could be evaluated (466 patients; 89.5% in the clindamycin group and…

### MRSA: Treating people with infection [^113isEmX]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) possesses a gene that renders it resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. While MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), particularly in the nose, it can lead to infections, especially in individuals with prolonged hospital admissions, underlying diseases, or following antibiotic use. Approximately 20% of S. aureus in blood cultures from England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is methicillin-resistant.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review to address the clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? Our search included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other significant databases up to November 2009. Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most current version of this review. We also incorporated harm alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We identified 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review provides information regarding the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), and quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin).

### Dapzura RT [^111iQNsg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either daptomycin for injection or a standard of care comparator, which included intravenous therapy with vancomycin, semi-synthetic penicillin, first-generation cephalosporin, or clindamycin. Patients were allowed to switch to oral therapy after demonstrating clinical improvement; no minimum intravenous dosing was required.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety of daptomycin for injection. The clinical outcome was determined by the resolution or improvement of symptoms at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, conducted 7 to 14 days after the last dose. This assessment was performed by the site-level Blinded Evaluator.

Of the 82 subjects randomized in the study, 81 were treated with either daptomycin for injection or a comparator and included in the safety population. Out of these, 73 had proven S. aureus bacteremia at baseline. Of those 73, 51 subjects were randomized to the daptomycin for injection group, and 22 to the comparator group. The mean duration of intravenous therapy was 12 days, ranging from 1 to 44 days. Forty-eight subjects switched to oral therapy, with a mean duration of 21 days. The clinical success rates determined at 7 to 14 days after the last dose of therapy (IV and oral) at the TOC visit were 88% (45/51) for the daptomycin group and 77% (17/22) for the comparator group.

### Considerations for higher doses of daptomycin in critically ill patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^117Ef3ew]. Clinical infectious diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Higher daptomycin doses are advocated for select methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-related infections, but the probabilities of target attainment (PTA) and toxicity of these doses have not been characterized in critically ill patients.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical outcomes of a cohort of critically ill patients treated with daptomycin 6–8 mg/kg/day for primarily Staphylococcus species-related infections. Daptomycin concentrations were measured intensively over the initial 96-hour dosing period. Data were modeled by population PK analyses, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the probabilities of effect and toxicity with standard and alternate dosing regimens.

- **Results**: Fifty patients with a mean (SD) age of 69.7 (12.2) years, weight 74.5 (20.3) kg, and creatinine clearance 56.8 (38.2) mL/minute were enrolled with measurements of 12 (2.2) daptomycin samples per patient. Significantly lower daptomycin exposures were observed despite comparable doses in a subset of patients (n = 13) with augmented clearance (CL). No covariates of CL were identified, but this subset was significantly more likely to be in severe sepsis or septic shock, have higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and MRSA bacteremia. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (30.7% vs 10.8%) in patients with augmented daptomycin CL. Use of an empiric fixed dose of 750 mg of daptomycin is predicted to achieve a comparable PTA with a lower probability of toxicity compared to the use of 10 mg/kg in critically ill patients.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^117MdSXz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

The emergence of community-associated MRSA strains has greatly influenced the selection of empirical antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (ABSSSIs). An understanding of local microbial epidemiologic patterns and susceptibility is essential to provide adequate empirical coverage for MRSA.

For the treatment of an abscess, the IDSA guidelines recommend, in addition to incision and drainage, administration of an antibiotic active against MRSA when initial antibiotic treatment has failed or when the patient has immunosuppression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or hypotension. For cellulitis and erysipelas, including an antibiotic with activity against MRSA and group A streptococcus is recommended when the infection is associated with penetrating trauma or when there is evidence of MRSA infection, MRSA colonization, injecting drug use, or SIRS.

Including an antimicrobial agent active against MRSA in the treatment of surgical wound infections is recommended in patients with risk factors for infection by this microorganism, such as nasal colonization, prior infection, hospitalization, or recent antibiotic administration. Anti-MRSA agents for ABSSSIs include vancomycin, considered the first-line parenteral treatment of serious MRSA infections in hospitalized patients, as well as linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. Other agents with reliable MRSA activity approved for ABSSSIs include ceftaroline, tedizolid, and dalb.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: A clinical practice guideline [^115FF4Ke]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

The occurrence of adverse effects depends on the antibiotic. With clindamycin, the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, predominantly diarrhea, is approximately 10% higher than with no antibiotics (high-quality evidence). TMP-SMX probably increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects by a smaller amount, approximately 2% (moderate-quality evidence), and it is predominantly nausea rather than diarrhea. The severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea was not described but is likely to range from mild to severe. Two large trials monitored for Clostridium difficile infection with routine clinical monitoring and no such infection occurred in any treatment arm.

Overall, there is no important difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin (high-quality evidence). In patients who were initially cured, one study suggested that clindamycin may reduce the risk of early recurrence at one month by approximately 7% (low-quality evidence), but the confidence interval was wide and this result is inconsistent with indirect evidence from other RCTs. These studies suggest that the reduction in risk of abscess recurrence compared with placebo is similar for both TMP-SMX and clindamycin. Whether clindamycin reduces abscess recurrence more than TMP-SMX is therefore uncertain (low-quality evidence). Local resistance patterns may affect the relative effectiveness of each antibiotic option. Clindamycin has a 10% higher risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea than TMP-SMX (high-quality evidence).

The panel also considered evidence for cephalosporins compared with TMP-SMX and clindamycin.
