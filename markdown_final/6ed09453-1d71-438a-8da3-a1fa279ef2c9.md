## Question

explain an elevated a1c in diabetes range, but not on 2 separate occasions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret a single HbA1c in the diabetes range that is not reproduced on a separate occasion, and what evaluation steps should follow to reconcile discordant results and avoid misdiagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic thresholds and the requirement for confirmation. Then, I should verify how to handle discordant repeat testing and whether the same or different test should be repeated. Next, I will examine technical and pre-analytical factors that can falsely elevate HbA1c, followed by clinical conditions that alter the HbA1c–glycemia relationship. After that, I will consider physiological reasons for discordance across glycemic tests. Finally, I will synthesize an interpretation and outline concrete clinical actions and follow-up, ensuring the plan is evidence-based and reference-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold and the need for confirmation: diabetes can be diagnosed with an HbA1c ≥ 6.5% using an NGSP-certified, DCCT-standardized laboratory method, but unless classic symptoms or hyperglycemic crisis are present, any diagnostic result should be repeated to rule out error, with a preference to repeat the same test to increase concordance [^114kB3Pu] [^113FtkYW] [^1112nrRw] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if the second test is below threshold; in cases where an initial HbA1c ≥ 6.5% is not confirmed on repeat testing, diabetes is not diagnosed at that time, and the algorithm advises repeating the test that was above the cut point and making the diagnosis only on the basis of a confirmed result, recognizing that analytic and biologic variability can lead to border-zone reversals on retesting, which is least likely for A1c compared with FPG and OGTT [^116xiHbV] [^117VZPG4] [^1112nrRw].

> Wait, let me verify potential technical explanations for a single high HbA1c: although modern standardization has improved accuracy, intermethod bias and drift can occur, especially between different platforms or point-of-care devices, so I should confirm that the original test used an NGSP-certified, DCCT-aligned lab method and avoid non-FDA-cleared POC devices for diagnosis, as ADA 2025 restricts diagnostic use of POC A1c to FDA-cleared devices in CLIA-certified settings with trained personnel [^1154km5Y] [^117QG6Tr] [^113UDPmE] [^111QPPKS].

> I need to check for clinical conditions that uncouple HbA1c from true glycemia, because altered red cell turnover or hemoglobin variants can falsely elevate or depress A1c; iron deficiency and reduced RBC turnover in older adults or CKD can raise A1c, while hemolysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, sickle disorders, HIV, G6PD deficiency, hemodialysis, pregnancy, or EPO therapy can lower or otherwise distort A1c, and in such settings ADA advises relying on glucose-based diagnosis rather than HbA1c [^113FtkYW] [^113RwGrs] [^112MpBcB] [^111kfdSB] [^111NHSYs].

> Let me consider physiological discordance across tests: A1c integrates fasting and postprandial glycemia over ~3 months, so an elevated A1c with nondiabetic FPG can reflect predominant postprandial spikes or individual variability in glycation rate (the glycation gap), and race/ethnicity can be associated with modest A1c differences independent of measured glucose, which means discordance does not automatically imply lab error but warrants targeted follow-up testing and context-aware interpretation [^1112nrRw] [^114ycGUw] [^115qMjyB] [^1167jh24] [^115P6fnB] [^111XYuEL].

> I will now interpret the clinical scenario: if the elevated HbA1c in the diabetes range is not reproduced, diabetes should not be diagnosed, and the patient often falls into increased risk categories; wait, I initially wrote "prediabetes range (5.7- < .7 < " which is incorrect, I should correct that to the ADA prediabetes range of HbA1c 5.7–6.4% if applicable on subsequent testing, while also recognizing that a normal repeat HbA1c with risk factors still confers elevated future risk and justifies surveillance and lifestyle counseling [^116xiHbV] [^117VZPG4] [^114kB3Pu] [^115nQQ4H].

> Next, I should review immediate actions: I need to ensure the confirmatory test is repeated using an NGSP-certified laboratory assay and avoid non-diagnostic POC settings; if discordance persists, the test that was above the threshold should be repeated again, and any diagnosis should be anchored to a confirmed assay as per ADA algorithms [^114kB3Pu] [^117QG6Tr] [^1154km5Y].

> Hold on, I should verify that interfering conditions have been assessed: a brief targeted history and labs to look for anemia, iron deficiency, hemoglobinopathy risk, kidney disease, pregnancy, recent bleeding or transfusions, HIV status, dialysis or EPO use can guide whether to abandon HbA1c for glucose-based criteria in this case, which ADA 2025 explicitly recommends in conditions that alter the HbA1c–glycemia relationship [^113FtkYW] [^113RwGrs] [^111kfdSB].

> I will now examine glucose-based testing to resolve discordance: obtaining fasting plasma glucose and, when the picture remains equivocal or postprandial hyperglycemia is suspected, a 75-g OGTT can detect diabetes missed by A1c, with OGTT being more sensitive to post-challenge dysglycemia and recommended when A1c and glucose measures disagree or in high-risk profiles [^1112nrRw] [^114ycGUw] [^1167jh24] [^116Gtp7b].

> But wait, what if day-to-day variability is the issue rather than a categorical mismatch? Short-term continuous glucose monitoring over 10–14 days with attention to time-in-range and postprandial excursions can contextualize discordant results and help distinguish sustained hyperglycemia from transient spikes, complementing but not replacing A1c for diagnosis [^112s6yu2] [^117N8iSu].

> I should double-check risk stratification and follow-up: even without confirmed diabetes, elevated or borderline values predict future diabetes and cardiovascular events, so I should provide intensive lifestyle counseling, document the discordance workup to avoid premature labeling, and arrange periodic reassessment, recognizing that combined markers (e.g. A1c plus FPG or OGTT) improve risk prediction stability over a single metric [^115nQQ4H] [^115yYrcQ] [^114kB3Pu].

> In summary, an isolated, unconfirmed HbA1c ≥ 6.5% should not trigger a diabetes diagnosis; instead, I need to confirm with a standardized repeat, evaluate for assay and biological interferences, consider physiological discordance, and, if needed, pivot to glucose-based testing before assigning a label or treatment, while counseling on risk and arranging surveillance to catch progression early and accurately [^1112nrRw] [^113FtkYW] [^114kB3Pu].

An elevated A1c in the diabetes range on a single test, but not on two separate occasions, most often reflects **biological variability** or **laboratory error** rather than true chronic hyperglycemia [^117VZPG4]. A1c can be **falsely elevated** by conditions that alter red cell turnover (e.g. iron deficiency anemia, CKD, hemoglobinopathies) or by assay interference, and it may not align with glucose-based tests due to differences in what each measures [^114dkPgY] [^111kfdSB] [^1112nrRw]. ADA 2025 guidelines require **confirmation** of an initial A1c ≥ 6.5% with a repeat A1c or a glucose-based test (FPG, OGTT, or random glucose with symptoms) before diagnosing diabetes [^114kB3Pu]. If the repeat test is normal, the patient should be monitored as high risk, and alternative markers (fructosamine, CGM) considered if discordance persists [^114dkPgY] [^117N8iSu].

---

## Biological variability and laboratory error

Biological variability means that A1c reflects average glycemia over ~3 months; however, day-to-day glucose fluctuations and short-term changes can cause **transient elevations** that may not persist on repeat testing [^111XYuEL] [^112k9Mys]. Laboratory error can also lead to **false elevations** due to pre-analytical, analytical, or post-analytical issues; repeat testing helps rule these out [^111LudLX] [^114dkPgY].

---

## Conditions affecting red blood cell turnover

A1c assumes a normal RBC lifespan; conditions that alter turnover can **skew results**:

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: prolongs RBC lifespan, increasing glycation and falsely elevating A1c [^111NHSYs].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: uremia and altered erythropoiesis can falsely elevate A1c [^112MpBcB].

- **Hemoglobinopathies**: variants (e.g. sickle cell trait) can interfere with assays and falsely elevate A1c [^111kfdSB].

---

## Assay interference and methodological limitations

Assay interference arises when hemoglobin variants or other factors affect certain A1c methods, causing false elevations [^111kfdSB] [^113RwGrs], and **methodological limitations** — including assay differences and lack of standardization in some settings — can produce inconsistent results [^113UDPmE] [^111LudLX].

---

## Discordance between A1c and glucose-based tests

A1c and glucose tests assess different aspects of glycemia, which can lead to **discordance**. Postprandial hyperglycemia may present as an **elevated A1c with normal FPG**, reflecting high postprandial glucose or increased glycation rates [^1112nrRw]. In contrast, **fasting hyperglycemia** may show a high FPG with normal A1c due to increased hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates [^1143QmbE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **ADA 2025 guidelines emphasize confirming** an initial A1c ≥ 6.5% before diagnosis:

- **Repeat testing**: confirm with a repeat A1c or a glucose-based test (FPG, OGTT, or random glucose with symptoms) [^114kB3Pu] [^117VZPG4].

- **Discordant results**: if tests disagree, repeat the abnormal test and base diagnosis on the confirmed result [^114kB3Pu] [^116xiHbV].

- **Special populations**: use glucose-based tests when A1c may be unreliable (e.g. hemoglobinopathies, pregnancy, CKD, recent transfusion) [^113RwGrs] [^113FtkYW].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Monitoring**: if repeat testing is normal, monitor as high risk for diabetes and reassess periodically [^111n9ELU].

- **Alternative markers**: consider fructosamine or CGM when A1c and glucose tests remain discordant [^114dkPgY] [^111zru9N] [^112s6yu2].

- **Patient education**: explain the need for confirmation and the meaning of discordant results to reduce anxiety and improve adherence [^111mCS9d].

An elevated A1c in the diabetes range on a single test, but not on two separate occasions, most often reflects **biological variability** or **laboratory error** rather than true chronic hyperglycemia. A1c can be falsely elevated by conditions that alter red cell turnover (e.g. iron deficiency anemia, CKD, hemoglobinopathies) or by assay interference, and it may not align with glucose-based tests due to differences in what each measures [^114dkPgY] [^111kfdSB] [^111NHSYs].

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113FtkYW]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining blood glucose for the diagnosis of diabetes in conditions associated with an altered relationship between HbA1c and glycemia. These conditions include hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), G6PD deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or EPO therapy.

### Assessing glycemia in diabetes using self-monitoring blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^112k9Mys]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, successful management of blood glucose control is becoming increasingly important. Approaches to assessing glycemia include the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

- **Objectives**: The study aims to assess the evidence underlying the use of these two modalities, evaluate confounders and sources of error in each test, describe upcoming developments, and reach evidence-based conclusions on their optimal use.

- **Data sources, study selection, and data extraction**: Reports identified from MEDLINE searches (1976–2005) using relevant terms were selected for quality and relevance to the stated questions. Particular attention was paid to larger cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and established recommendations.

- **Data synthesis**: If used properly, SMBG gives an acceptably accurate reflection of immediate plasma glucose levels. Study results vary, but in general, the evidence supports a positive effect of regular SMBG for improving glycemia, particularly in individuals treated with insulin. The best timing of SMBG and its frequency are controversial issues; however, the clinical recommendation is for regular monitoring with frequency depending on the treatment and the instability of glycemia. In the relatively near term, SMBG could gradually be replaced by continuous glucose monitoring. HbA1c measures long-term glycemic control, reflecting a time-weighted mean over the previous 3 to 4 months. There are a number of physiologic and methodologic confounders that can affect HbA1c, but standardization of assays is addressing these issues.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^1112nrRw]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests, such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and A1C, obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, changes over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In cases of elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, there may be a likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia. Conversely, in scenarios of high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point, augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, as this increases the likelihood of concurrence. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are situations in which results from two different tests, such as FPG and A1C, are available for the same patient. In this scenario, if both tests are above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Point-of-care HbA1c in clinical practice: Caveats and considerations for optimal use [^111QPPKS]. Diabetes Care (2024). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is widely used for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Accurate measurement of A1C is necessary for optimal clinical value. Assay standardization has markedly improved the accuracy and consistency of A1C testing. Devices to measure A1C at the point of care (POC) are commercially available, allowing rapid results when the patient is seen.

In this review, we describe how standardization of A1C testing was achieved, leading to high-quality results in clinical laboratories.

- **Advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing**: We address the use of POC A1C testing in clinical situations and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of POC A1C testing. We emphasize the importance of considering the limitations of these devices and following correct testing procedures to ensure that accurate A1C results are obtained for optimal care of patients.

### Elevated A1C in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^115nQQ4H]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A1C is an integrated measure of circulating glucose levels and tracks well in individuals over time. Epidemiological studies have shown that A1C values in nondiabetic adults predict incident diabetes, cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and total mortality. In these studies, A1C values well within the "normal" range (i.e. A1C 6%) are common in the general population of nondiabetic adults in the U.S. It was observed that A1C levels are associated with risk factors for type 2 diabetes and its complications even in the absence of elevated glucose levels.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for in-hospital hyperglycemia, specifically concerning HbA1c testing, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining HbA1c testing in all patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia (random blood glucose > 140 mg/dL; > 7.8 mmol/L) admitted to the hospital if no HbA1c test is available from the prior 3 months.

### Abnormally low hemoglobin A1c as harbinger of hemoglobinopathy [^116c43SF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c is frequently used in primary care to screen for and monitor disorders of glucose metabolism. A number of clinical syndromes may impact the accuracy of this laboratory value. This report describes a case of abnormally low hemoglobin A1c that was the result of an asymptomatic compound hemoglobinopathy (homozygous hemoglobin S disease and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) that had gone previously undiagnosed. Primary care physicians must be aware of such pitfalls in the use of this laboratory value and be prepared to use other values to monitor for and assess disorders of glucose metabolism.

### Physiologic concepts that may revise the interpretation and implications of HbA1C in clinical medicine: An American perspective [^112MpBcB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2015). Low credibility.

HbA1c, a routinely used integrated measure of glycemic control, is traditionally thought to be equivalent to mean blood glucose in hematologically normal individuals. Therefore, particularly as the methodology of measuring HbA1c has been standardized, clinical decisions dependent on mean blood glucose are often predominantly decided based on the interpretation of measured HbA1c. However, in this commentary, now that a more routine method of measuring red cell life span has been developed, we present evidence that the relationship between HbA1c and mean blood glucose is influenced by variation in red blood cell survival even in the hematologically normal. This variation has consequences for the appropriate interpretation of HbA1c in diverse clinical conditions such as the diagnosis of diabetes and management of diabetes in chronic kidney disease.

### Reduced testing frequency for glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c, is associated with deteriorating diabetes control [^114KFwHc]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing frequency and diabetes control, building on previous findings that monitoring outside international guidance on testing frequency is widespread in patients with diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that the retest interval is linked to changes in HbA1c levels.

The research design and methods involved examining repeat HbA1c tests (400,497 tests in 79,409 patients from 2008 to 2011) processed by three clinical laboratories in the U.K. We analyzed the relationship between the retest interval and two outcomes: 1) the percentage change in HbA1c and 2) the proportion of cases showing a significant HbA1c rise. Demographic factors' effects on these findings were also explored.

The results indicated that the optimal testing frequency to maximize the downward trajectory in HbA1c was four times per year, particularly for those with an initial HbA1c value of ≥ 7% (≥ 53 mmol/mol), aligning with international guidance. Testing every 3 months was associated with a 3.8% reduction in HbA1c compared to a 1.5% increase with annual testing, while more frequent testing yielded no additional benefit. Compared with annual monitoring, testing every 3 months halved the proportion of patients showing a significant rise in HbA1c (7–10% vs. 15–20%).

The conclusions of this study provide objective evidence, from a large multicenter dataset, that testing outside guidance on HbA1c monitoring frequency is associated with significant detrimental effects on diabetes control. To achieve the optimal downward trajectory in HbA1c, the monitoring frequency should be adhered to as per the guidelines.

### A review of variant hemoglobins interfering with hemoglobin A1c measurement [^111kfdSB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used routinely to monitor long-term glycemic control in people with diabetes mellitus, as HbA1c is directly related to risks for diabetic complications. The accuracy of HbA1c methods can be adversely affected by the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) variants or elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). The effect of each variant or elevated HbF must be examined with each specific method.

The most common Hb variants worldwide are HbS, HbE, HbC, and HbD. All of these Hb variants have single amino acid substitutions in the Hb beta chain. HbF is the major hemoglobin during intrauterine life; by the end of the first year, HbF falls to values close to adult levels of approximately 1%. However, elevated HbF levels can occur in certain pathologic conditions or with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.

In a series of publications over the past several years, the effects of these four most common Hb variants and elevated HbF have been described. There are clinically significant interferences with some methods for each of these variants. A summary is provided showing which methods are affected by the presence of the heterozygous variants S, E, C, and D, and elevated HbF.

Methods are divided by type (immunoassay, ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography, boronate affinity, other) with an indication of whether the result is artificially increased or decreased by the presence of an Hb variant. Laboratorians should be aware of the limitations of their method with respect to these interferences.

### Performance of A1c versus OGTT for the diagnosis of prediabetes in a community-based screening [^116Gtp7b]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Reliable identification of individuals at risk for developing diabetes is critical to instituting preventative strategies. Studies suggest that the accuracy of using hemoglobin A1c as a sole diagnostic criterion for diabetes may be variable across different ethnic groups. We postulate that there will be a lack of concordance between A1c and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosing prediabetes across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations.

A total of 218 asymptomatic adults at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) were assessed with A1c and OGTT for the diagnosis of prediabetes. Glucose homeostasis status was assigned as no diabetes (A1c 6.4% [46 mmol/mol]). Inclusion criteria were age greater than 18 years and at least one of the following: a family history of diabetes, a history of gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, non-Caucasian race, or obesity. Subjects received a fasting 75-g OGTT and A1c on the same day. Bowker's test of symmetry was employed to determine agreement between the tests.

Data from 99 Hispanic patients and 79 NHW patients were analyzed. There was no concordance between A1c and OGTT for Hispanic (P = 0.002) or NHW individuals (P = 0.003) with prediabetes.

In conclusion, A1c is discordant with OGTT among Hispanic and NHW subjects for the diagnosis of prediabetes. Sole use of A1c to designate glycemic status will result in a greater prevalence of prediabetes among Hispanic and NHW New Mexicans.

### A1c variability and the risk of microvascular complications in type 1 diabetes: Data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [^11787jc6]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

An alternative possible explanation for our data relates to the fact that the risk of microvascular complications seems to rise exponentially, rather than linearly, as A1c rises. Thus, although patients who have more variable A1c values will spend the same time above and below their mean value as another with comparatively stable A1c, their average risk will be higher. This is because their periods of sustained glycemia far above their mean will place them at an especially high complication risk, which will more than cancel out any reduction in risk resulting from them also having equal periods far below their mean. If true, it would be expected that this effect would be exaggerated as the individual's mean A1c was higher, which may be one reason why the influence of A1c variability seems greater in conventionally treated patients.

Another possible reason linking A1c fluctuations with complication risk is the consistent observation that improving glycemic control can lead to a short-term worsening in retinopathy before subsequently resulting in a net long-term improvement: the "normoglycemic reentry phenomenon". Indeed, the potential for early retinopathy worsening was one of the main concerns of improving glucose control when the DCCT was conceived. The mechanism for this paradoxical deterioration is not fully known but is thought to involve changes in ocular blood flow and increased IGF-1 concentrations consequent on improved glycemic control. Whatever the cause, the cyclical improvements in glycemic control found in patients with more variable A1c could result in a cyclical pattern of retinopathy progression and regression.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: A systematic review [^111n9ELU]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Use of A1C for the identification of persons with undiagnosed diabetes has been investigated for a number of years. A1C better reflects long-term glycemic exposure than diagnostic tests based on point-in-time measures of fasting and postload blood glucose and has improved test-retest reliability. In addition, A1C does not require fasting or the 2-hour wait of the oral glucose tolerance test. These advantages should lead to increased identification and more timely treatment of persons with diabetes. Recently, an American Diabetes Association (ADA)-organized international expert committee recommended the adoption of the A1C assay for the diagnosis of diabetes at a cut point of 6.5%. This cut point was primarily derived from a review of studies that examined the association of A1C values with incident retinopathy, with some of the most influential data obtained from recently published prospective studies. Retinopathy was chosen as the ultimate criterion because it is among the main complications of diabetes. Identifying the point on the A1C distribution most closely related to future retinopathy will identify persons in the greatest need of interventions for preventing diabetes complications.

In addition to utility and convenience, A1C could help identify persons at increased risk of developing diabetes. This is an important public health priority since a structured lifestyle program or the drug metformin can reduce the incidence of diabetes by at least 50% and 30%, respectively.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2010 [^116xiHbV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic threshold, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. For instance, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dL or 7.0 mmol/L) or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. Admittedly, in most circumstances, the "nondiabetic" test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C and somewhat more likely for FPG.

### A1c versus glucose testing: A comparison [^1143QmbE]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Notwithstanding the use of glucose (FPG and/or the OGTT) as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of diabetes for many years, glucose testing suffers from several deficiencies. The requirement that the subject be fasting at the time the blood is drawn is a considerable inconvenience. While our ability to measure glucose has improved, inherent biological variability can produce very large differences within and among individuals. In conjunction with the lack of sample stability, which is difficult to overcome in clinical practice, these factors result in a lack of reproducibility of glucose testing.

A1C, which reflects chronic blood glucose values, is routinely used in monitoring glycemic control and guiding therapy. The significant reduction in microvascular complications with lower A1C and the absence of sample lability, combined with several other advantages, have led to the recommendation by some organizations that A1C be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that racial differences in A1C values may be present, and the possible clinical significance of this needs to be determined. Importantly, A1C cannot be measured in certain conditions. Despite these caveats, A1C can be measured accurately in the vast majority of people. A comprehension of the factors that influence A1C values and the conditions where it should not be used will produce accurate and clinically meaningful results. The convenience of sampling at any time without regard to food ingestion makes it likely that measurement of A1C will result in the de…

### Pitfalls of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes [^1167jh24]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Many health care providers screen high-risk individuals exclusively with an HbA1c despite its insensitivity for detecting dysglycemia. The two cases presented describe the inherent caveats of interpreting HbA1c without performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

- **Case 1**: Reflects the risk of overdiagnosing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an older African American male. His HbA1c levels, although variable, were primarily in the mid-prediabetes range (5.7–6.4% [39–46 mmol/mol]) for many years, although the initial OGTT demonstrated borderline impaired fasting glucose with a fasting plasma glucose of 102 mg/dL [5.7 mmol/L], without evidence for impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose ≥ 140–199 mg/dl [7.8–11.1 mmol/L]). Because subsequent HbA1c levels were diagnostic of T2D (6.5%-6.6% [48–49 mmol/mol]), a second OGTT performed was normal.

- **Case 2**: Illustrates the risk of underdiagnosing T2D in a male with HIV, having normal HbA1c levels over many years, who underwent an OGTT when mild prediabetes (HbA1c = 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]) developed that was diagnostic of T2D.

To avoid inadvertent mistreatment, it is therefore essential to perform an OGTT, despite its limitations, in high-risk individuals, particularly when glucose or fructosamine and HbA1c values are discordant. Innate differences in the relationship between fructosamine or fasting glucose to HbA1c are demonstrated by the glycation gap or hemoglobin glycation index.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^114ycGUw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, there may be a higher likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia. In the opposite scenario, where there is a high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point, augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, as this increases the likelihood of concurrence. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if both tests are above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Effect of biological variation in HbA1c and blood glucose on the diagnosis of prediabetes [^112Smomj]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The single-metric diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes was based on the ADA cutpoints. The two-dimensional confirmation-by-agreement approach used by Selvin et al. for diagnosing confirmed undiagnosed diabetes was extended to include the diagnosis of confirmed normal and confirmed undiagnosed prediabetes using two-dimensional combinations of FPG, 2hOGTT, and HbA1c. The use of three diagnostic outcomes (normal, prediabetic, and diabetic) for each pair of diagnostic metrics (FPG + HbA1c, FPG + 2hOGTT, and 2hOGTT + HbA1c) resulted in nine-compartment models. These models included (1) three diagonal compartments from bottom left to top right with confirmed normal, confirmed prediabetes, or confirmed diabetes diagnoses, and (2) six compartments (three above and three below the confirmed box in each column) with ambiguous or 'mismatched' diagnoses where the two metrics disagree.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic and other characteristics of the study cohort. Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies, and continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations or ranges as appropriate.

### Glycemic variability and diabetes complications: Does it matter? Of course it does [^115dgKKy]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

There is no argument that improving mean levels of glycemic control, as judged by assays for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), reduces the risks of microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease events in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, observations in some trials have suggested that targeting HbA1c to suggested targets may not always result in improved outcomes for people with long-standing type 2 diabetes. The reasons why the glycemic control strategies that primarily use HbA1c in these studies did not have predicted outcomes are not clear. Thus, controversy remains as to whether there are glycemic metrics beyond HbA1c that can be defined as effective measures that can be used in addition to HbA1c to help in assessing the risk of an individual developing diabetes complications.

In this regard, the concept of "glycemic variability" (GV) is one metric that has attracted a lot of attention. GV can be simply defined as the degree to which a patient's blood glucose level fluctuates between high (peaks) and low (nadir) levels. The best and most precise way to assess GV is also one that is still debated. Thus, while there is universal agreement that HbA1c is the gold standard for the primary clinical target, there is no consensus as to whether other proposed glycemic metrics hold promise to provide additional clinical data or whether there should be additional targets beyond HbA1c. Therefore, given the controversy, we provide a point-counterpoint debate on this issue. In the point narrative below, Dr. Hirsch provides his argument.

### Translating the A1C assay into estimated average glucose values [^111XYuEL]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

Our results strongly support a simple linear relationship between mean glucose and A1C levels in a clinically relevant range of glycemia. Our data fulfilled the a priori quality criterion; i.e. 90% of the estimates fell within the ± 15% range of the regression line. This criterion was considered realistic, allowing for the imprecision of the A1C assay, CGM, and self-monitored blood glucose tests.

The large population allowed us to demonstrate that the relationship between A1C and AG was consistent across prespecified subgroups. The tight relationship and consistency across different subgroups suggest that for many, if not most, patients with diabetes, there are no significant factors affecting the relationship between mean glucose levels and A1C. There was a suggestion (P = 0.07) that the regression line was different for African Americans, such that for a given value of A1C, African Americans might have a slightly lower mean glucose level. This borderline result requires further study to be confident that there is no relationship between ethnicity and the relationship between mean glucose and A1C. There was also a suggestion that age may affect the relationship between AG and A1C; however, the effect was not monotonic. The regression lines for each age group crossed at an A1C of 7%, with the first and last tertile being similar and the middle tertile being different. We suspect that this is a spurious finding. There are other well-recognized clinical factors, such as anemia and altered erythrocyte turnover, which can affect A1C results measured with all assays.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^1167MvKp]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results.

### A1C: Recommendations, debates, and questions [^111bidT7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG.

We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### Accuracy of HbA1c as monitored by external quality assessment and compared with patient mean values [^113UDPmE]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2018). Low credibility.

The accuracy and trueness of results from a laboratory test, such as the HbA1c test, should not be taken for granted but must be checked continuously. A tool for this is participation in external quality assessment (EQA) for all laboratories performing the HbA1c test. An additional possibility to detect changes in trueness is to monitor variations in patient cohort mean or median values that are not explained by changes in treatment or selection of patients.

- **Methods**: Results reported to an EQA scheme for HbA1c over 20 years have been extracted from the Equalis database. These results are compared to analytical performance specifications (APS) and to the mean HbA1c levels for the Swedish population of persons with type 2 diabetes.

- **Results**: The accuracy of the HbA1c test has improved during the period. The hospital lab methods used in Sweden now fulfill APS agreed upon by professional organizations in Sweden. The accuracy for point-of-care tests (POCT) methods varies over time and fulfills APS for certain periods. The bias found for some methods might explain changes seen in patient mean values for HbA1c in Sweden between 2007 and 2017.

- **Conclusions**: The global standardization of HbA1c has resulted in improved comparability for HbA1c results worldwide. However, even small variations in trueness for the methods in use might significantly impact mean HbA1c values for cohorts of patients. When a systematic error is observed for a specific method, it is essential that manufacturers correct the method without delay.

### A1c: Recommendations, debates, and questions [^113F84CF]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Nathan took the position that such eAG reporting with A1C will serve a useful purpose. He began by commenting that "diabetes has always been sugar-centric" and noted that what was subsequently found to be glycated hemoglobin was first described as a minor hemoglobin fraction in 1958; Rahbar found an increase in levels with diabetes a decade later. The 1997 ADA Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), and the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) intervention trials, he said, "cement A1C as the means by which we measure our targets".

The goal of treatment is, he continued, an A1C < 7%, observing that "we're guiding people based on A1C". This led him to question the use of both glucose and A1C, two different measures, in treating diabetes, suggesting that this might be confusing for patients. He suggested that the use of eAG would allow all values discussed with patients to be expressed in the same units, which he considered desirable. Such conversions have been proposed by a number of investigators, beginning with a European study and one he carried out more than 25 years ago, showing robust correlation of A1C with mean self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG).

These considerations led to the A1C-derived Average Glucose (ADAG) study of more than 500 type 1 and type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects, 83% of whom were Caucasian, 8% Black, and 8% Hispanic, who performed continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 2–3 days monthly as well as pre- and postprandial SMBG for 4 months, giving approximately 2,500 CGM and…

### Diabetes and frailty: An expert consensus statement on the management of older adults with type 2 diabetes [^112mBybU]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

A further issue to consider when assessing HbA1c in older adults is the accuracy of the metric itself. There are multiple comorbidities that confound HbA1c values. Any condition that increases red blood cell turnover, such as bleeding conditions (e.g. peptic ulcer disease) or haemolytic conditions (e.g. significant valvular disease), will artificially lower HbA1c values. Conversely, for the majority of older adults who have reduced red blood cell turnover, increased cellular membrane friability and iron deficiency anaemia can result in an artificial elevation of the HbA1c value. Even in healthy older adults eligible for inclusion in intensive glycaemic control trials, lower levels of fasting plasma glucose were found to be required to achieve a similar HbA1c.

- **Frailty and mortality**: Once established, apart from age and gender, frailty is the single biggest predictor of mortality in older adults. As a result, frailty, rather than comorbidity, underpins target setting, recommended interventions, and treatment goals in older adults with diabetes.

- **Dynamic nature of frailty**: It is important to remember that frailty is a dynamic process; a person's frailty categorisation may change, hence the need for regular reassessment, particularly following a change in circumstances, such as moving to a care home, hospitalisation, increased adherence to medications, or weight loss due to decreased appetite. Re-evaluation of frailty should occur, as a minimum, at the annual diabetes review, but earlier if there has been a change in circumstances.

### HbA1c overtesting and overtreatment among US adults with controlled type 2 diabetes, 2001–13: Observational population based study [^111mCS9d]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Clinically unnecessary testing can have detrimental effects for both the patient and the healthcare system. Excessive tests can cause unnecessary patient discomfort and anxiety, and because of the potential for false positive results caused by expected short-term biological and analytical variability of the HbA1c test, they can increase the risk of further needless testing, specialist referral, and treatment change. The availability of a laboratory result could compel a doctor and patient to act, even if not clinically indicated or beneficial. We saw this in our study population, in which excessive testing was associated with an increased likelihood of treatment intensification despite normal levels of HbA1c.

We found that patients over age 65 years and those with a high underlying disease burden were more likely to have excessive HbA1c testing. Healthcare providers could have decided that such patients needed to be monitored more closely, yet all these patients had stable HbA1c levels of less than 7.0%, with no insulin use or documented hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Moreover, guidelines recommend that patients with significant comorbidities should, in fact, be treated less intensely and have relaxed HbA1c targets above 7.0%, making frequent testing in this population even less useful. We were reassured to find that patients aged 75 years and older were less likely to have intensified treatment after the index HbA1c test than those younger than 45 years. However, these older patients were also less likely to have deintensified treatment after the index HbA1c test, suggesting that…

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^115qMjyB]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, the likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia may be present. In the opposite scenario (high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point), augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis.

### Analysis: Investigating the quality of POCT devices for HbA1c, what are our next steps [^113mRqFV]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Low credibility.

There is a growing number of publications evaluating the performance of HbA1c point-of-care testing (POCT) devices when compared to routine laboratory instruments, but is this what we need from future studies? Here, we describe the understanding of the performance of POCT for HbA1c, which areas need further studies, and the key requirements for future publications based on performance evaluations of these devices.

- **Clinical settings**: Studies in clinical settings are required.
- **Standardized methods**: Performance should be measured against internationally standardized reference methods.
- **New market devices**: There is a need to evaluate new-to-the-market devices that currently do not have a detailed performance history.
- **External quality assessment**: The need for external quality assessment schemes designed to support POCT in a wide range of clinical settings is highlighted.

These elements are crucial for future studies to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of POCT devices for HbA1c.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^1146F9Wo]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

It is unclear why nondiabetic non-Hispanic Blacks have consistently higher A1C values even in the setting of normal fasting glucose levels and after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Further research should be conducted to determine whether this disparity stems from racial differences in postprandial glycemia or from racial differences in the tendency of hemoglobin to undergo glycosylation.

This study has several strengths, including the large, nationally representative sample of healthy, nondiabetic individuals. We benefited from the rigorous measurement of risk factors using standardized protocols and strict quality control data collection and laboratory procedures in NHANES.

Important limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limits our conclusions regarding the temporality of the observed associations. In addition, we had only a single measurement of fasting glucose. The American Diabetes Association recommends repeating an elevated fasting glucose measurement to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. The use of a single measurement of fasting glucose rather than two will overestimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Nonetheless, interpretation of single measurements of fasting glucose and A1C as analyzed in this study reflects a common clinical decision-making setting. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of laboratory differences over time, calibration of A1C to account for the change in laboratories in 2005–2006 using a published equation did not appreciably alter our results.

### Impact of HbA1c testing at point of care on diabetes management [^1148Gzip]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes is a highly prevalent disease also implicated in the development of several other serious complications, such as cardiovascular or renal disease. HbA1c testing is a vital step for effective diabetes management. However, given the low compliance to testing frequency and often a subsequent delay in the corresponding treatment modification, HbA1c at the point of care (POC) offers an opportunity for improvement in diabetes care. In this review, based on data from 1999 to 2016, we summarize the evidence supporting further implementation of HbA1c testing at POC, discuss its limitations, and propose recommendations for further development.

### Management of type 2 diabetes: Are we making progress [^112bvCUs]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) serves as a key indicator for managing type 2 diabetes. Its measurement provides critical insights into long-term glucose control in patients. Effective management strategies focus on reducing HbA1c levels through a combination of lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and patient education.

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Incorporating dietary changes and physical activity into daily routines is essential for patients. These modifications not only help in weight management but also improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Various medication classes, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, are available to support blood glucose regulation. Selecting the appropriate therapy requires careful consideration of patient-specific factors and comorbidities.

- **Patient education**: Ensuring patients are well-informed about their condition and treatment options enhances adherence to management plans and fosters a proactive approach to care.

Ongoing research and clinical trials continue to assess new treatments and refine existing protocols, aiming to improve outcomes for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Postchallenge glucose, A1C, and fasting glucose as predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: A 10-year prospective cohort study [^115ht3Jn]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

A1C, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were all specific but not sensitive predictors of a 10-year risk of type 2 diabetes. Approximately one-third of participants with IGT, elevated A1C, and IFG developed diabetes. IGT had the highest prevalence in this population, resulting in the greatest number of diabetes cases within the IGT group. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys have shown that the 2-hour glucose value is more sensitive for detecting impaired glucose regulation and type 2 diabetes in elderly individuals.

The ultimate importance of a predictive test for type 2 diabetes is determined by its ability to indicate high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The risk of CVD increases before glycemia reaches diabetic levels, and 2-hour glucose appears to be a better predictor of CVD than fasting glucose.

Longitudinal data comparing cardiovascular risk between 2-hour glucose and A1C in the nondiabetic range have been scarce and controversial. An association was observed between 2-hour glucose and, to a lesser extent, A1C and cardiovascular mortality in Dutch adults. However, in U.S. adults, A1C was a better predictor of CVD than postchallenge glucose in women without diabetes. Cardiovascular mortality is a late endpoint; hence, we examined the incidence of new-onset CVD. In our study, IGT was the only marker in the nondiabetic range significantly associated with incident CVD in women. A1C was significantly associated with incident CVD in women at levels of ≥ 6.5%.

### Should A1C targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally stipulate that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be monitored every 2–3 months for treatment adjustments but also emphasize the importance of clinical judgment tailored to individual needs. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best strategy for the majority of patients, given that the progressive nature of diabetes requires prompt and consistent therapeutic intervention.

Recent data suggest a well-controlled A1C is vital, although only 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year. Before recent guidelines provided more structure and specific A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic medications was less standardized.

### Haemoglobin A1c in the diagnosis and monitoring of diabetes mellitus [^116pDsu3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) is due to celebrate its 40th birthday. Many people would argue that the clinical studies relating the test to diabetes complications while in its late 20s are likely to be its finest ever achievement. However, this article looks at how HbA(1c) has matured since then and discusses in detail how its many strengths and idiosyncrasies as a marker of glycaemic risk have, as a 30-something, become more clearly understood. As HbA(1c) approaches middle age, this paper also describes how the test appears to be developing a mid-life crisis, as debate over how its results should be expressed seems likely to divide opinion among clinicians for some time to come.

### Assessment of glycaemic status in adult hospital patients for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus: A systematic review [^111NHSYs]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study nation varied across the studies included in this review, which may contribute to variation in the study outcomes as HbA1c has been found to underestimate average blood glucose in African-Americans with sickle cell trait. Higher HbA1c values have been reported in African-Americans and American Indians compared with white Americans, independent of hemoglobin variants.

Only one study (Karakonstantis et al.) excluded individuals with medical conditions that might affect HbA1c accuracy. HbA1c can underestimate glycemia in HIV-infected and G6PD-deficient individuals and overestimate glycemia in people with iron-deficiency anemia. Corticosteroid use can cause persistent hyperglycemia ("steroid diabetes"), so its effect on HbA1c should be considered, especially in a hospital patient population, although literature on the subject is scarce. The possibility that illness preceding hospital admission, including acute pancreatic damage or renal failure, could perturb HbA1c should also be considered as a possible limitation. Both NICE and the ADA recommend cautious interpretation of HbA1c and suggest oral glucose tolerance testing or fasting blood glucose testing be used for individuals with conditions that might affect HbA1c. This should be incorporated in future study designs, and clinical judgment should be exercised in considering the possibility of conditions that may alter HbA1c.

Variation in thresholds used to define hyperglycemia and HbA1c among the identified studies prevented an overall assessment of the diagnostic performance of the thresholds applied.

### Glycemic variability and diabetes complications: Does it matter? Simply put, there are better glycemic markers [^112S6LNP]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

There is no argument that improving mean levels of glycemic control, as judged by assays for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), reduces the risks of microvascular complications and cardiovascular disease events in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, observations in some trials have suggested that targeting HbA1c to recommended levels may not always result in improved outcomes for individuals with long-standing type 2 diabetes. The reasons why glycemic control strategies primarily using HbA1c did not achieve the expected outcomes in these studies are not clear.

Controversy remains as to whether there are glycemic metrics beyond HbA1c that can effectively assess the risk of developing diabetes complications. In this context, the concept of "glycemic variability" (GV) is one metric that has gained significant attention. GV can be defined as the degree to which a patient's blood glucose level fluctuates between high (peaks) and low (nadir) levels. The best and most precise way to assess GV is still debated.

While there is universal agreement that HbA1c is the gold standard for the primary clinical target, there is no consensus on whether other proposed glycemic metrics hold promise in providing additional clinical data or whether there should be additional targets beyond HbA1c. Given this controversy, we provide a point-counterpoint debate on this issue. In the preceding point narrative, Dr. Hirsch provides his argument.

### Hemoglobin A1c as a substitute for oral glucose testing in early pregnancy screening [^115iFUfk]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Low credibility.

Recommendations for individuals with risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) call for screening in early pregnancy. However, there is currently no clear consensus on a specific screening modality. This study evaluates whether a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) screening in individuals with risk factors for gestational diabetes (GDM) could be used instead of an early 1-hour glucose challenge test (GCT). We hypothesized that the HbA1c could replace the 1-hour GCT in early pregnancy evaluation.

- **Study design**: This is a prospective observational trial at a single tertiary referral center of women with at least one risk factor for GDM. The women were screened at 94, 179, 154, and 139 mg/dL for fasting, 1-, 2-, and 3-hour values, respectively; 1-hour GCT > 200 mg/dL; or HbA1c > 6.5%.

- **Results**: A total of 758 patients met inclusion criteria. A total of 566 completed a 1-hour GCT, and 729 had an HbA1c collected. The median gestational age at testing was 9 1/7 weeks (range: 4 0/7 to 6/7 weeks). Twenty-one participants were diagnosed with GDM at 5.6%. The HbA1c had a sensitivity of 84.2%, a specificity of 83.3%, and a false positive rate of.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus [^113DzGPX]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) obtained in close temporal approximation. Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes. In the setting of an elevated A1C but "nondiabetic" FPG, the likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia may be present. In the opposite scenario, where there is a high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point, augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or a hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^114R3ZDQ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes continues unabated. Despite extensive efforts to educate providers, patients, and even the public at large about the advantages of early identification and treatment to prevent complications, a large number of patients remain undiagnosed. A serious barrier to enhanced detection has been inadequate screening using tests that are somewhat inconvenient for patients and clinicians, often resulting in suboptimal implementation. In this issue of *Diabetes Care*, a joint committee from the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and European Association for the Study of Diabetes examines diagnostic testing for diabetes, specifically the role of A1C, and makes significant new recommendations. While this report has not yet been endorsed as a guideline by any of these associations or other organizations, it represents a step in that direction and thus deserves attention.

Clearly, no clinical diagnostic test is perfect. However, to be clinically useful, a test must be accurate, specific, standardized (or easily standardizable), convenient, and ideally, inexpensive. Although plasma glucose testing meets some of these criteria, its use has been challenged by the need to obtain a sample in the fasting state — most people attend outpatient visits in the fed state — or under standard carbohydrate challenge conditions, such as the oral glucose tolerance test. There continues to be some uncertainty regarding the diagnostic performance of fasting glucose testing versus the oral glucose tolerance test.

### Accuracy of a point-of-care hemoglobin A1c assay [^116dix5F]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Low credibility.

Point-of-care test (POCT) HbA1c assays provide rapidly available results for clinical decision-making. The accuracy and precision of these assays must be established. Venous blood samples from 300 patients were assayed for HbA1c by a laboratory technician using the POCT Alere Afinion™ assay and a laboratory (Premier Affinity TM) assay. The POCT results from 402 patients' fingerstick samples, assayed by nine non-technician staff, were compared with the laboratory assay.

- **Laboratory assessment**: The laboratory assessment showed a tight correlation (r² = .977, P < .001) between the assays. The mean absolute and relative differences were 0.01 percentage points and 2.1%, respectively. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for the POCT and laboratory assays were < 2% and < 1%, respectively.

- **Clinical assessment**: The clinical assessment also demonstrated a tight correlation between the assays (r² = .978, P < .001), with mean absolute and relative differences of 0.2 percentage points and 3.41%, respectively. The CV for the POCT assay was < 2%.

The POCT performed acceptably compared to the laboratory assay under realistic clinical conditions.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114kWJK4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The role of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes has been considered for several years. In the past, the lack of standardization has been a major barrier. With improved standardization through the NGSP and the IFCC, and new data demonstrating the association between HbA1c concentrations and the risk for retinopathy, the International Expert Committee recommended the use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes.

In making its recommendation, the Committee also considered several technical advantages of HbA1c testing compared with glucose testing, such as its pre-analytical stability and decreased biological variation. The clinical convenience of the HbA1c assay, which requires no patient fasting or tolerance tests, compared with glucose-based diagnosis, further convinced the Committee to recommend HbA1c testing for diagnosis. A value ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) was considered diagnostic based on the observed relationship with retinopathy.

For diagnosis, a positive test result [≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)] should be confirmed with a repeat assay. The ADA indicates that although either an HbA1c assay or a glucose assay (FPG or OGTT) can be used as the confirmatory test, repeating the same test is preferred. The frequency of HbA1c testing for diagnosis has not been established, but guidelines similar to those for glucose-based testing seem appropriate. Only NGSP-certified HbA1c methods should be used to diagnose or screen for diabetes. The ADA cautions that point-of-care devices for measuring HbA1c should not be used for diagnosis.

### "Prediabetes": Are there problems with this label? No, we need heightened awareness of this condition [^112bEymK]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The category of "prediabetes" defined by the American Diabetes Association comprises a range of intermediate hyperglycemia based on fasting, 2-h postload glucose, or HbA1c. Over the recent past, the "cut points" identifying this stage have changed; specifically, a lower fasting glucose level is now used. On one hand, it can be argued that the change to a lower cut point identifies a group of individuals still at higher risk and provides heightened awareness for a condition associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Moreover, identifying individuals at this stage may represent an opportunity for earlier intervention in the disease.

However, the argument against this definition of prediabetes is that it disguises the differences in the three subcategories and complicates the interpretation of observations on interventions and outcomes. Additionally, it can be argued that the large number of people identified with the criteria far exceeds the capacity of healthcare systems to respond with individual care, particularly without evidence that interventions benefit any category other than impaired glucose tolerance. Thus, there is no consensus on the definition using the identified cut points.

Controversy also remains as to whether there are glycemic metrics beyond HbA1c that can be used, in addition to HbA1c, to help assess the risk of an individual developing diabetes complications. Given the controversy, a Point-Counterpoint debate on this issue is presented. In the preceding point narrative, Dr. Yudkin provides his argument that there are si…

### Standards of medical care in diabetes — 2011 [^117VZPG4]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes**: As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with a hyperglycemic crisis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, if two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is also confirmed.

	- On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes.

	- Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis.

### Analytic bias among certified methods for the measurement of hemoglobin A1c: a cause for concern [^111LudLX]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

We studied the magnitude, significance, and origin of an analytic bias that emerged between our point-of-care (POC) and our central laboratory (CL) methods for the measurement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and evaluated the analytic accuracy of seven commonly used HbA1c methods relative to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) reference method. The POC and CL methods were compared by split-sample analysis of clinical specimens and time series analyses of the HbA1c results reported for a 33-month period.

The relative accuracies of seven HbA1c methods were evaluated using College of American Pathologists proficiency survey results. Long-term drifts in the CL- and POC-analyzed test results caused the median intermethod bias [(POC result) - (CL result)] to increase from -0.4% to -0.9% HbA1c. Systematic biases, drifts in analytic performance over time, and intermethod variability were frequently observed among the seven NGSP-certified HbA1c methods. Intermethod variability is a potential source of inaccuracy whenever HbA1c results are interpreted relative to universal, fixed, clinical decision thresholds.

### A1c level and future risk of diabetes: A systematic review [^115yYrcQ]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Several studies found that A1C is particularly predictive of future diabetes after prior stratification of fasting plasma glucose. This is consistent with prior observations that elevated fasting and 2-hour glucose in combination indicate greater risk than either fasting plasma glucose or A1C alone. This improved predictability may be a function of reducing error variance; in other words, conducting a follow-up test clarifies the group with more stable hyperglycemia and is the main reason that a second test is recommended for a full clinical diagnosis.

Our most important limitation was the lack of original data to model the continuous association between A1C values and incidence. This lack of original data required us to use a modeling approach with which many readers are unfamiliar. Nevertheless, our modeling of average studies resulted in an average incidence value of roughly 1% per year for persons with normal A1C values, an incidence estimate that is consistent with numerous other estimates of the general population. The lack of access to raw data also prevented us from conducting formal ROC analyses of A1C cut-off points to distinguish between eventual cases and non-cases or to quantitatively assess the impact of variation in population characteristics on the relationship between A1C and incidence. Our findings could also be influenced by the choice of outcome definition. A1C is more apt to predict diabetes if the outcome is also A1C-based. We did not detect major differences in the A1C/diabetes incidence association according to the choice of glycemic test.

### Pitfalls in hemoglobin A1c measurement: When results may be misleading [^114dkPgY]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Since the beginning of clinical use in the 1970s, hemoglobin A1c (A1c) has become the standard tool for monitoring glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The role of the A1c test was broadened in 2010, when the American Diabetes Association added A1c as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes. Because of hemoglobin A1c's integral role in diagnosis and treatment, it is important to recognize clinical scenarios and interfering factors that yield false results.

The purpose of this review is to describe the A1c measurement, outline clinical scenarios or factors that may yield false results, and describe alternative laboratory biomarkers.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against [^116S6SST]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The argument for the individualization of A1c targets can be traced to a number of observations. At its simplest, all clinicians in diabetes are aware of people (some on lifestyle alone, but some even on insulin therapy) who have A1c levels in the normal range, and certainly below target levels, without any special effort or lifestyle restriction and without overt or covert hypoglycemia. These patients are, of course, to be distinguished from patients who have lower levels as a result of obsession with tighter glucose levels or an unusual fear of microvascular complications. Some of the former group, with A1c levels in the normal or near-normal range, may have abnormalities of A1c formation, but anyone in this category without problems should seemingly be allowed to continue, provided the issue of covert hypoglycemia has been considered.

Naturally, blood glucose control is very tight, with short blood glucose excursions to a mean maximum of ~7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). This result is achieved by storing glucose as muscle glycogen, subsequently recycled to glucose through two-carbon intermediates and gluconeogenesis in the liver, losing ~30% of energy value in the process. That nature chooses to "waste" energy in achieving tight blood glucose control emphasizes the importance of that and provides a strong argument for emulating it clinically. Updated average A1c is linearly related to myocardial infarction well below normal target levels, and indeed such a relationship has been described within the normal range in a diabetic population.

### A1c: Recommendations, debates, and questions [^111nPDfm]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

This is the first of a series of articles based on presentations at the American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions held from June 5 to 9, 2009, in New Orleans, Louisiana. A series of elegant investigations some four decades ago led to the realization that elevated levels of certain hemoglobin components are found in individuals with diabetes. The useful measurement of A1c became standard in the assessment of glycemia. A1c, rather than direct measures of glycemia, is now used as the "goal" for diabetes treatment.

### Do race and ethnicity impact hemoglobin A1c independent of glycemia [^115P6fnB]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is widely used as an index of mean glycemia, a measure of risk for the development of diabetes complications, and a measure of the quality of diabetes care. Emerging literature suggests that, although HbA1c levels change little over time within persons without diabetes, they vary considerably among individuals, suggesting that factors other than glycemia may impact HbA1c.

Racial and ethnic differences in HbA1c have been described that do not appear to be explained by differences in glycemia. It is imperative that the nonglycemic factors that affect HbA1c be more clearly defined. Even more important, it must be determined whether differences among individuals or groups correlate with susceptibility to complications or merely reflect variation in hemoglobin glycation.

### Accuracy and precision of a point-of-care HbA1c test [^113s2ufv]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing offers advantages over laboratory testing, yet concerns about the accuracy and precision of these methods remain. The accuracy and precision of the POC Afinion™ HbA1c Dx test were investigated.

- **Methods**: Samples spanning the assay range were collected from prospectively enrolled subjects at three clinical sites. The accuracy of the POC test using fingerstick and venous whole blood samples was estimated via correlation and bias with respect to values obtained by an NGSP secondary reference laboratory (SRL). The precision of the POC test using fingerstick samples was determined from duplicate results by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (SD) and then separated into its components using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The precision of the POC test using venous blood was evaluated from samples run in four replicates on each of three test cartridge lots, twice per day for 10 consecutive days. The SD and CV by study site and overall were calculated.

- **Results**: Across the assay range, POC test results from fingerstick and venous whole blood samples were highly correlated with results from the NGSP SRL (r = .99). The mean bias was -0.021% HbA1c (-0.346% relative) using fingerstick samples and -0.005% HbA1c (-0.093% relative) using venous samples. Imprecision ranged from 0.62% to 1.93% CV for fingerstick samples and 1.11% to 1.69% CV for venous samples.

- **Conclusions**: The results indicate that the POC test evaluated here is accurate and precise using both fingerstick and venous whole blood samples, demonstrating its potential utility in clinical settings.

### Critical reappraisal of the time-in-range: Alternative or useful addition to glycated hemoglobin [^112s6yu2]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2020). Low credibility.

The HbA1c value is a well-established parameter used to characterize glucose control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived parameters, calculated using daily glucose profiles such as Time-in-Range (TiR), have increasingly gained interest for assessing a patient's therapy. The question has arisen as to whether TiR could replace HbA1c. Because TiR focuses on the quality of glucose control during a minimum of 10 to 14 days of CGM use and reflects the variability of glucose concentrations, Time-in-Range could be considered an attractive option for improving diabetes control in patients with diabetes.

Due to the lack of established standards for glucose measurements with CGM systems, results from different CGM systems can deviate from each other. Time-in-Range should not be viewed as a replacement for HbA1c but should be used to deliver valuable additional information.

### Effect of the method to measure levels of glycated hemoglobin on individual clinical decisions: Comparison of an immunoassay with high-performance liquid chromatography [^112ainbP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Our objective was to compare in a prospective study the clinical performance of the reference and an alternative method to measure blood levels of glycated hemoglobin. A total of 178 samples from patients with diabetes were tested by both methods, and results were analyzed for correlation and comparison of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to classify patients according to glycemic control. There was a significant linear correlation between methods (r = 0.645; P < .0001); the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the alternative method to identify patients with controlled and uncontrolled status were as follows: controlled, 88%, 78%, 77%, and 88%; and uncontrolled, 78%, 88%, 88%, and 77%, respectively. Results show that although the results of both methods show a statistically significant correlation, the ability of the alternative method to correctly classify individual patients according to glycemic control status is far from optimal.

### Could continuous subcutaneous glucose sensors (CGMS) be repurposed to diagnose diabetes in equivocal or challenging cases [^117N8iSu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

When first introduced, the inter-laboratory CV for HbA1c was up to 20%. This variability led to a standardized approach to HbA1c measurement by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC). Since then, the inter-laboratory CV has fallen to ~3.5%. An HbA1c of 6.5% provides almost equal sensitivity and specificity to a fasting or post-load glucose measurement as a predictor of prevalent retinopathy. Therefore, HbA1c was adopted as a diagnostic test by the ADA in 2010. The excellent assay performance, reasonable cost, and simplicity of measurement (a non-fasted blood sample) have made HbA1c the preferred measure for diabetes testing at scale. Hence, the means by which diabetes is diagnosed have shifted as technology and measurement accuracy have improved.

However, the utility and practical value of HbA1c as a diagnostic test requires re-evaluation, considering the known problems of its application, as well as the advent of the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c can vary with the population studied — for example, being 0.4% lower in the white population than in the black population, with smaller differences observed in Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian people. Factors such as altered red cell turnover, variations in glycation rates, and anemia can impact HbA1c levels. There is a very small margin of error that can be tolerated with the HbA1c — even a small positive or negative bias in values can lead to the re-categorization of disease state for potentially millions of people.

### "Prediabetes": Are there problems with this label? Yes, the label creates further problems [^111daiv9]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^11627gHn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Testing frequency**: There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of HbA1c testing. The ADA recommends, "For any individual patient, the frequency of A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regimen used, and the judgment of the clinician". In the absence of well-controlled studies that suggest a definite testing protocol, expert opinion recommends HbA1c testing "at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control)… and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals". These testing recommendations are for nonpregnant patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In addition, all patients with diabetes who are admitted to a hospital should have HbA1c measured if the results of testing in the previous 2–3 months are not available. Diabetes quality-assurance programs [e.g. Provider Recognition Program and HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set)] have generally required documentation of the percentage of diabetic patients who have had at least one HbA1c measurement during the preceding year. Studies have established that serial HbA1c measurements (quarterly for 1 year) produce large improvements in HbA1c values in patients with type 1 diabetes.

- **Interpretation**: HbA1c values in patients with diabetes constitute a continuum. They range from within the reference interval in a small percentage of patients whose mean plasma glucose concentrations are close to those of nondiabetic individuals, to markedly increased values.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^113RwGrs]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically concerning HbA1c and blood glucose, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining blood glucose for diagnosing diabetes in conditions that alter the relationship between HbA1c and glycemia. These conditions include hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease, pregnancy (second and third trimesters and the postpartum period), G6PD deficiency, HIV, hemodialysis, recent blood loss or transfusion, hemolysis, or EPO therapy.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^114kB3Pu]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend diagnosing diabetes based on HbA1c or plasma glucose criteria, using either the fasting plasma glucose value, 2-hour plasma glucose value during a 75-g OGTT, or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms or crises criteria:

- **HbA1c**: ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay

- **Fasting plasma glucose**: ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) with no caloric intake for at least 8 hours

- **2-hour plasma glucose**: ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT, performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water

- **Random plasma glucose**: ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, obtained at any time of the day without regard to time since the previous meal
