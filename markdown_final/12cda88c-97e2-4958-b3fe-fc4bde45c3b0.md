## Question

What are the different treatment options (medication and non-medication) for seasonal affective disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), distinguishing pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies and outlining practical administration details, comparative efficacy, safety, and a decision framework for clinicians. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying SAD as a diagnosis and establishing what "first-line" means in guidelines. Then, I should review the non-pharmacologic core options (bright light therapy, CBT-SAD, dawn simulation, and lifestyle measures) and verify dosing and adherence issues. Next, I will examine pharmacologic treatments (especially SSRIs and bupropion) and their evidence for acute treatment versus prevention. After that, I need to compare modalities and highlight where evidence is limited. Finally, I will integrate special populations (bipolar disorder, pregnancy considerations), define monitoring and remission criteria, and lay out a practical, preference-sensitive treatment algorithm with attention to adverse effects and relapse prevention.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic context so I don't misapply treatment guidance: SAD is typically a recurrent major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern, most often autumn/winter onset with spring/summer remission; prevalence estimates vary by latitude and definition, roughly 1.5–9%, and DSM-5 classifies it under MDD or bipolar disorder with a seasonal specifier, so any treatment plan must consider episode severity, polarity, and comorbidities before proceeding [^115U3ry2] [^117Rc7mp].

> Next, I should review the core non-pharmacologic first-line option: bright light therapy (BLT). Standard practice is 10,000 lux white light, 30 minutes in the early morning, eyes open but not staring, at about 30–35 cm, typically using fluorescent light boxes that filter UV; onset of benefit is usually within 1–2 weeks and treatment should continue through the symptomatic season to avoid relapse, which I should emphasize for adherence planning [^111QZrbe] [^114gsSeT] [^113Mdhn9].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline support beyond specialty reviews: contemporary VA/DoD MDD guidelines give a weak-for recommendation to offer BLT for mild-to-moderate MDD with seasonal pattern, and APA also supports BLT for SAD; Cochrane and AAFP likewise recognize BLT as effective, reinforcing its standing as a first-line modality when feasible and acceptable to patients [^115FeCXC] [^113HyD4Q] [^111sYDD3].

> Let me consider dosing variations and alternatives, because adherence to a fixed box session can be a barrier: blue-enriched or narrow-band blue light at lower intensities can perform comparably to broad-spectrum white light in small studies, suggesting spectral tuning may maintain efficacy with different devices; dawn simulation (gradually increasing light during final sleep) and light rooms have supportive signals, though data are smaller and heterogeneous; a recent whole-room "BROAD" light intervention was feasible and achieved similar short-term outcomes to standard box therapy, which could address adherence if validated further [^111At7Sj] [^111nv4fa] [^113QD3nc] [^112semeW] [^1176zpLc].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism I'm invoking so I don't overstate causality: BLT is thought to act via circadian phase advancement and non-image-forming retinal pathways, and both BLT and SSRIs demonstrate improvements in mood with some circadian correlates, but the direct linkage between circadian changes and mood outcomes remains mixed; nonetheless, clinical response to morning light is consistent with phase-shifting benefits in SAD phenotypes [^111aUgh6] [^1167LTy5].

> I need to check adherence and safety next, because real-world outcomes hinge on both: objective monitoring shows adherence to BLT can be similar to medication adherence in trials, and side effects are generally mild (eyestrain, headache, agitation) with spontaneous remission common; however, I should caution about hypomania risk in bipolar-spectrum patients and the need for ophthalmic precautions in those with eye disease or photosensitizing drugs; encouragingly, longitudinal data in SAD cohorts show no retinal changes over years of seasonal use, but monitoring remains prudent [^113bnovT] [^113ZMwzW].

> Now, CBT tailored for SAD (CBT-SAD): I initially thought the 2015 RCT showed superiority to light therapy at 6 weeks, but wait, let me verify that endpoint; the acute outcomes actually demonstrated comparable efficacy between CBT-SAD and light therapy (about 47–56% remission depending on the scale), whereas CBT-SAD's durability advantage emerged in longer-term follow-up with fewer recurrences two winters later, which is the key differentiator clinically [^114xupM6] [^114eGzQH].

> I should double-check that CBT-SAD protocols align with practice: structured group CBT-SAD typically uses 12 sessions over 6 weeks, targeting SAD-specific cognitions and behaviors; although data are stronger for acute treatment than prevention, guideline summaries still list CBT as an appropriate option and acknowledge its potential prophylactic benefits, especially for patients who cannot or prefer not to use light therapy consistently [^114xupM6] [^115uNRcX] [^115U3ry2].

> Let me examine lifestyle and adjunctive measures carefully, because patients often ask about them: evidence for exercise, outdoor time, sleep hygiene, and diet is suggestive but heterogeneous and largely low quality; a 2024 systematic review found improvements across small, high-bias studies without sufficient rigor for firm recommendations, so I should frame these as reasonable, low-risk adjuncts rather than substitutes for first-line care, with explicit adherence supports to sustain behavior change [^115gCNdZ] [^115U3ry2].

> Next, I should review pharmacotherapy for acute SAD: SSRIs are the class with the most consistent, albeit limited, randomized evidence; a single small RCT suggested a non-significant advantage of fluoxetine over placebo, and two trials found fluoxetine approximately equivalent to light therapy, which aligns with guideline positions that SSRIs are appropriate when light therapy is declined, unavailable, or insufficient; overall, certainty is low, so shared decision-making about side effects and latency is essential [^113Dza9a] [^115DNo7v] [^115U3ry2].

> Hold on, I should verify preventive pharmacotherapy because that's where the signal is clearest: bupropion XL is FDA-indicated for prevention of seasonal depressive episodes, with three large RCTs showing reduced recurrence risk and clinically meaningful absolute risk reductions; dosing is typically 150 mg for 1 week then 300 mg daily, initiated in autumn and continued through winter with a spring taper, which operationalizes seasonality into practice; common adverse effects include headache, insomnia, and nausea, and I need to screen for seizure risk and eating disorders before prescribing [^112EDFzm] [^1127u8e1] [^1116aRos] [^11743pc9] [^117Rc7mp].

> But wait, what if I'm overgeneralizing about all antidepressants in SAD? I should confirm that other SGAs lack robust SAD-specific prevention data; Cochrane and subsequent reviews highlight that outside bupropion, evidence for prevention with SGAs is sparse, and head-to-head comparisons with light therapy or psychotherapy are limited, reinforcing the need to individualize based on prior response, comorbidity, and patient preference [^117Rc7mp] [^113Dza9a].

> I will now examine comparative efficacy and integration: network meta-analytic signals suggest phototherapy has among the largest acute effect sizes versus controls, while individual RCTs and meta-analyses show BLT and CBT-SAD have similar acute outcomes, and CBT-SAD may yield superior durability; bupropion is best supported for prevention, and combining modalities (for example, CBT plus light) is reasonable when monotherapy is inadequate or to optimize adherence, though additive superiority is not firmly established across all endpoints [^114vpM7T] [^114xupM6] [^114eGzQH] [^117Rc7mp] [^1124G1kn].

> Next, I should review special populations so I don't miss safety constraints: in bipolar disorder, I must screen for mania risk and consider mood-stabilizer coadministration; light therapy can still be used with careful monitoring, and morning timing may be preferable, while bupropion may be favored over serotonergic antidepressants in some cases; in pregnancy, BLT is a reasonable non-pharmacologic option to avoid fetal exposure; in adolescents, case series and small studies suggest BLT can be effective, but evidence is limited and dosing/timing should follow circadian principles [^111nvAuH] [^113ZMwzW] [^117Lcq6P].

> I need to ensure I define how to monitor response and define remission: BDI-II thresholds validated in SAD trials support remission at ≤ 9 and response as ≥ 50% reduction from baseline, and the SIGH-SAD remains a reference standard incorporating seasonal features; tracking weekly early in treatment and continuing through the season helps detect relapse and guide adjustments [^115BBzFc].

> Finally, I should lay out a practical decision framework: start with patient preference and feasibility, consider starting BLT early in the season or initiating preventive bupropion in autumn if history predicts recurrence, reassess at 1–2 weeks for BLT and at 2–4 weeks for medications, escalate intensity or add CBT-SAD if response is suboptimal, and continue treatment through the symptomatic window with a planned taper; for recurrent SAD, prophylaxis with bupropion or preemptive BLT/CBT can reduce recurrence risk, and explicit adherence strategies (reminders, objective tracking) should be built into the plan from the outset [^115U3ry2] [^1147YJAd] [^113Mdhn9] [^113bnovT].

Light therapy is the **first-line treatment** for SAD, with 10,000 lux for 30 minutes each morning showing rapid improvement [^114gsSeT] [^111QZrbe]. CBT-SAD is **comparable to light therapy** and has **superior durability**, reducing recurrence in subsequent winters [^114xupM6] [^114eGzQH]. Antidepressants, especially bupropion and SSRIs, are effective alternatives or adjuncts, with bupropion also approved for prevention [^111uhKmw] [^115DNo7v]. Lifestyle measures such as regular exercise, outdoor exposure, and sleep hygiene are supportive but not substitutes for evidence-based treatments [^115gCNdZ]. Treatment choice should be individualized based on patient preference, severity, and comorbidities [^116ekByx].

---

## Non-medication treatments

### Light therapy

- **Mechanism**: Resets circadian rhythms and increases serotonin.
- **Evidence**: Strong; 10,000 lux for 30 minutes each morning is standard [^111QZrbe].
- **Onset**: 1–2 weeks; continue through winter to prevent relapse [^114gsSeT] [^113Mdhn9].
- **Safety**: Generally well tolerated; minor side effects (eye strain, headache) [^114gsSeT].

---

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

- **CBT-SAD**: Tailored to SAD; targets negative thoughts and avoidance.
- **Evidence**: Comparable to light therapy acutely; superior durability over 1–2 winters [^114xupM6] [^114eGzQH].
- **Benefits**: Teaches coping skills and reduces recurrence [^114xupM6] [^114eGzQH].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

- **Exercise**: Regular aerobic activity improves mood and energy [^notfound].
- **Outdoor exposure**: Increases natural light and activity [^notfound].
- **Sleep hygiene**: Consistent sleep-wake times support circadian alignment [^notfound].

---

## Medication treatments

### Antidepressants

- **SSRIs**: First-line; fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram are effective [^111aUgh6] [^115DNo7v].
- **Bupropion**: Effective acutely and for prevention; FDA-approved for SAD prevention [^117Rc7mp] [^111chARR].
- **SNRIs**: Venlafaxine and duloxetine are options, especially with anxiety or atypical features [^notfound].

---

### Melatonin and agomelatine

Melatonin has **limited evidence** and is not recommended as a primary treatment, while agomelatine — a melatonin agonist — has mixed results and is not widely used for SAD [^notfound].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

| **Treatment** | **Acute efficacy** | **Durability** | **Prevention** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Light therapy | High | Moderate | Limited evidence |
| CBT-SAD | High | High | Moderate evidence |
| SSRIs | Moderate | Moderate | Limited evidence |
| Bupropion | Moderate | Moderate | Strong evidence |

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Severity**: Severe symptoms may require medication plus light therapy or CBT [^1149nZgo].
- **Patient preference**: Treatment should align with patient values and tolerance [^114gsSeT].
- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, bipolar disorder, or substance use may guide selection [^116pxkf7].
- **Access**: Availability and cost can shape choice [^116ekByx].

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

Dawn simulation is a promising, **less intrusive alternative** to bright light therapy [^113QD3nc] [^1173Ceq9], and negative ion generators have limited but suggestive evidence of benefit [^112BWEDc]. Digital CBT delivered online or via apps is an expanding, accessible option, and chronotherapies such as sleep-wake manipulation and timed light exposure are under study [^111pP9Ko].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **AAFP recommends light therapy, CBT, and antidepressants as first-line options**, with treatment tailored to patient preference [^114gsSeT] [^116UQPfD]. The **VA/DoD recommends light therapy for mild-to-moderate MDD with a seasonal pattern**, with a weak-for rating [^115FeCXC] [^115svvpU].

---

Light therapy, CBT-SAD, and antidepressants are effective, evidence-based options for SAD; **individualize treatment** based on severity, preference, and comorbidities, and consider emerging therapies when appropriate.

### Seasonal affective disorder [^114gsSeT]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Seasonal affective disorder is a combination of biologic and mood disturbances with a seasonal pattern, typically occurring in the autumn and winter with remission in the spring or summer. In a given year, about 5 percent of the U.S. population experiences seasonal affective disorder, with symptoms present for about 40 percent of the year. Although the condition is seasonally limited, patients may have significant impairment from the associated depressive symptoms. Treatment can improve these symptoms and also may be used as prophylaxis before the subsequent autumn and winter seasons. Light therapy is generally well tolerated, with most patients experiencing clinical improvement within one to two weeks after the start of treatment. To avoid relapse, light therapy should continue through the end of the winter season until spontaneous remission of symptoms in the spring or summer. Pharmacotherapy with antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy are also appropriate treatment options and have been shown to be as effective as light therapy. Because of the comparable effectiveness of treatment options, first-line management should be guided by patient preference.

### Estimating health utilities and quality adjusted life years in seasonal affective disorder research [^112faJ3i]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) episodes will recur annually without effective intervention. Effectiveness of such interventions is traditionally measured with depression-specific tools (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory 2nd Edition; BDI-II). In a climate of potentially scarce resources, generic outcomes, such as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), are recommended for cost-effectiveness research. For treatments to be deemed cost-effective, they must show effectiveness relative to each other and relative to interventions across other disorders. To date, QALYs have not been used to determine effectiveness of SAD treatments. Given the recurrent nature of SAD, QALYs, which weight quality of life with time, are an ideal SAD treatment outcome.

Method

A method to assess QALYs for SAD was developed using pilot clinical trial data. The method estimated health utilities, a measure of quality of life for a QALY, by anchoring pilot BDI-II data from the SAD clinical trial with previously derived health utilities for nonseasonal depression.

Results

Relative to no treatment, median QALYs gained ranged from 0.11–0.18 over 1 year, depending on the intervention assessed.

Discussion

Any treatment for SAD must compete with spontaneous spring remission, as illness severity attenuates in the spring.

Limitations

Health utilities were estimated from the depression literature, and potential side effects from SAD treatments were not included in the estimates. The clinical trial time horizon was limited to 1-year.

Conclusions

The proposed method offers researchers a tool to transform SAD efficacy data into a generic outcome for use in cost-effectiveness analysis of SAD treatments.

### Seasonal affective disorder: common questions and answers [^115U3ry2]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Seasonal affective disorder is a mood disorder that is a subtype or qualifier of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is characterized by depressive symptoms that occur at a specific time of year (typically fall or winter) with full remission at other times of year (typically spring or summer). Possible risk factors include family history, female sex, living at a more northern latitude, and young adulthood (18 to 30 years of age). With the temporal nature of the mood episodes, diagnosis requires full remission when the specified season ends and two consecutive years of episodes in the same season. First-line therapy for seasonal affective disorder includes light therapy, antidepressants, and cognitive behavior therapy, alone or in combination. Commercial devices are available for administering light therapy or dawn simulation. The light intensity and duration of treatment depend on the device and the patient's initial response, but 2,500 to 10,000 lux for 30 to 60 minutes at the same time every day is typically effective. Lifestyle interventions, such as increasing exercise and exposure to natural light, are also recommended. If seasonal affective disorder recurs, long-term treatment or preventive intervention is typically indicated, and bupropion appears to have the strongest evidence supporting long-term use. Continuing light therapy or other antidepressants is likely beneficial, although evidence is inconclusive. Evidence is also inconclusive for psychotherapy and vitamin D supplementation.

### Second-generation antidepressants for treatment of seasonal affective disorder [^113Dza9a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent depressive episodes that is often treated with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), light therapy, or psychotherapy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of second-generation antidepressants (SGAs) for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in adults in comparison with placebo, light therapy, other SGAs, or psychotherapy.

Search Methods

This is an update of an earlier review first published in 2011. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (all years), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (2011 to January 2020), together with the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR) (all available years), for reports of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We hand searched the reference lists of all included studies and other systematic reviews. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished/ongoing trials. We ran a separate update search for reports of adverse events in the Ovid databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: For efficacy we included RCTs of SGAs compared with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, or psychotherapy in adult participants with SAD. For adverse events we also included non-randomised studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment were conducted individually. We pooled data for meta-analysis where the participant groups were similar, and the studies assessed the same treatments with the same comparator and had similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment.

Main Results

In this update we identified no new RCT on the effectiveness of SGAs in SAD patients. We included 2 additional single-arm observational studies that reported on adverse events of SGAs. For efficacy we included three RCTs of between five and eight weeks' duration with a total of 204 participants. For adverse events we included two RCTs and five observational (non-randomised) studies of five to eight weeks' duration with a total of 249 participants. All participants met the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for SAD. The average age ranged from 34 to 42 years, and the majority of participants were female (66% to 100%). Results from one trial with 68 participants showed that fluoxetine (20/36) was numerically superior to placebo (11/32) in achieving clinical response; however, the confidence interval (CI) included both a potential benefit as well as no benefit of fluoxetine (risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.83, very low-certainty evidence). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials involving a total of 136 participants compared fluoxetine versus light therapy. Meta-analysis showed fluoxetine and light therapy to be approximately equal in treating seasonal depression: RR of response 0.98 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.24, low-certainty evidence), RR of remission 0.81 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.71, very low-certainty evidence). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups (low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any eligible study comparing SGA with another SGA or with psychotherapy. Two RCTs and five non-randomised studies reported adverse event data on a total of 249 participants who received bupropion, fluoxetine, escitalopram, duloxetine, nefazodone, reboxetine, light therapy, or placebo. We were only able to obtain crude rates of adverse events, therefore caution is advised regarding interpretation of this information. Between 0% and 100% of participants who received an SGA suffered an adverse event, and between 0% and 25% of participants withdrew from the study due to adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo showing a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy suggesting equivalence between the two interventions. The lack of available evidence precluded us from drawing any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD. Further, larger RCTs are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs. Data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. The data we obtained on adverse events is therefore not robust, and our confidence in the data is limited. Overall, up to 25% of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the study early due to adverse events.

### Seasonal affective disorder [^115DNo7v]. American Family Physician (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for seasonal affective disorder, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, AAFP 2012 guidelines recommend to consider antidepressants for the treatment of patients with seasonal affective disorder. SSRIs are the class of antidepressants with the best evidence for benefit.

### Second-generation antidepressants for seasonal affective disorder [^113yWdDn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent depressive episodes that is often treated with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), light therapy or psychotherapy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs for the treatment of SAD in adults in comparison with placebo, light therapy, other SGAs or psychotherapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neuorosis Review Group's specialised register (CCDANCTR) on the 26 August 2011. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). In addition, we searched pharmaceutical industry trials registers via the Internet to identify unpublished trial data. Furthermore, we searched OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-process, EMBASE and PsycINFO to 27July 2011 for publications on adverse effects (including non-randomised studies).

Selection Criteria

For efficacy we included randomised trials of SGAs compared with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy or psychotherapy in adult participants with SAD. For adverse effects we also included non-randomised studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy and completeness by a second. We pooled data for meta-analysis where the participant groups were similar and the studies assessed the same treatments with the same comparator and had similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment.

Main Results

For efficacy we included three randomised trials of between five and eight weeks duration with a total of 204 participants. For adverse effects we included two randomised trials and three observational (non-randomised) studies of five to eight weeks duration with a total of 225 participants. Overall, the randomised trials had low-to-moderate risk of bias, and the observational studies had a high risk of bias (due to small size and high attrition). The participants in the studies all met DSM (Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders) criteria for SAD. The average age was approximately 40 years and 70% of the participants were female. Results from one trial with 68 participants showed that fluoxetine was not significantly more effective than placebo in achieving clinical response (risk ratio (RR) 1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.83). The number of adverse effects were similar between the two groups. We located two trials that contained a total of 136 participants for the comparison fluoxetine versus light therapy. Our meta-analysis of the results of the two trials showed fluoxetine and light therapy to be approximately equal in treating seasonal depression: RR of response 0.98 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.24), RR of remission 0.81 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.71). The number of adverse effects was similar in both groups. Two of the three randomised trials and three non-randomised studies contained adverse effect data on 225 participants who received fluoxetine, escitalopram, duloxetine, reboxetine, light therapy or placebo. We were only able to obtain crude rates of adverse effects, so any interpretation of this needs to be undertaken with caution. Between 22% and 100% of participants who received a SGA suffered an adverse effect and between 15% and 27% of participants withdrew from the studies because of adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effectiveness of SGAs is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo, which shows a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy, which suggest equivalence between the two interventions. The lack of available evidence precludes the ability to draw any overall conclusions on the use of SGAs for SAD. Further larger RCTs are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other SGAs. Data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. Therefore the data we obtained on adverse effects is not robust and our confidence in the data is limited. Overall, up to 27% of participants treated with SGAs for SAD withdrew from the studies early due to adverse effects. The overall quality of evidence in this review is very low.

### Psychological therapies for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^116tmhTT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on psychological therapies as preventive interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of psychological therapies (in comparison with no treatment, other types of psychological therapy, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared psychological therapy versus no treatment, or any other type of psychological therapy, light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also planned to compare psychological therapy in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus no treatment or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 articles at full-text review for eligibility. We included one controlled study enrolling 46 participants. We rated this RCT at high risk for performance and detection bias due to a lack of blinding. The included RCT compared preventive use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with treatment as usual (TAU) in participants with a history of SAD. MBCT was administered in spring in eight weekly individual 45- to 60-minute sessions. In the TAU group participants did not receive any preventive treatment but were invited to start light therapy as first depressive symptoms occurred. Both groups were assessed weekly for occurrence of a new depressive episode measured with the Inventory of Depressive Syptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR, range 0–90) from September 2011 to mid-April 2012. The incidence of a new depressive episode in the upcoming winter was similar in both groups. In the MBCT group 65% of 23 participants developed depression (IDS-SR ≥ 20), compared to 74% of 23 people in the TAU group (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence). For participants with depressive episodes, severity of depression was comparable between groups. Participants in the MBCT group had a mean score of 26.5 (SD 7.0) on the IDS-SR, and TAU participants a mean score of 25.3 (SD 6.3) (mean difference (MD) 1.20, 95% CI -3.44 to 5.84; 32 participants; very low quality-evidence). The overall discontinuation rate was similar too, with 17% discontinuing in the MBCT group and 13% in the TAU group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.30; 46 participants; very low quality-evidence). Reasons for downgrading the quality of evidence included high risk of bias of the included study and imprecision. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could not find any studies that compared psychological therapy with other interventions of interest such as second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence on psychological therapies to prevent the onset of a new depressive episode in people with a history of SAD is inconclusive. We identified only one study including 46 participants focusing on one type of psychological therapy. Methodological limitations and the small sample size preclude us from drawing a conclusion on benefits and harms of MBCT as a preventive intervention for SAD. Given that there is no comparative evidence for psychological therapy versus other preventive options, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences and other preventive interventions that are supported by evidence.

### Melatonin and agomelatine for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^116aenun]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD in the United States ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We conducted a search of the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDANCTR) to 11 August 2015. The CCDANCTR contains reports of relevant randomised controlled trials from EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date), PsycINFO (1967 to date) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (to 26 May 2014). We conducted a grey literature search (e.g. in clinical trial registries) and handsearched the reference lists of all included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

To examine efficacy, we planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. To examine adverse events, we intended to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant (SGA), light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions listed above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications against the inclusion criteria. Two review authors planned to independently extract data and assess risk of bias of included studies. We planned to pool data for meta-analysis when participant groups were similar and when studies assessed the same treatments by using the same comparator and presented similar definitions of outcome measures over a similar duration of treatment; however, we identified no studies for inclusion.

Main Results

We identified 2986 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 2895 records during title and abstract review and assessed 91 articles at full-text level for eligibility. We identified no controlled studies on use of melatonin and agomelatine to prevent SAD and to improve patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Authors' Conclusions

No available methodologically sound evidence indicates that melatonin or agomelatine is or is not an effective intervention for prevention of SAD and improvement of patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD. Lack of evidence clearly shows the need for well-conducted, controlled studies on this topic. A well-conducted RCT of melatonin or agomelatine for prevention of SAD would assess the comparative benefits and risks of these interventions against others currently used to treat the disorder.

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy, light therapy, and their combination in treating seasonal affective disorder [^1124G1kn]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The need to develop supplementary or alternative treatments for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is underscored by the significant minority (47%) of SAD patients that is refractory to light therapy, the persistence of residual symptoms despite light treatment, and poor long-term compliance with light use. Because preliminary studies suggest that cognitive and behavioral factors are involved in SAD, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) warrants investigation as a possible treatment option.

Methods

We piloted a 6-week randomized clinical trial to compare a standard light therapy protocol; a novel, SAD-tailored, group CBT intervention; and their combination in ameliorating and remitting a current SAD episode and as prophylaxis against episode recurrence. Depressive symptom severity and remission rates were assessed at post-treatment and at a 1-year follow-up visit to examine long-term treatment durability.

Results

CBT, light therapy, and their combination all demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms on two different outcome measures. Remission rates varied by measure, but did not reach statistical significance. During the subsequent winter, CBT, particularly in combination with light therapy, appeared to improve long-term outcome regarding symptom severity, remission rates, and relapse rates. No CBT-treated participant, with or without light, experienced a full SAD relapse compared to over 60% of those treated with light alone.

Limitations

These results should be viewed as preliminary and are limited by the small sample size (n = 23) and lack of a control group.

Conclusions

The nearly half of SAD patients who do not remit with light alone may benefit from CBT as an adjunct or alternative treatment, especially as a prophylaxis against episode recurrence.

### Second-generation antidepressants for preventing seasonal affective disorder in adults [^117Rc7mp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on second-generation antidepressants (SGAs).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of SGAs (in comparison with other SGAs, placebo, light therapy, melatonin or agomelatine, psychological therapies or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we planned to include non-randomised studies. Eligible studies compared a SGA versus another SGA, placebo, light therapy, psychological therapy, melatonin, agomelatine or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare SGAs in combination with any of the comparator interventions versus placebo or the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text publications, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. When data were sufficient, we conducted random-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) meta-analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity by calculating the χ² statistic and the Cochran Q. We used the I² statistic to estimate the magnitude of heterogeneity. We assessed publication bias by using funnel plots. We rated the strength of the evidence using the system developed by the GRADE Working Group.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results and excluded 3619 records during title and abstract reviews. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, of which four publications (on three RCTs) providing data from 1100 people met eligibility criteria for this review. All three RCTs had methodological limitations due to high attrition rates. Overall, moderate-quality evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an efficacious intervention for prevention of recurrence of depressive episodes in people with a history of SAD (risk ratio (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.72; 3 RCTs, 1100 participants). However, bupropion XL leads to greater risk of headaches (moderate-quality evidence), insomnia and nausea (both low-quality evidence) when compared with placebo. Numbers needed to treat for additional beneficial outcomes (NNTBs) vary by baseline risks. For a population with a yearly recurrence rate of 30%, the NNTB is 8 (95% CI 6 to 12). For populations with yearly recurrence rates of 50% and 60%, NNTBs are 5 (95% CI 4 to 7) and 4 (95% CI 3 to 6), respectively. We could find no studies on other SGAs and no studies comparing SGAs with other interventions of interest, such as light therapy, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence indicates that bupropion XL is an effective intervention for prevention of recurrence of SAD. Nevertheless, even in a high-risk population, three out of four people will not benefit from preventive treatment with bupropion XL and will be at risk for harm. Clinicians need to discuss with patients advantages and disadvantages of preventive SGA treatment, and might want to consider offering other potentially efficacious interventions, which might confer a lower risk of adverse events. Given the lack of comparative evidence, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences. Future researchers need to assess the effectiveness and risk of harms of SGAs other than bupropion for prevention of SAD. Investigators also need to compare benefits and harms of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

### Seasonal affective disorder [^113qZZS1]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with seasonal affective disorder have episodes of major depression that tend to recur during specific times of the year, usually in winter. Like major depression, seasonal affective disorder probably is underdiagnosed in primary care settings. Although several screening instruments are available, such screening is unlikely to lead to improved outcomes without personalized and detailed attention to individual symptoms. Physicians should be aware of comorbid factors that could signal a need for further assessment. Specifically, some emerging evidence suggests that seasonal affective disorder may be associated with alcoholism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Seasonal affective disorder often can be treated with light therapy, which appears to have a low risk of adverse effects. Light therapy is more effective if administered in the morning. It remains unclear whether light is equivalent to drug therapy, whether drug therapy can augment the effects of light therapy, or whether cognitive behavior therapy is a better treatment choice.

### Melatonin and agomelatine for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^1154xzQa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly starts in autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD depends on latitude and ranges from 1.5% to 9%. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention in people who have a history of SAD. This is one of four reviews on the efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD; we focus on agomelatine and melatonin as preventive interventions.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin (in comparison with each other, placebo, second-generation antidepressants, light therapy, psychological therapy or lifestyle interventions) in preventing SAD and improving person-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

To examine efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we intended also to include non-randomised studies. We planned to include studies that compared agomelatine versus melatonin, or agomelatine or melatonin versus placebo, any second-generation antidepressant, light therapy, psychological therapies or lifestyle changes. We also intended to compare melatonin or agomelatine in combination with any of the comparator interventions mentioned above versus the same comparator intervention as monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies independently. We intended to pool data in a meta-analysis using a random-effects model, but included only one study.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations through electronic searches and reviews of reference lists after deduplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review and assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review. Only one study, providing data of 225 participants, met our eligibility criteria and compared agomelatine (25 mg/day) with placebo. We rated it as having high risk of attrition bias because nearly half of the participants left the study before completion. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes, because of high risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The main analysis based on data of 199 participants rendered an indeterminate result with wide confidence intervals (CIs) that may encompass both a relevant reduction as well as a relevant increase of SAD incidence by agomelatine (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Also the severity of SAD may be similar in both groups at the end of the study with a mean SIGH-SAD (Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders) score of 8.3 (standard deviation (SD) 9.4) in the agomelatine group and 10.1 (SD 10.6) in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -4.58 to 0.98; 199 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events may be similar in both groups. In the agomelatine group, 64 out of 112 participants experienced at least one adverse event, while 61 out of 113 did in the placebo group (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.34; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Three out of 112 patients experienced serious adverse events in the agomelatine group, compared to 4 out of 113 in the placebo group (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.30; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data on quality of life or interpersonal functioning were reported. We did not identify any studies on melatonin.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the uncertain evidence on agomelatine and the absence of studies on melatonin, no conclusion about efficacy and safety of agomelatine and melatonin for prevention of SAD can currently be drawn. The decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should consider patient preferences and reflect on the evidence base of all available treatment options.

### Lifestyle modification as intervention for seasonal affective disorder: a systematic review [^115gCNdZ]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Bright light therapy (BLT) and pharmacological therapies currently represent the first line treatments for patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Lifestyle modifications offer a diverse field of additional intervention options. Since it is unclear, if lifestyle modifications are effective in SAD patients, this systematic review aims to synthesize the current evidence on their effectiveness and safety. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing lifestyle modifications (nutrition, exercise, staying outdoors, sleep, social aspects, mindfulness methods) in SAD patients. We defined the primary outcome as the post-therapeutic extent of depressive symptoms, measured by validated psychiatric symptom scales. Due to the insufficient number of studies and the high heterogeneity of the interventions we were not able to calculate a meta-analysis. We identified 6 studies from the following areas of lifestyle modification: diet, exercise, staying outdoors, sleep and music therapy. All studies showed improvements of depression scores in the intervention as well as in the control groups. The risk of bias was rated as high for all studies and the certainty of evidence was rated as very low. The results point towards the possible effectiveness of the interventions examined, but due to the small number of studies found, too small sample sizes and methodological limitations, we cannot draw a valid conclusion about the effectiveness of lifestyle-modifying measures in SAD patients. Larger, high-quality RCTs are needed to make evidence-based recommendations and thus to expand the range of therapeutic options for SAD.

### Randomized trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy versus light therapy for seasonal affective disorder: acute outcomes [^114xupM6]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Whereas considerable evidence supports light therapy for winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD), data on cognitive-behavioral therapy for SAD (CBT-SAD) are promising but preliminary. This study estimated the difference between CBT-SAD and light therapy outcomes in a large, more definitive test.

Method

The participants were 177 adults with a current episode of major depression that was recurrent with a seasonal pattern. The randomized clinical trial compared 6 weeks of CBT-SAD (N = 88) and light therapy (N = 89). Light therapy consisted of 10,000-lux cool-white florescent light, initiated at 30 minutes each morning and adjusted according to a treatment algorithm based on response and side effects. CBT-SAD comprised 12 sessions of the authors' SAD-tailored protocol in a group format and was administered by Ph.D. psychologists in two 90-minute sessions per week. Outcomes were continuous scores on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-SAD Version (SIGH-SAD, administered weekly) and Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II, administered before treatment, at week 3, and after treatment) and posttreatment remission status based on cut points.

Results

Depression severity measured with the SIGH-SAD and BDI-II improved significantly and comparably with CBT-SAD and light therapy. Having a baseline comorbid diagnosis was associated with higher depression scores across all time points in both treatments. CBT-SAD and light therapy did not differ in remission rates based on the SIGH-SAD (47.6% and 47.2%, respectively) or the BDI-II (56.0% and 63.6%).

Conclusions

CBT-SAD and light therapy are comparably effective for SAD during an acute episode, and both may be considered as treatment options.

### Bright white light therapy in depression: a critical review of the evidence [^1179dgNB]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Light therapy is an accepted treatment option, at least for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Our aim was to critically evaluate treatment effects of bright white light (BWL) on the depressive symptoms in both SAD and non-seasonal depression.

Methods

The systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched (December 1974 through June 2014) for randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals. Study quality was assessed with a checklist developed by the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care. Only studies with high or medium quality were used in the meta-analyses.

Results

Eight studies of SAD and two studies of non-seasonal depression met inclusion and quality criteria. Effects on SAD were estimated in two meta-analyses. In the first, week by week, BWL reached statistical significance only at two and three weeks of treatment (Standardized Mean Difference, SMD: -0.50 (-CI 0.94, -0.05); -0.31 (-0.59, -0.03) respectively). The second meta-analysis, of endpoint data only, showed a SMD of -0.54 (CI: -0.95, -0.13), which indicates an advantage for BWL. No meta-analysis was performed for non-seasonal depression due to heterogeneity between studies.

Limitations

This analysis is restricted to short-term effects of BWL measured as mean changes in scores derived from SIGH-SAD, SIGH-SAD self-report, or HDRS rating scales.

Conclusions

Most studies of BWL have considerable methodological problems, and the results of published meta-analyses are highly dependent on the study selection. Even though quality criteria are introduced in the selection procedures of studies, when the results are carefully scrutinized, the evidence is not unequivocal.

### Management of seasonal affective disorder [^1177RCJU]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Low mood associated with a certain season (usually winter) is very common. For example, in the UK, up to 6% of adults have "recurrent major depressive episodes with seasonal pattern", commonly known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD). People with SAD consult in primary care more often than age- and gender-matched control groups; patients also receive more prescriptions and are referred more often to secondary care. Around 6–35% of patients require hospitalisation for SAD at some point.5 Here we discuss the management of adults with SAD, and in particular light therapy.

### Light therapy for preventing seasonal affective disorder [^1162yAg1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a seasonal pattern of recurrent major depressive episodes that most commonly occurs during autumn or winter and remits in spring. The prevalence of SAD ranges from 1.5% to 9%, depending on latitude. The predictable seasonal aspect of SAD provides a promising opportunity for prevention. This review - one of four reviews on efficacy and safety of interventions to prevent SAD - focuses on light therapy as a preventive intervention. Light therapy is a non-pharmacological treatment that exposes people to artificial light. Mode of delivery and form of light vary.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of light therapy (in comparison with no treatment, other types of light therapy, second-generation antidepressants, melatonin, agomelatine, psychological therapies, lifestyle interventions and negative ion generators) in preventing SAD and improving patient-centred outcomes among adults with a history of SAD.

Search Methods

We searched Ovid MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to 19 June 2018. An earlier search of these databases was conducted via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMD-CTR) (all years to 11 August 2015). Furthermore, we searched the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and international trial registers (to 19 June 2018). We also conducted a grey literature search and handsearched the reference lists of included studies and pertinent review articles.

Selection Criteria

For efficacy, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with a history of winter-type SAD who were free of symptoms at the beginning of the study. For adverse events, we also intended to include non-randomised studies. We intended to include studies that compared any type of light therapy (e.g. bright white light, administered by visors or light boxes, infrared light, dawn stimulation) versus no treatment/placebo, second-generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin, agomelatine, lifestyle changes, negative ion generators or another of the aforementioned light therapies. We also planned to include studies that looked at light therapy in combination with any comparator intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened abstracts and full-text publications, independently abstracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies.

Main Results

We identified 3745 citations after de-duplication of search results. We excluded 3619 records during title and abstract review. We assessed 126 full-text papers for inclusion in the review, but only one study providing data from 46 people met our eligibility criteria. The included RCT had methodological limitations. We rated it as having high risk of performance and detection bias because of lack of blinding, and as having high risk of attrition bias because study authors did not report reasons for dropouts and did not integrate data from dropouts into the analysis. The included RCT compared preventive use of bright white light (2500 lux via visors), infrared light (0.18 lux via visors) and no light treatment. Overall, white light and infrared light therapy reduced the incidence of SAD numerically compared with no light therapy. In all, 43% (6/14) of participants in the bright light group developed SAD, as well as 33% (5/15) in the infrared light group and 67% (6/9) in the non-treatment group. Bright light therapy reduced the risk of SAD incidence by 36%; however, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was very broad and included both possible effect sizes in favour of bright light therapy and those in favour of no light therapy (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.38; 23 participants, very low-quality evidence). Infrared light reduced the risk of SAD by 50% compared with no light therapy, but the CI was also too broad to allow precise estimations of effect size (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.17; 24 participants, very low-quality evidence). Comparison of both forms of preventive light therapy versus each other yielded similar rates of incidence of depressive episodes in both groups (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.50 to 3.28; 29 participants, very low-quality evidence). Reasons for downgrading evidence quality included high risk of bias of the included study, imprecision and other limitations, such as self-rating of outcomes, lack of checking of compliance throughout the study duration and insufficient reporting of participant characteristics. Investigators provided no information on adverse events. We could find no studies that compared light therapy versus other interventions of interest such as second-generation antidepressants, psychological therapies, melatonin or agomelatine.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence on light therapy as preventive treatment for people with a history of SAD is limited. Methodological limitations and the small sample size of the only available study have precluded review author conclusions on effects of light therapy for SAD. Given that comparative evidence for light therapy versus other preventive options is limited, the decision for or against initiating preventive treatment of SAD and the treatment selected should be strongly based on patient preferences.

### Treatment of seasonal affective disorder: unipolar versus bipolar differences [^116pxkf7]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2004). Low credibility.

Evidence-based treatments for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) include light therapy and pharmacotherapy. We briefly review the diagnosis and treatment of SAD, focusing on clinical and treatment differences between patients with unipolar and bipolar illness. Special considerations for the management of SAD in patients with bipolar disorder are discussed, including the need to monitor for emergence of manic and hypomanic mood switches, to use mood stabilizers in patients with bipolar I disorder, and to be aware of potential interactions between bright light and medications used in treating bipolar disorder. Chronobiological treatments such as bright light therapy may be combined with pharmacotherapy to enhance therapeutic effects, reduce adverse side effects, and optimize treatment in patients with seasonal and nonseasonal bipolar disorder.

### Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for seasonal affective disorder: a pilot study [^116g2Xqp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The best available treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is light therapy. Yet, this treatment does not prevent recurrence of depression in subsequent seasons. The aim of the study is to gain preliminary insight in the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in the prevention of SAD recurrence.

Methods

This is a randomized controlled pilot study, in which SAD patients in remission were randomly allocated to an individual format of MBCT or a control condition (i.e. treatment as usual). MBCT was given between May and June 2011, when there was no presence of depressive symptoms. The Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (IDS-SR), which patients received on a weekly basis from September 2011 to April 2012, was used to assess moment of recurrence (≥ 20) and severity at moment of recurrence.

Results

23 SAD patients were randomized to MBCT and 23 to the control condition. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the groups did not differ in moment of recurrence (χ²(1).41, p = .52). T-tests showed no group difference in mean IDS-SR scores at moment of recurrence (t(31) = -.52, p = .61).

Limitations

The results are limited by small sample size (n = 46) and missing data of weekly IDS-SR assessments.

Conclusion

The findings of this pilot RCT suggest that individual MBCT is not effective in preventing a SAD recurrence when offered in a symptom free period (i.e. spring).

### Outcomes one and two winters following cognitive-behavioral therapy or light therapy for seasonal affective disorder [^114eGzQH]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The central public health challenge for winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is recurrence prevention. Preliminary studies suggest better long-term outcomes following cognitive-behavioral therapy tailored for SAD (CBT-SAD) than light therapy. The present study is a large, randomized head-to-head comparison of these treatments on outcomes one and two winters after acute treatment.

Method

Community adults with major depression, recurrent with seasonal pattern (N = 177) were followed one and two winters after a randomized trial of 6 weeks of CBT-SAD (N = 88) or light therapy (N = 89). Prospective follow-up visits occurred in January or February of each year, and major depression status was assessed by telephone in October and December of the first year. The primary outcome was winter depression recurrence status on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD). Other outcomes were depression severity on the SIGH-SAD and the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II), remission status based on severity cutoff scores, and major depression status from tracking calls.

Results

The treatments did not differ on any outcome during the first year of follow-up. At the second winter, CBT-SAD was associated with a smaller proportion of SIGH-SAD recurrences (27.3% compared with 45.6%), less severe symptoms on both measures, and a larger proportion of remissions defined as a BDI-II score ≤ 8 (68.3% compared with 44.5%) compared with light therapy. Nonrecurrence at the next winter was more highly associated with nonrecurrence at the second winter among CBT-SAD participants (relative risk = 5.12) compared with light therapy participants (relative risk = 1.92).

Conclusions

CBT-SAD was superior to light therapy two winters following acute treatment, suggesting greater durability for CBT-SAD.

### Depressive mood and circadian rhythms disturbances as outcomes of seasonal affective disorder treatment: a systematic review [^111aUgh6]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The present systematic review was aimed at critically summarizing the evidence about interventions focused on circadian rhythms and mood symptoms in seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

Methods

A systematic search of the electronic databases PUBMED, PsycINFO and Web of Science was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Original papers reporting data about the effects of treatments on both mood and circadian rhythms disturbances in SAD patients were considered for inclusion. The quality of the evidence provided by the eligible studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 2.0) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool (ROBINS-I).

Results

Forty papers were deemed eligible for the systematic review. The evidence of treatment outcomes referring to circadian disturbances was not robust. Despite this, bright light therapy (BLT) demonstrates to phase-advance delayed rhythms and to improve sleep-wake disorders. As for mood symptoms, both BLT and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) show evidence of efficacy. The possible connection between improvements of mood symptoms and changes in circadian outcomes seems controversial.

Limitations

The included studies presented considerable methodological heterogeneity, small sample sizes and non-optimal sample selection.

Conclusions

The effectiveness of BLT in depressive symptoms and circadian disturbances of SAD was outlined by the present systematic review. The evidence about other biological and pharmacological treatments, although promising, should be replicated. A multifactorial etiopathogenesis could explain the heterogeneous clinical presentations of SAD and the complex link between mood and circadian symptoms.

14.2 Seasonal Affective Disorder

The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) in the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes associated with SAD was established in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients with a history of MDD with an autumn-winter seasonal pattern (as defined by DSM-IV criteria). Bupropion treatment was initiated prior to the onset of symptoms in the autumn (September to November). Treatment was discontinued following a 2-week taper that began during the first week of spring (fourth week of March), resulting in a treatment duration of approximately 4 to 6 months for the majority of patients. Patients were randomized to treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) or placebo. The initial bupropion dose was 150 mg once daily for 1 week, followed by up-titration to 300 mg once daily. Patients who were deemed by the investigator to be unlikely or unable to tolerate 300 mg once daily were allowed to remain on, or had their dose reduced to, 150 mg once daily. The mean bupropion doses in the 3 trials ranged from 257 mg to 280 mg per day. Approximately 59% of patients continued in the study for 3 to 6 months; 26% continued for < 3 months, 15% continued for > 6 months.

### Treatment measures for seasonal affective disorder: a network meta-analysis [^114vpM7T]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the potential effectiveness of several mainstream therapies, including phototherapy, antidepressants, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and negative ion generators, in the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).

Methods

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and WOS databases was conducted from January 1975 to December 3, 2022. Randomized controlled trials meeting predefined selection criteria for the treatment of SAD using mainstream therapeutic approaches were identified. After reviewing abstracts, data were synthesized and categorized based on the type of intervention and the targeted disorder.

Results

A total of 21 randomized controlled trials, involving 1037 participants, were included. The standardized mean difference of depression scores and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the efficacy of phototherapy for Seasonal Affective Disorder. The meta-analysis revealed that phototherapy was significantly more effective than other intervention groups or control therapies, with an effect size of 4.64(2.38,7.03). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that no factors could explain the significant heterogeneity observed. Phototherapy exhibited statistically significant mild to moderate therapeutic effects in alleviating depressive symptoms and can be considered as a clinical therapy for treating Seasonal Affective Disorder. However, the quality of evidence remains low, and further well-designed, larger sample size, and high-quality studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of phototherapy in treating Seasonal Affective Disorder.

Conclusion

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that bright light therapy is a promising first-line non-pharmacological treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), showing significant improvement in mood symptoms compared to placebo. The findings support the use of bright light therapy as an effective and well-tolerated intervention for SAD. However, further large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of different treatment approaches for SAD.

4 ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF BIPOLAR DEPRESSION

4.1 Presentations of bipolar depression

The DSM‐5 criteria for bipolar depression are unchanged from DSM‐IV. Depression is characterized by a minimum of 2 weeks of depressed mood and/or anhedonia and at least four other symptoms that include changes in sleep, appetite/weight, energy, psychomotor activity, concentration, thought content (guilt and worthlessness), and suicidal intent. For many patients with BD, the depressive polarity is often more pervasive and more debilitating than manic states, with estimates that depressed mood accounts for up to two‐thirds of the time spent unwell, even with treatment. 12, 223, 224 Subsyndromal depressive symptoms, which persist despite treatment, are particularly common and a major source of functional impairment in these patients. 225, 226, 227, 228, 229 They should be treated aggressively.

DSM‐5 includes several specifiers that may accompany depressive episodes: anxious distress, mixed features, rapid cycling, melancholic features, atypical features, mood‐congruent or mood‐incongruent psychotic features, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern (Table 5). The utility of several of these specifiers in selecting treatment options for depression is discussed later in this section (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choices").

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of psychological, psychosocial, pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for adults with a new episode of depression [^111qTajs]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of treatments for adults with a new episode of unipolar depression was undertaken according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for NMAs. The study protocol (Appendix 1) was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019151328). The review focused on first-line treatments for a new depressive episode, as separate reviews were conducted to identify suitable treatments for people who did not respond to previous treatment and those with chronic depression.

Search strategy

Searches for RCTs (and systematic reviews of RCTs) of treatments for adults with depression were conducted in Embase, Emcare, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception, using relevant medical subject headings, free-text terms, and study type filters where appropriate (Appendix 1). The search was undertaken in May 2019 and updated in June 2020, with this date limit set to meet NICE guidance publication timelines (see also 2023 review update section below, specific to this publication). Additional search methods included checking reference lists of systematic reviews (identified through the electronic database search), and citation searches using Web-of-Science for included studies.

Selection criteria

RCTs were eligible for inclusion if ≥ 80% of participants were adults not currently receiving treatment, initiated on first-line treatment for a new episode of unipolar depression (or subthreshold depressive symptoms) according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or similar criteria, or by scoring above threshold on a validated depression scale. We excluded populations with perinatal depression, seasonal affective disorder, bipolar disorder, learning disabilities or in contact with the criminal justice system. Trials of further-line treatment, those specifically recruiting participants with depression and a physical health condition, or where ≥ 20% of participants had psychotic symptoms or a co-existing personality disorder or chronic depression were also excluded. We included only studies reporting data that could inform one or more outcomes of interest (described under 'Analysis plan and data extraction').

### Patterns of depressive symptom remission during the treatment of seasonal affective disorder with cognitive-behavioral therapy or light therapy [^112YYnYa]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To elucidate mechanisms related to remission in winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD), we explored the course of individual depressive symptom offset across two distinct treatment modalities that show comparable outcomes at treatment endpoint: cognitive-behavioral therapy for SAD (CBT-SAD) and light therapy (LT).

Method

One hundred seventy-seven adults with SAD in a depressive episode were randomized to 6-weeks of CBT-SAD (n = 88) or LT (n = 89). Symptoms were assessed via the 29-item Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-SAD Version (SIGH-SAD) at pretreatment and weekly during treatment. Survival analyses were conducted for the 17 SIGH-SAD items endorsed by more than 40 participants at pretreatment. Within each of the included symptoms, data from participants who endorsed the symptom at pretreatment and who had 3 or fewer weeks missing were included.

Results

For most (13/17; 76%) symptoms, CBT-SAD and LT did not differ in time to remission. However, for four symptoms (early insomnia, psychic anxiety, hypersomnia, and social withdrawal), LT led to symptom remission more quickly than CBT-SAD.

Conclusions

Symptom remission progressed comparably across CBT-SAD and LT for most symptoms. Despite the fact that the two treatments led to similar remission rates and improvements at treatment endpoint, for early insomnia, psychic anxiety, hypersomnia, and social withdrawal, LT led to symptom remission faster than CBT-SAD. These results suggest different mechanisms and pathways to the same therapeutic end. Speedier remission of early insomnia and hypersomnia is consistent with the theory that SAD is related to a pathological circadian phase-shift that can be corrected with LT.

### Circadian rhythms and mood disorders: time to see the light [^1167LTy5]. Neuron (2024). Medium credibility.

The importance of time is ever prevalent in our world, and disruptions to the normal light/dark and sleep/wake cycle have now become the norm rather than the exception for a large part of it. All mood disorders, including seasonal affective disorder (SAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD), are strongly associated with abnormal sleep and circadian rhythms in a variety of physiological processes. Environmental disruptions to normal sleep/wake patterns, light/dark changes, and seasonal changes can precipitate episodes. Moreover, treatments that target the circadian system have proven to be therapeutic in certain cases. This review will summarize much of our current knowledge of how these disorders associate with specific circadian phenotypes, as well as the neuronal mechanisms that link the circadian clock with mood regulation. We also discuss what has been learned from therapies that target circadian rhythms and how we may use current knowledge to develop more individually designed treatments.

### 100, 000 lumens to treat seasonal affective disorder: a proof of concept RCT of bright, whole-ROom, all-day (BROAD) light therapy [^1176zpLc]. Depression and Anxiety (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is common and debilitating. The standard of care includes light therapy provided by a light box; however, this treatment is restrictive and only moderately effective. Advances in LED technology enable lighting solutions that emit vastly more light than traditional light boxes. Here, we assess the feasibility of BROAD (Bright, whole-ROom, All-Day) light therapy and get a first estimate for its potential effectiveness.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment for 4 weeks; either a very brightly illuminated room in their home for at least 6h per day (BROAD light therapy) or 30min in front of a standard 10,000 lux SAD light box. Feasibility was assessed by monitoring recruitment, adherence, and side effects. SAD symptoms were measured at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks, with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorders 29-items, self-report version.

Results

All 62 patients who started treatment were available at 4-week follow-up and no significant adverse effects were reported. SAD symptoms of both groups improved similarly and considerably, in line with previous results. Exploratory analyses indicate that a higher illuminance (lux) is associated with a larger symptom improvement in the BROAD light therapy group.

Conclusions

BROAD light therapy is feasible and seems similarly effective as the standard of care while not confining the participants to 30min in front of a light box. In follow-up trials, BROAD light therapy could be modified for increased illuminance, which would likely improve its effectiveness.

### Manipulating the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms to improve clinical management of major depression [^112t86tc]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The challenge of bipolar depression

One of the areas of greatest therapeutic frustration has been the treatment of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder. Importantly, conventional monoamine-based medications are of least benefit in these patients. At this time a new range of second generation antipsychotic medications, anticonvulsants and other mood-stabilizing agents form the basis of care (often in combination with antidepressant agents). Conventional lithium therapy is not an effective monotherapy for bipolar depression. Given the very strong circadian features of bipolar disorder, and this failure to develop effective therapies for the depressive phase based on monoamine targets, it (along with the other circadian-like mood disorders such as seasonal affective disorder, winter depression, seasonally-sensitive unipolar depression, bipolar spectrum disorders, atypical depression) may benefit from a new circadian-based approach to treatment selection. A recent report suggests that adjunctive use of a novel melatonin agonist (ramelteon) may help to prevent relapse of bipolar disorder, and most notably relapse into the depressive phase.

### Assessing seasonal and weather effects on depression and physical activity using mobile health data [^115amZfe]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of diverse interventions, such as exercise, light therapy, and antidepressants, in preventing depression; however, their effectiveness varies significantly across individuals. Contextualizing the impact of seasonal depression variations can help identify factors influencing the effectiveness of these interventions, enabling healthcare research and real-world practice substantially. In clinical studies, for instance, stratifying populations based on the impact of weather or SAD could help deconvolve the heterogeneity of treatment responses across treatment and placebo groups. Additionally, recognizing different types of SAD allows healthcare providers to implement preventive measures, such as adjusting medication dosages or intensifying psychotherapy, before or during high-risk periods. Moreover, understanding a patient's response to changes in weather can enhance personalized intervention strategies. For example, recommending cooler, shaded areas for exercise intervention for those whose depression worsens with rising temperatures, or warmer environments for those sensitive to cold. However, there is a need for future qualitative research to work with participants experiencing SAD to understand how weather changes affect their daily functioning. Further research is also needed to improve the effectiveness of personalized interventions based on individuals' responses to seasonal changes in real-world applications.

### Body mass index and atypical balance as predictors of winter depression remission in cognitive-behavioral therapy and light therapy [^115DjfDp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Efficacious treatments for winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) include light therapy (LT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-SAD); however, baseline characteristics may differentially predict treatment outcomes. This study investigated body mass index (BMI) and atypical balance (the proportion of atypical depression symptoms), as predictors of depression remission.

Methods

The parent study randomized 177 adults diagnosed with Major Depression, Recurrent with Seasonal Pattern to 6-weeks of CBT-SAD (n = 88) or LT (n = 89) and followed participants one and two winters later. At baseline, BMI was measured and atypical balance was derived using the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD) as 8-item atypical subscale score/total SIGH-SAD score × 100. Depression remission was defined using standard SIGH-SAD cutpoints. Hierarchical logistic regressions tested the main effects of treatment modality, BMI, and atypical balance and their interactive effects on depression remission at post-treatment and follow-ups.

Results

The BMI × treatment and atypical balance × treatment interactions significantly predicted depression remission at second winter follow-up. The probability of remission was higher in CBT-SAD than LT at BMI ≤ 26.1 and atypical balance ≤ 40.3%. This predictive relationship survived when adjusting atypical balance for BMI, but not vice-versa.

Limitations

Participants were predominantly White and older. BMI does not account for muscle mass or fat distribution.

Conclusions

BMI and atypical balance prescriptively predicted higher likelihood of depression remission two winters following CBT-SAD but not LT. This work informs clinical decision-making and precision medicine efforts.

### Evolving applications of light therapy [^117Lcq6P]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

The psychiatric intervention, light therapy, grew from an intensive 25-year research focus on seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Dosing and timing strategies have been honed to optimize the antidepressant effect, and efficacy relative to placebo has provided the evidence base for widespread implementation. A persistent question has been whether the model system for SAD has wider utility for psychiatric disturbance, even beyond depression. The circadian phase-shifting capacity of timed light exposure is universal, and chronobiological factors are at play across the disease spectrum. Recent promising initiatives extend to light treatment for nonseasonal major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, including drug- and electroconvulsive therapy-resistant cases. With light therapy, patients with antepartum depression may find an alternative to medication during pregnancy. Cognitive improvement under light therapy has been noted in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motor function in Parkinson's disease has improved in parallel with the antidepressant effect of light therapy. The rest-activity disturbance of elderly dementia has been partially allayed under light therapy. In a new initiative, three major chronotherapeutic inventions-light therapy, sleep deprivation (wake therapy) and sleep time displacement (sleep phase advance therapy) are being combined to snap hospitalized patients out of deep depression and maintain long-term improvement.

Ongoing and recently completed clinical trials

Perhaps further highlighting the need for additional treatment options, there are several ongoing clinical trials for BD-D. The following list is not exhaustive but is intended to give a sense of the breadth of mechanisms of action that are being considered potentially useful in BD-D. The list of clinical trials is presented in an order that reflects the phase of clinical trials, from recruitment to completed phase III trials.

Light therapy, which is well established as treatment for seasonal affective disorder, is currently being studied for use in BD-D, and the trial is in the recruitment phase (NCT00590265). Tai chi and qigong are both being studied for subsyndromal BD-D in older adults, and the trial is in the recruitment phase (NCT04450147). Vestibular stimulation, which has been shown to be an effective non-invasive treatment for major depression, is being studied for BD-D and is in the recruitment phase (NCT02778256). In a related manner, scopolamine is in phase II of an RCT (NCT04211961). Also in phase II trials are adjunctive oral uridine (NCT00841269), the antiglucocorticoid mifepristone (NCT0043654), and felbamate, an anticonvulsant that is FDA-approved for partial and generalised seizures (NCT00034229).

3 ACUTE MANAGEMENT OF BIPOLAR MANIA

3.1 Presentations of mania

DSM‐5 5 made a change to "criterion A" for mania which now requires a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy present most of the day, nearly every day for at least 1 week (or less time if hospitalization is necessary). In addition, a diagnosis of a "manic episode" requires at least three (or four if the mood is only irritable) of the following symptoms: inflated self‐esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, more talkative than usual or pressure of speech, flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing, distractibility, increased goal‐directed activity or psychomotor agitation, or excessive involvement in activities with a high potential for painful consequences. The mood disturbance must lead to marked impairment in functioning, require hospitalization, or be accompanied by psychotic features.

Unlike DSM‐IV, DSM‐5 allows a diagnosis of BDI in patients with major depression whose mania emerges during treatment (eg, during medication or electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]) and persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of the treatment.

DSM‐5 has eliminated the categorical "mixed episode" specifier, replacing it with the more dimensional "mixed features". DSM‐5 also includes other specifiers that can accompany a manic episode: anxious distress, rapid cycling, mood‐congruent or mood‐incongruent psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern (Table 5). The utility of several of these specifiers in selecting treatment options for mania is discussed later in this section (see "Clinical features that help direct treatment choice").

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin) [^1127u8e1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Seasonal Affective Disorder

The efficacy of Wellbutrin XL in the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes associated with SAD was established in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in adult outpatients with a history of MDD with an autumn-winter seasonal pattern (as defined by DSM-IV criteria). Bupropion treatment was initiated prior to the onset of symptoms in the autumn (September to November). Treatment was discontinued following a 2-week taper that began during the first week of spring (fourth week of March), resulting in a treatment duration of approximately 4 to 6 months for the majority of patients. Patients were randomized to treatment with Wellbutrin XL or placebo. The initial bupropion dose was 150 mg once daily for 1 week, followed by up-titration to 300 mg once daily. Patients who were deemed by the investigator to be unlikely or unable to tolerate 300 mg once daily were allowed to remain on, or had their dose reduced to, 150 mg once daily. The mean bupropion doses in the 3 trials ranged from 257 mg to 280 mg per day. Approximately 59% of patients continued in the study for 3 to 6 months; 26% continued for < 3 months, 15% continued for > 6 months.

To enter the trials, patients must have had a low level of depressive symptoms, as demonstrated by a score of < 7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD17) and a HAMD24 score of < 14. The primary efficacy measure was the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders (SIGH-SAD), which is identical to the HAMD24. The SIGH-SAD consists of the HAMD17 plus 7 items specifically assessing core symptoms of seasonal affective disorder: social withdrawal, weight gain, increased appetite, increased eating, carbohydrate craving, hypersomnia, and fatigability. The primary efficacy endpoint was the onset of a seasonal major depressive episode. The criteria for defining an episode included: 1) the investigator's judgment that a major depressive episode had occurred or that the patient required intervention for depressive symptoms, or 2) a SIGH-SAD score of > 20 on 2 consecutive weeks. The primary analysis was a comparison of depression-free rates between the bupropion and placebo groups.

### Calibration of response and remission cut-points on the beck depression inventory-second edition for monitoring seasonal affective disorder treatment outcomes [^115BBzFc]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study is to define treatment response and remission cut-point scores for the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (BDI-II) when used to monitor seasonal affective disorder (SAD) treatment.

Methods

Data from two published randomized clinical trials for SAD were utilized to complete a ROC analysis to define response and remission thresholds for the BDI-II. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD) was used as a reference standard. Data from the two trials included BDI-II and SIGH-SAD scores for patients at baseline, 6 weeks (post-treatment), and 1 year (next winter).

Results

BDI-II score of ≤ 9 was the derived criterion for remission of SAD, and BDI-II score decrease of 50% from baseline was the criterion for treatment response.

Limitations

Study participants were primarily female (94%) and Caucasian (80%) so demographic diversity of the sample was limited.

Conclusion

This study validated BDI-II scores compared to the SIGH-SAD reference standard. The BDI-II has greater potential for widespread use by clinicians than the SIGH-SAD to monitor SAD patients because it is a brief self-report instrument that can be conveniently administered in the waiting room.

### The effects of blue-enriched light treatment compared to standard light treatment in seasonal affective disorder [^111At7Sj]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

One of the most frequently investigated hypotheses of the pathophysiology underlying Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a disturbance of circadian rhythms. Since the circadian system as well as other non-visual effects is especially sensitive to blue light, a new light therapy device with blue enriched polychromatic light was tested for its efficacy to treat SAD.

Methods

Within one winter 52 patients were treated in one of three conditions: 30 min full spectrum light (9000 lx, 5000 K), 30 min blue-enriched light (9000 lx, 17,000 K), or 20 min blue-enriched light. The study lasted 22 days with 10 days of morning-light treatment on weekdays during the first 2 weeks.

Results

Depressive symptoms (SIGH SAD) diminished over the 3-week period in all conditions, with no significant differences between conditions. The percentage responders were high, differing from 75%, 59% and 71% for the standard-LT, 30 min blue-enriched-LT, and 20 min blue-enriched-LT, respectively.

Conclusion

The lack of superiority of high intensity blue-enriched light over standard bright light treatment does not clearly support nor rule out the possibility of an important role for the circadian system or the blue sensitive non-visual image forming system in general, in the pathophysiology of SAD. The lack of a difference between conditions may also be the result of a saturated response to the high light intensities used. Recent data indeed suggest that low intensity blue-enriched light may be as effective as standard bright light treatment. The possibility of improving light therapy for SAD patients by applying light of shorter duration or at lower light intensities is highly relevant for optimizing treatment and will help to clarify the role of the circadian system and/or the non-image forming photoreceptors in SAD pathophysiology.

### Quality of life as an outcome indicator in patients with seasonal affective disorder: results from the can-SAD study [^112Ci8WT]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Although a host of studies have now examined the relationship between quality of life (QoL) and non-seasonal depression, few have measured QoL in seasonal affective disorder (SAD). We report here on results from the Can-SAD trial, which assessed the impact of treatment with either antidepressant medication or light therapy upon QoL in patients diagnosed with SAD.

Method

This Canadian double-blind, multicentre, randomized controlled trial included 96 patients who met strict diagnostic criteria for SAD. Eligible patients were randomized to 8 weeks of treatment with either: (1) 10000 lux light treatment and a placebo capsule or (2) 100 lux light treatment (placebo light) and 20 mg fluoxetine. QoL was measured with the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-20) at baseline and 8 weeks.

Results

Both intervention groups showed significant improvement in QoL over time with no significant differences being detected by treatment condition. Q-LES-Q scores increased significantly in seven of eight domains, with the average scores rising from 48 x 0 (S.D. = 10 x 7) at baseline to 69 x 1 (S.D. = 15 x 6) at week 8. Treatment-related improvement in QoL was strongly associated with improvement in depression symptoms.

Discussion

Patients with SAD report markedly impaired QoL during the winter months. Treatment with light therapy or antidepressant medication is associated with equivalent marked improvement in perceived QoL. Studies of treatment interventions for SAD should routinely include broader indices of patient outcome, such as the assessment of psychosocial functioning or life quality.

### Light room therapy effective in mild forms of seasonal affective disorder – a randomised controlled study [^112semeW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The most common way to provide bright light therapy to Swedish patients with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), is treatment in a light therapy room. Since few studies have evaluated treatment provided in this setting and few have evaluated the effect of bright light in sub-clinical SAD (S-SAD), such a study including a one-month follow-up was designed.

Methods

Fifty adults recruited from a previous prevalence study and clinically assessed as having SAD or S-SAD, were randomised to treatment in a light room or to a three-week waiting-list control group. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorders Self-rating 29-items Version (SIGH-SAD/SR) was used to measure depressive mood at baseline, directly following treatment and at the one-month follow-up.

Results

ANCOVA with adjustment for baseline depression score, showed a significant main effect for the light room therapy group (p < 0.001). Fifty-four percent (n = 13/24) improved ≥ 50% while no such improvement was seen in the control condition (n = 0/24). After merging the two groups, repeated measures ANOVA confirmed the experimental analysis (p < 0.001). At the one-month follow-up, 83.0% (n = 39/47) had improved ≥ 50% and 63.8% (n = 30/47) had normal depression scores, i.e. ≤ 8.

Conclusions

Light room therapy was effective in reducing depressive symptoms in subjects with winter depressive mood. Results were maintained over a period of one month.

### Controlled trial of naturalistic dawn simulation and negative air ionization for seasonal affective disorder [^113QD3nc]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This trial assessed two novel nonpharmaceutical treatments for winter depression-naturalistic dawn simulation and high-density negative air ionization-delivered during the final hours of sleep.

Method

The patients were 99 adults (77 women and 22 men) with the winter seasonal pattern of major depressive disorder (94 cases) and bipolar II disorder (five cases). Five parallel groups received 1) dawn simulation (0.0003–250 lux in the pattern of May 5 at 45 degrees north latitude); 2) a dawn light pulse (13 minutes, 250 lux, with an illuminant dose of 3.25×10³ lux-minutes matched to the simulated dawn); 3) postawakening bright light (30 minutes, 10,000 lux); 4) negative air ionization at high flow rate (93 minutes, 4.5×10¹⁴ ions/second); or 5) ionization at low flow rate (93 minutes, 1.7×10¹¹ ions/second). The symptoms were assessed over 3 weeks with the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version.

Results

Posttreatment improvement results were bright light, 57.1%; dawn simulation, 49.5%; dawn pulse, 42.7%; high-density ions, 47.9%; and low-density ions, 22.7% (significantly lower than the others). Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, analysis of variance failed to find superiority of dawn simulation to the dawn pulse or bright light. However, the dawn pulse led to a pattern of residual or exacerbated depressive symptoms similar to those seen in low-density ion nonresponders.

Conclusions

Naturalistic dawn simulation and high-density ionization are active antidepressants that do not require the effort of postawakening bright light therapy. They can be considered candidate alternatives to bright light or medication.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin xl) [^111uhKmw]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Major Depressive Disorder: WELLBUTRIN XL is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4-week controlled trials of inpatients and in one 6-week controlled trial of outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the Major Depression category of the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (see CLINICAL TRIALS).

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies the presence of 1) depressed mood or 2) loss of interest or pleasure; in addition, at least 5 of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning: depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation.

The efficacy of bupropion in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial with the sustained-release formulation of bupropion (see CLINICAL TRIALS). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use WELLBUTRIN XL for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Seasonal Affective Disorder: WELLBUTRIN XL is indicated for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder.

The efficacy of WELLBUTRIN XL for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes was established in 3 controlled trials of adult outpatients with a history of major depressive disorder with an autumn-winter seasonal pattern as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria (see CLINICAL TRIALS).

Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by recurrent major depressive episodes, most commonly occurring during the autumn and/or winter months. Episodes may last up to 6 months in duration, typically beginning in the autumn and remitting in the springtime. Although patients with seasonal affective disorder may have depressive episodes during other times of the year, the diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder requires that the number of seasonal episodes substantially outnumber the number of non-seasonal episodes during the individual's lifetime.

### Which placebo to cure depression? A thought-provoking network meta-analysis [^111yXikd]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Eligibility criteria

Types of participants

We reviewed studies involving adults (age 18 and over) with a diagnosis of major depressive episode (DSM IV, DSM IV-R, DSM III, DSM III-R, ICD 10, Feighner criteria, Research Diagnostic Criteria). Studies involving patients with other psychiatric or medical comorbidity were considered only when it was not an explicit inclusion criterion for the study. Studies involving patients with a diagnosis of anxious depression were also considered.

Studies involving more than 20% subjects with bipolar disorder were excluded, as were studies exclusively involving patients with seasonal affective disorder, post-partum depression, postmenopausal depression, atypical depression, dysthymia and studies involving elderly patients.

Types of intervention(s)

Our primary aim was to compare placebo arms. We focused our attention on three different placebos: 1) fluoxetine placebo (FLUp, where placebo was compared to fluoxetine), 2) venlafaxine placebo (VENLAFp, where placebo was compared to venlafaxine), and 3) venlafaxine/fluoxetine placebo (FLU/VENLAFp, where placebo was compared to both venlafaxine and fluoxetine), which were obviously compared with the corresponding antidepressants in oral mono-therapy in major depressive disorder first line acute treatment.

Types of outcomes

Response was chosen as the primary outcome. Remission was chosen as a secondary outcome. These outcomes are the most consistently reported estimates of acute-treatment efficacy. Response was defined as the proportion of patients who had a reduction of at least 50% from the baseline score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Remission was defined as the proportion of patients who had a HDRS score ≤ 7 or a MADRS score ≤ 12.

When trials reported results from both rating scales, we extracted data from the scale considered in the study as the primary outcome.

Types of studies

In this review were included 1) randomized controlled trials of fluoxetine or venlafaxine against placebo and 2) head-to-head trials of fluoxetine versus venlafaxine with or without placebo control. All studies were conducted from January 1989 to July 2009. Only study reports in English, French and Spanish language were considered.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of bright light and high-density negative air ions for treatment of seasonal affective disorder [^112BWEDc]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

This study, conducted over the course of 5 years, assessed the antidepressant efficacy of two active treatments, bright white light and high-density negative ions, and the efficacy of two placebo treatments, dim red light and low-density negative ions, for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). In a controlled laboratory setting, 73 women with SAD were exposed to one of the four treatment conditions over 12 consecutive days. Pretreatment expectation ratings did not significantly differ among the four treatment groups; however, expectation scores and treatment benefits were positively related. Over the course of treatment, subjects in all four groups showed significant score decreases on the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-Seasonal Affective Disorder Version-Self Rating (SIGH-SAD-SR) and on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). For raw scale scores, neither main effects of treatment nor interactions between treatment and time were significant. When remission outcome criteria were used, bright white light was significantly more effective than any of the other three treatments, and exposure to high-density negative ions was more effective than either of the two placebo conditions, although the difference was not significant.

### Brighter future for light therapy: harmonising the reporting of light interventions in psychiatry [^114YVk1t]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

The use of light for therapeutic purposes dates back millennia. Light therapy, as a possible treatment for seasonal affective disorders, was first identified in the mid-1980s. In modern psychiatry, bright light therapy has also been shown to be effective and safe for the treatment of non-seasonal major depressive disorder. Large-scale cohort analyses showing that both daytime and night-time light exposure are associated with psychiatric diseases reinforce the importance of light for mental healthand have led to a renewed consideration of the impact of lighting in the urban environment on human health. Despite the increasing evidence that lighting has profound and widespread impacts on health and functioning, there remains a notable gap in our understanding of the mechanisms and features of effective light therapy strategies for mood disorders, prompting further in-lab research in humans.

The reproducibility of research findings, and therefore the reliability of clinical recommendations, hinges on proper reporting of the methodological details of a given trial. To this end, reporting checklists and guidelines have been developed for various fields and contexts, including Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for clinical trials (CONSORT), Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for observational trials (STROBE)and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for systematic reviews (PRISMA). Despite their valuable contribution to standardising reporting practices, they sometimes lack the granularity needed to understand individual interventions, such as lighting interventions.

In a review of 19 published studies examining the non-visual impacts of light on health and physiology, we could not find a single metric to quantify light exposure that was reported across all studies. As light can vary across numerous attributes — illuminance, spectrum, wavelength, spatial distribution — it is essential that interventions are described precisely. For example, consider two room lighting or light therapy devices delivering 100 lux at eye level by white light, where one is a very bluish 'cool light' and the other is very orange 'warm light'. Without a description of the spectral qualities of the illumination, the two scenarios may be read as similar, yet, the bluish-white light could be at least two times as effective in eliciting non-visual responses, such as those on mood.

### Bupropion hydrobromide (Aplenzin) [^1116aRos]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Instructions for Use

To minimize the risk of seizure, increase the dose gradually [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

APLENZIN should be swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed. APLENZIN should be administered in the morning and may be taken with or without regard to meals.

2.2 Equivalent Daily Doses of APLENZIN (Bupropion hydrobromide) and Bupropion hydrochloride

See Table 1 for equivalent daily doses of APLENZIN (bupropion hydrobromide) and bupropion hydrochloride.

2.3 Dosage for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)

The recommended starting dose for MDD is 174 mg once daily in the morning. After 4 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 348 mg once daily in the morning.

It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of antidepressant treatment beyond the response in the acute episode. It is unknown whether the APLENZIN dose needed for maintenance treatment is identical to the dose that provided an initial response. Periodically reassess the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment.

2.4 Dosage for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

The recommended starting dose for SAD is 174 mg once daily. After 7 days of dosing, the dose may be increased to the target dose of 348 mg once daily in the morning. Doses above 300 mg of bupropion HCl extended-release (equivalent to APLENZIN 348 mg) were not assessed in the SAD trials.

For the prevention of seasonal MDD episodes associated with SAD, initiate APLENZIN in the autumn, prior to the onset of depressive symptoms. Continue treatment through the winter season. Taper and discontinue APLENZIN in early spring. For patients treated with 348 mg per day, decrease the dose to 174 mg once daily before discontinuing APLENZIN. Individualize the timing of initiation, and duration of treatment should be individualized, based on the patient's historical pattern of seasonal MDD episodes.

2.5 To Discontinue APLENZIN, Taper the Dose

When discontinuing treatment in patients treated with APLENZIN 348 mg once daily, decrease the dose to 174 mg once daily prior to discontinuation.

### A comparison of open treatment of seasonal major and minor depression with light therapy [^114FTRkH]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Although several investigators have described a milder form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD), called subsyndromal SAD, little is known about the effect of light therapy in this group. The current study evaluates 3 weeks of open treatment with light therapy in SAD and subsyndromal SAD patients.

Methods

Subjects with major or minor depression according to DSM-IV with a seasonal pattern were recruited during the winter of 1998–1999 from clinic patients and media advertising. Subjects were commenced on open treatment of morning light therapy, for 30 min daily using a new fluorescent light therapy unit that produced approximately 5,000 lux at a distance of 12 inches. The treatment lasted 3 weeks and at the end of the first and second week of treatment the duration of exposure could be increased to a maximum of 60 min at the discretion of the clinician. The Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-SAD version (SIGH-SAD) was administered weekly to evaluate outcome. Response was defined in a variety of ways to reflect the fact that subsyndromal SAD subjects had milder symptoms.

Results

Forty-six subjects entered treatment and 44 (SAD, n = 29, subsyndromal SAD, n = 15) completed at least 2 weeks. Response rates were generally similar in SAD subjects (64–69%) and subsyndromal SAD (40–67%) patients. There was a trend for longer exposure to be associated with better outcome.

Conclusions

Light therapy may be an effective treatment for subjects with both major and minor depression with a seasonal pattern. Optimal duration, for the light therapy unit used in this study, is likely 45–60 min daily.

### Seasonal variation in mood in African American college students in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area [^113mVsvR]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors attempted to estimate the occurrence, frequency, and pattern (winter versus summer) of seasonal affective disorder in African American college students. They hypothesized that winter seasonal affective disorder would be more prevalent than summer seasonal affective disorder.

Method

Undergraduate and graduate college students who identified themselves as African Americans living in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area were invited to participate in the study. The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire was used to calculate a global seasonality score and to estimate the frequency of seasonal affective disorder and subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder. The frequency of the summer versus winter pattern of seasonality of seasonal affective disorder was compared by using multinomial probability distribution tests. The effects of gender and the awareness of seasonal affective disorder were evaluated with a two-way analysis of variance.

Results

Of 646 students who were invited to participate, 597 returned the questionnaires, and 537 (83.1%) fully completed them. Winter seasonal affective disorder was significantly more prevalent than summer seasonal affective disorder. The mean global seasonality score was 8.3 (SD = 5.3). The majority of the subjects (80%) were not aware of the existence of seasonal affective disorder.

Conclusions

The authors found that the frequency, magnitude, and pattern of seasonality of mood in African American students were similar to those previously reported in the general population at similar latitude, but that awareness of the existence of seasonal affective disorder, a condition with safe and effective treatment options, was lower.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113NwANQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Cocaine use disorder — bupropion may be considered as a pharmacotherapeutic option: For patients with cocaine use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing bupropion to promote cocaine abstinence (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Bupropion is a dual dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation, and a small amount of evidence exists for bupropion facilitating abstinence from cocaine use; while it was not found to be superior to placebo on cocaine abstinence at the end of treatment or on treatment retention, it was superior to placebo on sustained (ie, 3 or more weeks) abstinence in two RCTs. Additional considerations include co-occurring tobacco use disorder (TUD) and depressive disorders: clinicians can give bupropion additional consideration for patients with co-occurring TUD, as this medication can also reduce nicotine/tobacco use (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and clinicians can give bupropion additional consideration for patients with co-occurring depressive disorders, as this medication can also treat depression (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Safety notes state that bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with history of seizure or anorexia or bulimia nervosa and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated seizure risk.

### Existing and emerging pharmacological approaches to the treatment of mania: a critical overview [^115YTf25]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar Disorders (BDs) are a group of severe mood disorders with a chronic and recurrent course, characterized by periods of euthymia alternated with manic/hypomanic, depressive with or without the presence of mixed features and mixed episodes. BDs rank as the 17th leading source of disability among all diseases worldwide with the highest suicide rate among all psychiatric conditions, being 20–30 times higher than in the general population. Within BDs, manic episodes (MEs) affect overall more than 1% of the general population. The presence of a manic episode is the required criterion needed for the diagnosis of BD type I (BD-I).

The 5th and last edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has made changes to the "criterion A" for a ME, which now requires a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy present most of the day, almost every day for minimum 1 week (or less if patient requires hospitalization). According to the DSM-5 definition, a ME must be accompanied by marked impairment in psychosocial functioning, require hospitalization, and/or involve psychotic symptoms. Another difference between DSM-5 and its prior editions is that a diagnosis of BD-I can now be made in patients in whom the ME emerges while being treated (i.e. with medication or ECT) for major depression, when a fully syndromic ME persists beyond the expectable effect of the treatment. Moreover, in DSM-5 the diagnosis of "mixed episode" no longer exists, and has been replaced with the more dimensional "with mixed features" specifier that can be applied to mania or hypomania. The DSM-5 included other specifiers that can accompany a manic episode, such as anxious distress, rapid cycling, mood-congruent or mood-incongruent psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset, and seasonal pattern. As for latest version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), which from 2022 should be in worldwide use, the definition of a ME is now almost identical with the DSM-5 as regards entry criteria, duration, hospitalization, and the presence or absence of psychotic features and impairment in social and occupational functioning, although with some formal and methodological dissimilarities (e.g. ICD-11's descriptions of the "essential features" of mood episodes are not presented as equivalents of strict diagnostic criteria and symptom counts or duration cut-offs are generally absent).

### The effects of low-intensity narrow-band blue-light treatment compared to bright white-light treatment in seasonal affective disorder [^111nv4fa]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Ever since a new photoreceptor was discovered with a highest sensitivity to 470–490 nm blue light, it has been speculated that blue light has some advantages in the treatment of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) over more traditional treatments. In this study we compared the effects of exposure to narrow-band blue light (BLUE) to those of broad-wavelength white light (BLT) in the treatment of SAD.

Methods

In a 15-day design, 45 patients suffering from SAD completed 30-min sessions of light treatment on 5 consecutive days. 21 subjects received white-light treatment (BLT, broad-wavelength without UV, 10 000 lx, irradiance 31.7 W/m²), 24 subjects received narrow-band blue light (BLUE, 100 lx, irradiance 1.0 W/m²). All participants completed weekly questionnaires concerning mood and energy levels, and were also assessed by means of the SIGH-SAD, which is the primary outcome measure.

Results

On day 15, SIGH-SAD ratings were significantly lower than on day 1 (BLT 73.2%, effect size 3.37; BLUE 67%, effect size 2.63), which outcomes were not statistically significant different between both conditions.

Limitations

Small sample size.

Conclusions

Light treatment is an effective treatment for SAD. The use of narrow-band blue light is equally effective as a treatment using bright white-light.

### Depression and anxiety disorders [^113ds9Ku]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Depressive and anxiety disorders are common problems facing obstetrician-gynecologists. Although psychiatric disorders are equally common in men and women, women are at least twice as likely to present with depressive disorders and most anxiety disorders. The depressive disorders include major depression, dysthymia, seasonal affective disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The anxiety disorders are panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia), generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and PTSD. One must diagnose and manage depressive and anxiety disorders during pregnancy, the purpureum, and while breastfeeding. General treatment principles include assessing suicide risk, psychotherapy, pharmacologic treatment, and an appropriate medical work-up for depressive and anxiety disorders. The SSRIs are the first-line treatment for most depressive and anxiety disorders because of data supporting their efficacy, the minimal need for dosage titration, the overall favorable side-effect profile, and the length of available clinical experience. Newer antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, bupropion, nefazodone, and mirtazapine, are options for patients unresponsive to, or intolerant of, the SSRIs. Treatment considerations include acute, maintenance, and continuation therapy, dosage regimens, adverse effects, and drug interactions. Specific guidelines are available for referring patients to a mental health specialist.

### Dawn simulation vs. bright light in seasonal affective disorder: treatment effects and subjective preference [^1173Ceq9]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Studies comparing the efficacy of dawn simulation to conventional bright light for the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (in parallel groups) have yielded conflicting results. This crossover study investigated treatment outcomes and long-term treatment preference.

Methods

Forty winter depressives were treated for a week with bright light (4.300lx for 30–45min shortly after awakening) or dawn simulation (gradually increasing light during the last 30min of sleep achieving 100lx before alarm beep, with the dawn simulator placed closer to the open eyes for a further 15min: 250lx). The depression level was self-rated using SIGH-SAD-SR.

Results

Depression scores reduced similarly following bright light and dawn simulation: for 43.8% and 42.2% (medians), respectively; efficacy ratio was 23:17. The preference was also similar (21:19). Among those who preferred bright light, the most common reason was that they perceived the bright light to be more effective (19/21; it was more effective, p = 0.0096; this subgroup tended to have more severe depression) and ease of use (6/21). Among those who preferred the dawn simulator, the reasons were a more "natural" action (9/19), device compactness and/or time-saving (10/19) and in 4 cases where bright light caused eyestrain.

Limitations

Not overhead naturalistic light for dawn simulation, self-rating of depression.

Conclusions

Dawn simulation is similarly effective to bright light in the treatment of winter depression. Patients with more severe depression tended to report greater improvement with bright light; in such cases, this would outweigh the non-clinical advantages of dawn simulation.

### A pilot study of adherence with light treatment for seasonal affective disorder [^113bnovT]. Psychiatry Research (2007). Low credibility.

Non-adherence with antidepressant medication regimens is now recognised as a substantial problem when evaluating depression outcome. Given the behavioural demands of light treatment (LT), it might be expected that non-adherence would be even more pronounced in LT, a form of intervention for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). However, little research has focused upon the extent to which patients in light treatment protocols adhere to set regimens. Nineteen patients with SAD were allocated to either treatment with bright white light (intervention) or dim red light (control condition) in a four-week protocol. Light exposure was estimated automatically (without participants' knowledge) with elapsed time meters built into the light box. Daily diaries were also used to measure self-reported light box use. Participants were instructed to use the light box for 30 min each day during week 1, 45 during week 2 and one hour during weeks 3 and 4 (total duration of prescribed light exposure 1365 min). The results indicated that mean duration of light box operation for the entire sample was 59.3% of the prescribed 1365 min. Six of nineteen (31.6%) patients dropped out of treatment. Amongst those completing treatment, adherence to the prescribed duration of exposure averaged 83.3% (S.D. = 31.4). A trend was found for the intervention condition to generate a lower dropout rate, as well as a trend for the degree of adherence to be greater in the intervention condition. Importantly, there was no association between adherence as measured automatically and the higher rates of self-reported adherence as measured in diaries. In summary, the results of this pilot study suggest that adherence with light treatment is of a similar order of magnitude to antidepressant medication adherence. Patient self-report was found to be unrelated to objectively estimated duration of light box use, a finding with significant research and clinical implications. Future research studies should routinely measure and evaluate adherence with light therapy and evidence-based techniques for maximising treatment adherence should be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

### Modafinil treatment in patients with seasonal affective disorder / winter depression: an open-label pilot study [^112igeec]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hypersomnia is a cardinal symptom of seasonal affective disorder/winter depression. This open-label pilot study assessed modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, as treatment for seasonal affective disorder/winter depression.

Methods

Total daily modafinil dose was 100 mg (all patients week 1), and 100 mg or 200 mg split dose (weeks 2–8). Efficacy assessments (weeks 1, 2, 5, and 8) included the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorder Version (SIGH-SAD), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).

Results

Thirteen patients (11 women; mean age, 41 years) were enrolled, 12 were evaluable for efficacy (100 mg dose, five patients; 200 mg dose, seven patients), and nine completed treatment. Modafinil significantly improved winter depression as shown by reductions from baseline in mean SIGH-SAD at week 1 (P < 0.01) through week 8 (P < 0.001 weeks 2–8) and MADRS total scores from week 2 through week 8 (P < 0.01 for all). At week 8, mean SIGH-SAD total score was 17.1 (versus 37.2 at baseline, P < 0.001), and mean MADRS total score was 13.3 (versus 26.9 at baseline, P < 0.01). Modafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition at all time points (P < 0.001). The response rate was 67% on the SIGH-SAD (29 item), HAM-D (21 item), and MADRS, and 100% on eight atypical SIGH-SAD items. Modafinil significantly reduced fatigue (FSS) and improved wakefulness (ESS) from weeks 2 through 8 (P < 0.01). Modafinil was well tolerated.

Limitations

This was an open-label, single site study.

Conclusions

Modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment in patients with seasonal affective disorder/winter depression.

Reported effects include that "Other commonly described side effects include eyestrain, nausea, and agitation, albeit with predominant spontaneous remission", that "light therapy can induce migraines in approximately one-third of those susceptible", and that patients with eye disease or using photosensitizing drugs "should only use light therapy with periodic ophthalmological and/or dermatological monitoring of the underlying condition". It is also reported that among seasonal affective disorder patients with preexisting conditions, one study "reported no changes in extensive ophthalmologic examinations… over up to 6 years of daily use in the fall and winter months".

### Manipulating the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms to improve clinical management of major depression [^115tJ6oB]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Melatonin-based therapies

While melatonin has not traditionally been considered to be a viable antidepressant alone, the registration of agomelatine in the European Union and internationally (but not in the United States) as a treatment for major depression has again raised questions as to whether melatonin itself has significant antidepressant properties. What is more likely is that there are specific subgroups of those with major depressive disorders (and most obviously those with depression with chronic insomnia, circadian dysfunction, seasonal features or bipolar depression) who are likely to derive antidepressant benefits from melatonin, agomelatine or other melatonin-based analogues. Although agomelatine has been evaluated for short and longer-term efficacy by the European Medicines Agency, it has not been presented to the FDA for registration in the United States. Further, there has been considerable academic debate as to the relative efficacy of agomelatine compared with placebo or other available antidepressant agents. Importantly, the differential effects of agomelatine as compared with SSRIs on sleep architecture has only recently been subject to investigation, with an initial study favoring the short-term benefits of agomelatine on key sleep parameters. There is an ongoing need for further comparative studies. A very recent report suggests that another melatonin analogue, ramelteon, when taken adjunctively with other therapies may have benefits in preventing relapse into depression in patients with bipolar disorder.

### Is dawn simulation effective in ameliorating the difficulty awakening in seasonal affective disorder associated with hypersomnia? [^114mjeBa]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with winter depression, (seasonal affective disorder, SAD) frequently complain of difficulty awakening in the morning. Dawn simulation has been found effective in treating SAD, but its effect on difficulty awakening has not been assessed.

Methods

Fifty medication-free patients with SAD associated with hypersomnia were randomized to receive either 1 week of dawn simulation (250 lux) or a dim (0.2–2 lux) placebo signal. The patients assessed their level of drowsiness upon awakening during the baseline week and during the treatment week using the Stanford sleepiness scale (SSS). A psychiatrist rated difficulty awakening after the baseline week and after the treatment week.

Results

Dawn simulation lowered both the difficulty awakening score (P < 0.05) and the SSS score (P < 0.05) compared to the placebo dawn signal.

Limitations

Replication is necessary. No biological markers of circadian phase were measured.

Conclusions

Compared to a placebo condition, dawn simulation appears effective in decreasing both prospectively assessed morning drowsiness and retrospectively assessed difficulty awakening. The symptom of difficulty awakening is consistent with the phase delay hypothesis of SAD. Assessment of difficulty awakening could prove useful in the evaluation of SAD.

Box 2 Light interventions to promote wellbeing and health

Given its important role in circadian entrainment and health-related outcomes, light has long been used for therapeutic and well-being purposes. One established area in which light exposure is manipulated is (bright) light therapy (BLT). Historically, BLT has been used for the treatment of seasonal affective disorders (SAD) and its subclinical counterpart (sSAD), depression, bipolar disorder, sleep and circadian-related disorders as well as jet lag prevention or reduction. Light interventions could theoretically address or manipulate all different parameters of light exposure (timing, duration, temporal pattern, intensity, and spectrum) separately or in combination. Most common manipulations include (blue) light blocking in the evening to avoid melatonin suppression, and/or increasing light exposure either in the morning (i.e. the individual circadian phase-advancing window) to advance internal time or at times when alertness and vigilance should be promoted (e.g. during shift work) –. Some studies/interventions also combine these methods or include other interventions, such as melatonin supplementation, curtailing sleep, cognitive-behaviour therapy, or manipulating the light environment (dawn-simulating alarms –, use of curtains or blinds). Existing interventions in the circadian field seem to mainly focus on (some of) these four dimensions, without taking the individual light history or spectral diet into account. Recommendations such as those developed Brown et al.also do not include information on achieving light exposure intervention goals in practice, omitting behaviour as a key ingredient for healthy light exposure.

### Electric lighting, adolescent sleep and circadian outcomes, and recommendations for improving light health [^111nvAuH]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Electric Lighting Interventions and Corrective Agents

Modern light therapy (LT) originated in the 1980s to combat depressed mood in seasonal affective disorder and has been applied to an array of sleep and psychiatric disorders. LT traditionally involved remaining seated for 30 min to 1 h in front of a "light box" emitting white light of 2,500 to 10,000 lux. LT is typically administered just after waking to advance circadian phase, and just before bedtime to delay circadian phase. Morning LT is typically administered daily until reaching the desired sleep-wake schedule. As weekday morning use may conflict with school schedules, an alternative is weekend-only LT to counteract circadian delays. While one hour of LT at natural weekend risetime was not effective in mitigating the typical circadian phase delay, weekend LT administered 1 h after the weekend midpoint of sleep advanced adolescents' circadian phase, with a greater effect still with 2.5 h of light. These findings underscore the importance of administering LT within the optimal time window per the phase response curve.

Short-wavelength light exposure is associated with increased melatonin suppression relative to long-wavelength light exposure in adolescents and adults, and increased morning cortisol relative to dim light. Short-wavelength LT is increasingly being utilized. The "light box" itself may also pose treatment barriers as the need to sit in front of the device for long durations may decrease adherence. One alternative is wearable glasses-like or visor-like devices, which provide light therapy while the user remains mobile to engage in other activities. Three weeks of morning wearable, white LT resulted in improvements in sleep onset, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness in adolescents with DSWPD relative to orange-light placebo, and sleep outcomes align with those of the light box. Wearable, short-wavelength LT has been shown to effectively phase advance the melatonin circadian rhythm in young adults, and has been investigated in adolescents, whose findings are later detailed.

### Brain monoamine oxidase A in seasonal affective disorder and treatment with bright light therapy [^112xjw65]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is characterized by decreased mood and drive in the fall and winter months, followed by spontaneous remission in spring and summer. Two to three percent of the population suffers from clinically manifest SAD. Bright light therapy (BLT) is well accepted as the gold standard treatment of this disorder.

The central contribution of serotonergic changes to depressive pathophysiology, irrespective of seasonality, has been thoroughly demonstrated. Along this line, increased cerebral monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) levels are considered a central finding in non-seasonal major depressive disorder (MDD). MAO-A is a mitochondrial enzyme that is primarily responsible for degradation of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain and is of utmost importance for homeostasis of cerebral 5-HT levels. Increased MAO-A in MDD is therefore in accordance with the monoamine theory of depressive pathophysiology.

As is the case in MDD, serotonergic changes are also thought to underlie development of SAD. Numerous molecular components of the serotonergic system are influenced by season and light, including the 5-HT 1A -receptorand the serotonin transporter (SERT) –. Furthermore, seasonal regulation of SERT expression was shown to be altered in SAD. In addition, the efficacy of MAO-A inhibitors in SADemphasizes that changes to MAO-A may play a role in the disorder's pathophysiology. However, changes to cerebral MAO-A distribution have yet to be investigated in patients with SAD.

This study thus investigates whether brain MAO-A distribution (1) differs between patients with SAD and healthy controls (HC), (2) is sensitive to BLT and (3) changes between fall/winter and spring/summer. In addition, the association between SAD symptom severity and MAO-A was investigated. For this purpose [11 C]harmine (7-[11 C]methoxy-1-methyl-9 H -[3,4- b]indole) positron emission tomography (PET), was used and MAO-A distribution volume (V T), an index auf MAO-A density, was calculated. [11 C]harmine is a reversible MAO-A inhibitor, is selective for the MAO-A isoenzymeand its metabolites do not pass the blood–brain barrier. It can therefore be considered the gold standard of currently available MAO-A radioligands for cerebral PET imaging.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Xl) [^11743pc9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

To enter the trials, patients must have had a low level of depressive symptoms, as demonstrated by a score of < 7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD17) and a HAMD24 score of < 14. The primary efficacy measure was the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Seasonal Affective Disorders (SIGH-SAD), which is identical to the HAMD24. The SIGH-SAD consists of the HAMD17 plus 7 items specifically assessing core symptoms of seasonal affective disorder: social withdrawal, weight gain, increased appetite, increased eating, carbohydrate craving, hypersomnia, and fatigability. The primary efficacy endpoint was the onset of a seasonal major depressive episode. The criteria for defining an episode included: 1) the investigator's judgment that a major depressive episode had occurred or that the patient required intervention for depressive symptoms, or 2) a SIGH-SAD score of > 20 on 2 consecutive weeks. The primary analysis was a comparison of depression-free rates between the bupropion and placebo groups.

In these 3 trials, the percentage of patients who were depression-free (did not have an episode of MDD) at the end of treatment was significantly higher in the bupropion group than in the placebo group: 81.4% vs. 69.7%, 87.2% vs. 78.7%, and 84.0% vs. 69.0% for Trials 1, 2 and 3, respectively. For the 3 trials combined, the depression-free rate was 84.3% versus 72.0% in the bupropion and placebo group, respectively.

1.3. Bright Light (BL) Therapy

A nonpharmacological treatment option for depression symptoms is morning BL exposure, with intensities up to 10,000 lx. BL therapy can also be included as adjunctive treatment into an existing treatment plan. The beneficial effects of BL therapy are well documented, particularly for treating seasonal affective disorder. Additionally, there is growing evidence supporting its effectiveness for nonseasonal depression, as highlighted in recent reviews and meta-analyses. Beyond affective disorders, BL therapy has shown benefits in conditions such as perinatal depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, dementia, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, combat-related PTSD, ADHD, cancer-related fatigue, poststroke insomnia, and burnout symptoms. However, research specifically examining the effects of BL on anxiety disorders remains limited and inconsistent. One study found a small effect in individuals with low anxiety levels, while another found no effect in those with high anxiety levels. Nonetheless, BL therapy has been shown to reduce anxiety symptoms in patients with nonpsychiatric disorders such as focal epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.

### Light therapy for non-seasonal depression [^114wFWku]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Efficacy of light therapy for non-seasonal depression has been studied without any consensus on its efficacy.

Objectives

To evaluate clinical effects of bright light therapy in comparison to the inactive placebo treatment for non-seasonal depression.

Search Strategy

We searched the Depression Anxiety & Neurosis Controlled Trials register (CCDANCTR January 2003), comprising the results of searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1966 -), EMBASE (1980 -), CINAHL (1982 -), LILACS (1982 -), National Research Register, PsycINFO/PsycLIT (1974 -), PSYNDEX (1977 -), and SIGLE (1982 -) using the group search strategy and the following terms: #30 = phototherapy or ("light therapy" or light-therapy). We also sought trials from conference proceedings and references of included papers, and contacted the first author of each study as well as leading researchers in the field.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing bright light with inactive placebo treatments for non-seasonal depression.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and quality assessment was made independently by two reviewers. The authors were contacted to obtain additional information.

Main Results

Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. In general, the quality of reporting was poor, and many reviews did not report adverse effects systematically. The treatment response in the bright light group was better than in the control treatment group, but did not reach statistical significance. The result was mainly based on studies of less than 8 days of treatment. The response to bright light was significantly better than to control treatment in high-quality studies (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.50 to -0.31), in studies applying morning light treatment (SMD -0.38, CI -0.62 to -0.14), and in sleep deprivation responders (SMD -1.02, CI -1.60 to -0.45). Hypomania was more common in the bright light group compared to the control treatment group (risk ratio 4.91, CI 1.66 to 14.46, number needed to harm 8, CI 5 to 20). Twenty studies (49 reports) were included in the review. Most of the studies applied bright light as adjunctive treatment to drug therapy, sleep deprivation, or both. Treatment

Reviewers' Conclusions

For patients suffering from non-seasonal depression, bright light therapy offers modest though promising antidepressive efficacy, especially when administered during the first week of treatment, in the morning, and as an adjunctive treatment to sleep deprivation responders. Hypomania as a potential adverse effect needs to be considered. Due to limited data and heterogeneity of studies these results need to be interpreted with caution.

### Chronobiological therapy for mood disorders [^111pP9Ko]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Chronobiological therapies for mood disorders include manipulations of the sleep-wake cycle such as sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance and the controlled exposure to light and darkness. Their antidepressant efficacy can overcome drug resistance and targets the core depressive symptoms including suicide, thus making them treatment options to be tried either alone or as adjunctive treatments combined with common psychopharmacological interventions. The specific pattern of mood change observed with chronobiological therapies is characterized by rapid and sustained effects, when used among themselves or combined with drugs. Effects sizes are the same reported for the most effective psychiatric treatments, but side effects are usually marginal or absent. New treatment protocols are developed to adapt them in different clinical settings. This review deals with the general principles of clinical chronobiology and the latest findings in this rapidly developing field.

### Efficacy of bright light therapy in bipolar depression [^111YdBDy]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

For 30 years, bright light therapy (BLT) has been considered as an effective, well-tolerated treatment for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Because of low response rates, new treatment strategies are needed for bipolar depression (BD), which resembles SAD in certain respects. Few placebo-controlled studies of BLT efficacy have been carried out for BD. Accordingly, this study evaluates the efficacy and safety of BLT as an add-on treatment for BD. Thirty-two BD outpatients were randomly assigned to BLT (10000lx) or dim light (DL, < 500lx). During a two-week period, light was administered each morning for 30min. The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Montgomery-Ǻsberg Depression Rating Scale assessed clinical outcome, and the UKU Side Effects Rating Scale evaluated side effects. No significant difference was observed in baseline depression scores in the two groups. Response rates for BLT and DL were 81% and 19%, and remission rates were 44% and 12.5%, respectively. Analyses showed statistically significant reductions in depression scores for the BLT group compared with the DL group on all scales. Side effects were similar in both groups, with headache as the most common side effect. The results suggest that BLT is an effective and safe add-on treatment for BD.

### Seasonality of antidepressant prescriptions and sick leaves [^115AuzFn]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present study was to estimate the number of patients with a seasonal prescription pattern of antidepressants, which might be taken as a surrogate marker for medicated patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Furthermore, we examined the time course of sick leaves for patients with seasonal and non-seasonal prescriptions of antidepressants. A retrospective analysis of prescription data of all patients insured by the Sickness Fund Burgenland (BGKK) between 2005 and 2016 was performed. Patients with treatment initiation of an antidepressant in the last and first quarter of the year for at least two consecutive years were selected (SAD-med). Patients with continuation treatment in the third quarter and patients with initiation of antidepressant medication in the second and third quarter of the year were excluded. The mean yearly prescription rate for antidepressants was 9.6% in the insured population. 3.0% of patients treated with antidepressants and 0.9% of insured cases satisfied the definition of SAD-med. The mean number of yearly sick leave days was similar for SAD-med patients and those with non-seasonal prescriptions. Time series analysis showed that sick leaves in SAD-med were influenced by seasonal fluctuations for several years after the first antidepressant prescription. Our study sheds light on antidepressant prescription and sick leave patterns in the general population. Compared to the prevalence of SAD, the estimated rate of SAD-med is substantial. Sick leaves appear to be closely linked to antidepressant prescriptions, and show a characteristic time course before and after the initial prescription.

### A sham-controlled randomized trial of adjunctive light therapy for non-seasonal depression [^111hXaM4]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy and safety of morning bright light therapy (BLT) in the treatment of patients with a current major depressive episode (MDE) in bipolar and unipolar disorder without a seasonal pattern. It was a randomized, sham-controlled trial.

Methods

Adults, ages 18–70 years were randomized to treatment either with BLT or a sham negative ion generator (as a placebo control). The subjects were required to be on a stable and therapeutic dose of psychotropic medication for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment and their treatment had to be insufficiently effective. Their clinical state was monitored at the baseline and at the end of treatment. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-21 items (HDRS-21), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression (PGI) were used. The results were analyzed with an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.

Results

Ninety-five patients were enrolled (50 diagnosed with bipolar disorder and 45 with unipolar depression). Fifty-two patients were randomized to treatment with BLT and forty-three were in the placebo group (ITT population). Eighty-three subjects completed the study. There were 12 dropouts (5 in the light group and 7 in the placebo group). After 14 days of treatment, a significant improvement was found in all groups (p < 0.001). The subjects treated with BLT did not significantly differ in terms of improvement in HDRS-21 scores at the endpoint when compared to patients treated with placebo (p = 0.2). However, further analysis demonstrated significantly higher response (50% v. 27.9%, p = 0.02) and remission rates (28.8% v. 11.6%, p = 0.04) among patients treated with morning BLT when compared to placebo group. It should be noted that in the population of drug-resistant patients, BLT was more efficacious than placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between unipolar and bipolar disorders (p = 0.4).

Conclusion

Although overall improvement in HDRS-21 scores were not superior in the BLT group, both response and remission rates were significantly higher among patients treated with BLT relative to those receiving the sham intervention. BLT was also more efficacious than placebo in the population of patients with drug-resistant depression. Further studies to define the subpopulation of patients with non-seasonal depression who may benefit the most from BLT are needed.

### Role of biological rhythm dysfunction in the development and management of bipolar disorders: a review [^113uSnba]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

According to the phase advance hypothesis of depression, a state of earlier and more synchronised rhythmic variables disturbs the usual circadian rhythm, which subsequently may be unable to entrain to the 24 hours' external day–night cycle. During an episode of affective disorder, there is an asynchrony of the remaining sleep–wake cycle in a normal or phase-delayed position, which tends to advance to the sleep phase.

Clinical observations and research suggested that daily doses of light exposure could rapidly and profoundly alleviate mood disorders and sleep irregularities. Clinicians recommended initiating treatment with 15 min of midday light to attenuate the severity of BD. Contraindications for light therapy were rare, and its compatibility with medication and other psychiatric treatments suggested that it could be integrated into standard practice. One study has attested the curative effect of bright light therapy (BLT) and dim light therapy. According to the criteria for remission and a decrease in the scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, response rates were 81% and 19% while remission rates were 44% and 12.5%, respectively. The results indicated that BLT was a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for BD with a seasonal pattern. Another study found that adolescents with BD with breakthrough depressive symptoms might benefit from light therapy when administered in conjunction with continued antidepressant treatment. However, one study provided robust evidence that confirmed the efficacy of midday BLT in treating BD but demonstrated that women with BD were highly sensitive to morning BLT.

### Seasonal affective disorder… [^116UQPfD]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment Studies have shown that light therapy, pharmacotherapy, and cognitive behavior therapy are appropriate options for treating SAD, but no treatment, or combination of treatments, has been found to be superior. For this reason, treatment choice should be guided by patient preference. LIGHT THERAPY Many published studies on the effects of light therapy in persons with SAD do not meet recognized standards for rigorous clinical trial design because of inherent difficulties in creating an acceptable placebo. However, multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the available data support the use of light therapy as an effective treatment for SAD. PHARMACOTHERAPY Results from most randomized controlled trials indicate that second-generation antidepressants are superior to placebo in reducing depression scores and remission rates.

LIGHT THERAPY VERSUS PHARMACOTHERAPY Few trials have compared the effectiveness of light therapy versus pharmacotherapy. One double-blind randomized controlled trial assigned 96 patients to one of two regimens: eight weeks of 10, 000 lux light therapy for 30 minutes daily as soon as possible after waking plus a placebo capsule, or eight weeks of 20-mg fluoxetine per day plus 100 lux light therapy for 30 minutes daily. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY CBT is an empirically validated treatment for nonseasonal depression. One group of researchers developed and pilot tested a version of CBT tailored for patients with SAD that involved 90-minute sessions twice per week over a period of six weeks.

24 The small uncontrolled feasibility study found that standard light therapy, SAD-tailored CBT, and a combination of light therapy and CBT all led to comparable reductions in depressive symptoms and good remission rates, both of which were statistically significant for all three groups. Combined treatment had the highest remission rate but was not statistically superior to the other treatments alone. The authors subsequently published a larger randomized controlled trial that also demonstrated statistically significant and similar improvements in depression severity in all three treatment groups, compared with the control group. 25 Treatment with CBT, with or without adjunct light therapy, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in recurrences of depression during the following winter compared with light therapy alone.

7 In addition, symptoms of SADs overlap with other, more established subtypes of depression — summer depressions with typical depressive episodes and winter depression with atypical depression. 8, 9 Winter depression responds to treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, 10 as does atypical depression. Although summer depression has been studied less extensively than winter depression, it appears to respond to the same antidepressant pharmacotherapy that is used effectively to treat nonseasonal depression. 4 but it remains unestablished whether phototherapy achieves its well-documented effects through any of these or other mechanisms. Until further research clarifies these issues, phototherapy offers physicians an additional effective treatment option for clearly established cases of winter depression 14 and justifies efforts made to identify this seasonal pattern in patients with depressive episodes.

Treatment Options and Guidelines Although light therapy is uniquely effective for winter depressive episodes, treatment planning for patients with SAD should include consideration of all treatment options available, including somatic and psychosocial treatments. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. 14 has recently recommended practice guidelines for depression in primary care, including treatment of seasonal depression. According to these guidelines, the use of light therapy should be considered only in patients with well-documented seasonal, non-psychotic, winter depressive episodes occurring within recurrent major depressive disorder, bipolar II disorder or milder seasonal depressive episodes. It is also advised that physicians unfamiliar with light therapy consult a professional who is experienced and trained in its use. Light therapy is a first-line treatment consideration under the circumstances listed in Table 3.

It is also a second-line option in patients who fail to respond to an adequate trial of medication. Other Treatments To our knowledge, no controlled studies have investigated the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy or psychotherapy for SAD specifically. However, very strong evidence supports the efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy, 30 two forms of psychotherapy, and combined psychotherapy and somatic therapy 33 in the treatment of depression. At this time, interpersonal therapy and cognitive therapy are not contraindicated in patients with SAD. These types of psychotherapy should be considered in patients whose depressive episodes are unipolar, non-psychotic, nonsevere and not chronic, and in those who do not respond to, who refuse or who cannot participate in phototherapy or pharmacotherapy.

Patients with SAD may have personal and interpersonal issues like those occurring in patients with nonseasonal depression and may benefit from the adjunctive use of psychotherapy.
