## Question

A 62-year-old woman is referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy due to iron deficiency anemia and a recent finding of low serum vitamin B12. Her laboratory results show positive gastric parietal cell antibodies. She has no significant gastrointestinal symptoms. During endoscopy, the gastric mucosa appears pale and thin, especially along the greater and lesser curves of the corpus. The endoscopist is considering how to proceed with biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and assess for precancerous changes.

According to current BSG guidelines, what is the recommended approach to gastric biopsies in this patient, and from which specific sites should biopsies be taken?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to gastric biopsies in a 62-year-old woman with iron deficiency anemia, low vitamin B12, positive gastric parietal cell antibodies, and endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, including which specific biopsy sites to choose and how to handle the specimens. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical diagnosis and whether this fits autoimmune gastritis/pernicious anemia. Then, I should verify what BSG 2019 specifically recommends for biopsy strategy in this exact scenario. Next, I will consider the updated Sydney protocol and how many biopsies to obtain. After that, I need to check specimen handling and labeling. Finally, I will integrate surveillance implications and reconcile any conflicting guidance from other societies so the plan is practical and evidence-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. Iron deficiency anemia plus vitamin B12 deficiency with positive parietal cell antibodies is classic for autoimmune gastritis with pernicious anemia, and the endoscopic description of pale, thin corpus mucosa with prominent vessels is consistent with corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis, which is the expected pattern in autoimmune gastritis rather than H. pylori–related atrophy that typically starts in the antrum [^5122a234] [^d3dd1022].

> Wait, let me verify the BSG 2019 position on when to biopsy in this exact scenario. BSG explicitly recommends considering a baseline endoscopy with biopsies in patients aged 50 years or older with laboratory evidence of pernicious anemia, defined by vitamin B12 deficiency plus positive parietal cell or intrinsic factor antibodies, and it advises taking biopsies from the greater and lesser curves because atrophic gastritis in pernicious anemia affects the corpus. This matches our patient perfectly, so biopsy is indicated here [^63157e13] [^f004832a] [^328b9da5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the number and distribution of biopsies. I initially thought to follow a minimal two-site approach, but I should double-check the updated Sydney protocol and contemporary guidance. The updated Sydney system calls for sampling five sites: greater and lesser curvature of the antrum, greater and lesser curvature of the corpus, and the incisura, typically with 1–2 biopsies per site and placed in two jars (antrum/incisura and corpus) to enable histologic staging and risk stratification. This is supported by BSG and ESGE/MAPS II, and aligns with AGA guidance to obtain at least five biopsies with antrum/incisura and corpus in separate jars, with additional targeted biopsies of abnormalities [^a4f61a32] [^6d375bff] [^0ab7c0b2] [^4155a765].

> I need to ensure specimen handling is correct. BSG advises collecting biopsy samples in separate containers and labeling them as either directed or random to corroborate endoscopic staging, and AGA similarly recommends separate jars for antrum/incisura versus corpus, with additional jars for targeted lesions. This facilitates accurate OLGA/OLGIM staging and correlation with endoscopic extent, which is crucial for risk stratification and surveillance planning [^d07e7dd6] [^0ab7c0b2] [^4155a765].

> Next, I should review surveillance implications so I can counsel the patient. BSG supports offering surveillance every 3 years for patients with extensive atrophic gastritis or gastric intestinal metaplasia, and ESGE/MAPS II suggests 3–5 year intervals for autoimmune gastritis, while AGA emphasizes individualized surveillance based on extent and severity with shared decision-making. Given corpus-predominant atrophy in autoimmune gastritis, surveillance is reasonable, though intervals should be tailored to histologic stage and patient preferences [^3c2c939e] [^933e2789] [^5b776266].

> But wait, what if I am over-calling biopsies in iron deficiency anemia without red flags? The AGA IDA guideline suggests against routine gastric biopsies solely for atrophic gastritis in IDA, yet that recommendation does not directly apply here because this patient also has vitamin B12 deficiency and positive parietal cell antibodies, which shifts the pretest probability toward autoimmune gastritis and aligns with BSG's specific recommendation to biopsy in pernicious anemia. So, in this combined phenotype, BSG's targeted approach remains appropriate despite the AGA IDA caveat [^9277b08c] [^b82271c8] [^63157e13].

> Let me reconsider the practical biopsy plan to ensure nothing is missed. I will obtain at least five biopsies: two from the corpus along the greater curvature, two from the corpus along the lesser curvature, and one from the incisura, placing antrum/incisura and corpus samples in separate jars. If I see any polyps, nodules, or other mucosal abnormalities, I will take additional targeted biopsies in separate containers. I should also test for H. pylori on these biopsies even though autoimmune gastrophy is suspected, because H. pylori can coexist and alter risk, and I will request histologic staging with attention to extent of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia to inform surveillance [^a4f61a32] [^6d375bff] [^5b776266].

> In summary, I should confirm autoimmune gastritis histologically with a standardized approach: perform high-quality endoscopy with image enhancement when available, obtain at least five biopsies per the updated Sydney protocol with antrum/incisura and corpus in separate jars, add targeted biopsies of any abnormalities, and request histologic staging. This strategy is directly supported by BSG 2019 for pernicious anemia and is consistent with ESGE/MAPS II and AGA guidance for atrophic gastritis risk stratification and surveillance planning [^63157e13] [^6d375bff] [^0ab7c0b2].

---

Per BSG guidance, in a 62-year-old woman with iron deficiency anemia, low B12, and positive parietal cell antibodies, **obtain biopsies from the greater and lesser curvatures of the corpus** to confirm autoimmune atrophic gastritis and stage disease [^63157e13] [^d07e7dd6]. Use **separate jars for antrum/incisura and corpus** to enable histologic staging (OLGA/OLGIM) and risk stratification [^a4f61a32] [^492351aa]. If image-enhanced endoscopy shows intestinal metaplasia, take directed biopsies from those sites; otherwise, obtain at least five biopsies per the updated Sydney protocol [^d07e7dd6] [^0ab7c0b2]. This approach confirms AIG, excludes H. pylori, and guides surveillance for neoplasia [^5b776266] [^3c2c939e].

---

## Indications for biopsy in autoimmune gastritis

Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by **corpus-predominant atrophy** with antral sparing, leading to intrinsic factor deficiency and vitamin B12 malabsorption. Biopsy confirmation is essential for:

- **Histologic confirmation**: Confirming the diagnosis of AIG and excluding other causes of atrophic gastritis, such as Helicobacter pylori infection [^d3dd1022] [^5b776266].
- **Risk stratification**: Assessing the extent of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, which are critical for determining cancer risk and surveillance intervals [^492351aa] [^f6e5dd2d].
- **Detection of neoplasia**: Identifying synchronous dysplasia, neuroendocrine tumors, or early gastric cancer, which are more prevalent in patients with AIG [^5b776266] [^372f54f5].

---

## Recommended biopsy protocol according to BSG guidelines

The BSG provides specific recommendations for **biopsy sampling in patients with suspected AIG**:

- **Corpus biopsies**: Obtain biopsies from the greater and lesser curvatures of the gastric corpus, as atrophic gastritis in pernicious anemia predominantly affects the corpus [^63157e13] [^d07e7dd6].
- **Separate containers**: Place biopsies from the antrum/incisura and corpus in separate, clearly labeled containers to facilitate histopathological staging using the OLGA/OLGIM systems [^a4f61a32] [^492351aa].
- **Directed biopsies**: If image-enhanced endoscopy reveals areas of intestinal metaplasia or other abnormalities, obtain targeted biopsies from these sites [^d07e7dd6] [^e019fa03].

---

## Updated Sydney protocol

The updated Sydney protocol is widely accepted for **systematic gastric biopsies** and includes:

| **Biopsy site** | **Location** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| Antrum | Greater and lesser curvatures, approximately 3 cm from the pylorus | Assess for H. pylori, atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia |
| Incisura | Angularis | Increase diagnostic yield for advanced atrophy and intestinal metaplasia |
| Corpus | Greater and lesser curvatures, approximately 4 cm proximal to the incisura | Assess for corpus-predominant atrophy and intestinal metaplasia |

---

This protocol ensures **comprehensive sampling** of the gastric mucosa, enabling accurate histopathological staging and risk stratification [^623d0bff] [^a4f61a32].

---

## Role of image-enhanced endoscopy

Image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) techniques, such as narrow-band imaging (NBI) or blue light imaging, significantly improve the detection of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. The BSG recommends using IEE to **identify suspicious areas** for targeted biopsies, thereby increasing diagnostic yield and accuracy [^a136b843] [^d1087bef].

---

## Histopathological evaluation and staging

Histopathological evaluation should include assessment of the **extent and severity of atrophy and intestinal metaplasia**, as well as exclusion of H. pylori infection. The OLGA and OLGIM staging systems are recommended for risk stratification and to guide surveillance intervals [^492351aa] [^a845fa99].

---

## Clinical implications and surveillance

Confirming AIG through biopsy has important clinical implications:

- **Surveillance**: Patients with extensive atrophy or intestinal metaplasia are at increased risk of gastric cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. Surveillance endoscopy every 3 years is recommended for patients with advanced atrophic gastritis or extensive intestinal metaplasia [^3c2c939e] [^933e2789].
- **Individualized approach**: Surveillance intervals should be individualized based on patient risk factors, including family history, extent of atrophy, and presence of dysplasia [^f6e5dd2d] [^49afe070].
- **H. pylori assessment**: All patients with atrophic gastritis should be tested for H. pylori infection, and if positive, eradication therapy should be administered and confirmed [^5b776266] [^1b043eeb].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Corpus biopsies**: Obtain biopsies from the greater and lesser curvatures of the corpus to confirm AIG [^63157e13] [^d07e7dd6].
- **Separate containers**: Use separate containers for antrum/incisura and corpus biopsies for accurate staging [^a4f61a32] [^492351aa].
- **Directed biopsies**: Perform targeted biopsies of suspicious areas identified on image-enhanced endoscopy [^d07e7dd6] [^e019fa03].
- **Histopathological staging**: Utilize OLGA/OLGIM systems for risk stratification and surveillance planning [^492351aa] [^a845fa99].

---

The BSG recommends obtaining biopsies from the **greater and lesser curvatures of the corpus** in patients with suspected autoimmune gastritis, using separate containers for antrum/incisura and corpus samples. This approach ensures accurate diagnosis, staging, and risk stratification, guiding appropriate surveillance and management strategies [^63157e13] [^d07e7dd6].

Clinical management

There are no randomized controlled studies evaluating the benefit of endoscopic surveillance, nor of ideal surveillance intervals/methods in AIG for the purpose of earlier detection of neoplasia (dysplasia, cancer). Instead, observational data demonstrating a significantly increased risk of gastric neoplasia associated with AIG and PA provide the clinical rationale for performing endoscopic surveillance. Several international societies provide clinical guidance on screening, diagnosis, and management of chronic atrophic gastritis, many times embedded within guidelines for other gastric (pre)neoplasia.

Endoscopy

Because of the malignancy risk, endoscopic surveillance should be considered or is recommended according to international society guidelines—namely, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG),the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA),the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE),the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE),a consensus statement by multiple Italian societies for gastroenterology, endoscopy and internal medicine,and Kyoto Consensus Report—but the optimal interval for surveillance is not established, with most generally recommending every 3–5 years and potentially shorter intervals depending on additional risk factors for gastric cancer, including family history. Guidance varies with respect to surveillance in patients with AG/GIM due to AIG specifically, with some suggesting surveillance every 3–5 years,, and others, namely US societies, advocating determination of intervals according to individualized assessment and shared decision-making. The clinical or cost-effectiveness of these practices has not been demonstrated, making it low-quality evidence. The ASGE, AGA, BSG, Italian Societies, and ESGE acknowledge that there is a significantly increased prevalence of gastric neoplasia at the time of diagnosis of PA and that the risk for neoplasia is highest within the first year of PA diagnosis. Accordingly, the ASGE recommends endoscopy within 6 months of PA diagnosis and the BSG recommends that baseline endoscopy with biopsies be considered in individuals >50 years old with PA. Once the diagnosis of AIG is made, all patients should be evaluated for concomitant PA. However, it is unclear if and at what interval these serologies should be repeated if they are negative initially. The recent AGA Clinical Practice Update advises screening for type-1 gastric NETs with upper endoscopy among patients with AIG, along with resection, with or without ongoing surveillance, depending on the size and burden of NETs.

### Noninvasive testing (...) [^b091a7ae]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice • In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL. • Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease. • Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. • Video capsule endoscopy is not recommended in asymptomatic adults with IDA. From the AFP Editors Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. It affects 3% of adults and is slightly more common in women younger than 50 years. The American Gastroenterological Association developed guidelines for the evaluation of IDA in adults. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia.

Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain. Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Noninvasive Testing Several common conditions associated with IDA can be diagnosed noninvasively, before or after endoscopy. Frequent blood donation, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption syndromes may be suggested by initial evaluation. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H.

pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive. Endoscopy Bidirectional endoscopy is the primary means of evaluation for IDA, although evidence of patient-oriented benefit is lacking.

In men and postmenopausal women with IDA, bidirectional endoscopy is recommended based on diagnosis of colonic malignancy in 9% and upper gastrointestinal malignancy in 2% of patients, more than 10 times the rate of colorectal cancer found in routine screening. The AGA also suggests endoscopy in premenopausal women with IDA because malignancy is diagnosed in 1% of this population. In younger patients who might have a plausible nonmalignant cause of anemia, iron replacement can be offered without further exploration. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, routine gastric biopsies are not recommended. Although autoimmune atrophic gastritis can be diagnosed by gastric biopsy, it has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes. H. pylori can also cause atrophic gastritis, but it can be diagnosed noninvasively. After normal bidirectional endoscopy, small bowel video capsule endoscopy is not recommended without symptoms because evidence of benefit is lacking.

Executive summary

Gastric adenocarcinoma continues to be a frequent cause of death in the world and is the 16th most common cancer in the UK. The most common stages in the progression to gastric adenocarcinoma are gastric atrophy (GA) and gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), which are collectively known as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). These conditions are principally caused by Helicobacter pylori infection and less commonly by autoimmune gastritis. The key to having a significant impact on the prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and its economic burden is to accurately identify individuals at greatest risk and intervene with recognised efficacious treatments, including endoscopic resection, before cancer is established. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) endoscopy committee agreed to create a guideline to provide statements and recommendations on the prevalence, risks, diagnosis, treatment, surveillance and screening of gastric premalignant and early gastric malignant lesions. The principal patient group are those found to have GA, GIM, gastric epithelial dysplasia or early gastric adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosal or superficial submucosal layers. The target users include gastroenterologists, GI surgeons, pathologists, endoscopists and general practitioners. We followed the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument, and the quality of the evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Surveillance

CAG and GIM

Recently updated European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE MAPS 2) guidelinesand new BSG guidelines on patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinomarecommend 3 yearly surveillance for patients with extensive CAG or GIM, that is, that affecting antrum and corpus (figure 4). Although the majority of GC is sporadic, 10% show familial aggregation. Those with a family history have an additionally increased cancer progression risk, an affected first-degree relative is associated with a relative risk of 1.8–3.5.Therefore, in cases with extensive CAG or GIM and a family history, these patients should be considered for more intensive surveillance every 1–2 years, while patients with a family history and CAG or GIM limited to one area of the stomach may be counselled for the benefits of surveillance every 3 years (table 1). Carcinoma in the gastric remnant of patients who have had previous surgery for benign disease (eg, peptic ulcer disease) is rare, there are currently no consensus guidelines for this patient group; however, patients are often recommended endoscopy at 15 years post-surgery, additionally if they are known to have mucosal abnormalities such as CAG or GIM they should also be considered for surveillance on an individual basis.

Summary of relevant updated guideline recommendations for diagnosis and surveillance of precancerous conditions of the stomach

Autoimmune gastritis

There is some evidence that patients with autoimmune gastritis have an increased risk of GC and may therefore benefit from endoscopic surveillance. At present, there is no clearly defined follow-up interval. Screening endoscopy at the time of diagnosis is important to secure the diagnosis but also for estimating risk as this may be the period of greatest excess cancer risk.The 2019 updated ESGE MAPS 2 guidelines recommend that patients may benefit from endoscopic follow-up every 3–5 years, however, this was a weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

Dysplasia

Patients with any evidence of dysplasia should be assessed at a specialist centre with expertise in enhanced imaging assessment. All visible dysplastic lesions should be resected where possible. If there is no endoscopically visible lesion, a repeat enhanced imaging endoscopy should be performed in 6 months for HGD and 6–12 months for LGD.Revision of pathology slides by a GI pathologist with special expertise should be considered, especially in the scenario where no lesion is visible after a high-quality endoscopy. Post endoscopic resection for neoplasia, patients should remain under yearly surveillance as long as this remains clinically appropriate.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9277b08c]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune atrophic gastritis in iron deficiency anemia—In patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA), the estimated pooled prevalence of this condition was 10.1% (95% CI, 7.6%–12.8%), available studies often did not differentiate atrophy due to H pylori infection from that due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis, and no evidence was found that earlier identification of autoimmune atrophic gastritis affects the clinical management of iron deficiency or long-term outcomes. Given the lack of well-accepted management implications after a diagnosis of atrophic gastritis and insufficient evidence to demonstrate that earlier diagnosis improves patient outcomes, the use of routine gastric biopsies for this diagnosis is not supported. The AGA suggests against the use of routine gastric biopsies to diagnose atrophic gastritis. Conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence. Some observational studies have suggested that the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and carcinoids may be elevated in this condition, and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends considering endoscopic surveillance every 3–5 years, but this recommendation is based on low-level evidence.

### Quality standards in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: a position statement of the British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and association of upper gastrointestinal surgeons of great britain and Ireland (AUGIS) [^92f99ad2]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

It should be noted that approximately 30–50% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis have adenomas in the stomach and up to 90% in the duodenum.Often these patients have a carpet of fundic gland polyps in the proximal stomach making it technically challenging to identify the adenomatous change.The diagnosis and surveillance of familial adenomatous polyposis in the UGI tract should follow in accordance with published guidelines.

Where coeliac disease is suspected, a minimum of four biopsies should be taken, including representative biopsies from the second part of the duodenum and at least one from the duodenal bulb.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: strong

Strength of recommendation: strong

Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition, characterised by gluten-induced small bowel villous atrophy. Classic endoscopic features of flattened mucosal appearance, nodularity, a reduction in duodenal folds and scalloping have been described. Coeliac disease may be present in the absence of endoscopic features and therefore biopsies to obtain a histological diagnosis where there is a suspicion of coeliac disease are recommended.Villous atrophy may occur in a patchy distribution and so in order to optimise diagnosis a minimum of four biopsies taken at different locations throughout the duodenum, including the bulb, are required.Where an OGD is being performed specifically to obtain histological confirmation of coeliac disease, patients should adhere to a gluten-rich diet to avoid a false-negative result, consuming gluten in more than one meal a day for at least 6 weeks.Once a diagnosis has been established, management should be in accordance with existing guidelines.

Biopsy strategy for diagnosis and risk stratification of the premalignant stomach

What biopsy strategy should be adopted for the sampling and reporting of the premalignant and early malignant stomach?

Should all those undergoing routine endoscopy be biopsied or are there groups to target?

We recommend that patients with image-enhanced features of CAG should undergo biopsies for confirmation of endoscopic diagnosis; biopsies are directed at mucosal sites within Sydney protocol areas where enhanced imaging discloses GIM. Biopsy samples should be collected in separate containers and labelled as either ‘directed’ or ‘random’ to corroborate endoscopic staging assessment (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: strong; level of agreement: 93%).

We suggest that a baseline endoscopy with biopsies should be considered in individuals aged ≥50 years, with laboratory evidence of pernicious anaemia, defined by vitamin B 12 deficiency and either positive gastric parietal cell or intrinsic factor antibodies. As GA affects the corpus in pernicious anaemia, biopsies should be taken from the greater and lesser curves (evidence level: low quality; grade of recommendation: weak; level of agreement: 93%).

Biopsies should be undertaken in patients with endoscopic suspicion of GA, GIM or early neoplasia.

Current surveillance protocols stipulate random biopsies in specified locations according to the updated Sydney protocol (Figure 5). However, random sampling does not reliably foster correlation of endoscopic and histopathological findings and carries a risk of sampling error. By contrast, ‘directed’ biopsies of mucosal foci suspicious for GIM in areas of the updated Sydney protocol will drive quality control and ultimately propel endoscopy-led staging and risk stratification. This targeted biopsy strategy links endoscopic GIM detection with the well-established OLGIM histopathological classification scheme. The aforementioned numerical endoscopic classification system for staging of GIM has been shown to correlate strongly with OLGIM and with the extent of GIM,further supporting this change in practice. The GDG did not agree on whether OLGA or OLGIM should be routinely used, principally because there is insufficient expertise or capacity for this to be routinely undertaken. Individual units, however, may choose to adopt this risk stratification system.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^9196d0e1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Gastric polyps and autoimmune gastritis—evaluation and malignancy risk considerations are as follows: Most gastric epithelial polyps arise with inflammatory conditions including Helicobacter pylori gastritis and autoimmune gastritis; fundic gland polyps are generally benign, whereas hyperplastic polyps and adenomas occur in H. pylori–driven gastric premalignant conditions and can transform malignantly. In suspected or confirmed hyperplastic polyps or adenomas, systematic gastric biopsies are indicated with assessment for H. pylori and for gastric premalignant conditions, and histology facilitates management including polypectomy and/or surveillance. Autoimmune gastritis is a premalignant condition associated with substantially higher risk of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumors and an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, although recent studies suggest no additional adenocarcinoma risk when autoimmune gastritis occurs without previous or current H. pylori infection.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—definitions, recognition, and biopsy approach in atrophic gastritis: Atrophic gastritis is defined as “the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity,” and “the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology.” Providers should be aware that “the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis,” and “there should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present.” Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features “which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields,” and because these changes “are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed.” When endoscopic features are present, providers “should assess the extent endoscopically and obtain biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura … placed in separately labeled jars,” and “targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities.” In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers “should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and antiintrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis” and “should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies.”

There is insufficient evidence to make a formal recommendation on endoscopic surveillance in individuals with AIG; given the increased risk of type I neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and the possible increased risk of GC, individualized surveillance may be considered (Low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation). There are no RCTs of surveillance vs no surveillance for the purpose of early neoplasia detection in patients with histologically confirmed AIG, and endoscopic surveillance is suggested in the context of shared decision-making. In patients with pernicious anemia, the risk of GC is highest within the first year of diagnosis; thus, endoscopy should be considered in patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia, with particular consideration of women 50 years or older.

European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) 2019—atrophic gastritis (AG) and intestinal metaplasia (IM) surveillance: For patients with mild to moderate atrophy restricted to the antrum there is no evidence to recommend surveillance. Patients with IM at a single location have a higher risk of gastric cancer; however, this increased risk does not justify surveillance in most cases, particularly if a high-quality endoscopy with biopsies has excluded advanced stages of AG. In patients with IM at a single location but with a family history of gastric cancer, or with incomplete IM, or with persistent H pylori gastritis, endoscopic surveillance may be considered. Patients with advanced stages of AG (severe atrophic changes or IM in both antrum and corpus, OLGA/OLGIM III/IV) should be followed up with a high-quality endoscopy every 3 y, and those with a family history of gastric cancer may benefit from a more intensive follow-up, eg, every 1–2 y after diagnosis. Patients with autoimmune gastritis may benefit from endoscopic follow-up every 3–5 y.

### No-biopsy pathway following the interim BSG guidance reliably diagnoses adult coeliac disease [^0d3ee2a9]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent interim guidance from the British Society of Gastroenterology, aligned to historical paediatric practice, advises a no-biopsy protocol (NBP) for adults with high anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) titres and other clinical factors. A 7-year retrospective review identified 433 patients with positive tTG-IgA. Of these 433, 98 (23%) fulfilled the high titre criteria for an NBP which may have reduced endoscopic burden on the service. A high titre versus low titre translated in a 95% versus 75% histological confirmation of coeliac disease (p<0.01). The addition of anti-endomysial antibody analyses impacted minimally on these predictive rates. Our data support an NBP approach for selected patients. Of concern, however, was the finding that a third of patients with positive titres were not referred for a biopsy despite national guidance at the time advocating it. A clear message needs to be transmitted that the NBP is only for those with high titre, as opposed to any tTG-IgA positivity.

Description

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach, with a primary focus on atrophic gastritis due to chronic Helicobacter pylori infection-the most common etiology-or due to autoimmunity. To date, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, which leads to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification. In addition, there is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. Providers should recognize, however, that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports. Nevertheless, atrophic gastritis represents an important stage with distinct histopathologic alterations in the multistep cascade of gastric cancer pathogenesis.

Methods

The Best Practice Advice statements presented herein were developed from a combination of available evidence from published literature and consensus-based expert opinion. No formal rating of the strength or quality of the evidence was carried out. These statements are meant to provide practical advice to clinicians practicing in the United States. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Atrophic gastritis is defined as the loss of gastric glands, with or without metaplasia, in the setting of chronic inflammation mainly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or autoimmunity. Regardless of the etiology, the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis should be confirmed by histopathology. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Providers should be aware that the presence of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis. There should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis, particularly if marked atrophy is present. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Providers should recognize typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis, which include pale appearance of gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds, and, if with concomitant intestinal metaplasia, light blue crests and white opaque fields. Because these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: When endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are present, providers should assess the extent endoscopically. Providers should obtain biopsies from the suspected atrophic/metaplastic areas for histopathological confirmation and risk stratification; at a minimum, biopsies from the body and antrum/incisura should be obtained and placed in separately labeled jars. Targeted biopsies should additionally be obtained from any other mucosal abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In patients with histology compatible with autoimmune gastritis, providers should consider checking antiparietal cell antibodies and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies to assist with the diagnosis. Providers should also evaluate for anemia due to vitamin B-12 and iron deficiencies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All individuals with atrophic gastritis should be assessed for H pylori infection. If positive, treatment of H pylori should be administered and successful eradication should be confirmed using nonserological testing modalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The optimal endoscopic surveillance interval for patients with atrophic gastritis is not well-defined and should be decided based on individual risk assessment and shared decision making. A surveillance endoscopy every 3 years should be considered in individuals with advanced atrophic gastritis, defined based on anatomic extent and histologic grade. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The optimal surveillance interval for individuals with autoimmune gastritis is unclear. Interval endoscopic surveillance should be considered based on individualized assessment and shared decision making. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Providers should recognize pernicious anemia as a late-stage manifestation of autoimmune gastritis that is characterized by vitamin B-12 deficiency and macrocytic anemia. Patients with a new diagnosis of pernicious anemia who have not had a recent endoscopy should undergo endoscopy with topographical biopsies to confirm corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis for risk stratification and to rule out prevalent gastric neoplasia, including neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Individuals with autoimmune gastritis should be screened for type 1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors with upper endoscopy. Small neuroendocrine tumors should be removed endoscopically, followed by surveillance endoscopy every 1-2 years, depending on the burden of neuroendocrine tumors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Providers should evaluate for iron and vitamin B-12 deficiencies in patients with atrophic gastritis irrespective of etiology, especially if corpus-predominant. Likewise, in patients with unexplained iron or vitamin B-12 deficiency, atrophic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic evaluation pursued. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In patients with autoimmune gastritis, providers should recognize that concomitant autoimmune disorders, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, are common. Screening for autoimmune thyroid disease should be performed.

Diagnosing PA: the commonest non-nutritional cause of vitamin B deficiency

Given how NICE guidelines are used in practice, we find that the guidelines lack specific advice on the clinical scenarios in which practitioners should suspect AIG and PA. While they recommend considering an anti-intrinsic factor autoantibody test if AIG is suspected, the guidelines do not adequately explain why general practitioners should suspect an autoimmune basis beyond typical gastrointestinal symptoms. The presentation of AIG is highly variable, and looking only for gastrointestinal symptoms is insufficient as these present only in the later stages or not at all in most patients. Intrinsic factor auto-antibodies (IF-Ab) perform poorly as a stand-alone diagnostic marker for PA. Although they are highly specific, they have low sensitivity and present in less than 50% of PA patients. The guidelines acknowledge that a negative IF-Ab test does not rule out AIG or PA, and they suggest additional investigations when clinical suspicion remains. They further state that these should include anti-gastric parietal cell antibody (PC-Ab) tests, gastrin level measurements, CobaSorb tests, or gastroscopy with gastric body biopsy. However, despite their high sensitivity, PC-Ab has poor specificity and is present in other autoimmune conditions (e.g. autoimmune thyroid diseases) and, more generally, in approximately 10% of the general population. However, the uncertainty with this is whether it presents a pre-vitamin B12 deficiency or PA, where individuals are not yet symptomatic or are symptomatic but have a serum B12 value within the normal reference ranges. Therefore, a positiveresult will not definitively indicate PA or AIG. Additionally, PC-Ab might test positive in cases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-related chronic superficial gastritis, further complicating its diagnostic utility.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on management of gastric intestinal metaplasia [^f9891b3f]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines—scope and target audience for gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) management state that the guideline focuses on recommendations for management of patients with GIM detected as part of routine upper endoscopy and is intended to aid decision-making for patients who are undergoing upper endoscopy in North America. Screening for gastric cancer (either population-wide or in select populations) and management of patients with dysplasia of the gastric mucosa, gastric adenocarcinoma, and/or autoimmune gastritis are beyond the scope of the current guideline. The document notes that GIM may represent the histologic step just before development of dysplasia and that an evidence-based guideline supported by a comprehensive literature review for management of patients with GIM has not been previously published in the United States. The page also lists on-page abbreviations, including American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), and relative risk (RR).

Gastric atrophy patterns and confirmation—most examples of gastric atrophy can be divided into 2 patterns, HpAG and AIG; HpAG develops in the gastric antrum and incisura and may extend proximally, whereas AIG, also termed autoimmune metaplastic AG, is detected in the gastric corpus and fundus with characteristic sparing of the antrum unless there is concomitant HpAG; the border of the atrophic mucosa can be identified endoscopically and is used by the Kimura Takemoto system to estimate atrophy severity and the risk of progression through the Correa cascade, but diagnosing gastric atrophy based on endoscopy alone may be inaccurate and should be confirmed and its extent evaluated using a standardized biopsy protocol.

Figure 3 
Early gastric cancer. Intramucosal cancer located in the inferior body of the stomach. Although visible at white light endoscopy (A) with nodularity, rolled edges and central depression, the lesion is more clearly demarcated with enhanced imaging (Pentax, OE) (B), showing a greater contrast of the erythematous neoplastic mucosa, irregularity in the mucosal pit pattern and loss of normal gland architecture.

Biopsy strategies

At first endoscopy, assessment of the high-risk stomach should include biopsies to assess for H. pylori and to stage the extent of atrophic gastritis.The recent 2019 BSG guidelineson diagnosis and management of patients at risk of GC recommend that patients with image-enhanced features of CAG should undergo biopsies for confirmation of endoscopic diagnosis. Biopsies should be directed at sites within Sydney protocol areas where enhanced imaging suggests GIM. Biopsy samples should be collected in separate containers and labelled as either ‘directed’ or ‘random’ to corroborate endoscopic staging.

Updated 2019 guidelines from the ESGE stipulate biopsies from at least two sites (antrum and corpus, lesser and greater curvature for each).Additionally, where enhanced imaging is available and with the appropriate expertise, targeted biopsies to visible mucosal abnormalities should also be taken. There is evidence that taking an incisural biopsy may increase the proportion of patients diagnosed with higher-risk gastritis (OLGA III/IV or OLGIM III/IV),this also facilitates histopathological staging with the OLGA or OLGIM, which correlate with cancer risk.Random sampling carries a significant risk of sampling error leading to inaccurate and potentially missed diagnoses; therefore, the highest yield for advanced gastritis and early neoplasia is currently with a combination of random mapping biopsies plus targeted biopsies with enhanced imaging. A drive to improve clinicians’ confidence in the recognition of mucosal patterns of the stomach, as has been the case for colonic polyp classification, would enable a move towards an endoscopy-led staging protocol where biopsies are taken for confirmatory purposes or to exclude H. pylori and neoplasia.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^3efac0a3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) are common and include atrophic gastritis, gastric intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and certain gastric epithelial polyps. GPMC have an increased risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer (GC) in the United States represents an important cancer disparity because incidence rates are 2- to 13-fold greater in non-White individuals, particularly early-generation immigrants from regions of high GC incidence. The US 5-year survival rate for GC is 36%, which falls short of global standards and is driven by the fact that only a small percentage of GC in the US is diagnosed in the early, curable stage. This document represents the first iteration of American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on this topic and encompasses endoscopic surveillance for high-risk patients with GPMC, the performance of high-quality endoscopy and image-enhanced endoscopy for diagnosis and surveillance, GPMC histology criteria and reporting, endoscopic treatment of dysplasia, the role of Helicobacter pylori eradication, general risk reduction measures, and the management of autoimmune gastritis and gastric epithelial polyps. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on upper endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC detection in US populations deemed high-risk for GC. Surveillance endoscopy is recommended for individuals at high risk for GPMC progression, as defined by endoscopic, histologic, and demographic factors, typically every 3 years, but an individualized interval may be warranted. H. pylori testing, treatment, and eradication confirmation are recommended in all individuals with GPMC. Extensive high-quality data from US populations regarding GPMC management are lacking, but continue to accrue, and the quality of evidence for the recommendations presented herein should be interpreted with this dynamic context in mind. The GPMC research and education agendas are broad and include high-quality prospective studies evaluating opportunistic endoscopic screening for GC/GPMC, refined delineation of what constitutes "high-risk" populations, development of novel biomarkers, alignment of best practices, implementation of training programs for improved GPMC/GC detection, and evaluation of the impact of these interventions on GC incidence and mortality in the US.

### The importance of biopsy sampling practices in the pathologic evaluation of gastrointestinal disorders [^26f6e074]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the literature regarding appropriate endoscopic sampling and surveillance protocols for common inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract. Gastroenterologists increasingly use endoscopy with mucosal biopsy to detect inflammatory diseases, assess response to therapy, and monitor for progression to dysplasia.

Recent Findings

Many diseases show a patchy distribution in the digestive tract and there may be poor correlation between the endoscopic appearance and presence of histologic abnormalities. Indeed, a clinician's ability to render a diagnosis is limited by endoscopic mucosal sampling. The appropriate number of tissue samples and required biopsy sites are not established for many gastrointestinal disorders, and adherence to guidelines may not yield a reliable diagnosis in all cases.

Summary

We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations and emerging endoscopic techniques for the evaluation of eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, chronic gastritis, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^c9c4f35c]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction, affecting approximately 7% of individuals in the community, with most patients managed in primary care. The last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline for the management of dyspepsia was published in 1996. In the interim, substantial advances have been made in understanding the complex pathophysiology of FD, and there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning its diagnosis and classification, with the advent of the Rome IV criteria, and management. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of patients. The approach to investigating the patient presenting with dyspepsia is discussed, and efficacy of drugs in FD summarised based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of pairwise and network meta-analyses. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. These provide both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, in this guideline, we consider novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need and priorities for future research.

### Quality indicators in diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy [^623d0bff]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Surveillance of BE is described by the Seattle protocol, which implies taking four quadrantic biopsies every 2 cm along the circumferential extent of the non-dysplastic BE segment. Targeted biopsies from any suspicious area within the BE segment should be taken separately.Both ESGE and BSG acknowledge the Seattle protocol, which should be used in ⩾90% cases of BE surveillance.

In the stomach, chronic AG and GIM are well-described precursor conditions for gastric adenocarcinoma.The updated Sydney system is the most widely accepted protocol for the classification and grading of gastritis (including AG and GIM),and recommends taking at least five biopsies: two from the antrum (from the greater and lesser curvature, ~3 cm from the pylorus); one from the incisura; and two from the gastric body (from the lesser curvature ~4 cm proximal to the incisura, and from the middle of the greater curvature). Such a set of biopsies provides information on the extent of AG/GIM in the stomach and enables risk-stratification of patients with histopathological staging systems, such as an operative link for gastritis assessment (OLGA), or, more commonly used, the operative link for gastric intestinal metaplasia (OLGIM).Previous studies have shown that the separate biopsy taken from the incisura has a modest additional diagnostic value and, in some circumstances, can be avoided. ESGE recommend biopsies from at least two topographic sites (both the antrum and the corpus, at the lesser and greater curvature of each) for adequate staging of gastric precancerous conditions, especially when performed under advanced-imaging guidance by an experienced endoscopist.

Gastric pathology reporting and Sydney protocol—The Sydney system for evaluation of gastritis consists of systematic biopsies of 5 sites (greater and lesser curvatures of the antrum and corpus, and the incisura angularis). Typically, 1–2 biopsies are obtained at each of the 5 sites and placed in 2 separate jars (antrum/incisura and corpus); biopsies may be directed within each of the 5 Sydney zones if the endoscopic appearance suggests GPMC, and targeted biopsies of mucosal abnormalities and lesions are placed in a separate jar.

### Duodenal biopsies for the diagnosis of coeliac disease: are we adhering to current guidance? [^19d52e41]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coeliac disease (CD) is a common condition with a prevalence of at least 1% in the UK.CD can present with a range of symptoms including vague and non-specific abdominal symptoms similar to irritable bowel syndrome.With time, the proportion of patients presenting with atypical symptoms has also increased.Thus, it is important to ensure that when CD is considered as a potential diagnosis, patients are adequately investigated to avoid missing the diagnosis. The lifetime risk of malignancy, especially intestinal lymphoma and other gastrointestinal cancers, in fact, slightly increased in CDwith studies quoting an incidence of lymphoma of 8%.

Endoscopy remains the mainstay of adult CD diagnosis. As histological changes in CD can be patchy, several biopsies should be taken from the bulb and more distal duodenum at the time of endoscopy. Updated guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) on the management of adult CD recommend taking at least four duodenal biopsies, including one from the bulb, if CD is suspected.This is based on a large study involving 132 352 patients without known CD, which showed that taking ≥4 duodenal biopsy samples resulted in a doubling of the diagnostic rate of CD compared with when <4 samples were taken.This is further supported by evidence from a retrospective study involving patients with known CD, which showed that the sensitivity for a diagnosis of CD increased with incremental biopsies, and the diagnosis could be confirmed in 100% of patients when four biopsy specimens were taken.

We carried out a study to assess our compliance to the BSG guidelines in patients without known CD. Following implementation of measures to improve compliance, we also aimed to determine the influence of better compliance to guidelines on our local diagnostic rate of CD.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^a52d6aca]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastric adenocarcinoma carries a poor prognosis, in part due to the late stage of diagnosis. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer—in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every 3 years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM. Endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection of visible gastric dysplasia and early cancer has been shown to be efficacious with a high success rate and low rate of recurrence, providing that specific quality criteria are met.

Methodology

The guideline was commissioned by the BSG in May 2015 and the proposal approved by Clinical Standards and Services Committee. The guideline was developed in line with the BSG guideline Process.The purpose of the guideline was to provide guidance to healthcare professionals who are involved in the care of patients at risk of gastric cancer, including gastroenterologists, GI surgeons, pathologists, endoscopists and general practitioners. The AGREE II instrument (May 2009)was used to guide the methodology. The chair (MB) convened a guideline development group (GDG), consisting of clinicians and patients with experience of, or in the management of, these conditions. Members of the GDG were selected to ensure the relevant professional bodies and specialties were represented, including gastroenterologists, surgeons and pathologists. GDG members were required to declare any conflict of interests. The scope and purpose of the guidelines were initially discussed by the GDG on 20 July 2015 at the first consensus meeting, following which a set of key questions were created. The key questions were subdivided into clinical groups, including diagnosis, treatment, surveillance, screening and research (table 1). The GDG then voted anonymously on the relevance of each question to the guidelines and those with <75% agreement were excluded. The GDG then met in London on 17 September 2015 for a second consensus meeting to discuss the agreed key questions, agree on methodology, and allocate leads and subgroups to each question. Each lead and subgroup formulated a set of clinical questions pertinent to each key question using the PICO (patients, interventions, controls and outcomes) system, within which these four critical components were predefined as precisely as possible. The importance of each PICO outcome was ranked numerically by the subgroups on a 1–9 scale (7–9: critical; 4–6: important; 1—3: of limited importance) according to the clinical importance of each. Those outcomes of ≤3 were excluded.

### Updated joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for management of Helicobacter pylori infection in children and adolescents (2023) [^20c1e4df]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Evolving epidemiological data and increasing antibiotic resistance mandate an update of the European and North American Societies of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines.

Methods

Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated by experts according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. PICO (patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) questions were developed and voted on by the group. Recommendations were formulated using the Evidence to Decision framework.

Results

The current literature supports many of the previous recommendations and several new recommendations. Invasive testing with strain antimicrobial susceptibility analysis is recommended for the diagnosis and selection of eradication therapy for H. pylori infection. Molecular methods are acceptable for detection of infection and of antibiotic resistance in gastric biopsy specimens. Reliable, noninvasive tests can be used as a screening method for children with history of gastric cancer in a first-degree relative. When investigating causes of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura, testing for H. pylori is no longer recommended. When investigating other diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or eosinophilic esophagitis, specific diagnostic biopsies for H. pylori infection are not indicated. However, if H. pylori is an incidental finding, treatment may be considered after discussing the risks and benefits. Treatment should be based on antibiotic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and, if unavailable, regimens containing clarithromycin should be avoided.

Conclusions

Due to decreasing prevalence of infection, increasing challenges with antibiotic resistance, and emerging evidence regarding complications of infection, clinicians must be aware of these recommended changes to appropriately manage H. pylori infection and its clinical sequelae in children.

### Quality standards in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: a position statement of the British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and association of upper gastrointestinal surgeons of great britain and Ireland (AUGIS) [^26471b5f]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Where iron deficiency anaemia is being investigated, separate biopsies from the gastric antrum and body should be taken, as well as duodenal biopsies if coeliac serology is positive or has not been previously measured.

Level of agreement: 80%

Grade of evidence: weak

Strength of recommendation: weak

Iron deficiency anaemia has been found to be associated with gastric atrophy. We suggest biopsies are taken from the gastric antrum and body to confirm this diagnosis and avoid further unnecessary investigations. Biopsies from the duodenum should also be taken if coeliac serology is positive or has not been measured before an OGD performed for iron deficiency anaemia.

Where gastric or duodenal ulcers are identified, H. pylori should be tested and eradicated if positive.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: moderate

Strength of recommendation: strong

Where gastric or duodenal ulcers are observed, H. pylori should be excluded by a rapid urease test or gastric biopsies.Medication history should be reviewed to exclude contributory pharmacological agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.There is no role for the surveillance of duodenal ulcers, with repeat OGD having a low diagnostic yield.

The presence of gastric polyps should be recorded, with the number, size, location and morphology described, and representative biopsies taken.

Level of agreement: 100%

Grade of evidence: moderate

Strength of recommendation: strong

The presence, number and size of any detected gastric polyps should be documented. It is recommended that the actual number of polyps is recorded where there are five or less; however, it is acceptable where there are more than five to use the description of multiple polyps. All atypical polyps should be described. The majority of gastric polyps are accounted for by fundic gland and hyperplastic polyps.Although fundic gland polyps can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on endoscopic appearances, biopsies are recommended to confirm the histological diagnosis and exclude dysplasia.A single biopsy of a polyp is usually sufficient, with this approach having been found to be as accurate as polypectomy in 97.3% of cases.Repeat biopsies of a previously diagnosed benign gastric polyps are not indicated.Where there are multiple polyps, representative biopsies should be taken, as it is known that coexisting polyps are usually of the same histological type.Premalignant polyps should undergo surveillance in accordance with existing guidelines, while some dysplastic polyps should be considered for removal.

Coeliac disease and IDA

CD is found in 3%–5% of subjects investigated for unexplained IDA as demonstrated by studies from the UK, Europe, USA and Middle East.Duodenal biopsy histology remains the gold standard for exclusion or confirmation of the diagnosis. Coeliac serology—anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) or antiendomysial antibody—is however a useful screening test.A prospective study of 2000 referrals for gastroscopy (all indications including anaemia, mean age 56 years) with parallel serology and histology yielded both a sensitivity and a specificity of tTG IgA antibody for CD of 90.9%, with a negative predictive value of 99.6%.

With emerging evidence on the reliability of serology with an anti-tTG IgA titre of greater than 10× the upper limit of normal,the BSG has issued interim guidance on a ‘no biopsy’ protocol in patients under the age of 50 years during the COVID-19 pandemic, provided they have no alarm symptoms. An updated guideline on the diagnosis of CD in adults is expected in 2022.

Retrospective studies suggest that antibody-negative CD accounts for about 2% of the total coeliac population,though this may be an under-estimate due to ascertainment bias (seronegative subjects are less likely to get a biopsy), and the true figure may be nearer 10%.As standard serological screening tests are IgA-based, apparently seronegative CD can result from IgA deficiency. This only accounts for a minority of antibody-negative cases however,and screening for it may not be cost-effective as the result only marginally changes the probability of CD.

As the relative prevalence of seronegative CD is highest in the elderly,the sensitivity of coeliac serology for CD falls with age. This has importance in the investigation of IDA, where the incidence is highest in the elderly, and the median age at presentation is over 70.As the sensitivity of serology for CD can be as low as 74% in coeliacs presenting with IDA,it may be that an age-related approach to investigation is most appropriate.

Literature searches, evidence synthesis and grading of evidence

A literature search was undertaken by each subgroup with predefined search terms, electronic databases used (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Medline) and the time period covered. Where appropriate, conference abstracts were used to help formulate recommendations, provided that these were of sufficient scientific rigour.

The PICOs were used to guide the search for evidence and the highest quality studies were prioritised. Systematic reviews or meta-analyses were selected initially. Where systematic reviews, meta-analyses or critically appraised articles were unavailable, lower levels of evidence were selected. Where reviews use poor-quality studies such as that by Spence et al,for example, where the review was based on small, often single-centre cohort studies resulting in high levels of heterogenicity, this is discussed in the evidence review and highlighted in the evidence tables. In this instance, more weight is given to larger studies using large databases, which are likely to be more accurate. This hierarchy of searching was performed in a pyramidal sequence from top (high quality) to bottom (low quality), cascading from recently published systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies, to RCTs, and subsequently to observational studies providing that no evidence is available from the higher quality categories. The selected evidence was tabulated in an evidence table categorising each study into the study design, intervention/clinical question, participants/population, reference standard, results and conclusions/comments.

Although randomised controlled studies are deemed the most appropriate type of study to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, other types of studies were included to assess types of effectiveness, such as ways of delivering service or outcomes from registries in clinical practice. If evidence from studies was weak or contradictory, searches for alternative sources were undertaken to see if the evidence concurred or contradicted (triangulation of searches). All available negative studies were included in the searches. The subgroups discussed the external validity of the studies and whether the study outcomes are applicable to the target population for the guidelines. Literature searches were transparent and reproducible to reduce ‘dissemination biases’.

All evidence tables and references were downloaded to a shared reference manager (F1000Workspace), to which all GDG members had access. Shortly before the statements were finalised, a further literature search was undertaken. The quality of the evidence was assessed following the GRADE terminology using table 2.Evidence is graded as high, moderate, low and very low quality (table 2).

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: expert review [^51a43759]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnostic workup—atrophic gastritis histopathology and risk stratification—the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis (AG) should be confirmed by histopathology (Best Practice Advice [BPA] 1), and practical reporting depends on submitting antral and corpus biopsy specimens in separate jars with correct orientation; gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM) is readily identified irrespective of specimen thickness or orientation. Severity and topographic distribution of atrophic lesions are well-established determinants of gastric cancer risk and are incorporated in 2 classification systems for risk assessment—Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link for Gastritis Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM)—which are advocated by international guidelines, although reporting of OLGA/OLGIM stage has not gained a foothold in clinical practice in the United States. Providers should be aware that the presence of IM on gastric histology almost invariably implies the diagnosis of AG, and that extensive atrophy and metaplasia are associated with an increased cancer risk; there should be a coordinated effort between gastroenterologists and pathologists to improve the consistency of documenting AG severity and extent, particularly if marked atrophy is present (BPA 2).

4.1.3 Diagnostic tests

Good Practice Recommendation 7. Suspected Crohn’s disease should be investigated with ileocolonoscopy including segmental colonic and ileal biopsies (to look for microscopic disease); and with imaging to assess location and extent of small bowel disease (Agreement: 97.8%).

Ileocolonoscopy with biopsy is established as the first-line investigation for suspected Crohn’s disease. Ileoscopy with biopsy histology is superior in establishing the diagnosis of mild ileal Crohn’s disease, however, intubation of the terminal ileum may not always be possible, and up to 20% of patients have isolated proximal small bowel disease beyond the reach of even complete ileocolonoscopy. For example, out of a cohort of 150 Crohn’s disease patients, 36 had active small bowel disease diagnosed using CT enterography following a normal ileocolonoscopy.Ileoscopy and radiological imaging are complementary in diagnosis of ileal Crohn’s disease.Dedicated small bowel imaging should be performed to complement ileocolonoscopy in all patients with suspected Crohn’s disease and those with an unclassified colitis at ileocolonoscopy. Mucosal biopsy specimens are essential for a complete macroscopic and microscopic assessment of the colon and distal ileum.

Statement 27. We suggest that adult patients with Crohn’s disease do not routinely require upper gastrointestinal endoscopy as part of the diagnostic evaluation unless they have upper gastrointestinal symptoms (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 91.1%).

Crohn’s disease in the upper gastrointestinal tract has a prevalence up to 13% in some studies,and 16% in a more recent study of 119 patients.When found, it is usually accompanied by ileal or colonic disease.It has been suggested that upper GI endoscopy can help to differentiate between UC and Crohn’s disease in patients with an unclassified colitis. Changes of focal gastritis occur, however, in UC as well as Crohn’s disease,and so gastroscopy may not be helpful. If there is vomiting, dyspepsia or other upper GI symptoms then upper GI endoscopy is indicated, but not routinely in adults with suspected or proven Crohn’s disease.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG) and British society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (BSPGHAN) joint consensus guidelines on the diagnosis and management of eosinophilic oesophagitis in children and adults [^b83b7381]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Investigations

At least six biopsies should be taken from different anatomical sites within the oesophagus for diagnosis and follow-up of eosinophilic oesophagitis

Level of evidence: Moderate.

Strength of recommendation: Strong.

Level of agreement: 100%.

Although macroscopic endoscopic appearances can suggest EoE, some of these endoscopic changes can also be seen in other conditions (eg, post-radiotherapy strictures), or can be confused with other pathology (eg, candidial oesophagitis). In a significant proportion of patients, EoE can be missed either because the mucosa appears normal or the changes are too subtle and not easily recognised without prior clinical suspicion. Regardless of endoscopic appearance, histology is required to secure the diagnosis. The distribution of the eosinophilic infiltrate is often patchy, and this can often make the diagnosis more difficult to confirm.To improve the likelihood of sampling the correct site and securing a diagnosis, multiple biopsies are required from different sites within the oesophagus. The current body of evidence is not uniformly clear with regard to the minimum or maximum number of biopsies required, nor which sites are the most appropriate for samples to be taken. Between 2004 and 2019, 16 retrospective, prospective and case studies described the association between numbers of biopsies and oesophageal sites in the diagnosis of EoE, with the numbers of patients included in each study ranging from 30 to 213. Eleven published studies suggested taking biopsies from two sites, the proximal and distal oesophagus,two studies also suggested including the mid oesophagus,while others were unclear. Similarly, the number of biopsies suggested is also variable; however, all suggest obtaining multiple biopsies with recommendations ranging between four and six, with six biopsies equating to a 97%–100% chance of making a positive diagnosis.

The GDG recommends that six biopsies should be taken from at least two different sites in the oesophagus. Further, in order to maximise the chances of making an EoE diagnosis, there should be a combination of targeted biopsies from visible areas of mucosal surface abnormality (eg, white spots, furrows) and non-targeted biopsies among the six biopsies.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of gastric premalignant conditions [^940517c9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline—Histologic diagnosis of gastric premalignant conditions: In individuals at increased risk for or with suspected gastric premalignant conditions (GPMC) or gastric cancer (GC), we suggest systematic gastric sampling according to the updated Sydney biopsy protocol, with at minimum 2 separate containers for the antrum and incisura and for the corpus, and targeted biopsies of any other mucosal abnormalities placed in additional separate containers (Low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation). In individuals with gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM), we suggest that the histological subtype of GIM (incomplete, complete, and mixed) be reported for risk stratification and surveillance; limited GIM is restricted to the antrum and incisura, whereas anatomically extensive GIM also involves the corpus, and severity refers to the proportion of atrophy or GIM in individual biopsies from each compartment (Very low quality of evidence, conditional recommendation).

Endoscopy

Upper endoscopy with biopsies obtained from the gastric body and antrum/incisura (at minimum) provides the gold standard for diagnosis. It is important that proceduralists recognize endoscopic features which might be consistent with AIG, although the endoscopic findings might be subtle early in the disease course. As atrophy progresses, the mucosa thins and rugae flatten which appears endoscopically as loss of gastric folds, pale mucosa, and prominent vessels visible through the thinned mucosa (Figure 1). Small lesions such as hyperplastic and pseudopolyps, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and even adenomas or adenocarcinoma may also be present (Figure 1). Concomitant gastric intestinal metaplasia is often easier to appreciate endoscopically, particularly with high-definition white light endoscopy and image enhancement, such as narrow band imaging. Features of gastric intestinal metaplasia include the classic tubulovillous pattern and light blue crest sign, which are more readily appreciated with near-focus or magnified endoscopy.

The typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis are apparent, including loss of rugal folds and pallorous-appearing gastric mucosa; not as appreciated here is the increased prominence of submucosal blood vessels in the gastric body due to the thinned gastric mucosa.

In addition to a thorough endoscopic assessment in order to evaluate the extent of pre-neoplastic changes and identify/characterize any concerning lesions, obtaining biopsies according to the Sydney protocol is recommended and allows for the greatest diagnostic yield, as well as the opportunity to classify disease severity and extent using the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA)and Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (OLGIM)staging systems. The updated Sydney protocol includes two sets of biopsies obtained from the following locations placed in separately labeled jars: greater and lesser curvature of the gastric corpus, greater and lesser curvatures of the gastric antrum, and the incisura. These anatomic biopsies should be placed in separately labeled jars, as should any biopsies obtained from visualized abnormalities.

AGA guideline—special staining of gastric biopsy specimens for HP: When biopsies are obtained from the normal-appearing gastric body and antrum for the detection of HP infection, the AGA suggests not obtaining automatic special staining of the specimens (Conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). Moderate-quality data indicated that HP infection is almost always found in the context of chronic inflammation, and with the 5-biopsy updated Sydney protocol the majority of cases of HP infection can be identified by experienced pathologists on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains. Therefore, routine use of ancillary special staining of the specimen would have limited value and will increase overall procedural cost; if HP is not identified on H&E staining in the presence of chronic gastritis, at the pathologists’ discretion, immunohistochemistry or other special staining will be considered.

### Gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (...) [^eb7410d5]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Anemia of any cause is present in approximately 6% of the US population and increases with age, more so in people in racial minority populations. For example, according to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, from 2003 to 2012 the prevalence of anemia in Black men increased from 5. 1% to
11. 8% and in Black women from 17. 5% to
25. 0%. 1 Iron deficiency anemia is an important specific cause of anemia with an estimated prevalence of approximately 3% in the adult population. Iron deficiency anemia is twice as prevalent among Black women and Hispanic women compared with White women2 and can be caused by either decreased iron availability or increased iron requirements after blood loss from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. 3 The AGA guideline notes significant practice variation in the definition and diagnostic evaluation of IDA and presents an evidence-based approach to this condition.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk for gastric cancer in the United States: expert review [^f6e5dd2d]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for atrophic gastritis, more specifically with respect to endoscopic surveillance, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain risk stratification in all patients with confirmed gastric atrophy, with or without gastric intestinal metaplasia. Recognize that patients with severe atrophic gastritis and/or multifocal or incomplete gastric intestinal metaplasia are likely to benefit from endoscopic surveillance, particularly if they have other risk factors for gastric cancer, such as family history. Consider obtaining endoscopic surveillance every 3 years, recognizing that intervals are not well defined and shorter intervals may be offered in patients with multiple risk factors, such as anatomically extensive severe gastric intestinal metaplasia.

### Practice trends among US gastroenterologists following the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on gastric intestinal metaplasia: data from a tertiary care center [^031b671f]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Studies show variability in gastroenterologists' management of gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) in the United States. In 2020, the American Gastroenterological Association published GIM guidelines, recommending physician-patient shared decision-making on GIM surveillance based on risk factors. We compared gastroenterologists' communication trends of a GIM finding and surveillance recommendations before and after 2020 and evaluated patient and provider factors associated with a surveillance recommendation.

Methods

A sample of patients diagnosed with GIM on biopsies from upper endoscopies performed in 2018 (cohort A) and 2021 (cohort B) were included. Logistic regression analysis assessed the association between patient/provider characteristics and surveillance recommendations in the overall cohort and over time.

Materials

In all, 347 patients were included: 175 in cohort A and 172 in B. Median age was 65.7 (56.0, 73.4), and 54.5% were females. Communication to patients about GIM findings and surveillance recommendations increased from 24.6% <2020 to 50% >2020 ( P <0.001) and 20% <2020 to 41.3% >2020 ( P <0.001), respectively. Overall, endoscopy >2020, family history of gastric cancer, autoimmune gastritis, female providers, and gastroenterologists with 10 to 20 years of experience were associated with a surveillance recommendation. The effect of family history of gastric cancer and the effect of the patient's female sex on surveillance was significantly different between both cohorts [Odds ratio (OR): 0.13, 95% (Confidence interval) CI: 0.02, 0.97 and OR 3.39, 95% CI: 1.12, 10.2, respectively).

Conclusions

Despite a 2-fold increase in surveillance recommendations after 2020, there was no meaningful effect of any of the patients' factors on a recommendation for surveillance over time, which raises the question as to whether surveillance is being offered to both average and high-risk patients without thorough risk stratification.
