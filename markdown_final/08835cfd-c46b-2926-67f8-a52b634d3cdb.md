## Question

Treatment of autoimmune hepatitis acute liver flare

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of an autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) acute liver flare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify the acute presentation. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup and when to pursue liver biopsy. Next, I will consider immediate management priorities, including when to start corticosteroids and when to avoid them. After that, I need to outline steroid dosing, monitoring, and early decision points for transplant referral. Finally, I should address special scenarios, maintenance therapy, and pediatric considerations, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with major guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and definitions, because misclassification here drives mismanagement. An AIH acute liver flare can present as acute severe AIH (AS-AIH) with jaundice and coagulopathy (INR > 1.5) but without encephalopathy, or as AIH with acute liver failure (ALF) when encephalopathy is present; both can occur as a first presentation or as an acute exacerbation of previously unrecognized chronic AIH, and both carry high risks of deterioration and need for transplant, so I need to keep a low threshold for early transplant evaluation [^7eee3f8f] [^2041a05b] [^6bcfd7af].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic workup before jumping to steroids, because missing alternative causes can be dangerous. I should exclude viral hepatitis (including acute HBV, HEV, and others), drug-induced liver injury including AIH-like injury, ischemia, and other acute liver diseases, and I should obtain autoantibodies (ANA, SMA, anti-LKM1, anti-SLA/LP) and IgG, recognizing that up to half of acute presentations can be seronegative; liver biopsy is often decisive in acute presentations, with centrilobular necrosis and plasma cell–rich lobular hepatitis supporting AIH when classic interface hepatitis may be absent, so I should not delay biopsy if it will change management [^2041a05b] [^62da772e] [^c71528f0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steroids in all-comers. I need to check severity and encephalopathy status before deciding. In AS-AIH without ALF, early corticosteroids are recommended; in AIH-ALF, steroids are generally not beneficial and may be harmful, so I should prioritize urgent transplant evaluation rather than prolonged steroid trials; similarly, in acute-on-chronic liver failure due to AIH, I should weigh risks and benefits case-by-case and avoid steroids if there is uncontrolled infection or advanced encephalopathy, aligning with EASL and AASLD guidance [^4528fbef] [^6bcfd7af] [^c5e029f5] [^fb4dad91].

> I will now examine steroid dosing and formulation, and I should double-check that I am not inadvertently recommending budesonide in the wrong setting. For AS-AIH, prednisone or prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (up to 60 mg/day) is standard, with some centers using IV methylprednisolone at equivalent doses; budesonide is contraindicated in cirrhosis or acute severe disease due to portosystemic shunting and lack of evidence, so I must avoid it here; azathioprine is typically withheld initially in severe cholestasis or ALF and added only after cholestasis improves to avoid hepatotoxicity [^79973c93] [^db53b865] [^c86769df].

> Next, I should review monitoring and early decision points, because delays in recognizing nonresponse can be catastrophic. I need to check aminotransferases, bilirubin, INR, and mental status frequently, at least every 1–2 days initially; if there is no meaningful biochemical improvement within 3–7 days or any clinical deterioration (rising INR, worsening jaundice, or encephalopathy), I should escalate to urgent transplant evaluation rather than persisting with steroids; early MELD dynamics and clinical features can help predict steroid responsiveness and guide timing of listing [^4528fbef] [^295f4ad3] [^854cca5e].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on maintenance therapy and this is a breakthrough flare. I should confirm adherence and drug levels, because nonadherence or underdosing is a common cause of relapse; if adherence is confirmed, I should treat the flare by reinstituting the original induction regimen (typically prednisone/prednisolone with or without azathioprine) and then optimize maintenance, switching to mycophenolate or tacrolimus if azathioprine is not tolerated or ineffective; in refractory cases, I should consider second-line agents and refer to a transplant-capable center early [^72a51222] [^79973c93] [^2802ae76].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios that alter risk–benefit. In pregnancy, I should continue prednisone and azathioprine and avoid mycophenolate, with close postpartum monitoring for flares; in children, higher steroid doses (up to 2 mg/kg/day) may be used acutely, and transplant should be considered early for ALF or steroid-refractory disease; in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, I should avoid budesonide and coordinate care with transplant teams early [^4ce5fc15] [^db53b865] [^64d5ee81].

> Let me reconsider the role of liver biopsy in the acute setting, because I initially thought biopsy might be too slow; however, in AS-AIH, histology can secure the diagnosis when serologies are negative and guide urgency of therapy, so I should not defer biopsy if it will change management, especially when AIH-ALF is not yet established and steroids are being considered [^2041a05b] [^c71528f0].

> I should double-check that my algorithm aligns with major guidelines. For AS-AIH without ALF, start prednisone/prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, monitor closely for 3–7 days, and if no improvement or if deterioration occurs, proceed to urgent transplant evaluation; for AIH-ALF, do not delay transplant with steroids, and avoid steroids in severe coagulopathy with encephalopathy stages III–IV; for maintenance after remission, continue azathioprine with low-dose prednisone or transition to mycophenolate or tacrolimus as appropriate, and monitor lifelong for relapses [^4528fbef] [^6bcfd7af] [^79973c93] [^f039852a].

In an autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) acute liver flare, **prompt immunosuppression is essential** to prevent progression to acute liver failure [^4528fbef]. Start **prednisone or prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day** (max 60 mg/day) immediately, and add azathioprine 1–2 mg/kg/day once bilirubin is ≤ 6 mg/dL to reduce steroid exposure and relapse risk [^79973c93] [^db53b865]. Monitor liver tests every 1–2 weeks; if there is no biochemical improvement within 1–2 weeks or if encephalopathy develops, escalate to IV methylprednisolone and **urgent transplant evaluation** [^6bcfd7af] [^f6ec943e]. Budesonide is contraindicated in acute severe AIH or cirrhosis, and mycophenolate is an alternative if azathioprine is not tolerated [^c86769df] [^79973c93]. Supportive care includes infection surveillance, GI prophylaxis, and close monitoring for complications [^7a56886d].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnosis

- **Confirm AIH flare**: Characterized by a rapid rise in ALT/AST, bilirubin, and INR, often with elevated IgG and positive autoantibodies (ANA, SMA, anti-LKM1) [^7eee3f8f].
- **Exclude other causes**: Viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, ischemia, and other acute liver diseases must be ruled out [^2041a05b].
- **Histology**: Liver biopsy is often required to confirm AIH and assess severity, especially in acute presentations [^4e2afeea].

---

## Immediate medical management

### Corticosteroid therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Prednisone or prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day) is the cornerstone of acute flare management [^79973c93].
- **Intravenous steroids**: Consider IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in severe cases or when oral intake is compromised [^4528fbef].
- **Duration**: Continue until biochemical remission (normalization of ALT, AST, and IgG), typically 4–8 weeks, then taper gradually [^notfound].

---

### Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy

Add **azathioprine 1–2 mg/kg/day** once bilirubin is ≤ 6 mg/dL to reduce steroid exposure and relapse risk [^79973c93]. If azathioprine is not tolerated or is ineffective, **mycophenolate mofetil 1.5–2 g/day** is an alternative [^79973c93].

---

## Monitoring and response assessment

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check liver enzymes, bilirubin, INR, and IgG every 1–2 weeks initially, then monthly once stable.
- **Early response**: Expect ALT/AST decline within 1–2 weeks; lack of improvement warrants escalation or reconsideration of diagnosis [^2c32b602].
- **Histologic remission**: Consider repeat biopsy after 6–12 months to confirm remission before tapering therapy [^notfound].

---

## Indications for liver transplantation

- **Acute liver failure**: INR ≥ 1.5 with hepatic encephalopathy or MELD > 30 despite steroids [^notfound].
- **Treatment failure**: No biochemical improvement after 1–2 weeks of high-dose steroids [^6bcfd7af].
- **Recurrent flares**: Multiple relapses with progression to cirrhosis or decompensation [^96c5a047].

---

## Complications and supportive care

- **Infection risk**: High with immunosuppression; monitor closely and treat promptly [^7a56886d].
- **Gastrointestinal prophylaxis**: PPIs are recommended to prevent steroid-induced ulcers.
- **Bone health**: Calcium, vitamin D, and bisphosphonates as indicated to prevent osteoporosis.

---

## Special considerations

Avoid **budesonide** in acute severe AIH or cirrhosis due to reduced efficacy and increased side effects [^c86769df]. In pregnancy, prefer **prednisone or prednisolone** with azathioprine; avoid mycophenolate [^4ce5fc15]. In pediatrics, use prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day with azathioprine 1–2 mg/kg/day, and consider liver transplantation for ALF or steroid-refractory disease [^64d5ee81].

---

## Summary algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm AIH flare and exclude other causes |
| 2 | Start prednisone/prednisolone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day |
| 3 | Add azathioprine 1–2 mg/kg/day when bilirubin ≤ 6 mg/dL |
| 4 | Monitor liver tests every 1–2 weeks |
| 5 | Escalate to IV steroids and transplant evaluation if no improvement in 1–2 weeks |
| 6 | Taper steroids after biochemical remission |
| 7 | Maintain azathioprine or mycophenolate long-term |

---

Prompt, guideline-concordant immunosuppression with close monitoring and early transplant evaluation is the key to managing an **AIH acute liver flare**.

Treatment failure

Primary complete biochemical remission after adequate treatment initiation is the rule (90–95% of patients); therefore, reassessment of diagnosis and treatment adherence should be considered in non-responders. Non-response is not well-defined, but usually the absence of a transaminase decline of at least 25% from baseline after 2–3 weeks should be considered as non-response. It is also important to remember that other conditions may develop concurrently during the AIH course, such as viral infections or DILI, which if unrecognized, could be mistakenly regarded as a null response or flares.

Treatment failure can be seen either in patients with an acute/severe or even fulminant disease form, or in those without such intense severity. Data on patients with acute/severe presentation are scarce, consisting mostly of real-life non-randomized studies with a small number of patients and varying, mostly arbitrary entry criteria, because the precise definition of this form of AIH is still missing. Therefore, the role and timing of corticosteroids in modifying the outcome of acute/severe AIH remains unclear, as it is ambiguous whether such patients should be given a corticosteroids trial, a priority listing for liver transplantation, or both. Potts and Verma recently reviewed five retrospective studies, each with a small number of patients, including in total 85 patients with AIH-related acute liver failure. Sixty-nine patients (89.2%) received immunosuppression, mostly oral corticosteroids, and had remission rates of 8.3–50%, while 43.5% underwent or were listed for liver transplantation and 33% died. The largest recent studies in acute/severe AIH come from France (n = 104) and Greece (n = 42). In the multicenter retrospective French study, an overall survival rate of 90% was reported (median follow up: 2.3 years), although early liver transplantation was required in one third of patients. The beneficial effect of corticosteroids was observed in 66% of patients, mainly in those with low international normalized ratio (INR) at baseline and improvement in liver function during the first week of treatment. In the Greek study, high-dose intravenous corticosteroids were given (prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg/day) in the early stages of acute/severe AIH, defined as an acute presentation without any sign of hepatic encephalopathy and transaminases > 10×ULN, INR ≥ 1.5 and bilirubin ≥ 4 mg/dL at any time during the acute course. This management appeared to prevent disease deterioration without increasing morbidity and mortality (long-term overall survival without transplantation: 95.2%; median follow up: 5.3 years).

Introduction

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a challenging condition that presents in both acute and chronic forms in patients of all ages. It remains a diagnosis of exclusion since there is no disease-specific test and one third of patients present with advanced liver disease. Corticosteroids and non-selective immunosuppression are currently the mainstay of treatment. Disease relapse is common and affects up to 80% of patients after treatment withdrawal. Moreover, undesired corticosteroid-related side effects are considerable, and up to 50% of patients can develop cirrhosis despite therapeutic intervention. AIH has a female predominance, with the majority of most patients requiring life-long monitoring.

To-date, liver biopsy is considered essential for diagnosis of AIH in accordance with all clinical guidelines, and can highlight co-existence with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, viral hepatitis, and variant syndromes. It is also useful for evaluation of treatment response and to guide therapy by quantification of hepatic inflammation and staging of liver fibrosis.

Monitoring of liver inflammation in AIH relies on non-invasive assessment such as liver biochemistry (alanine transaminase (ALT) activity) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. Liver biochemistry can be insensitive to changes in fibro-inflammation in the liver and one cannot exclude underlying residual active hepatic inflammation in the presence of 'normal LFTs' (liver function tests). Some clinical guidelines recommend repeat "on-treatment" histological assessment to confirm complete resolution of histological inflammation to aid in long-term therapeutic management considerations. This has not been universally adopted. In practice, liver biopsy is performed at diagnosis, for an unexplained and persistent flare in liver biochemistry/IgG and when considering treatment cessation or withdrawal. Liver biopsy however is invasive and not liked by patients. This paucity in follow-up histological assessment has resulted in a need for objective, quantitative, reproducible, and accurate non-invasive methods of assessing liver health in this population.

Drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)–like liver injury — guidance statements: Drug-induced AIH-like liver injury must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIH, and the offending agent must be withdrawn with monitoring maintained to ensure laboratory resolution. Glucocorticoid therapy for drug-induced AIH-like injury should be instituted when symptoms or disease activity are severe (e.g., fulfill Hy's law) or if symptoms and laboratory tests fail to improve or worsen after discontinuation of the offending drug. Laboratory flare after glucocorticoid withdrawal suggests underlying AIH and the need for immunosuppressive therapy.

### Flare of autoimmune hepatitis Causing acute on chronic liver failure: diagnosis and response to corticosteroid therapy [^9f3ca7d3]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is considered less common in the Asia Pacific region. Due to this, AIH flare as a cause of acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is often overlooked and treatment delayed. We aimed at the defining clinical and histopathological spectrum and role of steroid therapy in AIH-ACLF. Patients with AIH-ACLF, prospectively recruited and followed between 2012 and 2017, were analyzed from the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) data base. Diagnosis of AIH was confirmed using International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group score or simplified AIH score with histopathological evidence. Of 2,825 ACLF patients, 82 (2.9%) fulfilled criteria of AIH (age 42.1 ± 18.1 years, 70% female). At baseline, mean bilirubin was 18.6 ± 8.2 mg/dL, Child-Turcotte-Pugh score was 11.7 ± 1.4, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 27.6 ± 6.5. Mean immunoglobulin G was 21.61 ± 7.32 g/dL, and this was elevated ≥ 1.1 times in 97% of cases; 49% were seronegative. Liver histology was available in 90%, with median histological activity index of 10 (interquartile range, 7–12); 90% with moderate to severe interface activity; 56% showing significant parenchymal necrosis (bridging and confluent necrosis); and cirrhosis in 42%. Twenty-eight (34%) patients received steroid therapy and showed shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay (median 1.5 versus 4 days, P < 0.001) and improved 90-day survival (75% versus 48.1%, P = 0.02) with comparable incidence of sepsis (P = 0.32) compared to those who did not. Patients of advanced age, more severe liver disease (MELD > 27; 83.3% sensitivity, 78.9% specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.86), presence of hepatic encephalopathy, and fibrosis grade ≥ F3 had an unfavorable response to corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion: AIH presenting as ACLF is not uncommon in Asian patients; a low threshold for liver biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis as nearly half the patients are seronegative; early stratification to steroid therapy or liver transplantation (MELD > 27, hepatic encephalopathy in ≥ F3) would reduce ICU stay and improve outcomes.

Relapse and flare of AIH

Relapse can occur in patients after complete discontinuation of treatment, while flares represent an increase of liver biochemical indices during tapering of induction therapy or during maintenance therapy. Even though a strict definition of relapse in AIH is lacking, it should be considered when clinical and/or laboratory indices reappear (ALT ≥ 2–3 × ULN and/or elevation of IgG which usually precedes ALT increase). A new biopsy is not usually needed to confirm relapse or flare.

Relapses and flares are successfully treated quite easily with the initial treatment regimens used in the induction therapy schedule, by increasing the corticosteroid dose slightly and transiently. The net result is the re-achievement of CBR in most patients. As in relapse cases, other causes of increased aminotransferases and problems with treatment adherence should be carefully excluded to avoid a misconception of flare episodes.

Recommendations 55–56

Re-biopsy is not recommended to confirm relapse or flare if other causes of high aminotransferases have been carefully excluded (Evidence 2, Strong recommendation)
Treatment of relapses or flares should be identical to the starting schedule, and results in re-achievement of CBR in almost all patients (Evidence 1, Strong recommendation)

Statements 3–7

Early diagnosis is of utmost importance, as it positively affects the patient's outcome (Evidence 1, Strong statement)
Males may represent a subgroup with advanced disease at diagnosis and worse outcome (Evidence 3, Weak statement)
Almost a third of adults and 40–50% of children already have cirrhosis at diagnosis, because of undiagnosed or misdiagnosed disease (Evidence 2, Strong statement)
Acute AIH presents as an acute flare of undiagnosed AIH, or as a genuine episode of acute hepatitis (Evidence 2, Strong statement)
AS-AIH is defined by the presence of jaundice, prolongation of international normalized ratio (INR ≥ 1.5 and < 2) and no hepatic encephalopathy (Evidence 2, Strong statement)

Recommendations 1–4

Thorough investigation for suspected AIH should be performed in all cases of unexplained hepatitis, especially when IgG levels are elevated (Evidence 2, Strong recommendation)
AIH patients should be screened at diagnosis and during follow up for the presence of Hashimoto thyroiditis, the most common concurrent extrahepatic autoimmune disease (Evidence 2, Strong recommendation)
Patients with AIH can be screened according to symptoms for other extrahepatic autoimmune diseases, as they may affect mortality, being higher in those with more than one autoimmune disease (Evidence 2, Weak recommendation)
Sub-classification of AIH into AIH-1 and AIH-2 is not recommended (Evidence 4, Strong recommendation)

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### Management of autoimmune hepatitis [^857580e5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic, progressive hepatitis of uncertain cause which has fluctuating activity characterized by periods of flares and remissions. Initial placebo-controlled trials carried out in the 1970s demonstrated that immunosuppression with steroids was extremely effective in reducing flares and progression of disease. The late 1980s-1990s could be described as the 'Dark Ages' of AIH treatment research. Very few clinical studies were performed during this time, although it became increasingly apparent that not all patients tolerated or responded to traditional immunosuppression, and that not all patients were easy to diagnose because of overlapping features with other autoimmune conditions. Fortunately, clinical research in the treatment of AIH has experienced a renaissance in the 21st century.

Recent Findings

This review highlights some of the more important recent discoveries, including the creation of the clinically useful short form of the autoimmune hepatitis diagnostic scoring system; accumulation of data supporting the use of mycophenolate and tacrolimus as second-line treatment; and the recent completion of the largest, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AIH treatment to date, comparing budesonide to prednisone.

Summary

These new findings are pertinent to the everyday clinical management of patients with AIH.

### Severe autoimmune hepatitis in patients with previous spontaneous recovery of a flare [^567dc24f]. Journal of Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Autoimmune hepatitis can present acutely and pursues a variable, usually progressive course. Spontaneous remissions have been described, but their influence on the course of subsequent attacks has not yet been studied.

Methods

Charts from 1980 to 2000 were reviewed. Cases of autoimmune hepatitis were further examined to identify those with prior episodes of transient elevation of the serum aminotransferase activities of unknown etiology.

Results

Fifty-one patients with autoimmune hepatitis were identified, nine of whom (18%) had experienced a transient episode of elevated aminotransferase activities which had resolved spontaneously. The median period of time separating the two flares was 10 months (range: 4 months-23 years). The median age at diagnosis was 41 years in both groups. More than 75% of the patients in either group suffered from a type 1 autoimmune hepatitis. Importantly, patients with spontaneous recovery of a previous episode had a higher serum alanine transaminase activity (P < 0.02), were less likely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy (78 versus 98%, P = 0.077) and required transplantation more frequently (22 versus 0%, P = 0.028). Histologically, these patients did not have more fibrosis than patients without previous flare.

Conclusions

More than 10% of autoimmune hepatitis may begin with a spontaneously resolving episode. However, the spontaneous recovery of a previous attack should not falsely reassure: a subsequent flare of autoimmune hepatitis can still be severe.

Table 2
Common and uncommon variants and specific forms of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

Manifestations of the disease vary considerably, from entirely asymptomatic to acute liver failure (ALF). Acute presentation occurs in about 30% of patients and is indistinguishable from viral or other causes of hepatitis. Acute AIH, either icteric or non-icteric, can present as an acute flare of chronic AIH that had not been diagnosed previously, or as a genuine episode of acute hepatitis without lesions of chronic disease on liver histology. Some of these patients can present an acute–severe type of AIH (AS-AIH) (Table 2).

Most patients (65%-70%) are either completely asymptomatic or present with general symptoms of various severity, such as weakness, fatigue, malaise, amenorrhea, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, upper right quadrant pain, nausea, low-grade fever and polyarthralgia, usually involving the small joints, without arthritis, dating back even for years. Almost a third of adults and 40–50% of children already have cirrhosis at baseline, even though these figures seem to be declining in recent studies from several countries, including Greece, probably reflecting improvements in early diagnosis and treatment.

AIH is classified in 2 subtypes, AIH-type 1 (AIH-1) and AIH-type 2 (AIH-2), according to the circulating autoantibodies, although the importance of this distinction is still uncertain. Indeed, a recent long-term observational study in children with AIH showed that disease severity, treatment response and outcomes were not associated with the type of AIH. Patients with AIH-1 have seropositivity for antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA), smooth muscle autoantibodies (SMA) and/or soluble liver antigens/liver pancreas antibodies (anti-SLA/LP), while those with AIH-2 have seropositivity for anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody type-1 (anti-LKM1) and/or antibodies against liver cytosol type-1 antigen (anti-LC1) or rarely anti-LKM-type 3 (anti-LKM3).

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) clinical presentation and diagnostic considerations — "AIH is an immune-mediated inflammatory liver disease of uncertain cause which affects all ages, both genders, and all ethnicities". "Patients may be asymptomatic, be chronically ill, or present with acute liver failure (ALF); and the diagnosis must be considered in all patients with acute or chronic liver inflammation, including patients with graft dysfunction after LT". "AIH does not have a signature diagnostic feature, and the diagnosis requires the presence of a constellation of typical features which can vary between patients with the same disease and can occur in other liver diseases". Outcomes can include "Progression to advanced hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, death from liver failure, or LT", and therapy notes that "Treatment with immunosuppressive agents has been life-saving, but management regimens may be long-term, associated with serious side effects, and variably effective".

Presentation and management

Relapse of AIH usually presents as an asymptomatic flare in serum transaminases on monitoring. In well patients without cirrhosis, it is reasonable to repeat the tests after 1–2 weeks before changing treatment. However, in patients with cirrhosis, relapse has been associated with hospital admission and occasionally with death.

Serum IgG is less often elevated than in initial presentation of AIH. In one study, median serum IgG on relapse was 15.4 (11–22) g/dL suggesting normal levels in over half. If the presentation is atypical, (including for example, a prodromal illness) hepatotropic viruses (box 1) should be tested for, ultrasound scan performed and drug toxicity considered. In clinically typical cases, liver biopsy usually confirms AIH and is not necessary routinely.

On re-treatment with prednisolone serum transaminases normalise in over 90% of patients. In the randomised trial of prednisolone versus budesonide, some patients had relapse (rather than first presentation) of AIH, suggesting that budesonide is also effective in treating AIH relapse.

As with initial induction treatment, it is reasonable to continue steroids until CBR is achieved on two occasions.

There is no evidence that one relapse is associated with a worse outcome. However, after re-achieving CBR, there is a stronger case for then continuing azathioprine (or mycophenolate) in maintenance doses. In two studies, rates of second relapse after stopping treatment were 62% (over 1–33 years)and 100% (over 0–5 years). Patients who had two or more relapses, or more than four relapses per decade, were more likely to die or to need liver transplantation than were non-relapsers. Development of cirrhosis is also associated with repeated relapse.

In children who relapse, it is important to ensure the dosage is correct for their height and weight.

Section P. COVID-19 and AIH

COVID-19 might involve the liver, and cause abnormal liver tests. In patients with AIH, COVID-19 might cause a 'flare' in serum transaminase, which is usually mild, but in cirrhotic patients might result in acute on chronic liver failure.

COVID-19 might be more severe in patients taking immunosuppressive drugs, including rituximab, high-dose steroids, thiopurines, and (possibly) mycophenolate and tacrolimus. However, other surveysdo not support this Thus some, although not all, guidelines suggest modest reduction of immunosuppression dose.NICE guidance recommendsspecific antiviral treatment within 5–7 days of symptoms in patients with cirrhosis, and in those taking immunosuppressive drugs.

Several cases have been reported of AIH developing shortly after COVID-19. However many are probably coincidental.

Patients with AIH should receive COVID vaccination. About half, especially those taking steroids or mycophenolate, had impaired cellular and humoral responses to two doses of COVID vaccine; however, a third dose then achieved an adequate humoral (though not cellular) response. Despite this, COVID-19 infection in AIH is less severe in vaccinated patients.

Several cases of an acute AIH-like illness have been reported within 4 weeks of COVID-19 vaccination, including both the viral vector (Oxford and Janssen) and mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) variants. AIH is usually, mild and responds to corticosteroids, but a few cases have been fatal or have required liver transplantation. Incidence of post-vaccine liver injuryis low: 4 per 10 000, and some cases are probably coincidental. However, AIH following COVID vaccination rarely causes advanced fibrosis, and rarely relapses after steroids are stopped. In some reports, liver injury developed twice after repeated exposure to the same vaccine, although not after re-exposure to a different vaccine. These features suggest a causative role for the vaccine in some cases.

### Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis: corticosteroids or liver transplantation? [^91a9eb72]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute severe presentations of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) represent a challenge for the transplant community. As a disease, it is poorly characterized, and there is a weak evidence base to guide diagnosis and treatment. Early identification of acute severe AIH is key because it determines the initiation of corticosteroids, which can be lifesaving. However, their use in this setting remains controversial. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, severity of coagulopathy, and grade of encephalopathy may be predictors of outcome with corticosteroid therapy. The optimal timing of liver transplantation (LT) can be difficult to determine and, as such, the decision to proceed to transplantation should not be delayed by protracted courses of corticosteroids. The aim of this review is to better characterize this subset of patients; to differentiate them clinically, serologically, and histologically from chronic AIH and other causes of acute liver failure; and to present the role, predictors, and optimal timings of corticosteroid therapy and LT. Although this review is specific to adults, many principles hold true for the pediatric population.

Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or acute liver failure (ALF) due to AIH — glucocorticoids and timing of liver transplantation (LT): Glucocorticoid therapy (usually prednisolone or prednisone; 0.5–1 mg/kg daily in adults and up to 2 mg/kg in children) has been effective in 20%-100% of patients with acute severe AIH and has not been associated with an increase in sepsis. In AIH with ALF, glucocorticoids have not been associated with improved overall survival, and survival has been less in treated patients with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease scores > 40; reports of improvement with mild encephalopathy have been sparse and therapy may be deleterious in severe decompensation. The key is to abandon ineffective treatment quickly (within 1–2 weeks depending on clinical status and treatment response) and proceed to LT; failure to improve laboratory tests or any clinical deterioration or hepatic encephalopathy during treatment justifies immediate consideration of LT, and hepatic encephalopathy at presentation defines ALF with AIH and is associated with LT being more likely to improve survival than protracted glucocorticoid treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^1991d995]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver of unknown cause that may progress to liver cirrhosis and end stage liver failure if diagnosis is overlooked and treatment delayed. The clinical presentation is often that of acute hepatitis, sometimes very severe; less frequently, it can be insidious or completely asymptomatic. The disease can affect people of any age and is more common in women; its incidence and prevalence seem to be on the rise worldwide. An abnormal immune response targeting liver autoantigens and inducing persistent and self-perpetuating liver inflammation is the pathogenic mechanism of the disease. A specific set of autoantibodies, increased IgG concentrations, and histological demonstration of interface hepatitis and periportal necrosis are the diagnostic hallmarks of autoimmune hepatitis. Prompt response to treatment with corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory drugs is almost universal and supports the diagnosis. The aims of treatment are to induce and maintain long term remission of liver inflammation. Treatment can often even reverse liver fibrosis, thus preventing progression to advanced cirrhosis and its complications. Most patients need lifelong maintenance therapy, and repeated follow-up in experienced hands improves the quality of care and quality of life for affected patients.

### Acute flares in chronic hepatitis B: the natural and unnatural history of an immunologically mediated liver disease [^6a182d14]. Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Acute flares in chronic hepatitis B are common and may be caused by a number of identifiable and potentially treatable factors. The common link for many of these exacerbation episodes is a change in the immunologic response to hepatitis B virus (HBV), and this may have no identifiable cause or be triggered by an increase in viral replication or genotypic change. It is important to keep in mind the clinical situations in which patients are at increased risk of reactivated infection and secondary exacerbations. Reactivation is frequently induced by medical treatments such as cancer chemotherapy, antirejection drugs used in organ transplantation, and corticosteroids. The immunologic flares that often result from sudden withdrawal of these medications can be life-threatening unless recognized and treated promptly with antivirals, and there is increasing experience that preemptive antiviral treatment can diminish their occurrence and improve the outcome. The experience with lamivudine and other nucleoside analogues has increased our understanding of the molecular events behind hepatitis flares that occur when chronic hepatitis B is treated with drugs that potently inhibit HBV DNA polymerase. However, not all flares are explainable by events related to HBV infection alone. Depending on the population studied, as many as 20%-30% of flares may be caused by infection with other hepatotropic viruses, and this situation may inhibit HBV replication. Proper understanding of the etiology and effective treatment of acute flares in chronic hepatitis B requires an appreciation of high-risk clinical situations, assessment of HBV replication status, and testing for other viruses when appropriate.

### What is the optimal first-line treatment of autoimmune hepatitis? A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials and comparative cohort studies [^2697d614]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

First-line treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) performed in the 1960s and 70s. In a meta-analysis, prednisolone+/−azathioprine was more effective than placebo and more effective than azathioprine alone at achieving disease remission. Prednisolone plus azathioprine was as effective as higher-dose prednisolone monotherapy, with fewer adverse effects (AEs).

However, evidence of survival benefit from steroid-based treatment was not demonstrated statistically. Also, it remains unclear whether all patients with AIH require steroids. Or whether there are subgroups who do not.

Acute severe (AS)-AIH comprises about 5% of presentations and about 30% of patients require early liver transplant for survival. The efficacy of corticosteroids is not established.

In a RCT in patients without cirrhosis, budesonide showed higher efficacy than prednisolone in achieving normal serum transaminases after 6 months, with fewer AEs. Its longer-term efficacy is unclear. A meta-analysisof this trial and one observational studyinformed the recommendation of prednisolone and budesonide as equivalent first-line treatments in the 2020 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines. However, more information on budesonide is now available.

Recommendations regarding initial dose of prednisolone have varied widely in guidelinesand from expert opinion. Questions also remain regarding steroid-sparing agents (SSAs) in AIH. Azathioprine was shown in early RCTs to enable reduction of steroid dose without loss of efficacy but with fewer AEs. However, it is unclear if SSAs improve survival. Mycophenolate is used as an alternative SSA in patients intolerant of azathioprine, and recently, as a first-line agentand its efficacy has been compared with that of azathioprine in a recent RCT.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) definitions and treatment outcome terms — AIH is defined by "Characteristic histologic abnormalities (lymphoplasmacytic interface hepatitis), elevated AST, ALT, and total IgG and the presence of one or more characteristic autoantibodies". Inactive cirrhosis is "Absence of inflammatory infiltrates in both portal tracts and fibrous bands in cirrhosis". Acute severe AIH requires "Jaundice, INR > 1.5 < 2.0, no encephalopathy; no previously recognized liver disease", while acute liver failure (ALF) is "INR ≥ 2; hepatic encephalopathy within 26 weeks of onset of illness; no previously recognized liver disease". Remission terms include "Normalization of serum AST, ALT, and IgG levels" for biochemical remission and "Absence of inflammation in liver tissue after treatment" for histological remission. Response and safety terms include "Worsening laboratory or histological findings despite compliance with standard therapy" for treatment failure, "Improvement of laboratory and histological findings that fails to satisfy the criteria for remission" for incomplete response, "Exacerbation or reappearance of the disease activity during or after induction of remission and drug withdrawal (or nonadherence)" for relapse, and "Inability to continue maintenance therapy due to drug-related side effects" for treatment intolerance; note that "Patients with cirrhosis in biochemical remission may have persistent elevation of IgG".

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and pregnancy — counseling, fetal outcomes, and maternal complications are summarized as follows: the effects of AIH and its medications on fetal– maternal health should be discussed before pregnancy if possible; among mothers with AIH, the live birth rate is 73%, the fetal loss and stillbirth rate is 27% (higher than the general population at 7%-15% but similar to women with chronic disease at 24%-29%), and premature births occur in ~20% of pregnancies with no specific birth defects associated with AIH; antiphospholipid antibodies are strongly associated with AIH and may be a separate, but related, cause of preterm delivery; the overall maternal complication rate during the pregnancy or within 12 months of delivery is 38%; flares occur mainly in patients who are not on therapy or not in remission during the year prior to conception; patients who are pregnant or planning pregnancy within the next year should be continued on treatment to reduce the risk of flare and hepatic decompensation; and flares are 3 times more common postpartum.

We present a systemic review with meta-analysis of first-line treatment of AIH to support the (submitted) British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) AIH Guidelines. We aimed to address the following questions:

Is use of corticosteroid (± steroid-sparing agent) associated with better transplant-free survival (compared with non-use), in patients with (a) AIH overall, (b) asymptomatic AIH, (c) without cirrhosis and (d) with decompensated cirrhosis?
Are these first-line treatment options associated with better outcomes and/or fewer AEs than their comparators: budesonide (vs prednisolone), mycophenolate (vs azathioprine) and 'high' (> 35–40 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day) dose prednisolone (vs lower dose)?

### Nomenclature, diagnosis and management of drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis (DI-ALH): an expert opinion meeting report [^f5615811]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Implications for drug development

DILI is a major cause of the withdrawal of potentially valuable therapies post-marketing. Current methods have not been shown to be helpful in predicting DILI or DI-ALH in clinical studies. Due to the lack of effective biomarkers, Hy's law is currently the most used tool to assess a drug's potential to cause severe DILI. Therefore, the most specific indicator that a drug is hepatotoxic is the occurrence of drug-induced hepatocellular injury with jaundice, and/or an increased international normalised ratio. Labelling cases as potential DI-ALH in clinical trials may trigger follow-up actions, including: determining liver-specific autoantibodies in patients with elevated aminotransferases, administering steroids according to current recommendations for treatment of AIH, and long-term follow-up of study participants to monitor for possible flares of AIH in either the presence or absence of study drug. For this reason, caution should be exercised in classifying a case of suspected DILI as DI-ALH, since this can have a profound impact on the workup of these patients, the decision to interrupt or discontinue treatment and the overall safety assessment of the developmental compound. A comprehensive identification of potential DI-AILH cases in clinical studies would require a dedicated initiative, for instance in the frame of a public-private partnership that specifically addresses this question and allows partner companies to share samples and data.

A much better understanding of the mechanisms underlying DILI and DI-ALH is essential to design improved predictive models. Thus, future research should focus on applying new technological advances and constructing a systematic biological approach to understand the mechanism and identify initial pathways. This will enable the identification of new treatment targets and other environmental and genetic factors that also have a profound impact on the risk of an individual patient developing overt liver disease. This would allow physicians to stratify patients according to their environmental and genetic factors and to adopt a personalised approach to the treatment of DI-ALH.

A 48-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis was on naproxen, hidroxichloroquine and acetylsalicylic acid. She had self-suspended all medication and resumed 1 year later. Five days after the medication was resumed, she developed acute hepatitis, with biochemical hepatic cytolysis, hypergamaglobulinaemia and a serum antinuclear antibody titre of 1/2560. Idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis was considered, but drug-induced liver injury could not definitely be ruled out. Patient declined liver biopsy. Oral prednisolone was started. Within 3 months with prednisolone being tapered to 10 mg/day, a new flare occurred. Liver biopsy was performed and it favoured autoimmune hepatitis diagnosis. We discuss the diagnostic options and treatment approach in a patient with autoimmune disease and possible drug-induced liver injury who initially declined liver biopsy.

### Remission in autoimmune hepatitis: what is it, and can it ever be achieved? [^62ce6887]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

The goals of therapy in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are to dampen inflammation within the liver, with the aim of inducing remission, improving symptoms, and prolonging survival. Ideally, treatment could be stopped once remission has been achieved. However, cessation of therapy may be complicated by relapse in substantial numbers of patients and although as many as 30% of patients could remain in remission, it is impossible to predict which patients can stop therapy safely and avoid unnecessary prolongation of immunosuppression therapy. A retrospective analysis of data from a large single centre has assessed parameters that could predict maintenance of remission following withdrawal of therapy. Importantly, it has been shown that therapy should not be withdrawn in any patient who has not achieved complete normalization of biochemistry in the presence of normal histology, nonspecific portal hepatitis, or inactive cirrhosis. The results illustrate the difficulties in relation to defining remission and relapse in patients with AIH and highlight the need for consistency in terminology.

### Grand round: autoimmune hepatitis [^b38a40eb]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a corticosteroid-responsive liver disease arising consequent to immunogenetic and environmental risk factors. The clinical course reflects relapsing and remitting, hepatocyte targeted immunologic damage, which is countered by reparative responses to cell injury. Appropriate and timely immunosuppressive therapy drives the disease into remission, albeit with inevitable side effects. Many challenges faced in the clinic reflect practice that must capture a heterogeneous disease presentation, course, and treatment response, as well as treatment tolerability. In this Grand Round we appraise the evidence supporting current treatment approaches, address the impact of autoimmune liver disease 'crossover or overlap' presentations, explore important clinical correlates to immune-serological classifiers, and discuss the factors influencing choice of alternative therapy in difficult-to-treat situations.

STATEMENT 11

Definition of the acute/severe form of AIH is an urgent unmet need (I)

RECOMMENDATIONS 41–47

In partial responders under a conventional regimen, an increase of the azathioprine dose to 2 mg/kg/day in combination with 5–10 mg/kg/day prednisolone is recommended (II-3)
In partial responders under a budesonide-based regimen, a change to prednisolone (> 20 mg/day) could be considered (III)
In partial responders not able to achieve complete remission despite the above options, the goal should be the lowest achievable biochemical activity with a minimum of side-effects, or administration of alternative second-line therapeutic agents after consultation at a specialized center (II-3)
Failure of primary complete biochemical remission after adequate treatment should raise strong suspicion of misdiagnosis or non-compliance with therapy (II-2)
All AIH patients presenting with the acute/severe form of the disease should be considered for a high-dose corticosteroid trial (> 1 mg/kg/day) at the earliest opportunity (the sooner the better), and preferably intravenously, but failure to improve within 7 days should lead to emergency listing for liver transplantation (II-3)
In non-responders without intense severity, prednisolone and azathioprine at the maximum dosage (1 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively) could be tried, followed by management at expert centers in the case of non-response (II-2)
Determination of TGN levels could help the redesign of treatment strategy, as undetectable TGN may indicate altered azathioprine metabolism or non-compliance, while high TGN levels may suggest toxicity (II-2)

Acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AS-AIH)

AS-AIH is defined as an 'acute' presentation with jaundice and coagulation disturbance (INR greater than 1.5) but without encephalopathy. Definition of 'acute' has varied: 'symptoms for < 26 weeks", no known history of chronic liver disease'or 'no previous medical history of AIH'. Two-thirds of patients with AS-AIH receiving corticosteroids survive without transplantation (Section F)

AIH-related acute liver failure (AIH-ALF)

When encephalopathy is also present (in addition to jaundice and coagulopathy), the condition becomes that of AIH with ALF (AIH-ALF), sometimes called acute fulminant AIH. In reports, encephalopathy is already present at presentation in 3–6% of patients classified as AS-AIH, and might also develop over 1–3 weeks (especially in patients with higher INR and MELD scores), thus progressing to AIH-ALF.

The outcome of AIH with ALF is worse than that of AS-AIH, with recovery in only 9–32% of patients. No survival benefit with steroids was seen in AIH with ALF in one multicentre cohort(Section F). Thus, urgent transplantation is usually required.

Section C Recommendations

1. We recommend that the presence of encephalopathy in a patient with AS-AIH should codify the disease as AIH-ALF. This should trigger consideration of urgent liver transplant. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: strong.

2. We recommend that acute-on-chronic liver failure should be differentiated from decompensated cirrhosis, since it identifies a subgroup of patients that might merit expedited liver transplantation. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

Section D. Diagnostic workup

In patients with suspected AIH, a comprehensive drug history is needed, including all medications, herbal/dietary supplements and recreational drugs. (Table 1) Always consider stopping or changing medications which either (a) have previously been linked to AIH, (b) were started within 12 months of the liver injury or (c) are not needed or can be substituted. If after drug withdrawal, serum transaminases, do not promptly improve, consider a trial of steroids even if the diagnosis of AIH is uncertain (Section O).

Because there is no single diagnostic marker for AIH, other causes of hepatitis must be excluded. Patients with suspected AIH should undergo a non-invasive liver screen as detailed in box 1.

### Autoimmune liver disease [^1f56abc1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Identify advances in diagnosis, treatment, and understanding of autoimmune hepatitis.

Recent Findings

Autoimmune hepatitis can present as an acute or fulminant hepatitis in the absence of pre-existent fibrotic disease. Celiac disease can resemble it, and treatment must include corticosteroids. Centrilobular necrosis is within the histologic spectrum of autoimmune hepatitis, and variant syndromes may be refractory to conventional therapies. Discriminative indices developed by head-to-head comparisons between the classical disorders may be useful in identifying true variants, and antibodies to chromatin may have prognostic value in predicting relapse after drug withdrawal. Multiple drugs and infectious agents can trigger the disease, and cytokine imbalances are important pathogenic factors. Recurrent or de novo autoimmune hepatitis must be considered as a cause of graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Pregnancy is generally well tolerated, and it may attenuate the disease. After transplantation, pregnancy should be deferred until after the second year.

Summary

Autoimmune hepatitis has diverse presentations and manifestations. It must be considered in all patients with acute and chronic liver disease and in all cases of allograft dysfunction after liver transplantation.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology which may affect any patient irrespective of age, sex, and ethnicity. At baseline, the clinical spectrum of the disease varies largely from asymptomatic cases to acute liver failure with massive hepatocyte necrosis. The aim of these EASL guidelines is to provide updated guidance on the diagnosis and management of AIH both in adults and children. Updated guidance on the management of patients with variants and specific forms of AIH is also provided, as is detailed guidance on the management of AIH-associated cirrhosis, including surveillance for portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare disease of unclear etiology characterized by loss of self-tolerance that can lead to liver injury, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure. First-line treatment consists of systemic corticosteroids, or budesonide, and azathioprine, to which most patients are initially responsive, although predictors of response are lacking. Relapses are very common, correlate with histological activity despite normal serum transaminases, and increase hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, current regimens lead to adverse effects and reduced quality of life, whereas medication titration is imprecise.

Abstract

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare disease of unclear etiology characterized by loss of self‐tolerance that can lead to liver injury, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure. First‐line treatment consists of systemic corticosteroids, or budesonide, and azathioprine, to which most patients are initially responsive, although predictors of response are lacking. Relapses are very common, correlate with histological activity despite normal serum transaminases, and increase hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, current regimens lead to adverse effects and reduced quality of life, whereas medication titration is imprecise. Biomarkers that can predict the clinical course of disease, identify patients at elevated risk for relapse, and improve monitoring and medication dosing beyond current practice would have high clinical value. Herein, we review novel candidate biomarkers in adult and pediatric AIH based on prespecified criteria, including gene expression profiles, proteins, metabolites, and immune cell phenotypes in different stages of AIH. We also discuss biomarkers relevant to AIH from other immune diseases. We conclude with proposed future directions in which biomarker implementation into clinical practice could lead to advances in personalized therapeutic management of AIH.

### Autoimmune hepatitis [^e0274bed]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease of the hepatic parenchyma that can present in acute or chronic forms. In common with many autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis is associated with non-organ-specific antibodies in the context of hepatic autoimmunity. This dichotomy has made definition of a unifying hypothesis in the pathophysiology of the disease difficult, although data from the past 8 years have drawn attention to the role of regulatory T cells. Several triggers have been identified, and the disease arises in genetically susceptible individuals. Clinical and biochemical remission is achievable in up to 85% of cases. For the remaining patients, alternative immunosuppression strategies are an option. Liver transplantation provides an excellent outcome for patients with acute liver failure or complications of end-stage liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Variant or overlapping syndromes are worthy of consideration when unexpected disease features arise.

Most studies indicate that quality of life (QoL) in patients with AIH is lower than in the general population. We need to understand more about this — and in particular, which treatments for AIH improve QoL — and which make it worse.

In a minority of patients, liver damage progresses despite treatment and such patients need monitoring for complications of cirrhosis and consideration of liver transplantation. Overall results are good, although AIH might recur in the transplanted liver.

Pregnancy in women with AIH is nearly always successful, although there are modest increases in risk to both mother and baby. With the important exception of mycophenolate (which might damage the baby), we recommend continuing drugs for AIH throughout pregnancy to prevent disease flares.

Patients with AIH can usually be managed well in smaller as well as large hospitals, although children should maintain contact with a specialist. We recommend that they be under the care of only two–three designated consultants and have input from a specialist nurse. A patient database should be maintained for audit purposes. We recommend formation of regional AIH networks, with online meetings at which challenging problems can be discussed and biopsy slides reviewed. Advice from a transplant centre must be easily and rapidly available, especially for patients with severe disease, most of whom should be transferred.

We emphasise the need for further research. We need to better understand the effect of treatments on patients' quality of life and assess newer drugs which damp down the immune system in clinical trials. Some existing treatments need further evaluation (for example mycophenolate and budesonide to prevent relapse).

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^fb835dc2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis — management in severe acute disease and ALF: For those with AS-AIH without ALF, glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone alone, 0.5–1 mg/kg or a total of 60 mg daily in adults) can be beneficial without an increased risk of adverse outcomes such as infection, and therapy should not delay evaluation for liver transplantation (LT), with up to 48% of treated patients likely to require LT. The prognosis of AS-AIH ALF has improved significantly with the greater adoption of corticosteroid therapy and LT; survival rates for AS-AIH ALF in the pretransplant era were less than 20%, and more recent series show mortality rates of 16%–19%. Use of corticosteroid therapy in patients with chronic AIH with exacerbation or with ALF remains less certain, with data mixed showing both improved outcome and transplant-free survival or no benefit. Key concepts: In patients presenting with AS-AIH, we recommend the use of IV corticosteroids, and in patients with AS-AIH that has progressed to ALF, we recommend early evaluation for LT. The role of budesonide and other immunosuppressive agents such as tacrolimus in severe acute AIH is not well supported, so they cannot be recommended for general use at this time, and patients should be immediately evaluated for LT, and vigilant surveillance for infection should also be a part of the comprehensive care of patients with AS-AIH or AIH-induced ALF.

### Autoimmune hepatitis [^fcb4f05e]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis was one of the first liver diseases for which an effective treatment was developed and the benefit proven by randomized controlled trials. Nonetheless, both the diagnosis and the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis remain full of challenges. The clinical spectrum is very wide, ranging from subclinical non-progressive disease to fulminant hepatic failure. Diagnostic criteria based on elevation of IgG, demonstration of characteristic autoantibodies, and histological features of hepatitis in the absence of viral disease are very helpful. However, in some patients, diagnosis remains a clinical challenge. Adequately dosed steroids are the mainstay of remission induction treatment, while remission maintenance is best achieved by azathioprine. Therapeutic alternatives are required in a small group of patients responding insufficiently to these drugs or intolerant to their side effects.

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^c026847c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in pregnancy — risks, flare rates, and therapy considerations: AIH is associated with an increased risk of fetal prematurity and loss, with worse outcomes with inadequate AIH activity control, especially in the absence of or discontinuation of AIH treatment before or during pregnancy. Although historically considered quiescent during pregnancy, more recent data suggest AIH may have an initial presentation during pregnancy, an intrapartum flare risk of > 20% and a postpartum flare risk of up to 30–50%. Treatment for AIH is based on immunosuppression with corticosteroids and/or azathioprine (AZA), with recent practice guidelines for AIH recommending prednisone monotherapy for pregnant individuals, and a systematic review concluded that corticosteroids +AZA was appropriate for induction whereas corticosteroids +AZA or AZA monotherapy was superior to corticosteroid monotherapy for maintenance management of AIH. In the absence of systematic reviews on AIH treatment during pregnancy, it is important to consider that flares of AIH during pregnancy may be potentially more detrimental to neonatal outcomes than the potential risk of medical therapy needed to control and prevent AIH flares.

Budesonide safety and populations to avoid — Patients with acute liver failure (ALF) or cirrhosis were not included in the randomized trial of budesonide, and patients with cirrhosis should not receive budesonide because portosystemic shunting may reduce drug efficacy and promote steroid-specific side effects (SSSE); portal vein thrombosis has also been reported in patients with cirrhosis taking budesonide, albeit it is a known complication of cirrhosis independent of budesonide use; patients who fail to normalize laboratory tests on prednisone are less likely to respond to budesonide and therefore budesonide should not be used as a rescue therapy; the safety of budesonide use as first-line treatment in acute severe AIH or ALF is unknown, and thus it is not recommended in these settings.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — transplant indications, outcomes, and peri-illness therapy — LT is an effective therapy for patients with decompensated chronic autoimmune hepatitis and in patients with autoimmune hepatitis who present with acute liver failure. Long-term outcomes after LT for autoimmune hepatitis are excellent, with 5 to 10-year survival rates of ~75%. Factors associated with poor outcome and need for LT in type I autoimmune hepatitis include delayed aminotransferase response to therapy, younger age, greater acuity at presentation, MELD score > 12, and multiple relapses. Corticosteroid administration in acute liver failure due to autoimmune hepatitis is controversial and is best reserved for less severe disease (MELD < 28) to minimize the risk of sepsis which could preclude transplantation. 32. LT should be considered in patients with decompensated autoimmune hepatitis who do not respond to or are not appropriate candidates for medical therapies (1-A). 33. LT is indicated in autoimmune hepatitis presenting as acute liver failure if recovery is unlikely (1-B).

### Liver biopsy findings in chronic hepatitis B [^70cc08b5]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Liver biopsy plays a central role in treatment algorithms in patients with hepatitis B and remains the gold standard for evaluating hepatic pathology. The pathology of hepatitis B is diverse and reflects the natural history of infection. An acute hepatitic pattern with lobular disarray is seen in acute infection, during acute flares of disease, and with acute hepatitis D superinfection. In chronic hepatitis B, inflammation is less pronounced in the immune-tolerant phase and is prominent during immune-mediated viral clearance. Active inflammation appears to be the driving force for development of fibrosis. Inflammatory grades and fibrosis stage are assigned as is done for hepatitis C. Although current management guidelines recommend liver biopsies only in select patients based on age, viral levels, and hepatitis B e antigen status, these clinical and biochemical parameters do not show consistent correlations with liver histology. Liver biopsy also helps identify preneoplastic lesions including large cell and small cell change. Unlike in other causes of chronic hepatitis, immunostains are widely used and can help determine the phase of infection. Liver biopsies can also identify additional pathology that may contribute to liver disease such as steatohepatitis, iron overload, autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced injury. Thus, liver biopsy can play an important role in staging and grading chronic hepatitis B and should be more widely used in assessing the need for therapy.

Introduction

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune-mediated necroinflammatory liver disease. In most of the cases, AIH manifests as a chronic disease. Since it was first reported in 1984, there have been rare but significant cases of acute AIH in recent years. Acute presentation of AIH has been reported, and cases with acute manifestations usually contained two distinct clinical entities. One is true acute AIH without chronic histologic changes (acute form), and the other is acute exacerbation of chronic AIH (acute exacerbation form). The acute form was suggested to be further subdivided into non-severe, severe, and fulminant AIH. It has emerged that acute severe AIH (AS-AIH) is related to a high incidence of acute liver failure (ALF).

Czaja et al. and Yeoman et al. previously defined AS-AIH as an acute presentation (onset of symptoms to presentation of ≤ 26 weeks) with INR of ≥ 1.5, and no histologic evidence of cirrhosis. However, patients with AS-AIH often present with atypical symptoms, with normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and negative serological markers, especially antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-liver kidney microsomal 1 (LKM-1) antibody, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA). Therefore, liver histopathology, which is crucial to diagnosis of AIH and treatment decision, is considered a prerequisite for its timely detection. Regarding the histopathological features of AS-AIH, centrilobular necrosis with plasma cell infiltration was reported to be more diagnostic than typical AIH features of interface hepatitis and emperipolesis. Particular attention was paid to centrilobular necrosis, which in previous reports has ranged from 21.8 to 100% in patients with acute presentations of AIH. However, the significance of centrilobular necrosis remains to be elucidated. Therefore, early diagnosis of AS-AIH remains challenging and urgent.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) first-line therapy — budesonide plus azathioprine (AZA) versus predniso(l)ne plus AZA: Meta-analysis showed homogeneous results (I^2 = 0.0%, P = 0.495) and favored budesonide and AZA for biochemical remission with OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.03–3.67. One study reported more steroid-specific side effects in the prednisone group compared to budesonide, while no studies reported rapidity of response, death, or liver transplantation (LT). Conclusions included a conditional recommendation with low certainty for use of budesonide and AZA in children and adults without cirrhosis, acute severe hepatitis, or acute liver failure (ALF).

### New foe treated with old guns-supportive role of steroids in the treatment of acute severe hepatitis E [^8e2bed9a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

A full literature research revealed another case report describing recovery from HEV infection under immunosuppressive treatment. In that case, HEV was misdiagnosed and treated like acute autoimmune hepatitis. Taken together, immunosuppressive treatment of the inflammatory flare of acute HEV infection most likely does not hinder viral clearance, but may help to avoid additional liver damage and avert the need for liver transplantation.

It would be beneficial to identify patients with HEV-induced acute liver injury who might profit from immunosuppression and those who are likely to resolve HEV infection spontaneously without risk for acute liver failure. As major limitation for the interpretation of our case, the favourable outcome might just reflect the natural course of HEV infection that might have developed even without steroid treatment. Our patient presented with major risk factors (regular alcohol consumption and older age) for a severe course of HEV, which were identified by Péron et al. It is tempting to assume that steroid treatment prevented progression to encephalopathy. Still, we cannot rule out that absence of hepatic encephalopathy reflects the benign natural clinical course in this patient and is not a result of steroid treatment. If autochthonous HEV infection becomes fulminant, high-dose steroids might be a supportive treatment, potentially even additive to ribavirin that has already been used successfully in some case reports. Ribavirin has also been applied as treatment of acute autochthonous HEV infection on pre-existing chronic liver disease.

This case highlights the possibility of steroid treatment as a therapeutic rescue in patients with hepatitis E. Further studies are required to evaluate whether steroid treatment has a supportive role for patients with HEV-induced acute liver injury and improves their spontaneous outcome. At least, steroid treatment does not seem to impair viral clearance. Therefore, steroid use should not be delayed in severe acute immune-mediated hepatitis if HEV infection is assumed and diagnostic test results are pending.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver clinical practice guidelines: autoimmune hepatitis [^abcccee6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a relatively rare acute or chronic liver disease of unknown etiology characterized by large heterogeneity. Its distribution is global, covering all ages, both sexes and all ethnic groups. The aim of the present Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) of the Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver was to provide updated guidance and help to gastroenterologists, hepatologists, internists and general practitioners for AIH diagnosis and management. AIH diagnosis is based on clinicopathological characteristics: namely, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, particularly of immunoglobulin G (IgG), circulating autoantibodies, interface hepatitis on liver histology, absence of viral hepatitis, and a favorable response to immunosuppression. Clinical manifestations at disease onset are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to the acute/severe form. Aminotransferase and bilirubin levels vary, while the presence of hepatitis at the histological level is a prerequisite for diagnosis. Autoantibodies are the hallmark for AIH diagnosis; therefore, the CPG describe the appropriate serological algorithm for their detection. AIH therapy should aim to achieve complete biochemical (normalization of IgG and aminotransferases) and histological remission. All patients who have active disease, even those with cirrhosis, should be treated with individualized and response-guided induction therapy using prednisolone in combination with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil as first-line therapy. Immunosuppression should be given for at least 3 years and for at least 2 years after the achievement of complete biochemical response, while a liver biopsy should be recommended before treatment discontinuation. Current CPG are also provided for several specific conditions and difficult-to-treat patients.

Recommendations Section H

1. We recommend budesonide as an option in non-cirrhotic adult patients with significant prednisolone-associated AEs. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak.

2. We recommend mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as an option in those who are intolerant of azathioprine, and who are aking active steps not conceive. Grade of evidence: moderate. Strength of recommendation: weak.

3. We recommend that in patients responding inadequately to azathioprine despite treatment optimisation, tacrolimus might be more effective as a rescue therapy, but MMF can also be considered owing to its better side-effect profile. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: weak.

4. We recommend that second/third-line therapies, other than MMF and tacrolimus, require specific expertise: specialist input should be sought prior to their use. Grade of evidence: low. Strength of recommendation: strong.

Section I. Longer-term management

AIH is usually a lifelong disease, which (in the absence of a clear precipitant) rarely disappears, and which many patients will live with for several decades. Although occasional patients have been labelled as 'burnt-out' AIH, the rate of long-term spontaneous disease remission seems low. Thus, follow-up should be lifelong, with the aims of:

Limiting progression of liver injury by minimising relapse rate and fibrosis progression.
Maximising patient well-being: minimising adverse treatment effects and optimising quality of life (Section L).

### Autoimmune hepatitis presenting as acute liver failure: a 20-year retrospective review of north America [^854cca5e]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a common cause of acute liver failure. Treatment includes steroids for acute liver injury and liver transplantation in those who fail to respond or develop acute liver failure. The aim of this study is to further characterize acute liver failure secondary to autoimmune hepatitis and identify variables that predict 21-day transplant-free survival. This study included adults hospitalized with acute liver failure enrolled in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group Registry between 1998 and 2019 from 32 centers within the US. The etiology of all cases was reviewed by the Adjudication Committee, and all cases identified as autoimmune hepatitis were included. Acute liver injury was defined as an INR ≥ 2.0 without encephalopathy and acute liver failure as INR ≥ 1.5 with encephalopathy. Laboratory and clinical data were reviewed. Variables significantly associated with 21-day transplant-free survival were used to develop a multivariable logistic regression model. A total of 193 cases of acute liver failure secondary to autoimmune hepatitis were identified and reviewed. There were 161 patients (83.4%) diagnosed with acute liver failure on enrollment, and 32 (16.6%) developed acute liver failure during hospitalization. At 21 days, 115 (59.6%) underwent liver transplantation, 28 (14.5%) had transplant-free survival, and 46 (23.8%) died before liver transplantation. Higher admission values of bilirubin, INR, and coma grade were associated with worse outcomes. A prognostic index incorporating bilirubin, INR, coma grade, and platelet count had a concordance statistic of 0.84. Acute liver failure secondary to autoimmune hepatitis is associated with a high short-term mortality. We developed a model specifically for autoimmune hepatitis that may be helpful in predicting 21-day transplant-free survival and early identification of patients in need of expedited liver transplant evaluation.

Guidance statements — autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) drug withdrawal and monitoring: Drug withdrawal and achievement of a long-term treatment-free remission of AIH are possible in a minority of patients and should be considered in patients who have normalized serum aminotransferase and IgG levels for at least 2 years. Liver tissue examination prior to drug withdrawal is valuable in excluding unsuspected inflammation and reducing the frequency of relapse, but it is not mandatory in adults. Patients must be closely monitored for at least 12 months after treatment withdrawal and annually thereafter to cover for lifelong risk. Relapse requires prompt reinstitution of the original treatment until biochemical remission and subsequent transition to a long-term maintenance regimen.

### Current concepts in the diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^51e71730]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive necroinflammatory liver disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Mainly affecting females, AIH has a varied clinical presentation from minor symptomatology to acute liver failure. The diagnosis should be considered in anyone with abnormal liver function tests. Diagnostic features include biochemical evidence of transaminitis, elevated IgG and positive autoantibodies. Liver biopsy may show interface hepatitis with portal-based plasma cell infiltrates. A clinical and pathological spectrum of disease exists with other autoimmune liver disease in rare cases. AIH responds promptly to immunosuppression therapy, including corticosteroids (prednis(ol)one or budesonide) with azathioprine. Treatment failure can be addressed with several second-line immunosuppressive agents. Liver transplantation remains a successful salvage therapy for acute autoimmune liver failure or treatment failure in chronic AIH complicated by synthetic dysfunction, portal hypertension or hepatocellular carcinoma.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^b642bc79]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) hepatitis management by grade is outlined as follows: For grade 1 hepatitis (AST/ALT 1–3× the upper limit of normal [ULN] or total bilirubin 1.5–3× ULN), more frequent monitoring with once or twice weekly blood draws is suggested, with or without a delay in ICI dosing. For grade 2 ICI hepatitis (AST/ALT > 3–5× ULN or total bilirubin > 1.5–3× ULN), holding ICI treatment is suggested; consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be considered and potential hepatotoxins should be discontinued if medically feasible. In symptomatic grade 2 disease, prednisone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/d or equivalent may be administered, and ICI may be resumed when recovered to grade 1 with a steroid dose of ≤ 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily; if hepatitis fails to resolve after a 1- to 2-week delay in ICI dosing, systemic glucocorticoids should be administered. For grade 3 ICI hepatitis (AST/ALT > 5–20× ULN or total bilirubin > 3–10× ULN), ICI therapy should be discontinued and glucocorticoids are generally initiated at 1–2 mg/kg/d of prednisone or equivalent with a planned 4- to 6-week taper. For patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids within 3–5 days or who have hepatitis flare during steroid taper, second-line immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus may be considered; infliximab should be used with caution in suspected ICI hepatitis. For grade 4 ICI hepatitis (AST/ALT > 20× ULN or total bilirubin > 10× ULN or hepatic decompensation), patients should be hospitalized, ICI should be permanently discontinued, and therapy started on 2 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone or equivalent with a planned 4- to 6-week taper; if there is not a drop in transaminases of at least 50% in 3 days, secondary immune suppression with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus should be started, and antithymocyte globulin should be reserved for refractory and severe cases.

Regarding medical management for autoimmune hepatitis, more specifically with respect to induction therapy, first-line, EASL 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate prednisone or prednisolone (at least 0.5 mg/kg/day, and potentially up to 1 mg/kg/day in more severe and advanced disease) in combination with azathioprine (when bilirubin is ≤ 6 mg/dL and ideally 2 weeks apart from corticosteroid initiation at an initial dose of 50 mg/day up to a final dose of 1–2 mg/kg/day) or mycophenolate mofetil (1.5–2 g/day) as first-line treatment in patients with AIH.

### Early predictors of short-term prognosis in acute and acute severe autoimmune hepatitis [^507e4b7a]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, circulating autoantibodies, and interface hepatitis with plasma cells on histology, which is usually responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. Presentation can vary from asymptomatically raised liver enzymes to jaundice and liver failure. (1, 2)

In a subset of AIH patients, hepatitis causes a decrease in excretory and synthetic function of the liver reflected by increased serum bilirubin, decreased albumin levels, and prolonged international normalized ratio (INR). Presentation with decreased liver function is termed acute presentation of AIH. Acute presentation can be divided into 2 different categories: acute autoimmune hepatitis (A‐AIH) presenting with jaundice but without coagulopathy and acute severe autoimmune hepatitis (AS‐AIH) presenting with jaundice and coagulopathy. (3) AS‐AIH can present with or without hepatic encephalopathy (AS‐AIH with or without acute liver failure). (3)

For most AIH patients, the prognosis is good with treatment with corticosteroids and thiopurines. Patients without cirrhosis have the same life expectancy as the general population. (4) However, for AS‐AIH the prognosis seems worse and reported liver transplantation (LT)‐free survival rates differ between 20% and 90%. (5, 6, 7, 8, 9) In 1988, Czaja et al. reported that no improvement of serum bilirubin after 2 weeks was a bad prognostic sign. (10) This finding was only confirmed in a cohort of 11 patients. (11) More recently, the worsening of INR was reported as a bad prognostic sign in a cohort of 17 patients. (7)

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation between liver function, improvement of liver function, and short‐term prognosis in a larger cohort of patients presenting with A‐AIH and AS‐AIH.

Drug-induced AIH-like injury — clinical course, histology, and risk thresholds: Centrilobular zone 3 necrosis may be present, and bridging fibrosis (Ishak score ≥ 4) is rare, and resolution after drug withdrawal typically occurs within 1 month (rarely 3 months). In accordance with Hy's law, serum aminotransferase levels > 3-fold upper limit of normal (ULN) and total serum bilirubin level > 2-fold ULN increase the risk of death or need for liver transplantation (LT) in 9%-12% of patients. An algorithm using serum ALT > 17.3 ULN, total serum bilirubin > 6.6 ULN, and AST:ALT > 1.5 had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 82% for drug-induced acute liver failure (ALF). Sustained biochemical resolution after glucocorticoid withdrawal supports a self-limited drug-induced liver injury, whereas recrudescence of laboratory abnormalities is consistent with AIH and should be managed as AIH with immunosuppressive therapy. Idiosyncratic drug reactions have a mortality of 5% and need for LT in 4.5%.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^db53b865]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

First-line treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in adults and children — algorithmic actions by presentation are outlined. For AIH without cirrhosis, Adults: Prednisone (20–40 mg/d) and Pediatrics: Prednisone (1–2 mg/kg/d) or budesonide (9 mg daily) are used; check TPMT and add azathioprine (AZA) (50–150 mg/d) with laboratory testing every 1–2 weeks, and assess response by 4–8 weeks with taper to 5–10 mg daily over the next 6 months if biochemical response or consider second-line drugs if not. For AIH with cirrhosis, Do not use budesonide; Adults: Prednisone (20–40 mg/d) and Pediatrics: Prednisone (1–2 mg/kg/d) are used; for AZA, Do not use in decompensated cirrhosis, while compensated cirrhosis proceeds with TPMT check, AZA (50–150 mg/d), and laboratory testing every 1–2 weeks. For acute severe AIH, Do not use budesonide and Do not use azathioprine (AZA); Adults: Prednisone (60 mg/d) and Pediatrics: Prednisone (2 mg/kg/d) or I.V. steroids are given with laboratory testing every 12–24 hours, and assess response by 7–14 days with cautious prednisone reduction and consideration of AZA after cholestasis is resolved; lack of biochemical response prompts re-evaluation, consideration of second-line drugs, and transplant evaluation, with urgent transplant evaluation if hepatic encephalopathy develops. Maintenance after biochemical remission includes laboratory testing every 3–4 months, May attempt a steroid withdrawal while continuing AZA and, after prolonged biochemical remission (24 months), laboratory testing every 4–6 months with Consider immunosuppression withdrawal if appropriate; in the severe pathway, laboratory testing every 3–4 months and Do not withdraw immunosuppression.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^a233348a]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) practice guidance — purpose and scope states that the objectives are to provide guidance in the diagnosis and management of AIH based on current evidence and expert opinion and to present guidelines to clinically relevant questions based on systematic reviews. Guideline recommendations were based on evidence derived from systematic reviews and supported, if appropriate, by meta-analyses conducted independently by the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center, with findings analyzed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts who rated the quality of evidence and determined the strength of each recommendation. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to categorize each recommendation as strong or conditional. The recommendations address glucocorticoid and azathioprine therapy as first-line management, second-line medications after failure of first-line therapy, and maintenance management after liver transplantation, and the scope includes adults and children.

Conclusively, despite the low level of evidence, the available data indicate that all patients with acute/severe AIH should be considered for a corticosteroid trial at the earliest opportunity (the sooner the better), using high doses of prednisolone (> 1 mg/kg/day) intravenously. Failure to improve within 7 days should lead to emergency listing for liver transplantation. The prophylactic use of antibiotics/antifungals is not supported by the most recent studies, but they should be kept in mind and may be justified at an individualized basis.

The other form of treatment failure without intense severity is characterized by minimal, or even no improvement in the clinical and biochemical parameters after several weeks of standard regimen, despite confirmation of diagnosis and treatment adherence. In these patients, determination of active azathioprine metabolites, such as thioguanine nucleotides (TGN), could be helpful in revealing a lack of adherence to treatment or an altered azathioprine metabolism, although the therapeutic range of TGN levels is not precisely known in AIH. As endorsed by EASL, AASLD and the British Society of Gastroenterology GPG, an increase of prednisolone for at least one month and azathioprine to the maximum doses (1 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively) seems rational. However, despite this intense treatment strategy, most patients may not respond, while they carry increased risks for drug-related side-effects. Therefore, management by expert centers should be suggested as soon as possible for these patients.

### Second-line and third-line therapy for autoimmune hepatitis: a position statement from the European reference network on hepatological diseases and the international autoimmune hepatitis group [^2802ae76]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Most patients with autoimmune hepatitis respond well to standard immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and azathioprine, and while untreated disease is usually fatal, patients who respond well to therapy have an excellent prognosis. However, insufficient response to standard therapy or intolerable side effects requiring dose adaptions or treatment changes occur in 10–20% of patients. While there is fairly good agreement on second-line treatment options, there is very wide variation in the indication and use of possible third-line therapies. Herein, the European Reference Network on Hepatological Diseases (ERN RARE-LIVER) and the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) outline a treatment algorithm for both children and adults that should help to standardise treatment approaches, in order to improve patient care and to enable the comparison of treatment results between scientific publications.

### British society of gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines for management of autoimmune hepatitis [^6fdad6a0]. Gut (2011). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver disease which, if untreated, often leads to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Major advances were made in its management based on controlled trials performed in England and the USA in the 1970s and 1980s. Unfortunately, in recent decades there has been a dearth of controlled clinical trials and, thus, many questions regarding the optimal management of this disease remain unanswered. Many promising newer immunosuppressive therapies await formal comparison with standard therapies and also many important details in relation to the application of standard therapies remain unclear. These guidelines describe the optimal management strategies in adults based on available published evidence, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AIH published in 2002 and recently updated.

Discussion

This case series is illustrative of three children with sJIA who developed acute hepatitis while being treated with IL1RA. Clinical and laboratory data, as well as liver biopsy, were not characteristic of MAS. Biopsies instead suggested hepatocellular injury from an exogenous cause, be it infectious or chemical (Figure 1). The presence of eosinophils in two of the three liver biopsies may also support an exogenous trigger contributing to the hepatitis. A viral trigger may have contributed to development of hepatitis in two patients, although serologies for viruses known to induce hepatitis were negative (Table 1). We are then left with a serious adverse event coincident with IL1RA treatment and reversed upon discontinuation of the drug. This suggests that IL-1 blockade contributed to the development or propagation of these patients' liver injury.

The clinical history of these patients underscores our lack of understanding of the influence of IL-1 blockade on the natural history of sJIA. Hepatitis could occur due to four potentially overlapping mechanisms. First, pure drug toxicity from anakinra appears possible, but unlikely given the absence of prior reports of hepatitis with anakinra therapy, the variable time to onset of hepatitis, and the tolerance of restarting IL1RA in two patients. Second, induction of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) by the use of a biologic agent is possible, but also appears unlikely in the absence of specific autoantibodies or histopathological features associated with AIH. Third, immune dysregulation induced by IL1RA in children with sJIA could lead to hepatitis upon exposure to a normally benign infectious or environmental trigger. Fourth, IL1RA could change the clinical manifestations of MAS flare in some patients with sJIA leading only to acute hepatitis instead of the full MAS phenotype.
