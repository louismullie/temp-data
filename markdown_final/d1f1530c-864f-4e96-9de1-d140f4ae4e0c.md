## Question

Hepatoaplenomegaly with elevated retic count, ascites,.no schistocytes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step differential diagnosis and diagnostic approach to hepatosplenomegaly with an elevated reticulocyte count and ascites in the absence of schistocytes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the syndrome with targeted imaging, hemolysis labs, and ascitic fluid analysis. Then, I should organize a pathophysiology-driven differential that links portal hypertension and hemolysis. Next, I will lay out a phased diagnostic algorithm from initial evaluation to targeted and advanced testing. Finally, I will compare leading etiologies, anticipate pitfalls, and outline immediate management and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome rigorously, because anchoring too early can mislead. I should verify hepatosplenomegaly with abdominal ultrasound as first line and add Doppler to assess portal and hepatic venous flow, since this simultaneously confirms organ enlargement and screens for portal hypertensive physiology or thrombosis [^11195uWp]. I need to confirm ascites on exam and imaging, then perform a diagnostic paracentesis with serum ascites albumin gradient to establish portal hypertensive versus non portal etiologies, and obtain cell count with differential to screen for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with the 250 cells per mm³ polymorphonuclear threshold, sending culture and considering cytology if malignancy is suspected [^1153r1oP] [^117NWCVk] [^113Uq3Zz]. The elevated reticulocyte count points toward hemolysis or blood loss; I should document the absolute reticulocyte count and corrected reticulocyte index, while the absence of schistocytes argues against microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, but wait, I should not overstate this because rare MAHA can be patchy on single smear and requires correlation with LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, and clinical context, so I should confirm with a full hemolysis panel and direct antiglobulin test rather than exclude MAHA solely on smear.

> Next, I should review baseline laboratories and staging data to ground the differential. I will order a CBC with differential and careful peripheral smear interpretation, haptoglobin, LDH, indirect and direct bilirubin, and a direct antiglobulin test to classify immune versus non immune hemolysis, while checking a comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, albumin, and INR to assess hepatic synthetic function and cholestasis, since portal hypertension can be cirrhotic, presinusoidal, or noncirrhotic and these parameters guide where to look next. I should also obtain hepatitis B and C serologies to exclude common viral causes of chronic liver disease, and I need to ensure the ascitic fluid analysis includes culture and cytology when indicated by pretest probability, because missing malignant ascites would alter the trajectory entirely [^113Uq3Zz] [^1153r1oP] [^1115uioo].

> Now, let me construct a tiered differential that fits the triad of hepatosplenomegaly, ascites indicating portal hypertension, and reticulocytosis suggesting hemolysis. First, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders such as primary myelofibrosis, post PV or ET myelofibrosis, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and other lymphomas can cause massive splenomegaly via extramedullary hematopoiesis and may drive noncirrhotic portal hypertension through nodular regenerative hyperplasia or hepatic infiltration, with leukoerythroblastic smear features and cytopenias variably present [^113c2N2a] [^114Mjzsz] [^114f29ho] [^114jo4Wg]. Second, I must consider tropical and parasitic infections based on geography and exposure, especially hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly where malaria smears and RDTs are often negative and PCR is needed, and presinusoidal portal hypertension from schistosomiasis that yields hepatosplenomegaly and ascites with eosinophilia in many cohorts of refugees from endemic regions [^114bfy2M] [^111cc8FV] [^111p1KcP]. Third, hereditary hemolytic anemias such as beta thalassemia intermedia or major can produce chronic hemolysis with reticulocytosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, organomegaly, and portal hypertensive physiology over time, particularly with iron overload, though I need to check the age and history to align likelihoods [^114vKEuP]. Fourth, vascular and noncirrhotic portal hypertension entities including Budd Chiari and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension should be kept in view, especially given the known associations of INCPH and nodular regenerative hyperplasia with hematologic disorders, and the frequent absence of advanced fibrosis despite significant portal pressures [^1128E1xf] [^116H9Wm2] [^113c2N2a].

> I will now outline the initial workup that every patient with this constellation should have so we do not miss reversible or dangerous processes. Ultrasound with Doppler of the portal and hepatic veins can rapidly identify or exclude flow obstruction and characterize splenic size while also guiding safe paracentesis if needed, and it sets the stage for further vascular imaging if thrombosis is suspected [^11195uWp]. Diagnostic paracentesis should include serum ascites albumin gradient to define portal hypertension, cell count with differential to assess for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and culture, while cytology becomes important when malignant ascites is in the differential, because conflation of malignant and portal hypertensive ascites leads to mismanagement [^1153r1oP] [^117NWCVk] [^113Uq3Zz]. If there is any malaria exposure risk by history or demographics, I need to obtain malaria PCR even if smears or RDTs are negative, because HMS is frequently smear negative and PCR shifts the post test probability substantially in endemic cohort analyses [^114bfy2M] [^111cc8FV].

> In the targeted testing phase, I should let the hemolysis and general results guide hematology diagnostics. If the DAT is positive, I will evaluate for warm or cold autoimmune hemolysis and immediately screen for secondary causes like CLL or lymphoma with flow cytometry and cross sectional imaging as indicated, because secondary AIHA can unmask lymphoproliferative disease that itself could explain splenomegaly and portal hypertension via several mechanisms [^114vKEuP]. If hemolysis is confirmed without immune markers or the smear is leukoerythroblastic or shows teardrops and nucleated red cells, I should prioritize a bone marrow biopsy with reticulin fibrosis grading, add JAK2 V617F, CALR, and MPL mutation testing, and include lymphoid flow cytometry, because myelofibrosis and indolent lymphomas are leading causes of massive splenomegaly and often require tissue diagnosis to proceed, and splenectomy is sometimes used diagnostically when noninvasive workup remains nonrevealing [^115XfgHy] [^114Mjzsz]. If the patient is from or has exposure in endemic regions, I should obtain malaria PCR and schistosoma serology with eosinophil count, and I should consider empiric praziquantel where pretest probability is high and other causes are excluded, because co infection is common and contributes to presinusoidal portal hypertension and massive splenomegaly in several cohorts [^111p1KcP] [^114bfy2M] [^111cc8FV].

> For advanced evaluation of portal hypertension, I need to check that the SAAG is at least 1.1 g per dL to confirm portal hypertension and then determine whether the liver parenchyma is cirrhotic or noncirrhotic. If noncirrhotic disease is suspected, transient elastography and, when necessary, a liver biopsy can differentiate idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension and nodular regenerative hyperplasia from cirrhosis, remembering that NRH shows micronodularity with minimal fibrosis and is strongly linked to hematologic disorders, and I should choose a transjugular route when coagulopathy or ascites is significant [^1128E1xf] [^113c2N2a] [^115gxico]. I should also obtain contrast enhanced cross sectional imaging of the portal and hepatic veins to exclude portal vein thrombosis or hepatic vein outflow obstruction, since Budd Chiari and portal vein thrombosis change management pathways, and I can consider hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement in equivocal cases or when hemodynamic staging will alter therapy [^1128E1xf] [^1153r1oP].

> Let me distinguish between two top contenders that fit the triad: myelofibrosis and hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly. Myelofibrosis typically presents in older adults with constitutional symptoms, a leukoerythroblastic smear, teardrop forms, and driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL, with splenomegaly often massive from extramedullary hematopoiesis and portal hypertension that may be noncirrhotic, sometimes due to nodular regenerative hyperplasia, whereas malaria PCR is negative and DAT is usually negative unless there is coincident AIHA [^114Mjzsz] [^113c2N2a] [^113dVtF3]. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly is anchored by residency or prolonged exposure in endemic regions, very large spleens, anemia with reticulocytosis driven by splenic retention of mostly uninfected red cells, often negative thick and thin smears and low sensitivity RDTs, with PCR frequently positive and sometimes high IgM anti malarial titers, and presinusoidal portal hypertension can occur with or without schistosomal co infection [^117BDY1Z] [^114bfy2M] [^111cc8FV] [^111p1KcP]. Hold on, I should verify travel, refugee status, and exposure timelines carefully because brief exposure can sometimes precipitate HMS in susceptible hosts, but chronic antigenic stimulation is more typical in cohort descriptions [^117AiwJm].

> Turning to immediate management and safety, I need to ensure complications of portal hypertension and ascites are addressed while the diagnostic workup proceeds. If ascites is present, I should follow guideline based care including diagnostic paracentesis to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis at baseline and targeted repeat testing if fevers, encephalopathy, renal dysfunction, or gastrointestinal bleeding develop, and I should consider cytology where appropriate, because early identification of infection or malignancy changes outcomes and prevents delays in disease directed therapy [^117NWCVk] [^115cQmtD] [^113Uq3Zz]. If hairy cell leukemia or selected lymphomas are diagnosed with predominant splenic disease and low marrow involvement, splenectomy remains a valid initial therapy in carefully chosen patients, with vaccination and infection prophylaxis per asplenia protocols, while myelofibrosis management is individualized and often involves JAK inhibitor therapy, symptom directed splenectomy or radiotherapy in select cases, and transplant evaluation when appropriate, though I should weigh cytopenia risks carefully before cytoreductive therapies [^114jo4Wg] [^114Mjzsz] [^116Wcq85]. If HMS is suspected or confirmed, I should treat with appropriate antimalarials and ensure primaquine is provided when eligible after G6PD testing to eradicate hypnozoites, and I should consider retreatment with praziquantel in those with eosinophilia or positive schistosoma serology and compatible exposure, counseling on avoidance of contact sports due to rupture risk and ensuring close follow up because persistence beyond six months is not uncommon in refugee cohorts [^114bfy2M] [^116kXyjH] [^116Wcq85].

> I should also acknowledge potential pitfalls and correct early assumptions. Initially I might be tempted to say the absence of schistocytes excludes microangiopathic hemolysis, but wait, I should double check because MAHA can be intermittent on smear and requires integrated assessment with LDH, haptoglobin, creatinine, platelets, and clinical features before exclusion, so the smear alone is insufficient for a hard rule out in all cases, although the probability is indeed lower without schistocytes [^114vKEuP]. Hereditary spherocytosis would more typically show spherocytes rather than schistocytes with reticulocytosis and a negative DAT, so the smear pattern matters here, whereas congenital dyserythropoietic anemias usually have reticulocytopenia from ineffective erythropoiesis and thus are discordant with the current reticulocytosis, which helps deprioritize them in this scenario [^114vKEuP] [^111Cfjqo]. I should keep hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis on the radar with organomegaly and cytopenias, but the hemolysis signature in HLH is typically not brisk reticulocytosis and ferritin, triglycerides, and soluble IL 2 receptor levels would be critical if clinical suspicion arises, preventing misattribution of cytopenias to hypersplenism alone [^114mNqE7] [^11169Pwd].

> Finally, let me synthesize actionable next steps so nothing critical is missed. I will obtain abdominal ultrasound with Doppler to confirm hepatosplenomegaly and assess portal and hepatic venous flow, perform diagnostic paracentesis with serum ascites albumin gradient, cell count with differential, culture, and cytology if malignant ascites is suspected, and order a hemolysis panel including haptoglobin, LDH, indirect and direct bilirubin, and a direct antiglobulin test with expert peripheral smear review, followed by targeted malaria PCR and schistosoma serology with eosinophil count if exposure risk exists, and I will escalate to bone marrow biopsy with myeloproliferative driver mutation testing and flow cytometry if non immune hemolysis is present or hematologic malignancy is suspected, while arranging cross sectional vascular imaging of the portal system if Doppler is inconclusive or thrombosis is suspected, and I will manage ascites per guidelines while planning vaccinations and precautions if splenectomy becomes diagnostic or therapeutic [^11195uWp] [^1153r1oP] [^117NWCVk] [^113Uq3Zz] [^114bfy2M] [^111cc8FV] [^115XfgHy].

Most likely causes of hepatosplenomegaly with an elevated reticulocyte count, ascites, and no schistocytes are **chronic hemolytic anemias** (especially hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and **portal hypertension** due to chronic liver disease [^116Wcq85] or myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114vKEuP]. The elevated reticulocyte count indicates **hemolysis** [^114vKEuP] or marrow stress, while the absence of schistocytes argues against **microangiopathic hemolytic anemia**. Ascites suggests **portal hypertension** or hypoalbuminemia. Evaluation should include CBC, reticulocyte count, LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, Coombs test, liver function tests, and imaging (ultrasound/CT/MRI) to assess liver/spleen size and portal flow [^11195uWp]. Consider bone marrow biopsy if a myeloproliferative disorder is suspected [^114Mjzsz].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several pathophysiological mechanisms can account for the combination of hepatosplenomegaly, an elevated reticulocyte count, and ascites without schistocytes:

- **Chronic hemolytic anemia**: Chronic hemolysis leads to increased erythropoietic activity, causing elevated reticulocyte counts and extramedullary hematopoiesis, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly. Ascites may develop secondary to portal hypertension or hypoalbuminemia [^114vKEuP].

- **Portal hypertension**: Chronic liver disease or vascular disorders can cause portal hypertension, leading to hepatosplenomegaly and ascites [^1153r1oP]. Elevated reticulocyte counts may result from hypersplenism-induced hemolysis or marrow stress [^112yqVXD].

- **Myeloproliferative neoplasms**: Conditions such as primary myelofibrosis or chronic myeloid leukemia can cause hepatosplenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, elevated reticulocyte counts, and ascites secondary to portal hypertension or hypoalbuminemia [^114vKEuP] [^113c2N2a].

## Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes [^114vKEuP]:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Hemolytic anemia | - Hereditary spherocytosis <br/> - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia <br/> - Thalassemia <br/> - Sickle cell disease [^112r5jWp] |
| Liver disease | - Cirrhosis <br/> - Chronic hepatitis <br/> - Portal hypertension <br/> - Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) [^1153r1oP] |
| Myeloproliferative neoplasms | - Primary myelofibrosis <br/> - Chronic myeloid leukemia <br/> - Polycythemia vera [^114Mjzsz] |
| Infectious diseases | - Malaria <br/> - Schistosomiasis <br/> - Leishmaniasis <br/> - Tuberculosis [^114vKEuP] |
| Storage disorders | - Gaucher disease <br/> - Niemann-Pick disease <br/> - Amyloidosis [^113xyBma] |

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the cause:

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, bilirubin levels, direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test, liver function tests, viral hepatitis serologies, and autoimmune markers [^114vKEuP].

- **Imaging studies**: Abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to assess liver and spleen size, portal vein patency, and presence of ascites [^11195uWp].

- **Bone marrow biopsy**: Indicated if myeloproliferative neoplasm or infiltrative disorder is suspected [^114Mjzsz].

- **Ascitic fluid analysis**: Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG), total protein, cell count, and cytology to differentiate between portal hypertension-related and other causes of ascites [^1153r1oP] [^1139aLyw].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated reticulocyte count without schistocytes

An elevated reticulocyte count without schistocytes indicates increased erythropoiesis due to **chronic hemolysis** [^114vKEuP] or marrow stress, rather than acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). This pattern narrows the differential to chronic hemolytic conditions, liver disease with hypersplenism [^112yqVXD], or myeloproliferative disorders [^114Mjzsz].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the underlying cause:

- **Hemolytic anemia**: Treat underlying cause (e.g. corticosteroids for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis), supportive care (transfusions, folic acid supplementation) [^112r5jWp].

- **Liver disease**: Manage portal hypertension (beta-blockers, diuretics, paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [TIPS]), treat underlying liver disease (antiviral therapy, abstinence from alcohol) [^1153r1oP].

- **Myeloproliferative neoplasms**: Cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea, JAK2 inhibitors), supportive care, splenectomy or splenic irradiation if indicated [^114Mjzsz].

- **Infectious diseases**: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy (antimalarials, antiparasitics, antibiotics) [^1125SMvX].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis and complications **vary by the underlying condition**. For hemolytic anemia, outcomes are generally good with appropriate management, but complications include gallstones, iron overload, and anemia-related symptoms [^112r5jWp]. For liver disease, prognosis depends on the severity and reversibility of hepatic injury; complications include variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and renal dysfunction [^1153r1oP]. For myeloproliferative neoplasms, prognosis is determined by disease subtype and treatment response; complications include progression to acute leukemia, severe anemia, and thrombotic events [^114Mjzsz].

---

Hepatosplenomegaly with an elevated reticulocyte count, ascites, and no schistocytes suggests chronic hemolytic anemia, portal hypertension, or myeloproliferative neoplasms [^114vKEuP]. A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential to identify the underlying cause and guide management [^1153r1oP].

### Splenomegaly: Diagnosis and management in adults [^116Wcq85]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Splenomegaly can be due to several mechanisms but is almost always a sign of a systemic condition. Patient habits, travel, and medical conditions can increase the risk of splenomegaly and suggest etiology. Symptoms can indicate infectious, malignant, hepatic, or hematologic causes. Physical examination will typically reveal splenomegaly, but abdominal ultrasonography is recommended for confirmation. The examination should also assess for signs of systemic illness, liver disease, and anemia or other hematologic issues.

The most common causes of splenomegaly in the United States are liver disease, malignancy, and infection. Except for apparent causes such as infectious mononucleosis, basic laboratory analysis and ultrasonography are the first-line steps in determining etiology. Malaria and schistosomiasis are common in tropical regions, where as many as 80% of people may have splenomegaly. Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Splenectomies and spleen reduction therapies are sometimes performed.

Any patient with limited splenic function requires increased vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics for procedures involving the respiratory tract. Acute infections, anemia, and splenic rupture are the most common complications of splenomegaly, and people with splenomegaly should refrain from participating in contact sports to decrease the risk of rupture.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^111Cfjqo]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

A full blood count typically reveals moderate macrocytic anaemia, with a haemoglobin (Hb) level of 66–116 g/l (mean 92 g/l), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 100–120, and reticulocytopenia, although 30% of cases have a normal MCV. There are reports of transient neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, but these lineages are generally unaffected. The hallmark of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I (CDA‐I) is an absolute or relative reticulocytopenia, indicative of ineffective erythropoiesis.

Ineffective erythropoiesis was originally demonstrated using ferrokinetic studies, where the fraction of 59 Fe present in peripheral red blood cells is calculated two weeks post‐intravenous infusion. Where erythropoiesis is effective, such as when anaemia occurs due to bleeding, iron deficiency, or haemolysis, the fraction of red cells containing 59 Fe is approximately 75–80%. However, in ineffective erythropoiesis, it may be as low as 25–30%.

Recently, a new clinical index called the bone marrow responsiveness index (BMRI) has been developed to differentiate haemolytic anaemia from ineffective erythropoiesis. This index is defined as: [(absolute reticulocyte count) × (patient Hb/normal Hb)] and was shown to be a highly sensitive parameter (90.4%) for achieving a clinical diagnosis of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II (CDA‐II). This metric is likely useful in CDA‐I but is yet to be formally validated in this disease.

The blood film is markedly abnormal, displaying anisocytosis and various poikilocytes, including teardrops, ovalocytes, elliptocytes, microspherocytes, and irregular forms.

### How I treat symptomatic splenomegaly in patients with myelofibrosis [^114Mjzsz]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Managing patients with myelofibrosis (MF), whether they have primary MF or their MF has evolved from antecedent polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, presents numerous challenges to the hematologist. MF patients experience a range of debilitating disease manifestations, such as massive splenomegaly, cytopenias, constitutional symptoms, and transformation to a treatment-refractory blast phase. Although a cure is potentially achievable through allogeneic stem cell transplantation, this therapy is either inappropriate or not feasible for most patients. Therefore, remaining therapies are palliative but can be of significant value to some MF patients.

The management of symptomatic splenomegaly, in particular, remains one of the most perplexing aspects of MF clinical care. Utilizing medications is the simplest approach for reducing splenomegaly; however, achieving a symptomatic response without undue myelosuppression is challenging. Splenectomy or radiotherapy can offer benefits, but careful patient selection and close monitoring are essential due to the potential for dangerous adverse effects. Experimental medical therapies, such as JAK2 inhibitors, show promise and may soon play an important role in the management of symptomatic splenomegaly in MF patients. The future care of MF patients, including splenomegaly management, will continue to require hematologists to select therapeutic options carefully in the context of realistic, achievable goals.

### Nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver: An under-recognized cause of portal hypertension in hematological disorders [^113c2N2a]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension has been described in a wide variety of hematological disorders, especially myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders. Its clinical manifestations may include bleeding esophageal varices, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy. In patients with hematological disorders, there are a number of potential causes of portal hypertension, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver (NRH). This lesion is characterized by diffuse replacement of normal hepatic parenchyma by multiple small nodules composed of regenerating hepatocytes with minimal or no fibrosis. This lack of fibrosis distinguishes NRH from cirrhosis. Unlike cirrhosis, NRH only rarely results in compromised hepatic synthetic function. The major manifestation is portal hypertension related to increased resistance to blood flow within hepatic sinusoids.

NRH has been linked to a variety of systemic diseases, including collagen vascular diseases, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders, as well as various medications. Although NRH is commonly associated with blood dyscrasias, the diagnosis is often overlooked because of the complexity and wide differential diagnosis of liver diseases in the setting of hematological malignancy. We review herein nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver, including aspects of epidemiology, pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment. We highlight its association with different forms of hematological disease, aiming to increase awareness of this entity among internists and treating hematologists/oncologists.

### Pathology updates and diagnostic approaches to haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [^114mNqE7]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a complex, often under-recognized hyperinflammatory immune dysregulation syndrome arising in a diverse range of clinical scenarios and conditions. The accurate and timely diagnosis of HLH is crucial for patient survival and usually requires a high level of clinical suspicion.

The histological corollary to clinical HLH — haemophagocytosis — is neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of HLH, as it may be seen in a variety of reactive conditions and may be absent in true HLH. Nevertheless, the finding of haemophagocytosis in specific clinical situations should prompt consideration of HLH and further testing to exclude the condition.

Although haemophagocytosis is traditionally described in bone marrow, identification of it in other tissues, including lymphoid, splenic, liver, or neural tissue, can contribute importantly to the overall recognition of HLH. In this review, we discuss the underlying pathophysiology and aetiologies of HLH, the morphological aspects of haemophagocytosis, and its associated histological findings in different tissues, and provide a brief overview of diagnostic criteria and clinical evaluation.

### Unresolved splenomegaly in recently resettled Congolese refugees - multiple states, 2015–2018 [^114bfy2M]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Few data, beyond anecdotal clinician reports, exist on tropical splenomegaly, and patients' anticipated clinical course is still largely unknown, particularly after relocation to nontropical environments. In contrast to what has been reported previously, many of the patients in this report had persistent splenomegaly long after arrival, despite receipt of a short course of malaria treatment and removal from an area with endemic malaria, indicating that the clinical course of tropical splenomegaly is still poorly understood. Malaria might still be the predominant underlying etiology, particularly given the presence of species including P. vivax and P. ovale, which can cause relapsing disease in some refugees. The original recommendation remains unchanged: all refugees of Congolese origin with splenomegaly should receive presumptive treatment with primaquine after arrival in the United States. Despite this recommendation, two-thirds of refugees identified with splenomegaly in this investigation did not receive primaquine. Lack of awareness among domestic physicians, need for repeated visits for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing, a long (14-day) course, safety concerns, and availability of primaquine might have contributed to inconsistent administration.

The majority of patients with persistent splenomegaly had some combination of hematologic abnormalities, potentially caused by splenic sequestration. Many patients also had elevated liver transaminases, suggesting a need to monitor hepatic complications in this population.

### Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of nodular lesions of the spleen in hematology clinical practice [^113i1puR]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Nodular splenic lesions are often found incidentally in otherwise healthy patients during routine imaging, and only in a minority of cases are they accompanied by symptoms such as vague abdominal or left hypochondriac discomfort. Solitary or multiple solid nodules may indicate benign or malignant processes involving the spleen. The malignant group is heterogeneous, encompassing dendritic/reticulum cell sarcomas, epithelial metastases of neoplasms originating outside of the spleen, and hematologic malignancies. Among lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disorders, focal splenic lesions are generally common despite any detectable organ enlargement. They frequently present synchronously with other manifestations of the underlying disease, such as superficial or abdominal lymphadenopathies or peripheral blood alterations, mainly lymphocytosis. Single or multiple solid nodules of the spleen may be the unique manifestation of a neoplastic process involving the spleen, albeit much more rarely, and may be encountered in hematological everyday clinical practice.

If, on one hand, splenectomy has represented the gold standard for histopathological diagnosis, particularly if a suspicion of malignant localization to the spleen is very likely, on the other hand, imaging-guided core needle biopsy of the spleen represents an ideal strategy to obtain an adequate amount of tissue from the lesion, thus avoiding splenectomy. This procedure allows the preservation of the immunologic function of this organ, should the patient require any subsequent chemotherapy.

### The diagnostic utility of splenectomy in idiopathic splenomegaly [^115XfgHy]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

With increasing frequency, patients with idiopathic splenomegaly are referred to surgeons for splenectomy. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of splenectomy and the feasibility of a minimally invasive approach in the face of idiopathic splenomegaly.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 68 patients who underwent splenectomy for idiopathic splenomegaly. The primary endpoint was the rate of definitive diagnosis based on final surgical pathology of the removed spleen.

- **Results**: Preoperative workup included a bone marrow biopsy and peripheral blood smear in 93% and 100% of patients, respectively, with none having lymphadenopathy warranting biopsy. Splenectomy provided a definitive diagnosis for 44 (64.7%) patients. Of these, 34 (50%) patients had an underlying malignancy, with more than half being splenic marginal zone lymphoma. There were 33 (48.5%) laparoscopic, 23 (33.8%) open, 10 (14.7%) laparoscopic converted to open, and two (2.9%) laparoscopic hand-assist cases. Conversion to open occurred due to splenic size (median craniocaudal length 21.8 cm) in eight cases and staple line bleeding at the splenic hilum in two patients. Overall, the laparoscopic approach was completed in patients with a smaller splenic size compared to open (median craniocaudal length 15.2 vs. 26.0 cm, p < 0.0001). The open group had one (1.5%) intra-operative mortality due to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Thirty-day complication rates were similar for laparoscopic and open approaches (p = 0.10).

- **Conclusion**: Splenectomy is an effective diagnostic modality in determining a pathologic cause for splenomegaly.

### Assessing splenomegaly: Automated volumetric analysis of the spleen [^114Wifki]. Academic Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

To define systematic volumetric thresholds to identify and grade splenomegaly, and retrospectively evaluate the performance of radiologists in assessing splenomegaly in computed tomography (CT) image data, a clinical tool was developed to segment spleens from 172 contrast-enhanced clinical CT studies. These studies included 45 normal and 127 splenomegaly cases confirmed by radiological reports.

Spleen volumes were compared to manual measurements using overlap/error. Volumetric thresholds for mild and massive splenomegaly were defined at 1 and 2.5 standard deviations above the average splenic volume of the healthy population, respectively. These thresholds were validated against consensus reports, and the performance of radiologists in assessing splenomegaly was retrospectively evaluated.

- **Results**: The automated segmentation of spleens demonstrated robustness with volume overlap/error of 95.2% and 3.3%, respectively. No significant differences (P > .2) were found between manual and automated segmentations for either normal or splenomegaly subgroups. Comparable correlations between interobserver and manual-automated measurements were observed (r = 0.99 for all).

- **Findings**: The average volume of normal spleens was 236.89 ± 77.58 mL, while the average volume for splenomegaly was 1004.75 ± 644.27 mL. Volumetric thresholds of 314.47 mL for mild splenomegaly and 430.84 mL for massive splenomegaly were established (± 18.86 mL, 95% CI). Radiologists disagreed in 23.25% (n = 40) of the diagnosed cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the volumetric criterion for splenomegaly detection was 0.96.

### Hypersplenism [^112yqVXD]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Cytopenias in liver disease are a common finding. In the past, they have mostly been attributed to pooling and/or destruction of blood cells in the enlarged spleen, leading to the term 'hypersplenism'. With recent advances in the understanding of the physiology of blood formation, particularly with the discovery of several haematopoietic growth factors, new insights into the pathophysiology of blood cell derangements in liver disease have been obtained. Recombinant haematopoietic growth factors present new opportunities for the support of the haematopoietic system, which is required due to toxic antiviral therapies or surgical interventions in these patients.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^116kXyjH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Splenomegaly persisted after arrival among many of these patients despite information available in the published literature and common belief that resolution would follow malaria treatment and removal from a malaria-endemic area. Associated hematologic conditions, particularly anemia and thrombocytopenia, were more common in refugees with persistent splenomegaly than controls included in this cohort. Clinicians caring for these patients at both predeparture and post-arrival visits should be aware of the apparent high prevalence of splenomegaly in Congolese refugees and assume a high pretest probability, particularly among family members of patients known to have splenomegaly. Patients identified with splenomegaly should be treated with primaquine, if eligible.

- **Retreatment with praziquantel**: Consider in patients with persistent, unexplained eosinophilia or other signs or symptoms of schistosomiasis while considering other causes of eosinophilia. Patients should also be counseled on the condition and precautions (e.g. avoidance of contact sports), followed closely, and referred for specialty care if they fail to respond to treatment. Multiple etiologies of persistent splenomegaly in this population are possible, but there is likely a predominant underlying infection and immune response. Future investigations may further reveal associated pathologies and etiologies of tropical splenomegaly in this population.

It is generally agreed that if patients with MF have no symptoms, a wait-and-see approach is a reasonable option, with treatment being delayed until significant changes are observed. It is likely that such a conservative approach will change as soon as more effective therapies for the disease become available. The above wait-and-see policy also applies to asymptomatic splenomegaly, especially considering that MF patients often have cytopenias that may worsen following treatment initiation.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^112Cd1bE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Tropical splenomegaly is often associated with malaria and schistosomiasis. In 2014 and 2015, 145 Congolese refugees in western Uganda diagnosed with splenomegaly during pre-departure medical examinations underwent enhanced screening for various etiologies. After anecdotal reports of unresolved splenomegaly and complications upon U.S. arrival, patients were reassessed to describe long-term clinical progression after arrival in the United States. Post-arrival medical information was obtained through medical chart abstraction in collaboration with state health partners in nine participating states.

We evaluated observed splenomegaly duration and associated clinical sequelae between 130 case patients from eastern Congo and 102 controls through adjusted hierarchical Poisson models, accounting for familial clustering. Of the 130 case patients, 95 (73.1%) had detectable splenomegaly after arrival. Of the 85 patients with records beyond 6 months, 45 (52.9%) had persistent splenomegaly, with a median persistence of 14.7 months (range 6.0–27.9 months). Of the 112 patients with available results, 65 (58.0%) had evidence of malaria infection, and the mean splenomegaly duration did not differ by Plasmodium species.

Refugees with splenomegaly on arrival were 43% more likely to have anemia (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.04–1.97). Those with persistent splenomegaly were 60% more likely (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15–2.23) to have a hematologic abnormality, particularly thrombocytopenia (aRR: 5.53, 95% CI: 1.73–17.62), and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels.

### Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly: An approach to the diagnosis of lysosomal storage diseases [^113xyBma]. Journal of Clinical Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Hepatomegaly can result from numerous conditions. Some of these include schistosomiasis, hepatitis B virus infection, and hairy cell leukemia. Systemic mastocytosis, congenital syphilis, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis also contribute to this condition. Other causes encompass infections such as mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucellosis, and bartonellosis. Additionally, diseases like Wilson's disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, and splenic sequestration crisis are known contributors.

Cancer-related conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, small bowel lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, and various other forms like mu chain disease and mantle cell lymphoma are also associated. Several parasitic infections, including schistosoma mansoni, schistosoma japonicum, paragonimiasis, and opisthorchiasis, are noted causes. Moreover, conditions like focal nodular hyperplasia, juvenile-onset Still's disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and juvenile chronic arthritis can lead to hepatomegaly.

Genetic and metabolic disorders, such as phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, iduronate-2-sulfatase deficiency, Zellweger spectrum, very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, and sphingomyelinase deficiency also play a significant role. Other genetic conditions include sialidosis type 2, Sandhoff disease, Salla disease, and pyruvate carboxylase deficiency. Each of these conditions requires thorough investigation to establish an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^112r5jWp]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

- **Surgical approach**: The traditional approach to splenectomy has been by laparotomy. This approach allows for a careful search for an accessory spleen which, if left behind, may cause recurrence of anemia. The disadvantages of open splenectomy are mainly surgical morbidity and abdominal wall scarring. Laparoscopic splenectomy has become feasible with progress in minimally invasive techniques.

- **Laparoscopic splenectomy**: Laparoscopic splenectomy is currently considered the gold standard technique for removal of a normal-sized or slightly enlarged spleen and is preferred over open splenectomy. Compared to open splenectomy, laparoscopic splenectomy is less traumatic, is associated with fewer complications, requires shorter hospital stays, has a better cosmetic outcome, and overall, has a lower cost. However, it should only be performed by experienced surgeons. Nowadays, laparoscopic splenectomy is possible and safe also for massively enlarged spleens but in such cases is associated with longer operating times and longer hospital stays. Perioperative splenic artery embolization has been found to be useful and reduces the complications of massive spleen laparoscopic splenectomy. Moreover, selective splenic artery embolization, carried out in steps, will reduce spleen size and alleviate cytopenias.

A preoperative assessment of splenic size by ultrasound is recommended. Although three-dimensional computed tomography is considered to be more accurate, it does not provide significant advantage in estimating spleen size, and its use should be evaluated accordingly.

### Understanding clinically significant portal hypertension: An in-depth look at pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^114BAcvB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

First things first: how does it develop?

Depending on the underlying level of impediment of flow in the portal system, portal hypertension (PHT) can be classified into three groups: pre-hepatic, intrahepatic, and post-hepatic PHT. Intrahepatic PHT can be further divided into sinusoidal and presinusoidal PHT. In Western countries, the most common cause of PHT is cirrhosis, which causes sinusoidal PHT. In this review, we focus mainly on sinusoidal PHT, but understanding other mechanisms leading to portal hypertension is vital in recognizing the pitfalls in diagnosing clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH).

The development of PHT in cirrhosis is driven by both increased intrahepatic vascular resistance and enhanced splanchnic blood flow. Approximately 70% of this resistance is due to structural changes, such as the formation of fibrous septa and regenerative nodules during tissue remodeling. The remaining 30% is attributed to functional factors, including intrahepatic vasoconstriction mediated by activated hepatic stellate cells transforming into contractile myofibroblasts, along with an imbalance between vasodilatory agents (e.g. nitric oxide, carbon monoxide) and vasoconstrictive agents (e.g. prostaglandins, endothelins, norepinephrine, angiotensin). The resulting increase in portal pressure drives the formation of collaterals or spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) in an effort to divert the blood flow from the portal vein. Additionally, PHT drives extrahepatic nitric oxide overproduction, and consequently splanchnic vasodilation, resulting in a decrease in effective circulating volume that triggers reflex activation of the renin–angiotensin system.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^111QXcLH]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Although clinical follow-up information varied in quality and duration across clinic sites, any refugee with splenomegaly at any point after arrival was 39% more likely to have had a hematologic abnormality, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia (aRR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.04–1.85), and, more specifically, was 43% more likely to have had anemia (aRR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.04–1.97). Refugees with persistent splenomegaly beyond 6 months after arrival were 60% more likely (aRR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15–2.23) than controls to have had a hematologic abnormality at some point during the follow-up period. More specifically, patients with persistent splenomegaly were more than five times as likely to have had thrombocytopenia during the follow-up period (aRR: 5.53, 95% CI: 1.73–17.62). Splenomegaly did not appear to be associated with elevated liver transaminases (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) in this population; however, refugees with persistent splenomegaly were 57% more likely to have elevated ALP (aRR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.03–2.40). All estimates were adjusted for age, gender, and length of follow-up time.

- **Hematologic abnormalities**: Associated comorbidities include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.
- **Case study**: One patient presented with massive splenomegaly (splenic size: 27.1 cm × 7.1 cm × 26 cm by ultrasound) and hepatomegaly with extensive thrombosis of the main portal vein and superior mesenteric and splenic veins.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British Society of Gastroenterology, the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Pathology [^115gxico]. Gut (2020). High credibility.

Liver biopsy is required when clinically important information about the diagnosis, prognosis, or management of a patient cannot be obtained by safer means, or for research purposes. There are several approaches to liver biopsy, but predominantly percutaneous or transvenous approaches are used. A wide choice of needles is available, and the approach and type of needle used will depend on the clinical state of the patient and local expertise. However, for non-lesional biopsies, a 16-gauge needle is recommended.

Many patients with liver disease will have abnormal laboratory coagulation tests or receive anticoagulation or antiplatelet medication. A greater understanding of the changes in haemostasis in liver disease allows for a more rational, evidence-based approach to peri-biopsy management.

Overall, liver biopsy is safe, but there is a small morbidity and a very small mortality, so patients must be fully counselled. The specimen must be of sufficient size for histopathological interpretation. Communication with the histopathologist, with access to relevant clinical information and the results of other investigations, is essential for the generation of a clinically useful report.

### Retention of uninfected red blood cells causing congestive splenomegaly is the major mechanism of anemia in malaria [^117BDY1Z]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). High credibility.

Splenomegaly frequently occurs in patients with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) or P. vivax (Pv) malarial anemia, but mechanisms underlying this co-occurrence are unclear. In malaria-endemic Papua, Indonesia, we prospectively analyzed red blood cell (RBC) concentrations in the spleen and spleen-mimetic retention in 37 subjects splenectomized for trauma or hyperreactive splenomegaly, most of whom were infected with Plasmodium. Splenomegaly (median 357g [range: 80–1918g]) was correlated positively with the proportion of red-pulp on histological sections (median 88.1% [range: 74%-99.4%]; r = .59, p = .0003) and correlated negatively with the proportion of white-pulp (median 8.3% [range: 0.4%-22.9%]; r = -.50, p = .002). The number of RBC per microscopic field (> 95% uninfected) was correlated positively with spleen weight in both Pf-infected (r = .73; p = .017) and Pv-infected spleens (r = .94; p = .006).

The median estimated proportion of total-body RBCs retained in Pf-infected spleens was 8.2% (range: 1.0%-33.6%), significantly higher than in Pv-infected (2.6% [range: 0.6%-23.8%]; p = .015) and PCR-negative subjects (2.5% [range: 1.0%-3.3%]; p = .006). Retained RBCs accounted for over half of circulating RBC loss seen in Pf infections. The proportion of total-body RBC retained in Pf- and Pv-infected spleens correlated negatively with hemoglobin concentrations (r = -.56, p = .0003), hematocrit (r = -.58, p = .0002), and circulating RBC counts (r = -.56, p = .0003). Splenic CD71-positive reticulocyte concentrations correlated with spleen weight in Pf (r = 1.0; p = .003). Retention rates of peripheral and splenic RBCs were also examined, highlighting their role in anemia mechanisms.

### Hairy cell leukemia: short review, today's recommendations and outlook [^114jo4Wg]. Blood Cancer Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment options, results, and new insights

- **Splenic irradiation and splenectomy**: Splenomegaly is one of the most common clinical manifestations of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), affecting up to 96% of patients, and often presents as epigastric discomfort or pain. Splenectomy was initially developed as the first effective therapeutic approach in treating HCL and was considered the treatment of choice until 1984, with overall response rates (ORR) documented between 60% and 100% in eight major reports. Patients achieved a median response duration of 5 to 20 months, with an overall survival (OS) rate of 55% to 70% after five years. Patients who undergo splenectomy benefit compared to non-splenectomized patients and tend to respond better and faster to subsequent therapies. It is recommended to wait at least six months after splenectomy before initiating further treatment approaches to realize the full benefits. However, splenectomy does not improve bone marrow infiltration and fibrosis, and the positive influences of splenectomy on long-term results remain uncertain.

Despite advancements in more effective chemotherapeutics in the treatment of HCL today, splenectomy still remains a valid treatment option in certain cases. For instance, HCL with significant splenomegaly (e.g. > 10 cm below the costal margin) but low bone marrow involvement can indicate splenectomy as a first-line treatment. In cases of suspected splenomegaly, splenectomy is not only therapeutic but also serves as a useful diagnostic tool to confirm the typical transformation of spleen histology. Splenectomy can reveal these transformations, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^116Egf9R]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

Refugees with splenomegaly on arrival were significantly more likely than matched controls to have a hematologic abnormality at some point during the follow-up, and the association was strengthened further when considering only case patients with persistent splenomegaly. Case patients appeared especially more likely to exhibit anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely due to splenic sequestration of blood cells and immune-mediated destruction of platelets through opsonization. Further, case patients were significantly more likely to have elevated levels of ALP, which, in this population without associated liver pathology, likely represents a marker of poor nutritional status. These results, however, could be affected by the longer follow-up time and increased frequency of testing for case patients.

Although malaria-associated splenomegaly is a likely cause of splenomegaly in many of these patients, nearly 40% of patients without evidence of malaria infection had persistent splenomegaly. Future investigations should systematically collect detailed laboratory information to elucidate both infectious and noninfectious etiologies of splenomegaly in this population. Sickle cell anemia did not appear to contribute to splenomegaly in the group we assessed. Splenomegaly in this population may be multifactorial, and etiologies may have differed between patients. Evidence suggests that schistosomiasis may have contributed to persistent splenomegaly, as among patients with both available Schistosoma IgG ELISA and eosinophilia results, 60% tested positive for both.

### Peritoneal tuberculosis as a cause of ascites in a patient with cirrhosis [^114f9B9Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old Portuguese Caucasian man with a history of heavy alcohol intake and no significant medical history presented with ascites, weight loss, and general malaise. The ascitic fluid analysis showed 921 cells/mm³ with mononuclear predominance (93.6%), elevated total proteins, and a slightly elevated serum-ascites albumin gradient. The abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of chronic liver disease with ascites. Additionally, on CT, there was evidence of peritoneal thickening.

On repeat paracentesis, the ascitic fluid analysis showed elevated adenosine deaminase but was negative for the presence of mycobacteria by Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Löwenstein-Jensen culture, and PCR amplification. Due to the persistent suspicion of tuberculosis, a laparoscopy was performed, showing multiple small white tubercles scattered over the peritoneum. Peritoneal biopsies revealed necrotising granulomas and cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. After a 6-month course of tuberculostatics, the ascites resolved completely and the patient remained asymptomatic.

### An unexpected finding of hepatosplenomegaly in a pediatric patient [^115TswCa]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A multidisciplinary approach is essential in the long-term management of GD Type 1. In addition to facilitating and observing response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), medical specialists must monitor for long-term complications. In GD Type 1, aberrant macrophage activation and immune dysregulation are associated with an increased risk of cancer in the site of the metabolic disease and in secondary organs involved in the disease process. Additionally, due to mutations in the GBA gene, it has been found that Parkinson's disease may develop in 4% to 9% of GD Type 1 patients. Long-term management should also encompass genetic counselling, as GD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Allied health care professionals are vital in managing subsequent psychosocial aspects of care.

In summary, GD is a rare, but important, treatable diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with hepatosplenomegaly. Associated hematological abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia and anemia, and skeletal manifestations should raise clinical suspicion for GD. Measuring glucocerebrosidase activity in dried blood spots is a reliable and cost-effective method to diagnose GD early in individuals with hepatosplenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis is supported by high serum chitotriosidase and genetic testing, with c.1226A > G being the most common deletion mutation seen in GD Type 1. Biweekly enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase has been proven to improve hematological, visceral, and bony manifestations of the disease. Physicians must consider the rare diagnosis of GD in patients presenting with hepato.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^113GfEZv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 6 months before refugees depart for the United States, U.S. Department of State–authorized panel physicians conduct required medical examinations according to technical instructions provided by the CDC. In 2014 and 2015, panel physicians working with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in western Uganda notified the CDC of an increase in the number of Congolese refugees with splenomegaly at their predeparture medical examinations. Under an enhanced screening protocol, the IOM evaluated U.S.-bound Congolese refugees for splenomegaly in March and July 2015.

Of the 987 persons screened during these two months, 145 (15%) had splenomegaly, defined as more than 2 standard deviations above the mean maximum splenic length, adjusted for height, by the WHO ultrasonography protocol. Of these, 122 of 145 (64%) had massive splenomegaly, defined as more than 4 standard deviations above the local mean for splenic size, adjusted for height. The results of this initial investigation are described elsewhere; briefly, each individual enrolled in this initial investigation received further testing for malaria (thick and thin smear, RDT), schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and sickle cell anemia.

After this initial investigation, which only included RDT and thick- and thin-smear microscopy for malaria diagnostic testing, only 26.9% of refugees in this population tested positive for malaria, rendering little conclusive evidence to support a definitive infectious etiology. Assuming malaria was the most likely etiology, all patients presenting with splenomegaly at their predeparture medical examination were assessed further.

### Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus [^112Crnsn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2008). Low credibility.

Both hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) and HIV infection are highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, though the inter-relationships between these two conditions are not clearly defined. The diagnosis of HMS is particularly challenging in HIV-infected patients. Detection of circulating malaria parasites using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may serve as a useful diagnostic tool.

### An unexpected finding of hepatosplenomegaly in a pediatric patient [^115RopqY]. Clinical Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The patient was started on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) at a dosage of 60 U/kg every two weeks. She tolerated this well, with no reported side effects. Two years later, she continues to thrive, with a weight of 28.4 kg (69th percentile) and a height of 122.6 cm (15th percentile). Clinical examination and a repeat abdominal ultrasound demonstrated resolved hepatosplenomegaly, with improved liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^111p1KcP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Schistosoma IgG ELISA results were available for 30 (23.1%) of 130 cases and 12 (11.8%) of 102 controls. Among the 17 case patients with persistent splenomegaly who had available Schistosoma IgG ELISA results, 11 (64.7%) were positive, and six (60.0%) of 10 patients with available paired absolute eosinophil counts had absolute eosinophilia (≥ 500 eosinophils/µL), possibly indicating ongoing schistosome infection. All patients in the original cohort received a stool ova and parasite examination. One case patient included in this follow-up investigation tested positive for S. mansoni ova, in addition to a second patient who was diagnosed with splenomegaly after U.S. arrival. Regardless of splenomegaly diagnosis, all patients received preemptive treatment with praziquantel before departure.

- **Malaria attribution**: The proportion of Congolese refugees with splenomegaly attributable to any malaria species is represented, including Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium vivax (Pv), Plasmodium ovale (Po), Plasmodium malariae (Pm), and coinfection with P. falciparum and another Plasmodium species. The data also show the proportion of those patients who received primaquine after arrival. Malaria speciation was resolved through polymerase chain reaction among patients enrolled for enhanced screening by the International Organization for Migration at enrollment.

### Congenital anerythremic erythroleukemia presenting as hepatic failure [^114J3K2i]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

We report an atypical case of congenital erythroleukemia in a child born with hepatosplenomegaly and abnormal liver tests. The initial peripheral blood cell count showed anemia and hyperleukocytosis with erythroblastosis that disappeared 1 week later. During the next 5 weeks, no blasts were found in the blood, and less than 5% were found on two successive bone marrow aspirates. The infant died of hepatic failure. The suspected diagnosis on a premortem liver biopsy was confirmed by an autopsy that showed blastic infiltration in many organs. These cells expressed only erythroid markers glycophorin A and C. Rearrangement of the myeloid lymphoid leukemia gene was not found by fluorescence in situ hybridization.

- **Differential diagnoses**: The main differential diagnoses include metabolic diseases, Langerhans histiocytosis, Pepper syndrome, transient myeloproliferative disorder, and leukemoid reactions. Although some of these can be excluded by the pathologist, others require a multidisciplinary confrontation, including clinical, biologic, genetic, and pathologic examinations.

### Assessment of hemophagocytic lympho-histiocytosis (HLH) in the setting of adult acute liver failure [^11169Pwd]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Low credibility.

In evaluating the validity of various scores and biomarkers for determining an HLH diagnosis in a population of adult acute liver failure (ALF) patients, we identified only 14 cases where HLH was entertained as the initial diagnosis, and only 5 of these were considered definite cases of HLH over a span of 16 years in this large multi-site study. HLH cases present with protean symptoms and signs, increasing the challenges in diagnosis. Of note, however, we did not add any additional cases despite our thorough review of possible additional subjects that might have been missed by the initial clinical team. That included patients with DRESS, many others with very high ferritins, as well as those with diagnoses that would be unlikely to qualify as HLH, given their well-characterized other etiologies.

Among HLH cases in our study, several unique clinical-demographic features were observed. Most HLH patients exhibited hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, despite reporting of organomegaly among patients with ALF in general being somewhat limited. More often, the liver may be diminished in size, not enlarged, and not appreciated as such. Our study revealed that HLH cases also typically exhibited the lowest hemoglobin levels, white blood cell counts, and platelet counts, compared to other ALF etiologies during the study period. The presence of anemia in ALF patients with HLH is attributed to the hemolytic nature of the disease. These severe cytopenias can be explained by the consumptive process of secondary HLH that develops during a pro-inflammatory state.

### Peliosis of the spleen with massive recurrent haemorrhagic ascites, despite splenectomy, and associated with elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor [^111EDTit]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 33-year-old man with isolated splenic peliosis, a rare pathological condition characterized by blood-filled cystic lesions. The patient presented with massive haemorrhagic ascites, which did not resolve despite a splenectomy. He was found to have massively elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The clinical course of the disease was prolonged. Repeated blood transfusions for anaemia were required, in addition to repeated aspiration of reaccumulating haemorrhagic ascites and pleural effusion. The clinical course was not in keeping with previously reported cases.

We have described an atypical clinical presentation in a patient with isolated splenic peliosis associated with elevated VEGF concentrations. No previously known associations for the condition were found despite thorough investigations. Management of the patient has been symptomatic and palliative. We have reviewed the various reported associations of peliosis and discussed the possible role of VEGF in this patient's condition.

### Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice from the British Society of Gastroenterology, the Royal College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Pathology [^111WBNcL]. Gut (2020). High credibility.

Since the publication of the previous version of these guidelines, there have been major advances in the understanding of coagulation in health and liver disease, as well as in the methodologies available to assess different aspects of coagulation and treatments for anticoagulation. Guidelines have been developed by the British Society of Haematology and the American Gastroenterology Association.

- **Coagulation testing**: The understanding of the coagulation profile in liver disease has evolved since the previous guideline was written. Historically, it was assumed that the raised prothrombin time often seen in liver disease, commonly expressed as an INR, reflected a bleeding risk and that correction with plasma products, specifically fresh frozen plasma (FFP), would reduce or correct this haemostatic failure. However, more recent studies have shown quite the reverse; there is often a prothrombotic state, and transfusion of FFP has been described as usually unnecessary, ineffective, and potentially hazardous. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is uncertainty about the utility and safety of prophylactic FFP use. Thus, the use of FFP is rarely indicated.

Although there is reduced synthesis and consumption of many procoagulant proteins and reduced numbers of platelets, there is an increase in factor VIII and von Willebrand Factor, and a reduction in natural anticoagulants. Haemostasis in chronic stable liver disease is often referred to as 'rebalanced', with a net effect of normal haemostasis or even a procoagulant state, and this is reflected in more 'global' assays.

### Unresolved splenomegaly in recently resettled Congolese refugees - multiple states, 2015–2018 [^1158kcMT]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because data were obtained from clinic visits that occurred at irregular intervals, these findings likely underestimate the duration of splenomegaly in this population. Second, because of loss to follow-up, this investigation cannot estimate the actual proportion of patients whose condition resolved after their initial screening exam. Third, data quality varied widely across clinics, and diagnostic information from U.S.-based clinics, particularly more sensitive molecular diagnostics, was unavailable in most instances. Finally, considering the 21 cases of splenomegaly identified after U.S. arrival, the condition was likely underdiagnosed. Increased awareness and emphasis on careful spleen examination might improve sensitivity of predeparture detection.

Despite published reports suggesting that resolution would follow malaria treatment and removal from an area with endemic malaria, this analysis found that splenomegaly persisted after arrival in many Congolese refugees, in some cases beyond 2 years. Associated pathologic conditions, such as anemia and thrombocytopenia, also were prevalent. Clinicians caring for such patients both predeparture and postarrival need to be aware of the high prevalence of splenomegaly in this population. Given familial clustering and additional cases identified through proactive family screening, both overseas and domestic clinicians could consider screening family members of Congolese refugees with splenomegaly.

### Differential diagnosis of ascites: Etiologies, ascitic fluid analysis, diagnostic algorithm [^112a6dSo]. Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Ascites can arise from various causes, including:

- **Liver and biliary diseases**: liver cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic vein thrombosis, hepatic veno-occlusive disease
- **Cardiac and systemic conditions**: right-sided heart failure, hypothyroidism, extramedullary hemopoiesis, hemolytic disease of the newborn

### Pancreatic ascites: Update on diagnosis and management [^114gS8xu]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Pancreatic ascites is a diagnostic challenge because of its rarity and nonspecific clinical features. Therefore, a comprehensive diagnostic approach that incorporates a history of the presenting illness, physical examination, blood tests, imaging, and diagnostic paracentesis with fluid analysis is crucial. The physical findings of ascites may include cachexia, abdominal tenderness, peritonitis, abdominal distension, shifting dullness, positive fluid wave, decreased bowel sounds, and extremity edema. Patients with concomitant pleural effusion may exhibit decreased breath sounds, crackles or rales, and in severe cases, may be in respiratory distress.

- **Laboratory tests**: Routine blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, brain natriuretic peptide level, lactate, uric acid, and complete blood cell count, can help clinicians narrow down the differential diagnosis of new-onset ascites. Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte abnormality observed in pancreatic ascites cases and is likely dilutional, due to fluid retention. Hypoalbuminemia is also reported in most cases and is often secondary to severe malnutrition in the setting of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic ascites. On complete blood cell count, patients typically show low hemoglobin with a normal to mildly elevated white blood count, even in the absence of an underlying infection. Platelet count and coagulation factors, such as prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio, are usually normal.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^113KpARe]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Tropical splenomegaly is often associated with malaria and schistosomiasis. In 2014 and 2015, 145 Congolese refugees in western Uganda diagnosed with splenomegaly during predeparture medical examinations underwent enhanced screening for various etiologies. After anecdotal reports of unresolved splenomegaly and complications after arrival in the United States, patients were reassessed to describe long-term clinical progression post-arrival. Medical information was obtained through medical chart abstraction in collaboration with state health partners in nine participating states.

We evaluated observed splenomegaly duration and associated clinical sequelae between 130 case patients from eastern Congo and 102 controls through adjusted hierarchical Poisson models, accounting for familial clustering. Of the 130 case patients, 95 (73.1%) had detectable splenomegaly after arrival. Of the 85 patients with records beyond 6 months, 45 (52.9%) had persistent splenomegaly, with a median persistence of 14.7 months (range 6.0–27.9 months).

Of the 112 patients with available results, 65 (58.0%) had evidence of malaria infection, and the mean splenomegaly duration did not differ by Plasmodium species. Refugees with splenomegaly on arrival were 43% more likely to have anemia (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.04–1.97). Those with persistent splenomegaly were 60% more likely (adjusted relative risk [aRR]: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.15–2.23) to have a hematologic abnormality, particularly thrombocytopenia (aRR: 5.53, 95% CI: 1.73–17.62).

A 20-year-old woman presented with fever and was eventually diagnosed with splenic tuberculosis as the sole site of the disease. Laboratory data provided no specific information for diagnosis except for a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and mild anaemia. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed splenomegaly with multiple hypoechoic lesions within it. A diagnosis of isolated splenic tuberculosis was confirmed after CT-guided aspiration from splenic lesions showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli.

### Hepatic nodule: a case of primary myelofibrosis [^113dVtF3]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Primary myelofibrosis is one of the entities that may manifest with lesions of extramedullary haematopoiesis, especially in the spleen and liver. The authors report a case of primary myelofibrosis presenting incidentally as an intrahepatic focal lesion of extramedullary haematopoiesis. This rare occurrence highlights the challenge of hepatic nodule differential diagnosis and allows reflection on the diagnostic criteria and prognostic factors of this myeloproliferative disease.

Although this investigation was designed only to evaluate and compare clinical sequelae and progression between case patients and controls after U.S. arrival, etiologic information was collected when possible. Information on potential exposures was not consistently available for cases and was particularly limited for controls, but all available etiologic information is presented in Table 2.

Malaria microscopy, RDT, or PCR results from either predeparture or post-arrival visits were available for 112 (86.2%) of 130 cases, of whom 65 (58.0%) tested positive by any method. Only 10 (9.8%) of 102 controls were tested for malaria, three of whom tested positive; testing methods among controls were restricted to microscopy and RDT. Malaria PCR results were available for 91 of the 92 patients who resettled to the nine states that participated. Among these 91 patients, 52 (57.1%) tested positive for any Plasmodium species by PCR, and of these, 20 patients had coinfections with multiple Plasmodium species, including P. falciparum coinfections with Plasmodium malariae (n = 12), P. ovale (n = 8), and Plasmodium vivax (n = 2), with two of these patients positive for three Plasmodium species.

Of the 52 patients with any positive result, 49 (94.2%) tested positive for P. falciparum, 15 (28.8%) tested positive for P. malariae, eight (15.3%) tested positive for P. ovale, and two (3.8%) tested positive for P. vivax. Among the 45 refugees with persistent splenomegaly, 35 received testing for malaria, of whom 22 (62.9%) tested positive.

### Portal hypertension complicating myelofibrosis in a patient without portal or hepatic vein thrombosis [^114N2u2H]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Comparable to previous case reports, our case suggests the possibility of intrahepatic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension without portal or hepatic vein thrombosis in myelofibrosis. In clinical practice, myelofibrosis should be excluded in patients with symptomatic portal hypertension of unknown cause. However, due to the absence of a liver biopsy, we are uncertain about the presence of liver infiltration from myeloid cells.

### Clinical sequelae associated with unresolved tropical splenomegaly in a cohort of recently resettled Congolese refugees in the United States-multiple states, 2015–2018 [^111cc8FV]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). High credibility.

Many diseases and conditions are associated with spleen enlargement or splenomegaly. The most common causes in the United States include liver disease, acute or chronic infections (e.g. bacterial endocarditis and infectious mononucleosis), hematologic malignancies (e.g. lymphomas, leukemias, and myeloproliferative disorders), inflammatory conditions (e.g. sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis), and splenic sequestration (e.g. pediatric sickle cell disease, hemolytic anemias, and thalassemias). Although these etiologies might affect populations from tropical areas, other potential causes include infectious etiologies. Tropical splenomegaly has been associated with malaria and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in a cohort of 221 Ghanaian patients, schistosomiasis in a case study describing a Sudanese refugee, hyperreactive malaria splenomegaly (HMS) syndrome among a cohort of Sudanese refugees, and hepatitis B virus infection, particularly in the presence of malaria infection, in a study of Hmong refugees.

Splenomegaly is a common pathologic finding in the tropics. The most commonly reported etiology, HMS, is a diagnosis of exclusion. On-site malaria diagnostic testing is frequently negative in those with malaria-associated splenomegaly, possibly driven by the lower sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and smear microscopy relative to molecular diagnostic methods. In the absence of acute febrile illness and without a confirmatory test, malaria is assumed when other etiologies for splenomegaly have been excluded.

### Unresolved splenomegaly in recently resettled Congolese refugees - multiple states, 2015–2018 [^111pPs8E]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Hematologic, hepatic, and infectious disease screening results were available for 84 of 85 refugees with documented splenomegaly and 24 of 32 without documented splenomegaly at their initial domestic exam. Among the 84 with splenomegaly, 53 (63.1%) exhibited a hematologic abnormality such as anemia (43 of 83, 51.8%), leukopenia (16 of 79, 20.3%), or thrombocytopenia (19 of 34, 55.9%). Elevated liver enzymes, including alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase, were present in 11 (20.0%) of 55 patients, and elevated alkaline phosphatase was present in 31 (53.5%) of 58 patients with available results.

Among the 46 patients screened for malaria by thin or thick smear after arrival, six (13.0%) were smear-positive. Two of these six patients had evidence of infection with Plasmodium falciparum, four had evidence of infection with Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale, and two had coinfection with Plasmodium malariae and P. vivax or P. ovale. Among 30 refugees with splenomegaly after arrival for whom Schistosoma immunoglobulin G results were available, 15 (50.0%) had evidence of prior infection. Among 13 with both Schistosoma immunoglobulin G results and an eosinophil count, eight (61.5%) had eosinophilia.

### Causes of massive tropical splenomegaly in Ghana [^1125SMvX]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

The causes and diagnosis of massive tropical splenomegaly are not well studied, especially with modern investigative methods. We aimed to identify features that would help local clinicians differentiate between the underlying conditions.

- **Methods**: We collected prospective clinical and laboratory data on 221 Ghanaian patients with a spleen size of at least 10 cm. We identified conditions associated with massive splenomegaly with molecular and immunological investigations as well as routine tests. Patients were assigned to diagnostic categories on the basis of these test results and predetermined criteria.

- **Findings**: Hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS; 91 patients [41%]) and B-lymphoproliferative disorders (48 patients [22%]) were the most common disorders associated with massive splenomegaly. Of the remaining patients, 32 (14%) had haematological disorders, and in 50 (23%) we could not identify the cause of splenomegaly. Male sex predominated in all diagnostic groups except HMS and tropical splenic lymphoma. Age less than 40 years and absolute lymphocyte count (less than 10 × 10⁹/L) were the only useful and widely available discriminators for distinguishing patients with HMS from those with lymphoproliferative disorders.

- **Interpretation**: B-lymphoproliferative disorders are a previously unrecognised cause of massive tropical splenomegaly. This finding has major implications for management of massive splenomegaly. Diagnosis of the less common causes of this disorder is usually straightforward, but differentiating between B-lymphoproliferative disorders and HMS can be challenging.
