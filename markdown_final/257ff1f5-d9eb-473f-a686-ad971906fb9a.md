## Question

What is splinter

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "splinter" means across different contexts and how to interpret it clinically and otherwise. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most common medical usage, which is a foreign-body splinter embedded in soft tissue. Then, I should verify the second most common usage, namely splinter hemorrhages of the nail bed and their diagnostic implications. Next, I will consider other medical and non-medical meanings, including ophthalmic and physics/engineering uses, and finally synthesize a concise, context-aware definition with practical guidance on evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the primary medical meaning: a splinter is a small, sharp fragment of material (commonly wood, glass, or metal) that becomes embedded in the skin or subcutaneous tissue, often causing pain, inflammation, and a risk of infection if not removed promptly; management typically involves local anesthesia, careful incision or de-roofing, and forceps extraction, with referral for deeper or structure-adjacent objects and imaging when localization is uncertain [^114QQSyv].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging nuances for retained splinters, because wood and some plastics are radiolucent and can be missed on plain radiographs; ultrasound is a useful adjunct to localize radiolucent foreign bodies, and MRI may be needed for deep or neurologically significant retained wooden fragments, as illustrated by case reports of subungual wood and intradural wooden splinters where MRI confirmed the diagnosis and guided operative management [^111g17DY] [^116paCx1] [^1178fVny].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all "splinters" being foreign bodies; I need to check the second major medical usage: splinter hemorrhages are thin, reddish-brown, longitudinal streaks under the nail plate caused by extravasation of blood from longitudinal nail-bed vessels, moving distally with nail growth; they are classically linked to infective endocarditis but are nonspecific and can follow trauma, appear in psoriasis, vasculitides, antiphospholipid syndrome, scurvy, certain drugs, and sometimes idiopathically, so I should confirm systemic context before attributing significance [^111vZBo5] [^113dnApn] [^1139in33] [^115w6bgH] [^1114v6nw] [^113FP94z].

> I should double-check the diagnostic value of splinter hemorrhages in suspected endocarditis; in a large retrospective cohort, sensitivity was low at about 26% but specificity was around 83%, and adding them as a minor vascular criterion to the Duke schema reclassified a modest proportion of cases, so their presence should raise suspicion in the right clinical context but should not be used in isolation to diagnose or exclude endocarditis [^116aiAWs].

> Let me consider other medical contexts where "splinter" appears; in ophthalmology, "splinter hemorrhages" can describe tiny peripapillary or optic disc hemorrhages seen with increased intracranial pressure or glaucoma, reflecting microvascular fragility and barrier breakdown, which is a different entity from nail splinter hemorrhages and should be interpreted with fundus findings and pressure context in mind [^113rUJ3L] [^112yD4Bp].

> But wait, what if the term is used outside medicine entirely; in physics and engineering, "splinter" can denote a small shard or fragment of a larger structure, such as a crystal splinter used in materials research, or in theoretical models describing fragmented states of oscillators, illustrating that the core concept of a small, broken-off fragment applies across disciplines even if the clinical relevance is indirect [^114tVG6a] [^114cFXzo].

> I will now examine the molecular biology usage to ensure completeness; in synthetic biology, a DNA "splint" is a bridging oligonucleotide used to ligate RNA fragments, a specialized technical meaning that shares the metaphor of a small connector holding pieces together, but it is unrelated to foreign-body or hemorrhagic clinical entities [^112LE5JB].

> Let me synthesize a concise, context-aware definition: a splinter is a small, sharp fragment of material embedded in tissue, most commonly wood, glass, or metal, requiring careful removal and sometimes imaging for localization; in clinical parlance, "splinter hemorrhages" are linear nail-bed microhemorrhages that, while classically associated with infective endocarditis, are nonspecific and warrant correlation with systemic signs, medication history, and risk factors before concluding a cardiac or vasculitic etiology [^114QQSyv] [^116aiAWs] [^113dnApn].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps when either meaning is suspected: for a suspected foreign-body splinter, inspect, palpate, consider ultrasound if radiographs are unrevealing, and remove with aseptic technique or refer if deep or near neurovascular structures; for nail splinter hemorrhages, take a careful history for trauma, medications, and systemic symptoms, and if endocarditis is on the table, obtain blood cultures and echocardiography rather than relying on nail findings alone to make the diagnosis [^114QQSyv] [^111g17DY] [^116aiAWs].

A splinter is a **small, sharp fragment** of wood, metal, glass, or plastic that penetrates the skin, causing pain, inflammation, and a risk of infection [^113g7ken]. Most splinters are **superficial and can be safely removed at home** using clean tweezers or needles after thorough cleansing; however, deep, large, or deeply embedded splinters — especially near the eyes, joints, or genitals — should be removed by a clinician to avoid complications [^114QQSyv]. If a splinter is not removed, it can cause infection, abscess, or granuloma formation; **seek medical care for signs of infection**, retained fragments, or failure of home removal [^116paCx1].

---

## Common materials causing splinters

Splinters can originate from **various materials**, including:

- **Wood**: Commonly from untreated lumber, tree branches, or wooden furniture [^113g7ken].

- **Metal**: Often from rusty nails, screws, or metal shavings [^113g7ken].

- **Glass**: Typically from broken glass or glassware [^113g7ken].

- **Plastic**: Less common but can occur from broken plastic items or toys [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Splinters typically present with the following **symptoms**:

- **Pain**: Localized pain at the site of penetration [^1136fyeX].

- **Redness and swelling**: Inflammation around the embedded object [^114QQSyv].

- **Visible foreign body**: The splinter may be visible or palpable under the skin [^114QQSyv].

- **Infection**: Signs include pus, increased redness, warmth, and systemic symptoms such as fever [^116paCx1].

---

## Potential complications

If not properly managed, splinters can lead to **several complications**:

- **Infection**: Bacterial infections, including cellulitis and abscess formation [^116paCx1].

- **Granuloma formation**: Chronic inflammation leading to granulomatous tissue [^notfound].

- **Tetanus**: Particularly with rusty metal splinters if the patient is not up-to-date with tetanus immunization [^notfound].

- **Retained foreign body**: Chronic pain, inflammation, or secondary infection [^1136fyeX].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis of splinters is primarily **clinical**, based on history and physical examination. Imaging may be required for deep or radiolucent materials (e.g. wood, plastic) that are not visible on standard radiographs [^116paCx1]. Ultrasound is particularly useful for **localizing radiolucent splinters** [^115knz7M] [^111g17DY], and MRI may be necessary for deep or complex cases, especially when the splinter is near critical structures [^1178fVny].

---

## Treatment and removal techniques

Treatment depends on the **depth, location, and material** of the splinter:

- **Superficial splinters**: Can often be removed at home using clean tweezers or needles after cleansing the area with antiseptic [^113g7ken].

- **Deep or embedded splinters**: Require professional medical removal, often under local anesthesia, and may necessitate surgical exploration [^114QQSyv].

- **Imaging-guided removal**: Ultrasound or MRI may be used to localize and guide removal of deep or radiolucent splinters [^115knz7M] [^1178fVny].

- **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Administered if the patient is not up-to-date with immunizations, particularly for metal splinters [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing splinter injuries involves **taking precautions** such as wearing protective gloves when handling wood, metal, or glass; keeping environments clean and free of debris; and using proper tools and techniques when working with potentially splintering materials. Education on safe handling and awareness of potential hazards also reduces risk.

---

## When to seek medical attention

Medical attention should be sought if:

- The splinter is **deep, large, or embedded near critical structures** (eyes, joints, genitals) [^114QQSyv].

- There are **signs of infection** (pus, increased redness, warmth, fever) [^notfound].

- The splinter is **retained or cannot be removed** at home [^114QQSyv].

- The patient is **immunocompromised** or has chronic medical conditions [^notfound].

---

Splinters are common foreign bodies that can cause pain, inflammation, and infection. Most superficial splinters can be managed at home, but **deep or complicated cases require professional medical evaluation and removal** to prevent complications [^114QQSyv].

### Is the current surge in political and financial attention to one health solidifying or splintering the movement? [^115gQVnf]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Conclusion

Since 2010, political and financial attention to One Health has surged, and One Health has been framed by the Tripartite to have a broader scope. These developments have been accompanied by an increase in the number of organisations conducting diverse activities under the One Health umbrella and by heightened power struggles around which stakeholders have the authority to define One Health. Owing to a perceived lack of guidance on priority focus areas and on how best to operationalise One Health, concerns were expressed that stakeholders are pulling operationalisation in directions most aligned to their own interests, thereby splintering the movement and stifling progress on systemic change. While the international attention to AMR is highlighting the need for investment in a One Heath approach, there is a risk that One Health initiatives will remain focused on disease-specific issues and that structural changes to sustain collaboration between sectors will be neglected. Several opportunities were identified to capitalise on the current growth in One Health initiatives and funding. Better monitoring and evaluation of the numerous ongoing activities is needed to strengthen the evidence base to support future funding and allow development of more precise guidelines on best practices. Further, to bridge divides between stakeholders, capacity building activities should additionally focus on collaboration skills and joint training of human, animal and environmental health specialists.

### Splinter removal [^114QQSyv]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Splinter injuries are common, but larger and deeper splinters are often difficult and painful to remove at home. These splinters often present as a foreign body embedded in the superficial or subcutaneous soft tissues. Whenever possible, reactive objects like wood, thorns, spines, and vegetative material should be removed immediately, before inflammation or infection occurs. Superficial horizontal splinters are generally visible on inspection or easily palpated. A horizontal splinter is exposed completely by incising the skin over the length of the long axis of the splinter, and removed by lifting it out with forceps. A subungual splinter may be removed by cutting out a V-shaped piece of the nail. The point of the V is at the proximal tip of the splinter, which is grasped and removed, taking particular care not to push the splinter further into the nail bed. Removal of an elusive splinter can be challenging and may require the use of imaging modalities for better localization. Deeper splinters, especially those close to important structures such as nerves, tendons, blood vessels, or vital organs, should be referred for removal.

### Diagnostic accuracy of splinter haemorrhages in patients referred for suspected infective endocarditis [^116aiAWs]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Splinter haemorrhages are an examination finding that has classically been associated with infective endocarditis (IE), but are not included in current diagnostic algorithms. Splinter haemorrhages have not been evaluated as a diagnostic tool using modern definitions of IE. We determined their sensitivity and specificity in patients with suspected IE and investigated their inclusion in the Duke criteria.

Methods

This is a retrospective diagnostic accuracy study using data from 1119 patients with suspected IE referred to the IE service. Patients were categorised according to the Duke criteria, the current diagnostic gold standard, into Duke 'rejected', 'possible' or 'definite' groups. Definite cases (n = 451) served as the true positives and rejected cases (n = 486) as the true negatives against which splinter haemorrhages were compared. Duke possible cases (n = 182) were used the assess the clinical impact of adding splinter haemorrhages to the Duke criteria.

Results

In clinically suspected cases of IE and using the Duke criteria as the gold standard comparator, splinter haemorrhages had a sensitivity of 26% (95% CI 22 to 31) (119 out of 451) and a specificity of 83% (95% CI 79 to 86) (403 out of 486). Inclusion of splinter haemorrhages as a minor vascular phenomenon in the Duke criteria would result in a reclassification of 12% of cases from Duke rejected to possible and 13% from Duke possible to definite.

Conclusion

Splinter haemorrhages are an insensitive tool in the diagnosis of IE, but their high specificity indicates they do have clinical value in patients with suspected infection. Their inclusion in the Duke criteria as a minor vascular criterion reduces diagnostic uncertainty for some Duke possible cases, while increasing it for a similar proportion of Duke rejected cases.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^114CfzXN]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Those driving intragroup fragmentation are likely to be group members who strongly identify with the parent camp. As the normative conflict model, suggests, it is those members who identify more strongly with the group who are most likely to challenge group norms when they believe that current norms no longer serve the achievement of group goals. Individuals who are highly invested in the group are more likely to evaluate the norms (and what they mean for the group) and deviate from the group prototype, if this deviation is seen as being in the best interest for the group. Once splinter factions within a camp are formed, the nature of the ingroup is reconfigured. Thus, from the perspective of faction members, their ingroup now consists of other members of the faction, while members of the parent camp become the outgroup, alongside members of the opposed camp. Thus, while the ingroup becomes smaller and more homogenous (more ideologically specified and narrow), the outgroup composed of both members of the opposing and parent camps, becomes more diverse, encompassing both different degrees of opposition and opposition to different aspects of the group's identity.

Whereas societal polarization into camps arises as an outcome of dissent between opposing ideological groups, polarization within a camp is characterized by a more extreme separation between ingroup and outgroups. Splinter factions are likely to consist of "high identifiers", members who are highly invested in the group, and high in certainty about the group's position. Validation from the ingroup and invalidation from the outgroup intragroup would most likely increase certainty about group position, which would, in turn, increase ideological segregation and polarization. We refer to the intense clustering of like-minded group members within factions as a heightened form of ideological segregation occurring between the splinter faction and parent camp.

### Artificial intelligence in the detection of non-biological materials [^113gRysi]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Before AI can be confidently utilized for the imaging of penetrating wounds, a number of challenges must be addressed. First, different models must be developed for each existing imaging modality. Second, the diversity of objects causing penetrating injuries, coupled with the multitude of potential locations on the body that an object can penetrate, require large, standardized datasets to train a potential model. Furthermore, some penetrating objects may splinter within the body or may induce bone fragments, which can have varied trajectories as secondary projectiles. Other challenges involve cases where penetrating objects have left the body. Thus, it is difficult for AI models to ascertain the penetrating object's tract within the body and the subsequently injured tissues. However, even if not directly involved in the identification of the object's track or injured tissues, AI models still have the potential to augment such clinical workflows through image enhancement or reconstruction.

### A theoretical framework for polarization as the gradual fragmentation of a divided society [^112WTxqQ]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

The concept of group identification is important here for several reasons. First, transformations in the collective narratives shared within a group are shaped by the unique context of intergroup and intragroup interactions in both online and offline social networks. However, these transformations are only possible if group members identify with a group and interact as group members. Secondly, in a similar process, the societal transformation of ideologically opposed camps into dissenting splinter factions, and ultimately extreme subgroups, is driven by intragroup and intergroup interactions between people identifying with camps, factions, and cells. Moreover, these social identities help create a context within which individual members of a society may interact as group members with agency, enabling them to be influential (and be influenced) in their capacity as either ingroup or outgroup members. Thus, mutual social influence and change can occur both within groups, driven by expected consensus with ingroup members in an intragroup context, and between groups, driven by expected dissent with outgroup members in an intergroup context. Table 1 shows the process of polarization underpinned by group fragmentation and changes to collective identity, as collective narratives are transformed within camps, splinter factions, and cells. The following section describes these transformations in more detail.

This process of validation is reflected in increased certainty about the group's collective narrative, and therefore, results in strengthening identification with the respective camp. However, the alternative pathway of intergroup interaction is equally important. That is, when interactions between the ingroup and outgroup members occur, and disagreement is expected, exposure to the outgroup's alternative collective narrative can reinforce conviction in the group narrative with the associated values and norms that differentiate the ingroup from the outgroup, thereby increasing polarization. Invalidation in this case could still lead to the same outcome of increased certainty in the ingroup position. Thus, certainty about the group narrative can be strengthened and polarization increased via a dual path, both when the narrative is reinforced via intragroup interaction, and when the narrative is contrasted with that of the outgroup. Thus, while people might prefer to interact online with people and media content reinforcing their view, social media platforms provide many opportunities to exposure to different and opposing views, much more so than would be possible in the real world. However, intergroup interaction in these situations (exposure to outgroup's position) can also increase polarization, as exposure to opposing views can lead to an increase one's own belief convictionrather than encouraging reflection and change.

Splinter faction formation

Polarization between camps and the resulting ideological segregation in camps provide opportunities for intensive intragroup interactions and deliberation within camps, as shown in early experiments on group polarization. Within a group that has many opportunities to deliberate, but limited exposure to outside information, the group position will likely become more extreme, and thus further distanced from the opposing camp. However, even in highly homogenous groups, intragroup dissent, for example in the form of disagreement with the norms and actions taken by the group, may develop. Splinter factions can form within opposed camps when group members disagree on fundamental issues of group identity and the disagreement cannot be resolved within the group. In this situation, the shared reality of group members is compromised. Thus, splinter factions form via a process of schism, or intragroup fragmentation, as members distance themselves from the mainstream camp. When this happens, the dissenting faction may develop different interpretations of the mainstream group narrative, and this changed social identity content is reflected in the adoption of new norms based on updated self-definitions of the identity of the group.

Radical cell formation

We argue that the formation of radical subgroups, or cells, that is, small groups composed of extreme and psychologically bonded members, arise as the result of intense clustering within a faction. Extreme clusters can form in physical spaces such as neighborhoods, but they often occupy online spaces that go beyond geopolitical boundaries. Either offline or online, they are highly cohesive psychological groups that are high in entitativity, so they can readily become platforms for identity fusion, a process whereby personal and group identity become one. Because group membership is central to a person's self-definition, the boundaries between personal and collective self might disappear to be replaced by a "visceral sense of connection with the group". Understanding how these cells form is most important to political psychologists and policy makers since it is from these groups that political violence usually occurs.

The formation of these extreme clusters is similar to the intragroup fragmentation leading to factions. The process leading to the formation of radical subgroups is again characterized by intense ideological clustering, whereby the group intensifies its position through ingroup consensus and outgroup dissent. Viewed as processes within a complex system, consensus underpins the formation and preservation of clusters, whereas dissent is the basis of fragmentation and alienation from other groups and mainstream society. When splinter factions move away from the parent camp, they also become more polarized in their identity content, so that that their values and beliefs further diverge from those of the parent camp. Extreme clusters formed within these factions can develop identity content that is even more extreme than that of the splintering faction. This content is reflected in new (extremist) group norms that, for example, may sanction the use of political violence. The growing isolation from outgroups, now consisting of not only the opposed camp, but also the parent camp and splinter factions, can make the group's narrative more powerful because group members find themselves without any other source of support or alternative group norms to adhere to. Thus, identification with an extreme group should predict support for violent political action through the process of identity fusion.

### Nitrofurantoin-induced splinter hemorrhages: a forgotten culprit [^115mcTY4]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Our case portrays the importance of obtaining a proper and thorough medical history, including risk factors, medication history, and family and surgical history to elucidate the cause of the condition. Additionally, when not associated with other symptoms in the absence of positive laboratory results and risk factors, it is important to advise patients that these symptoms should resolve without any intervention.

### Idiopathic splinter hemorrhages [^1121V3aX]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Splinter hemorrhages are non-blanchable usually distal reddish-brown linear hemorrhages beneath the nails. Among a variety of etiologic factors reported, trauma is the most common cause. A 26-year-old Hispanic female presented with asymptomatic, extensive fingernail hemorrhages of two months duration. There was no history of physical trauma to the nails. Treatment with a topical antifungal medication for one month produced no improvement. The past medical history was noncontributory. Extensive laboratory testing revealed no underlying systemic disease. Three months after the initial presentation, 6 of 10 fingernails showed signs of resolution without treatment. We conclude that idiopathic atraumatic subungual splinter hemorrhages can occur in healthy individuals. Spontaneous resolution occurred in our patient.

### Oscillators that sync and swarm [^113bxosB]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Perhaps colloidal equivalents of the splintered and active phase wave states could also be realized. Aside from being theoretically interesting, the ability to engineer these states could have practical application. For instance, Snezhko and Aranson also show that asters can be manipulated to capture and transport target particles. The non-stationary behavior of the splintered and active wave states might also have locomotive utility. Tentative evidence for this claim is provided by populations of cilia, whose collective metachronal waves, similar to the motion of swarmalators in the aforementioned states, are known to facilitate biological transport –.

Other plausible systems of real-world swarmalators are biological microswimmers, self-propelled micro-organisms capable of collective behavior. One such contender is populations of spermatoza, which exhibit rich swarming behavior such as trains, and vortex arrays, the latter of which is reminiscent of the active phase wave state, as mentioned in the Results section. The phase variable for each sperm is associated with the rhythmic beating of the sperm's tail, which can synchronize with that of a neighboring sperm. It has been theorized that this can induce spatial attraction, leading to clusters of synchronized sperm, consistent with experimentally observed behavior.

### Nitrofurantoin-induced splinter hemorrhages: a forgotten culprit [^113FP94z]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The discovery of splinter hemorrhages dates back to the 1920s, when Blumer described subungual bleeding that looked identical to splinters under the nails. Excluding its common idiopathic nature, trauma and bacterial endocarditis as the most common etiology of this condition, multiple drugs and dermatologic conditions have been associated with splinter hemorrhages as well. This includes but is not limited to septic embolization, central venous and foley catheter infections, graft infections or failures, sepsis, meningococcemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, or vasculitis.

Nitrofurantoin is an antimicrobial agent that has been used for many years in the setting of UTIs. Although it has been known to cause and/or associated with erythema nodosum, there have been limited reports of this drug causing splinter hemorrhages. This is likely due to less use of the drug by health providers due to the availability of more effective antibiotics. Despite the historic knowledge of oncohematologic drugs being a cause of splinter hemorrhages due to the antiangiogenic effects which impair the reparation of traumatized nail bed capillaries, we report a case of splinter hemorrhages affecting 10 fingernails after a week of nitrofurantoin, in the absence of cardiovascular symptoms and normal lab work.

A systematic review by Haber et al studied the possible etiologies and related conditions to splinter hemorrhages, and when drug-induced, splinter hemorrhages regressed after discontinuation of the offending drug. Nitrofurantoin has an inhibitory effect on adenisine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation, which has been demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo studies. This has been supported by the prolongation of bleeding time and percent inhibition of aggregation being positively correlated with serum nitrofurantoin concentrations. Thus, the inhibitory mechanism on platelet aggregation poses as the culprit for the splinter hemorrhages found in our patient.

Identifying splinter hemorrhages should raise concern for critical illness or infections and warrants a detailed clinical and laboratory examination. A careful medication history, even for short courses of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin, could elucidate the cause of a rather daunting looking condition for the patient and prevent unnecessary testing in an asymptomatic patient. However, if no clinical and laboratory evidence of bacterial endocarditis or any other condition is found, splinter hemorrhages typically have no clinical significance.

### Be aware of wood in the knee [^1136fyeX]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report a case of a 7-year-old boy who sustained a penetrating injury of a splinter of wood to the knee. Arthroscopic examination, removal of visualised foreign material and washout did not alleviate the symptoms of pain and swelling in its entirety. Microbiology cultures also failed to determine the cause of the on-going symptoms. Five days later, the patient underwent a mini arthrotomy through a lateral incision, which demonstrated synovitis, and removal of the remaining embedded foreign body from the lateral condyle. Although the authors advocate arthroscopy as the surgeon's first choice for removal of a foreign body from the knee, a mini-arthrotomy should also be considered to facilitate superior visualisation and easier instrumentation to remove embedded foreign bodies.

### Performance of common analysis methods for detecting low-frequency single nucleotide variants in targeted next-generation sequence data [^115kWUgF]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2014). Low credibility.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming a common approach for clinical testing of oncology specimens for mutations in cancer genes. Unlike inherited variants, cancer mutations may occur at low frequencies because of contamination from normal cells or tumor heterogeneity and can therefore be challenging to detect using common NGS analysis tools, which are often designed for constitutional genomic studies. We generated high-coverage (> 1000×) NGS data from synthetic DNA mixtures with variant allele fractions (VAFs) of 25% to 2.5% to assess the performance of four variant callers, SAMtools, Genome Analysis Toolkit, VarScan2, and SPLINTER, in detecting low-frequency variants. SAMtools had the lowest sensitivity and detected only 49% of variants with VAFs of approximately 25%; whereas the Genome Analysis Toolkit, VarScan2, and SPLINTER detected at least 94% of variants with VAFs of approximately 10%. VarScan2 and SPLINTER achieved sensitivities of 97% and 89%, respectively, for variants with observed VAFs of 1% to 8%, with > 98% sensitivity and > 99% positive predictive value in coding regions. Coverage analysis demonstrated that > 500× coverage was required for optimal performance. The specificity of SPLINTER improved with higher coverage, whereas VarScan2 yielded more false positive results at high coverage levels, although this effect was abrogated by removing low-quality reads before variant identification. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of high-sensitivity variant callers with data from 15 clinical lung cancers.

### Foreign bodies [^116paCx1]. Radiographics (2003). Low credibility.

Foreign bodies are uncommon, but they are important and interesting. Foreign bodies may be ingested, inserted into a body cavity, or deposited into the body by a traumatic or iatrogenic injury. Most ingested foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without a problem. Most foreign bodies inserted into a body cavity cause only minor mucosal injury. However, ingested or inserted foreign bodies may cause bowel obstruction or perforation; lead to severe hemorrhage, abscess formation, or septicemia; or undergo distant embolization. Motor vehicle accidents and bullet wounds are common causes of traumatic foreign bodies. Metallic objects, except aluminum, are opaque, and most animal bones and all glass foreign bodies are opaque on radiographs. Most plastic and wooden foreign bodies (cactus thorns, splinters) and most fish bones are not opaque on radiographs. All patients should be thoroughly screened for foreign bodies before undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging study.

### Nitrofurantoin-induced splinter hemorrhages: a forgotten culprit [^113xZuHc]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Splinter hemorrhages are formed by the extravasation of blood from the nail bed´s longitudinal vessels. These hemorrhages are more common in fingernails than toenails and present as black, brown, or purple in color. The blood attaches to the underlying nail plate and moves distally as the nail continues to grow. It is most commonly caused by trauma, systemic illnesses (ie, bacterial endocarditis or diabetes), cutaneous diseases (ie, psoriasis, onychomycosis, Darier disease, or Behcet), or drugs (ie, antibiotics, sedatives, tyrosine kinase inhibitors) or epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Nitrofurantoin, a lesser-known drug that may still be used in certain clinical settings, is a bactericidal antimicrobial that works through flavoprotein nitrofurantoin reductase to destabilize metabolites that disrupt ribosomal RNA, DNA, and intracellular components. It is active against most Gram-positive cocci and E scherichia coli, although Pseudomonas and Proteus are usually resistant to it and is generally used for lower urinary tract infections (UTIs). Herein, we present the case of an asymptomatic, 59-year-old Hispanic female who presented with splinter hemorrhages after a short course of nitrofurantoin for a UTI.

### Psoriasis of the nail: anatomy, pathology, clinical presentation, and a review of the literature on therapy [^1176gm8S]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects millions of people throughout the world. Even though cutaneous signs and symptoms are the most common clinical manifestations, the nails can be involved in up to 50% of cases, and their involvement remains an important yet often overlooked aspect of the disease. There is a broad spectrum of nail dystrophies associated with psoriasis, ranging from the common pitting and loosening of the nail plate to the less frequent discoloration and splinter hemorrhages seen in the nail bed. This article discusses the normal anatomy and embryology of the nail unit as well as the current understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. It also provides an extensive review of the existing literature with respect to psoriatic nail therapy. Although there have been many recent advances in the treatment of the cutaneous form of the disease-most notably in the field of immunotherapies-the options for nail psoriasis are far more limited. While a number of treatment alternatives currently exist for nail disease, the general paucity of clear evidence regarding these choices often makes it difficult to select the most efficient, safe, and optimal treatment for the patient. Even though the current literature has shown some support for the use of topical, intralesional, radiation, systemic, and combination therapies for nail psoriasis, the available studies lack sufficient power to extrapolate a standardized therapeutic regimen. Therefore, until better-documented evidence validating the treatment options emerges within the literature, clinicians and patients are left with a vague and relatively unproven approach to psoriatic nail disease.

### Subungual wooden splinter visualized with bedside sonography [^111g17DY]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Bedside ultrasound has become increasingly important as an adjunct to clinical diagnosis and procedures in the emergency department. It is only recently that this modality, which involves no ionizing radiation, has become incorporated into the pediatric emergency department. We report a case of a 10-year-old boy with a suspected subungual wooden foreign body. Bedside ultrasound was used to identify and characterize the foreign body before removal and then to evaluate for any residual foreign body after removal. A brief review of the technique is presented, including the use of a water bath to enhance visualization of the object and decrease the patient's discomfort. This case highlights the utility of ultrasound in detecting radiolucent soft tissue foreign bodies.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^116AWAdG]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — psychological, communication, and therapy assessments: Psychological assessment, including measurements of cognitive ability and adaptive skills, is indicated for treatment planning and helps to frame observed social-communication difficulties relative to overall development, with results of standardized intelligence tests sometimes showing considerable scatter and possible "splinter skills" or "savant skills". Communication assessment, including measurements of receptive and expressive vocabulary and language use, is helpful for diagnosis and treatment planning; occupational and physical therapy evaluations may be needed to evaluate sensory and/or motor difficulties, and sleep is an important variable to assess. When members of multiple disciplines are involved in assessment, it is optimal that coordination occur among the various professionals.

### "Capillary band width", the "nail (band) sign": a clinical marker of microvascular integrity, inflammation, cognition and age. A personal viewpoint and hypothesis [^111bfZnp]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

The nail provides a window of a person's wellbeing and the "nail (band) sign" provides an opportunity for the clinician to conveniently posit the state of the microcirculation of a person. Changes noted in the "capillary band" include splinter haemorrhages as an acute phenomenon. Changes in capillary band "width" and "prominence" indicate chronicity. "Capillary band width" and "prominence" may permit the differentiation of Alzheimer's from vascular causes of cognitive decline. Splinter haemorrhages and onycholysis alert clinicians to the presence of periodontal disease, and provide an indication of end organ "risk". "Capillary band width" widening and prominence is seen in chronic smokers. Nail changes not only reflect generalised disease or inflammation but also localised peripheral conditions that affect the microcirculation. The fourth finger on the left or right hand is usually used, or the middle finger, to measure "band width", but all fingers show the sign which is also present in the toes. Examination of "band width" and "prominence" together with other "nail signs" of wellbeing, such as the presence of the lunule at the base of the nail and smoothness of the convexity of the nail bed at its distal edge beneath the nail permit wellness evaluation and can be incorporated into standard medical practice before blood pressure measurement as a fundamental part of the clinical examination. Further evaluation will establish its importance as the most convenient yet reliable clinical sign of microvascular integrity and together with other nail signs determine its value in assessing wellness, as well as being a pointer to the presence of microvascular disease in investigative and epidemiological research and in patient management.

### Painful violaceus bullae of the hands [^112MpDp8]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 63 year-old-woman with a medical history of aortic valve replacement on anticoagulation, type II diabetes, and recently diagnosed ovarian cancer presented to the emergency department. She had fever, chest pain, a lactic acid level of 7.2 mmol (normal, 0.5–2.0 mmol), pulse rate of 154, and several painful violaceous bullae of the palms with surrounding stellate macules and rare splinter hemorrhages (Fig 1). Results of a punch biopsy are shown in Fig 2.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Coumadin-induced necrosis
B. Drug-induced vasculitis
C. Calciphylaxis
D. Septic emboli
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda

Answers:

A. Coumadin-induced necrosis – Incorrect. The classic distribution often involves areas with excessive adipose tissue, like the abdomen, thighs, or breasts. The duration of anticoagulation was not specified in the history but would typically be within the first 2 weeks of anticoagulation.
B. Drug-induced vasculitis – Incorrect. The patient history does not indicate any recent changes in medications, and the distribution would be more widespread on the trunk and extremities. Additionally, signs and symptoms of sepsis would remain unexplained.
C. Calciphylaxis – Incorrect. Calciphylaxis commonly occurs in the setting of end-stage renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism. The distribution is typically more localized to the abdomen, thighs, and legs and would not typically be on the hands or feet. This would also not account for the acute illness depicted in the question stem.
D. Septic emboli – Correct. The patient presented with characteristic findings of septic emboli including splinter hemorrhages and distal extremity stellate purpura. Our patient's symptoms support an infective process. Also, her history of aortic valve replacement and recent cancer diagnosis make her susceptible to bacteremia with endocarditis complicated by Streptococcus pyogenes.
E. Porphyria cutanea tarda – Incorrect. The diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda would appear more commonly on the dorsal aspect of the hands, forearms, chest, and face. The patient history would most likely include the development of skin findings after sun exposure and a history of liver disease. Lastly, this answer choice did not account for the acute illness of the patient.

### Epidemiology of injury and illness across all the competitive cycling disciplines: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115v7dqJ]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Within para cycling, the profile of illness is poorly understood despite the higher rates of illness seen compared with able-bodied disciplines. Thus, emphasises the requirement for specialist knowledge in managing illness profiles unique to athletes with disabilities. Additionally, there was a high prevalence of dermatological illness seen within track cycling. Crashes on the track can lead to widespread skin abrasions ('track burn') and wood splinters. The need to ensure thorough debridement of the wound post-crash and removal of all splinters is fundamental to reducing the risk of dermatological infection. As cyclists undertaking high training volumes may lower their ability to fight infection and consequently be more susceptible to wound infection, removal of all splinters is fundamental to reducing the risk of dermatological infection.

Unlike injuries, illnesses in sports are not defined by whether they occur in competition or training. This challenges the completeness of the illness profile presented within this review, as all the studies that have examined illness have done so within a competition or included competition and a narrow precompetition training window. There is often a delayed onset of symptoms due to the incubation time of bacterial and viral infections. Therefore, the true prevalence of illness may be under-reported. Further prospective studies within competition and training on cycling are warranted to capture a true understanding of illness prevalence within cyclists.

### Imaging and surgical approach to a pediatric penetrating intradural wooden splinter: case report [^1178fVny]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Penetrating spinal injuries by wood are infrequently reported. They are particularly rare in children. Only 6 cases of wooden fragments causing penetrating intradural spinal injury have been reported. The authors report a case of a 3-year-old girl who suffered a penetrating wound on her lower back after sliding on a wood floor. A portion of the extraspinal part of the wooden splinter was removed prior to presentation; however, a high suspicion for retained foreign body was maintained. Findings on CT were equivocal, but the diagnosis was confirmed on MRI. An incomplete cauda equina syndrome was noted on examination. She was taken to the operating room for removal of the wooden foreign body, repair of a durotomy, and repair of a CSF leak. At 8 months after surgery, the patient had fully recovered without sequelae. The roles of imaging modalities, prophylactic antibiotics, and surgery are discussed.

### Oscillators that sync and swarm [^114cFXzo]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4
Radii of stationary states. Simulation were for 800 swarmalators with a linear attraction kernel I att (x) = x. Red dots show simulation data, while black curves show theoretical predictions. a Radius of crystal formed in static sync state (for K = 1) and static async state (for K = −2) vs. J. b Inner and outer radii of annulus in static phase wave state vs. J

Static phase wave: The final stationary state occurs for the special case K = 0 and J > 0. This means the swarmalators' phases are frozen at their initial values. Still, the population evolves by rearranging itself in space. Since J > 0, 'like attracts like': swarmalators want to settle near others with similar phase. The result is an annular structure where the spatial angle ϕ of each swarmalator is perfectly correlated with its phase θ, as seen in Figs. 2 c and 3b. Since the phases run through a full cycle as the swarmalators arrange themselves around the ring, we call this state the 'static phase wave'.

In density space, this static phase wave state is described by ρ (r, ϕ, θ) = g 2 (r) δ (ϕ ± θ + C 1) where the ± and the constant C 1, are determined by the initial conditions. In the Methods section we again consider the linear attraction kernel, and find that g 2 (r) can be obtained analytically, with. This in turn lets us calculate the inner and outer radii R 1, R 2 of the annulus:with. Figure 3b shows agreement between these predictions and simulation.

Splintered phase wave: Moving from K = 0 into the K < 0 half-plane, we encounter the first non-stationary state, shown in Figs. 3 c and 5a. As can be seen, the static phase wave splinters into disconnected clusters of distinct phases. Accordingly we call this state the 'splintered phase wave'. It is unclear what determines the number of clusters. Fewer are found when smaller length scales for the interaction functions I att, I rep, G are used. However the parameters J, K also play a role, although how precisely has not yet been determined. Within each cluster, the swarmalators "quiver", executing small amplitude oscillations in both position and phase about their mean values.

### Splinter haemorrhages and brain infarcts as an unusual presentation of sarcoidosis [^113vwFg8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present an interesting case of a healthy 47-year-old woman who presented to the acute take with symptoms of visual apraxia, splinter haemorrhages and extreme fatigue. This was a diagnostic challenge with other unusual features to this case, which includes brain infarcts on MRI, raised troponin and oeosinophilia. Naturally endocarditis was the top differential but this was ruled out by serial negative blood cultures and a negative transthoracic echocardiogram. Several medical specialties were involved and the initial working diagnosis was ANCA vasculitis (oeosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Early administration of intravenous steroids clouded our judgement further and sarcoidosis was not thought as a possible differential. We illustrate the immensely challenging and complicated clinical course involving multiple specialties and investigations. In the end, a complete steroid wean was required to reach an accurate histological diagnosis.

### Evidence of splinting in low back pain? A systematic review of perturbation studies [^111aTFVB]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this systematic review was to assess whether LBP patients demonstrate signs of splinting by evaluating the reactions to unexpected mechanical perturbations in terms of (1) trunk muscle activity, (2) kinetic and (3) kinematic trunk responses and (4) estimated mechanical properties of the trunk.

Methods

The literature was systematically reviewed to identify studies that compared responses to mechanical trunk perturbations between LBP patients and healthy controls in terms of muscle activation, kinematics, kinetics, and/or mechanical properties. If more than four studies reported an outcome, the results of these studies were pooled.

Results

Nineteen studies were included, of which sixteen reported muscle activation, five kinematic responses, two kinetic responses, and two estimated mechanical trunk properties. We found evidence of a longer response time of muscle activation, which would be in line with splinting behaviour in LBP. No signs of splinting behaviour were found in any of the other outcome measures.

Conclusions

We conclude that there is currently no convincing evidence for the presence of splinting behaviour in LBP patients, because we found no indications for splinting in terms of kinetic and kinematic responses to perturbation and derived mechanical properties of the trunk. Consistent evidence on delayed onsets of muscle activation in response to perturbations was found, but this may have other causes than splinting behaviour.

### Translation of non-standard codon nucleotides reveals minimal requirements for codon-anticodon interactions [^112LE5JB]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Splinted mRNA ligation

Two RNA oligonucleotides were ligated to generate the prokaryotic reporter ErmCL mRNA. The oligonucleotide encoding the 5′-part (5′-GGGAGUUUUAUAAGGAGGAAAAAAU AUG GGCAUGUUUAGUAUUUUUGUAAUCAGCACAGUUC-3′; AUG start codon in bold) and the 3′-part encoding oligonucleotide 5′-P-AUUAU AAA CCAAACAAAAAA UAA -3′ (The sense codon that was modified or exchanged is underlined; UAA stop codon in bold.) were bridged by a DNA oligonucleotide splinter 5′-TTTGTTTGGTTTATAATGAACTGTG-3′. The ligation reaction was performed employing T4 DNA ligase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EL0013). Ligated full-length mRNA was purified via 8% PAA-urea gels.

Eukaryotic Cap-Flag-eGFP-ErmCL-poly(A) reporter mRNAs were generated by ligating the capped 5′-transcript to the poly(A)-tailed ErmCL oligonucleotide bridged by splinter 5′-TTTTTTGTTTGGTTTATAATCGTCCTCCTTGAAGTCGATG-3′. The enzymatic ligation was performed by T4 RNA ligase 2 (NEB, M0239) as described. Ligation products were purified employing a magnetic mRNA isolation kit (NEB, S1550S). mRNA purity and integrity were checked with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent). For assaying inosines in a natural mRNA sequence context, the following oligonucleotides were ligated to the capped Flag-eGFP 5′-transcript, GluR-B: 5′-P-AUAUGC A GCAAAACAAAAAA UAA -3′ (the A-to-I editing site is underlined; UAA stop codon in bold) and 5-HT 2C R: 5′-P-UAGCA A U A CGU AA UCCU A UUGAGCAUAGC UAA -3′ (the A-to-I editing sites are underlined; UAA stop codon in bold). The ligation sites were bridged with DNA splinters (GluR-B: 5′-TTTTTTGTTTTGCTGCATATCGTCCTCCTTGAAGTCGATG-3′ and 5-HT 2C R: 5′-CAATAGGATTACGTATTGCTACGTCCTCCTTGAAGTCGATG-3′).

### An engineered U7 small nuclear RNA scaffold greatly increases ADAR-mediated programmable RNA base editing [^112TyHsZ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

High throughput split-pool single cell screen of SmOPT-U7 variants

One benefit afforded by detectable RNA editing from a single copy is the ability to perform a high throughput pooled screen on gRNAs. Using a single cell sequencing method, each cell's RNA editing can be matched to the one gRNA present within that cell, even though the gRNA-target RNA interaction occurs in trans. Previous pooled ADAR gRNA screens have only sequenced in-cis hairpin structures, where the target RNA is physically connected to the gRNA. First, we customized a system to link endogenous mRNA editing to the individual gRNA responsible in a single-cell context. Most methods of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) only capture the 5′ or 3′ ends of transcripts and would miss an edited site within a transcript. A recent method of split-pool single-cell barcoding used in situ reverse transcription to detect specific transcripts within a cell, assisted by a Splint scaffold to organize the cell-specific ligated barcodes. We adapted this method to sequence longer (> 100 nt) stretches with sufficient transcript capture efficiency and resolution to measure RNA editing at a specific target site. Protocol improvements included: moving the universal molecular identifier (umi) onto the reverse transcription (RT) primer for better fidelity; an alternative RT enzyme active at hotter temperatures; reducing four rounds of subcode ligation to three, with Illumina indexing supplying an additional level of barcode diversity; and an improved computational analysis pipeline.

### Extracardiac manifestations of infective endocarditis and their historical descriptions [^111vZBo5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In his landmark "Gulstonian Lectures on Malignant Endocarditis", published in 1885, William Osler commented, "Few diseases present greater difficulties in the way of diagnosis than malignant endocarditis, difficulties which in many cases are practically insurmountable". At that time, the fields of microbiology and blood cultures were in their infancy, and the diagnosis was made premortem in just half the patients with the condition. After Osler's report, extracardiac physical findings became essential clues to earlier diagnosis. Today, infective endocarditis is most commonly suggested from the history and often clinched by an echocardiogram and blood cultures. Although prized physical manifestations are much less frequent now, they still do occur and may be an invaluable clue that leads to earlier, more effective treatment. The investigators review these extracardiac findings along with their historical descriptions: splinter hemorrhages, emboli, Osler's nodes, Janeway and Bowman lesions of the eye, Roth spots, petechiae, and clubbing.

### Nitrofurantoin-induced splinter hemorrhages: a forgotten culprit [^114s1mVF]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 59-year-old Hispanic woman, Fitzpatrick II skin type, presented to the office with longitudinal splinter hemorrhages involving all 10 digits of the hands. Prior to her office visit, the patient presented to the emergency room due to her nail findings. She received a work up for bacterial endocarditis which consisted of 2 blood cultures, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and chest x-ray; all of which were negative. At her office visit, the patient appeared healthy and asymptomatic on physical examination. Her only significant finding consisted of nonblanchable, distal, reddish-brown, linear hemorrhages without the presence of onycholysis (Figs 1 and 2) on all fingernails. Skin, hair, mucous membranes, and toenails were not affected. She denied a history of prosthetic heart valves, fever, chills, cardiac symptomatology, or recent physical activity involving trauma to the nails. She also denied recent use of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants, and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Her past medical history included ductal hyperplasia treated with tamoxifen and a recent UTI treated with nitrofurantoin. Her symptoms began 2 days following initiation of nitrofurantoin. An extensive laboratory workup, including autoimmune lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, beta glycoprotein, cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil antibody, perinuclear anti-neutrophil antibody, anti-proteinase 3, thromboembolic and infectious workup, and transthoracic echocardiogram, failed to show any evidence of bacterial endocarditis or other systemic disease. Only anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies were elevated (5.9 units, n: 0–0.9). The patient was advised to discontinue nitrofurantoin moving forward. At 4 week follow-up, the patient revealed no new lesions and markedly improved nail findings, with splinter hemorrhages fading (Figs 3 and 4).

### Nail abnormalities: clues to systemic disease [^1139in33]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

The visual appearance of the fingernails and toenails may suggest an underlying systemic disease. Clubbing of the nails often suggests pulmonary disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Koilonychia, or "spoon-shaped" nails, may stimulate a work-up for hemochromatosis or anemia. In the absence of trauma or psoriasis, onycholysis should prompt a search for symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The finding of Beau's lines may indicate previous severe illness, trauma, or exposure to cold temperatures in patients with Raynaud's disease. In patients with Muehrcke's lines, albumin levels should be checked, and a work-up done if the level is low. Splinter hemorrhage in patients with heart murmur and unexplained fever can herald endocarditis. Patients with telangiectasia, koilonychia, or pitting of the nails may have connective tissue disorders.

### Leukonychia: what can white nails tell Us? [^1128mo8L]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of leukonychia is clinical with the need for an additional test in a minority of cases. The diagnostic algorithm, which is presented in Fig. 14, can be a useful tool in most patients. By combining both the anatomical and the morphological classification, the most likely causes can be identified or excluded. Dermoscopy is very useful to integrate the clinical examination unmasking minor alterations not visible or unclear to the naked eye. This technique has become increasingly popular in recent years to facilitate the clinical diagnosis of nail disorders, opening up a valuable second front with a potential to avoid invasive diagnostic methods. Dermoscopy is also valuable in monitoring the evolution of a disease and response to treatment through stored images. When dealing with leukonychia, besides the morphological aspect that is clearly distinguishable by the naked eye, dermoscopy allows true leukonychia to be better distinguished from apparent leukonychia and pseudoleukonychia. The test of the whitish discoloration of the nail plate that disappears with pressure in cases of apparent leukonychia, but not in true leukonychia, can also be done with the lens of the dermoscope. Moreover, being a color abnormality, leukonychia is better appreciated with an interface solution (ultrasound gel) between the nail plate and the dermoscope lens.

In pseudoleukonychia, due to keratin granulation, dermoscopy should be done without interface solution: granulation is constituted by scales, which are better visible using the dry technique. In the presence of punctate leukonychia, dermoscopy is useful to distinguish between the true form and pseudoleukonychia and to better characterize the etiology of the latter: in superficial nail fragility, the areas of leukonychia are more regular and compacted (Fig. 15) and less cotton-candy like as they are in superficial white onychomycosis (Fig. 16). In Darier's disease, dermoscopy better shows the alternating parallel longitudinal red streaks with thinning of the corresponding nail plate and white bands. The bed vessels are more visible and associated with splinter hemorrhages. Distal splitting of the nail plate may be more or less marked, especially along the red bands (Fig. 17).

### Late sequelae of retained foreign bodies after World War II missile injuries [^111C6sfi]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

A number of people injured during the second world war harbour foreign bodies such as grenade splinters or bullets in some part of the body. Most of these metal fragments remain clinically silent. Some of them, however, may cause delayed complications. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of delayed complications associated with foreign bodies after world war II injuries. 159 patients with retained foreign bodies after world war II injuries were retrospectively identified radiologically in our data bases in the time interval from 1997 to 2009. Diverse delayed complications secondary to the metal objects were diagnosed in 3 cases (2%): one patient with grenade splinter migration into the choledochal duct, one case with pseudotumoural tissue reaction, and one patient with late osteomyelitis. The time from injury to clinical presentation varied from 56 to 61 years. PubMed and Medline were screened for additional cases with delayed sequelae after foreign body acquisition during the 2nd world war. A 30 year search period from 1980 up to date was selected. 15 cases were identified here. Our study demonstrates that health consequences of the 2nd world war extend into the present time, and therefore physicians should be aware of the presence of hidden foreign bodies and their different possible late reactions.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Ebstein's anomaly — clinical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest x-ray features: Patients with mild disease may show minimal findings other than a murmur; the jugular venous pressure is often normal even with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) due to a large compliant right atrium, central cyanosis may occur from a right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD), the first sound is loud with 1 or more systolic clicks, and the murmur of TR is holosystolic at the lower left sternal border and increases on inspiration. Characteristic ECG findings include very tall and peaked P waves ("Himalayan P waves"), a QR pattern often seen in lead V₁ that may extend to V₄, and QRS duration that is usually prolonged with a right bundle-branch block pattern that is often "splintered", followed by inverted T waves. Chest x-ray may be nearly normal in mild cases but in more severe cases shows severe enlargement, with right atrial enlargement prominent with a "globular" cardiac contour and clear lung fields, and the great arteries are usually small with an aortic root that is inconspicuous or absent.

### A local adhesive finger splint [^113LjPbM]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

A new design of a local static finger splint is proposed. The splint is made by enveloping a length of wire into double-sided adhesive tape. The skin of the region to be immobilized is covered with an adhesive skin dressing, to which the splint is then adhered. This method of attachment gives more freedom in choosing a site of splint application and prevents access obstruction to the wound, blocking of tactile areas, and circulation impairment. The splint is light, low profile, and malleable at ambient temperature. The adhesive splint was used in 5 patients to maintain the first web space open or to immobilize stiff interphalangeal joints in flexion overnight.

### The eye and the heart [^113rUJ3L]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Retinal haemorrhages

Haemorrhages occur if vessels are ruptured. These bleedings are normally large and can also break into the vitreous. Smaller haemorrhages, however, also occur if the BRB is opened at the level of both the endothelial cells (e.g. by VEGF or ET-1) and the basal membrane [by mettalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)](Figure 9). Indeed, the number of retinal haemorrhages in diabetes patients is correlated with the MMP-9 concentration in the vitreous.

Figure 9
Pathogenesis of optic disc splinter haemorrhages: Under normal conditions, the vessels in and around the optic nerve head are watertight. If the barrier is opened at the level of the endothelial cells, small molecules such as water as well as fluorescein can leak out. If, at the same time, the basal membrane in the same area is also weakened, erythrocytes can also escape. (Modified after Grieshaber and Flammer, with permission.)

Splinter haemorrhages at the border of the ONH also occur in the context of glaucoma. In these patients, VEGF, ET-1, and MMP-9are indeed increased in the circulation blood, particularly in glaucoma patients with PVD, which explains the higher prevalence of such haemorrhages in NTG patients and in females. As mentioned before, these molecules can diffuse from the choroid into the neighbouring tissue (Figure 8). However, they can also be over-expressed by the local neural tissue in cases of local hypoxia, which explains why the frequency of haemorrhages, to some extent, is reduced after IOP reduction. If the BRB is opened at the level of the endothelial cells, this can allow the escape of water and small molecules such as fluorescein. If, at the same time, the basal membrane is also weakened by MMP-9, erythrocytes can also escape (Figure 9).

### Isolated case of acquired onychodystrophy [^114DuqHy]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case

A 77-year-old otherwise healthy male presented with progressive nail dystrophy involving his fingernails that onset 10 years prior to presentation. He denied oral and other cutaneous lesions. He was otherwise feeling well without systemic symptoms. Review of systems was noncontributory and family history was unremarkable. Physical exam demonstrated dorsal pterygium with evidence of anonychia affecting multiple fingernails (Fig 1, A and B). A 3-mm punch biopsy of the right third digit nail matrix demonstrated a superficial perivascular and interface lichenoid dermatitis, predominantly lymphocytes, with jagged epidermal hyperplasia, and absence of eosinophils (Fig 2). Periodic-acid Schiff was negative for fungal elements.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Systemic amyloidosis
B. Lichen striatus
C. Dyskeratosis congenita
D. Isolated nail lichen planus (NLP)
E. Graft-versus-host disease

Answers:

A. Systemic amyloidosis – Incorrect. Nail findings seen with systemic amyloidosis include thinning and fissuring, often associated with splinter hemorrhages. Histologic examination would also reveal amyloid deposits within the nail matrix and nail bed dermis.
B. Lichen striatus – Incorrect. Lichen striatus often presents with lichenoid nail changes that are limited to 1 or 2 digits, not multiple.
C. Dyskeratosis congenita – Incorrect. Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome with characteristic symptoms including lichenoid nail changes, premalignant oral leukoplakia, and reticulated hyperpigmentation. This diagnosis is less likely in a patient presenting without the mucocutaneous triad or a family history of dystrophic nails. Furthermore, this genodermatosis usually presents in the first decade of life.
D. Isolated NLP – Correct. NLP is most frequently seen without involvement of the skin, scalp, or mucosa and clinical manifestations of NLP often include thinning of the nail plate, longitudinal ridging, fissuring, and nail atrophy. Other clinical findings include melanonychia and onychorrhexis. The clinicopathologic correlation supported a diagnosis of NLP.
E. Graft-versus-host disease – Incorrect. Although graft-versus-host disease may present with similar nail changes, additional cutaneous manifestations are often present. Additionally, this patient does not have a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to support this diagnosis.

### Challenge of nail psoriasis: an update review [^116wX1GP]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nail psoriasis is a refractory disease that affects 50–79% skin psoriasis patients and up to 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The pathogenesis of nail psoriasis is still not fully illuminated, although some peculiar inflammatory cytokines and chemokines seems to be the same as described in psoriatic skin lesions. Psoriatic nail involving matrix can cause pitting, leukonychia, red spots in lunula, and nail plate crumbling, while nail bed involvement can result in onycholysis, oil-drop discoloration, nail bed hyperkeratosis, and splinter hemorrhages. The common assessment methods of evaluating nail psoriasis includes Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), Nail Psoriasis Quality of life 10 (NPQ10), and so on. Treatment of nail psoriasis should be individualized according to the number of involving nail, the affected site of nail and presence of skin and/or joint involvement. Generally, topical therapies are used for mild nail psoriasis, while biologic agents such as etanercept are considered for severe nail disease and refractory nail psoriasis. Even though the current literature has shown some support for the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, or therapies of nail psoriasis, systemic review of this multifaceted disease is still rare to date. We elaborate recent developments in nail psoriasis epidemiology, pathogenesis, anatomy, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and therapies to raise better awareness of the complexity of nail psoriasis and the need for early diagnosis or intervention.

### Incidental finding of a retained intracorneal wooden foreign body [^1128Jkkj]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We present a case of an intracorneal wooden foreign body that remained undetected for 15 years following an ocular injury sustained during gardening. The patient presented with stable visual acuity despite the long-standing presence of a wooden splinter embedded in the cornea. Interestingly, Pentacam corneal tomography did not show any abnormalities despite the foreign body piercing through the corneal stroma and endothelium. This case may serve as an opportunity to re-examine the approach to managing chronic and stable intracorneal wooden foreign bodies and explore the implications of continued observation rather than surgical management.

### Palmoplantar pustulosis: recent advances in etiopathogenesis and emerging treatments [^112rs883]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

The primary lesion in PPP is a pustule on an erythematous and desquamative background. Lesions are localized on the palms and/or soles with a chronic and relapsing course. Patients may present with other lesions on different parts of the body as well as nail changes. The most common concomitant lesions are psoriasis vulgaris type, which were present in 24–84.21% of cases. Nail changes were observed in 30–76% of cases. Recently, Hiraiwa and Yamamoto published a retrospective review of nail changes in PPP. The most common finding was onycholysis (14/28 [50%]), followed by pitting (42.9%) and destruction of the nail (39.3%). Other nail changes included scale, subungual hyperkeratosis, subungual pustulation, indention, transverse and longitudinal ridging, curvature abnormalities, discoloration, splinter hemorrhage, and thickening of the nail.

### The role of drop shape in impact and splash [^114jmopx]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Satellite droplets collection

To collect all the satellite droplets produced by splash, the impact substrate is surrounded by white paper as illustrated in Fig. S8. The satellite droplets are collected by either the substrate or the paper walls and leave black stains, which are photographed by a digital camera. Then we measure the total stain area from both the substrate and the paper walls, which quantifies the total amount of splash. Note that the front and back side has no paper wall because we need a window for high-speed photography. To account for their absence, the stain area collected by the papers on the left and right sides are multiplied by two. Each experiment has typically repeated eight times and the statical average and standard deviation are presented.

### Honeycomb-like cavities in a single fingernail plate [^112mfR4m]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old white woman presented with a 7-month history of pain with palpation of her right third fingertip. She was initially diagnosed with chronic paronychia, and she received 16 weeks of fluconazole, as well as daily vinegar soaks for 3 months. Her symptoms persisted. During a subsequent visit, a thickened yellow nail plate of the affected digit was noted (Fig 1, A). An en face dermoscopic examination found honeycomb-like cavities (Fig 1, B). An ultrasound examination found no mass or focal fluid collection in the soft tissue or nail bed. The nail plate was removed and histologically examined (Fig 2). The periodic acid–Schiff testing was negative.

Question 1: What is the correct diagnosis?
A. Tinea unguium
B. Onychomatricoma
C. Subungual exostosis
D. Onychopapilloma
E. Glomus tumor

Answers:

A. Tinea unguium – Incorrect. Tinea unguium represents an infection of the nail plate by a dermatophyte. It typically presents with onycholysis and subungual hyperkeratosis. The PAS would be positive.
B. Onychomatricoma – Correct. Onychomatricoma is a rare benign fibroepithelial tumor that is distinguished by clinical features that may include (1) splinter hemorrhages in the proximal nail plate, (2) a thickened yellow nail plate, and (3) a longitudinal overcurvature.
C. Subungual exostosis – Incorrect. Subungual exostosis is often caused by trauma and observed on the great toe. It is a bony proliferation that presents as a painful subungual nodule with associated elevation of the nail plate.
D. Onychopapilloma – Incorrect. An onychopapilloma is a benign tumor of the nail bed and matrix. It typically presents with distal subungual keratosis and/or longitudinal erythronychia. It does not present with honeycomb-like cavities.
E. Glomus tumor – Incorrect. A glomus tumor is a neoplasm that arises from a thermoregulatory glomus body, an arteriovenous shunt, found in greater concentration on the digits. A glomus tumor presents as a tender blue-red subungual papule in a young adult.

### Clinical, dermoscopic, and pathologic features of onychopapilloma: a review of 47 cases [^113mB7JR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Onychopapilloma is a benign neoplasm of the nail bed and the distal matrix. Although not uncommon in our experience, only up to 32 cases of this tumor have been reported in the literature.

Objective

We sought to review the clinical, dermoscopic, and pathologic features of onychopapilloma.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features of 47 patients with pathologically confirmed onychopapilloma diagnosed within the last 5 years, and reviewed the published literature.

Results

The most common clinical presentation was longitudinal erythronychia (n = 25); followed by longitudinal leukonychia (n = 7); longitudinal melanonychia (n = 4); long splinter hemorrhages without erythronychia, leukonychia, or melanonychia (n = 8); and short splinter hemorrhages without erythronychia, leukonychia, or melanonychia (n = 3), with subungual mass (n = 47) and distal fissuring (n = 11). Pathology was consistent with acanthosis of the nail bed and distal matrix, with matrix metaplasia underlying distal subungual hyperkeratosis.

Limitations

This was a retrospective analysis.

Conclusion

To our knowledge, our series of onychopapilloma is the largest so far. Among various clinical presentations, longitudinal erythronychia is the most common. Dermoscopy of the free edge of the nail plate showing a small subungual keratotic mass where the band reaches the nail plate margin provides a clue for the diagnosis.

### Patterned eruption following fishnet stocking use [^111n9CSd]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following conditions is least likely to present with palpable purpura?
A. Cryoglobulinemia
B. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy
C. Microscopic polyangiitis
D. Thrombocytopenic purpura
E. Polyarteritis nodosa

Answers:

A. Cryoglobulinemia – Incorrect. Cryoglobulinemia is caused by cryoglobulins, immunoglobulins that precipitate at temperatures below 37 °C, leading to small vessel occlusion or immune complex-mediated vasculitis. It presents with palpable purpura on the lower extremities.
B. Acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy – Incorrect. This condition affects children and is characterized by leukocytoclasia of capillaries and venules. This results in palpable purpura and urticarial plaques that can be annular, polycyclic, and targetoid/cockade, often on the cheeks, ears, and extremities.
C. Microscopic polyangiitis – Incorrect. This is a perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody driven vasculitis that affects capillaries, venules, and medium-sized arteries. Clinically, patients present with palpable purpura, in addition to erythematous macules and patches, splinter hemorrhages, and ulcers.
D. Thrombocytopenic purpura – Correct. Thrombocytopenic purpura typically presents with nonpalpable purpura or petechiae due to thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, rather than the palpable purpura seen in vasculitic conditions.
E. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Polyarteritis nodosa is a vasculitis that affects medium-sized arteries and can present with palpable purpura, livedo racemosa, retiform purpura, and ulcers.

### Criteria for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients presenting with dermatologic symptoms [^115w6bgH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the occurrence of arterial and/or venous thromboembolic events and obstetric complications in the setting of circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. Dermatologic manifestations are commonly seen in APS with almost half of the patients exhibiting varied conditions such as ulceration, splinter hemorrhages, and livedo reticularis. In this paper, we report the case of a 12-year-old boy who was diagnosed with APS after presenting with livedo reticularis and positive antiphospholipid antibodies. We discuss the difficulty of diagnosing APS in patients presenting solely with dermatologic complaints, as these skin manifestations are not specific enough for APS to be included in the Sapporo diagnostic criteria. Proposed revisions to the Sapporo criteria to increase its specificity and sensitivity are also addressed.

### Scurvy presenting with limp and weakness: a case report [^1114v6nw]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Scurvy is a preventable disease caused by poor intake and/or absorption of vitamin C. Fruits and vegetables are the primary dietary source of this essential vitamin. Typically, the first symptoms of scurvy are nonspecific, including fatigue, anorexia and weight loss; these appear after 60 to 90 days of a diet lacking ascorbic acid. Cutaneous findings, including petechiae, ecchymoses, hyperkeratosis, corkscrew hairs, and perifollicular hemorrhage, can develop after about 5 months of a diet deficient in vitamin C and are frequently found in the lower extremities because the capillaries also face hydrostatic pressure. Many cutaneous manifestations are secondary to blood vessel fragility as ascorbic acid is paramount in collagen synthesis. In the gingiva, this is seen as erythema, swelling, and teeth loss. Anemia is common and partially due to iron deficiency, because vitamin C aids in iron absorption. Additional manifestations can include lower extremity edema, splinter hemorrhages, alopecia, poor wound healing, cardiac hypertrophy, psychological changes, and conjunctival hemorrhages, among many others.

### Two cases of unidentified acute compartment syndrome [^116HzNFr]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Taking into account the season and time of injury, location of injury, rapid progression of symptoms, thrombocytopaenia, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis and diplopia and/or exotropia, we postulate that the two cases described herein were atraumatic ACS secondary to mamushi (Gloydius blomhoffii) bite. However, a diagnosis could not be established owing to the lack of bite marks and clinical history of bite.

Mamushi, a venomous pit viper, is widely found in Japan and is associated with frequent incidence of bites. Its venom causes severe swelling which compresses peripheral arteries and/or lead to ACS of the extremities. This may progress to hypovolaemic shock, renal failure and/or cardiovascular disorders. It is difficult to encounter mamushi even in the daytime, because of their small size (less than 60 cm in length). They also often hide in the grass and fallen leaves. Patients usually feel only a minor pain, similar to that of an insect bite or splinter, because the mamushi fangs are only approximately 5 mm long and are very thin. As small bite marks may be difficult to observe, diagnosis by bite marks alone is almost impossible to make. The mamushi venom contains a small amount of neurotoxin, which causes diplopia, blurry vision and exotropia, owing to action on the third cranial nerve. These symptoms remit within several days to approximately 2 weeks.

In terms of thrombocytopaenia, the platelet level of patient 2 decreased significantly (2.9×10 4 /μL) on day 2 in comparison with patient 1 (9.5×10 4 /μL) on day 6. We believe that this difference may be attributed to whether the venom was directly injected into the blood vessel or not. If the venom was directly injected into the blood vessel, the platelet count would rapidly decrease to < 1.0×10⁴/μL within 1 hour of the bite.

In both cases, the patients' liver transaminase levels increased 1 day post injury. We believe that this was attributed to rhabdomyolysis same as high levels of urine myoglobin. High CK and myoglobin levels also indicate an increased risk for kidney damage and failure, as seen in patient 1.

### Dry eye syndrome preferred practice pattern ® [^116ajw4x]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Dry eye syndrome — examination and slit-lamp biomicroscopy: All patients should have a comprehensive medical eye evaluation and follow-up at the recommended intervals; this should include the evaluation of tear film and the ocular surface, particularly in preoperative cataract and refractive surgery patients, and additional evaluation of a patient who presents with symptoms suggestive of dry eye should include further testing relevant to dry eye. The external examination and slit-lamp biomicroscopy are used to document the signs of dry eye; assess the quality, quantity, and stability of the tear film; and determine other causes of ocular irritation. The external examination may include skin and eyelids with incomplete closure/malposition, incomplete or infrequent blink, eyelid lag or retraction, erythema of eyelid margins, abnormal deposits or secretions, entropion, ectropion, or blepharospasm, and eyelid eversion is needed to evaluate the status of tarsal conjunctiva; it may also include adnexa with enlargement of the lacrimal glands, proptosis, cranial nerve function, and hands with joint deformities, Raynaud phenomenon, and splinter hemorrhages. The slit-lamp biomicroscopy evaluation should focus on tear film height of the meniscus along the inferior eyelid, debris, increased viscosity, mucous strands, foamy discharge on the lid margin, and tear break-up time and pattern; eyelashes, anterior and posterior eyelid margins including meibomian gland abnormalities and secretion character, puncta patency and position and presence and position of plugs, and conjunctiva including inferior fornix/tarsal and bulbar features; lissamine green staining of conjunctiva may aid in early diagnosis in Sjögren's syndrome.

### Intrinsic anharmonic localization in thermoelectric PbSe [^114tVG6a]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Inelastic x-ray scattering

Additional phonon measurements were performed using IXS for the benefits of much smaller background and better out-of-plane Q resolution than the neutron scattering measurements. Measurements of the LA phonon were performed on a ~20 μm thick by 1 mm long splinter of the PbSe single crystal using the HERIX-30 X-ray spectrometer at beamline 30-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), with 23.7 keV (λ = 0.5226 Å) focused to a beam size of 35 μm × 10 μm. The ~20 μm thickness was chosen to maximize the scattering signal in transmission IXS measurements. The instrumental energy resolution for IXS scans was 1.5 meV (FWHM), smaller than the measured linewidths. The PbSe single crystal splinter was loaded in a 100 μm ID glass capillary with 6 μm walls and sealed under 1/3 an atmosphere of argon as a high-temperature exchange gas. The capillary was then attached to a copper heater using silver paint and sealed under a beryllium dome for high temperature measurements. Measurements of the LA phonon were performed along Q = (2 + ς, 2 + ς, 0) at T = 294 and 770 K.

### Eruptive squamous cell carcinomas with keratoacanthoma-like features in a patient treated with sorafenib [^116NNALW]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that displays antiproliferative and antiangiogenic properties in the treatment of solid tumors. Commonly administered for the treatment of metastatic or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma, sorafenib has demonstrated remarkable survival benefits for those where curative surgery is not an option. Although generally having a mild side effect profile, sorafenib has been linked to a variety of dermatologic disorders, including most commonly acneiform rash, hand-foot-skin reactions, facial erythema, splinter subungual hemorrhages, alopecia or pruritus. The authors describe a case of sorafenib-induced eruptive squamous cell carcinomas with keratoacanthoma-like features in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. This case adds to the growing literature suggesting a strong correlation between sorafenib and non-melanoma skin cancers including keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Routine dermatologic monitoring of these patients to ensure early detection is highly recommended. J Drugs Dermatol. 2011;10(3):308–310.

### Characteristic nail lesions in Kawasaki disease: case series and literature review [^115qw537]. The Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is vasculitis of unknown etiology in infants and young children. The diagnostic criteria for KD include major and minor symptoms, but various nail lesions are not described in detail. The aim of this study was to identify symptoms that are relatively found in nail of KD as diagnostic markers. After literature review, various nail lesions are classified as Beau's lines, leukonychia, onychomadesis, orange-brown chromonychia, and pincer nail deformity. The orange-brown chromonychia is the most common nail lesion in KD. In this study, the authors found three cases of KD with orange-brown chromonychia; two of these cases included rare dotted or splinter hemorrhages in the nail bed that were found on dermoscopic examination. The authors propose that these nail lesions, including hemorrhage of the nail bed, could be included as a helpful diagnosis of KD.

Role of prophylactic splenic artery embolization?

A French multicentre RCT set out to determine whether prophylactic splenic artery embolization to reduce the risk of splenectomy was comparable or better than surveillance with embolization on demand for high-grade splenic injuries. In this SPLASH (Splenic Arterial Embolization to Avoid Splenectomy) trial, both strategies resulted in a splenic rescue rate of more than 93 per cent, but many patients in the surveillance group received embolization within a few days after injury (cross-over between groups). The investigators concluded that, with follow-up including CT, surveillance with embolization on demand was acceptable practice. A supporting commentary addressed the need to take the environment for surveillance or treatment into account; for example, patients and providers may prefer angioembolization for those with long travel distances to a tertiary-care facility.

### Onychomatricoma in a patient with skin of color [^114tSXqk]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with interest the report by Oak et al, who describe a case of onychomatricoma. Onychomatricoma is a rare, benign tumor of the nail matrix that is considered to almost exclusively affect patients with lighter skin types. Indeed, in a retrospective study of 30 patients with onychomatricoma, no cases were diagnosed in patients with dark brown skin — this is especially noteworthy since the study was conducted in Brazil and Miami, 2 regions with a relatively large proportion of patients of African descent. Moreover, nail conditions are poorly represented in skin of color (SoC) to begin with, further emphasizing a need to recognize and represent nail disorders in SoC. Here, we present the case of an African American patient with onychomatricoma.

A 56-year-old African American man presented for evaluation of his left second fingernail. Starting 13 years ago, he had progressive nail thickening with discoloration; he denied pain and pruritus. Physical examination of the left second fingernail disclosed a longitudinal thickened yellow nail plate with pronounced transverse curvature (Fig 1). Dermatoscopy of the nail plate revealed splinter hemorrhages, longitudinal white lines, and open spaces in a honeycombing configuration. A nail clipping was performed and sent for histopathology, which showed hyperkeratotic nail with round lacunae (Fig 2). Periodic acid–Schiff stain failed to demonstrate fungal elements. Based on the synthesis of clinical, dermatoscopic, and histologic findings, a diagnosis of onychomatricoma was made.

Fig 1
Left second fingernail shows thickened longitudinal ridge with xanthonychia and punctate hemorrhages.

Fig 2
Histology of nail clipping displays hyperkeratotic nail with round lacunae, consistent with a diagnosis of onychomatricoma (hematoxylin and eosin, ×40 magnification).

Clinically, onychomatricoma presents with the tetrad of exaggerated transverse curvature, honeycombing, splinter hemorrhages, and xanthonychia. In addition to classic tetrad signs, longitudinal melanonychia, subungual hematoma, thickened proximal ungual fold, and dorsal pterygium may also be appreciated. It typically presents as a solitary lesion involving the fingernails. Onychomatricoma is often misdiagnosed as onychomycosis, and the differential diagnosis may include Bowen disease, fibrokeratoma, longitudinal melanonychia, osteochondroma, and subungual wart.

### Tumid lupus erythematosus-like pseudovasculitic lesions in catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome [^115TgSzT]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Skin involvement occurs in up to 49% and 70% of APS and CAPS patients, respectively, and has been characterized as pseudovasculitis, defined as lesions that evoke clinical consideration of vasculitis but for which vasculitis is histologically excluded. Pseudovasculitic skin findings are also found in occlusive vasculopathies (ie, livedo reticularis, livedo racemosa, livedoid vasculopathy, retiform purpura, digital ulcerations, necrosis, thrombophlebitis) or noninflammatory hemorrhagic disorders (ie, petechiae, purpura/ecchymosis, splinter hemorrhages). Anetoderma-like lesions, discoid lupus erythematosus, Degos-like lesions, and painful papules and nodules have also been reported in APSbut are rarely found in other occlusive vasculopathies. Tumid LE-like or urticarial papules and plaques were not described in the recently published report from the International CAPS Registry. Our case documents tumid LE-like skin findings within the pseudovasculitic spectrum of CAPS, and possibly APS more generally.

This case highlights the important role dermatologists have in the complicated diagnosis of CAPS. High index of suspicion and early diagnosis by the dermatology consult team were likely critical for this patient's survival. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to catalogue the various skin manifestations of CAPS to improve the diagnostic assessment of this life-threatening disease. We believe tumid LE-like lesions should be classified as APS pseudovasculitic lesions.

### Successful treatment of onychomatricoma with minimally invasive surgical procedures based on its pathogenesis: a case report [^116wVWTz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Onychomatricoma is a rare, benign tumor of the nail, first described by Baran and Kint in 1992. Onychomatricoma is clinically characterized by xanthonychia, increased nail thickness, increased transverse curvature of the nail, and splinter hemorrhages. Onychomatricoma is a fibroepithelial tumor that histologically arises in the nail matrix and forms a hole in the nail plate which accommodates its epithelial digitations.

Here, we report a case of onychomatricoma in a Japanese male and suggest a desirable method of surgical treatment to minimize postoperative deformity of the nail plate, in light of a recent report on the pathogenesis of onychomatricoma.

### Dermoscopic features of nail psoriasis treated with biologics [^1152oZgt]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Although psoriatic nail lesions are small, they cause considerable discomfort for patients and adversely affect quality of life. Few studies have evaluated the dermoscopic features of psoriatic nails. The aim of this study was to clarify the dermoscopic features of nail psoriasis and identify those that reflect psoriatic activity. During biologic treatment of psoriasis, six patients with psoriatic nails twice underwent dermoscopic examination, with an interval of 17–42 weeks. We used the modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index score and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score to identify and assess dermoscopic features. We identified 10 dermoscopic findings, of which disappearance of diffuse scaling of the nail plate, transverse step-like notches and splinter hemorrhages of the nail bed, and appearance of erythematous borders of the onycholytic area were associated with improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. Dermoscopy can detect nail changes during psoriasis treatment and should be used to evaluate treatment success.

### Fingernail psoriasis reconsidered: a case-control study [^1122bwp6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Literature concerning clinical signs and frequency of nail psoriasis is incomplete. Recent studies focus only on signs included in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI).

Objective

We sought to describe clinical characteristics of fingernail psoriasis in comparison with healthy controls.

Methods

We collected data on 49 patients with fingernail psoriasis who visited our outpatient department and 49 control subjects, through questionnaires and clinical examination. The disease severity was measured by the NAPSI.

Results

Mean NAPSI score in patients and control subjects was 26.6 and 3.6, respectively. Most items included in the NAPSI were specific for nail psoriasis. Onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages were most frequently observed. Leukonychia was more frequent in control subjects. Longitudinal ridges and Beau lines are not included in the NAPSI but are significantly more frequently seen in patients than in control subjects.

Limitations

Limited sample size was a limitation.

Conclusion

The NAPSI was able to discriminate patients with fingernail psoriasis from healthy control subjects. Onycholysis and splinter hemorrhages were the most prevalent fingernail changes in psoriatic patients. Leukonychia was more frequently observed in control subjects, which raises the question of whether leukonychia should remain in the NAPSI. On the other hand, longitudinal ridges and Beau lines occurred more frequently in psoriasis but are not included in the NAPSI.

### Clinical comparison of ocular and systemic findings in diagnosed cases of abusive and non-abusive head trauma [^111YCDRW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In addition, associated with retinal hemorrhages, clinically diagnosed papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure can present with a distinct pattern of retinal hemorrhages: typically intraretinal, peripapillary, splinter-like hemorrhages which are confined in or around the optic disk area, not extending to the peripheral retina. This pattern of hemorrhages can be distinguished from those hemorrhages found in conjunction with optic nerve changes found in AHT cases. Unlike hemorrhages, characteristic of classic papilledema and optic nerve edema found in the two AHT patients in this study were associated with more extensive retinal hemorrhages found in zones I and II as well as vitreous hemorrhages, likely secondary to the severity of the injury. Optic nerve edema associated with abuse is not a frequent occurrence. Studies have shown papilledema to be found in < 10% of AHT cases. In this study, only two of the patients (6.7%) had papilledema, both with extensive retinal and vitreous hemorrhages.

### Dueling dynamics of low-angle normal fault rupture with splay faulting and off-fault damage [^115CHezs]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We note that although all faults are dynamically weak at high slip rates in these models, we do not account for static frictional weakness of mature gouges in the LANF (see model 4 of ref.), which could promote slip on the LANF over younger splays with stronger immature gouges. This strength contrast may enhance LANF slip and reduce splay fault slip relative to the modeled slip distributions in Fig. 2. However, features of our modeled ruptures suggest that splay fault slip initiates in response to structurally modulated interactions between dynamic stresses and preferentially oriented pre-existing structures with little regard for shallow fault friction. For example, in the model with a 60°-dipping synthetic splay fault (Fig. 2B), dynamic stresses ahead of the deeper rupture clamp the LANF and unclamp the splay, dynamically initiating spontaneous rupture of the splay fault before the main rupture front reached the LANF-splay intersection (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, the effects such static frictional strength variations would have on shallow slip partitioning appear minor relative to first-order structural controls on shallow dynamic slip viability such as those exerted by splay fault geometry. Additional models analyzing variable friction and stress parameterizations based on different degrees of fault maturity (Supplementary Fig. S11) support this conclusion.

### ANCA-associated vasculitis with cardiac valve vegetations in two teenage males: two case reports and a literature review [^116NXKLy]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

A thorough evaluation for infection ensued on day 6 of hospitalization, which was unremarkable aside from slightly positive Aspergillus antigen in his BAL (Table 2), though our Infectious Disease colleagues doubted this was a true-positive. On hospital day 6, a chest CT-Angiogram was completed to evaluate the extent of thromboembolic phenomenon given cardiac vegetations, which showed diffuse consolidation of both lungs without evidence of pulmonary arterial embolic disease. On hospital day 6, he developed splinter hemorrhages, followed by scattered petechiae on hospital day 7 consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis that was confirmed by skin biopsy. Repeat echocardiogram on hospital day 8 re-demonstrated small mitral valve vegetation and likely perforation of the anterior leaflet near the medial annulus (Fig. 3). Rheumatology was consulted on day 9 of hospitalization due to worsening hematuria (RBC on admission 6–10/hpf, hospital day 9 with RBC now > 100/hpf) with large hemoglobinuria and worsening urine protein/creatinine ratio (now 3.72), pulmonary hemorrhage, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, absence of a detectable source of infection (Table 2), and vegetations on echocardiogram with concern for an underlying rheumatologic disorder.

### Fingertip injuries [^111ryLCb]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Fingertip injuries — mallet finger classification, presentation, imaging, and splinting management are detailed as follows: There are two classifications of mallet finger, with a tendinous mallet defined by rupture of the distal aspect of the extensor tendon and a bony mallet involving an avulsion fracture of the adjacent distal phalanx; patients present with pain, swelling, and inability to actively extend the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and a bony fragment might be palpable if an avulsion fracture is present. Initial management includes radiography to evaluate for an avulsion fracture, and most cases can be treated nonoperatively with splint immobilization for a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks. The DIP joint should be immobilized in a neutral position but can be placed in slight hyperextension, and research has shown that the proximal interphalangeal joint does not need to be concurrently immobilized. Nighttime splinting is also recommended for an additional 2 weeks after the continuous splint immobilization period is completed. Bony mallets can be immobilized for 6 to 8 weeks, whereas purely tendinous mallets should be immobilized for 8 to 12 weeks. Although no singular type of splint has shown superiority over another, stack splints are most commonly used; composite aluminum and foam splints, as well as thermoplastic splints, are also appropriate. Swan neck deformity is noted as a potential complication of untreated mallet finger.

### Swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography of diabetic papillopathy: a case report [^1137wi3P]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a case of diabetic papillopathy (DP) diagnosed using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA).

Case Presentation

A 52-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a swollen optic disc in both eyes. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye. Fundus examination demonstrated a swollen optic disc, splinter hemorrhages, and radially oriented, dilated vessels over the optic disc in both eyes. Laboratory tests revealed previously unknown diabetes. SS-OCTA was performed to rule out neovascularization of the disc (NVD). B-scan image displayed blood flow signals in the thickened retinal nerve fiber layer of the optic disc and not above the vitreoretinal interface. We diagnosed the patient with DP.

Conclusions

This case showed that SS-OCTA is useful for distinguishing DP from NVD.

Fingertip injuries — key practice recommendations include that an acutely painful subungual hematoma should be decompressed by nail trephination or removal; splinting or buddy taping for stable distal interphalangeal joint dislocations after closed reduction promotes joint stability; fingertip fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface should be referred to an orthopedic or hand surgeon; and for mallet finger, the distal interphalangeal joint should be splinted in an uninterrupted neutral position and immobilized for at least 6–8 weeks.

Jersey finger — imaging and initial management: Imaging studies, such as radiography and ultrasonography, are used to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for the presence of any associated fractures. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used for a more detailed view of the soft tissue structures and improve preoperative localization of the tendon. Once jersey finger is diagnosed, the finger should be splinted, and expedited referral to a hand surgeon should be pursued. Prompt surgical management is necessary to avoid tendon retraction and decreased blood supply that could affect surgical outcomes.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis sparing a tattoo with halo effect [^112spTc8]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case report

A man in his 40s with recent intravenous drug use and hepatitis C was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with progressive respiratory failure in the setting of multifocal pneumonia, an epidural abscess, tricuspid valve endocarditis, oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, and acute hepatorenal failure. Laboratory values on admission were notable for a white blood cell count of 20 K/μL, a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, international normalized ratio of 1.7, platelets of 30 K/μL, creatinine level of 6 mg/dL, and total bilirubin of 17.2 mg/dL. During his hospital stay, he received multiple antibiotics (levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and nafcillin) and additional new medications (octreotide, pantoprazole, albumin, furosemide, lactulose). The patient had no known history of drug allergies. On day 5 postadmission, nonretiform, palpable purpura (Fig 1) developed consisting of well-defined, nonblanching, coalescing, 2- to 3-mm bright red to purple macules and papules primarily involving the legs. No splinter hemorrhages, stellate lesions, ulcerations, or blisters were noted. No additional symptoms were elicited, as the patient was intubated. Interestingly, the eruption exhibited a "sparing phenomenon", with a 2- to 3-cm halo of clinically normal skin around his tattoos (Fig 2, A and B). Laboratory data showed a hepatitis C viral load of 323,000 IU/mL. Cryoglobulins, antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-mitochondrial antibody, and anti–smooth muscle antibody test results were all normal. A skin biopsy found a superficial perivascular neutrophilic infiltrate with sparse leukocytoclasis, red blood cell extravasation, and reactive vascular changes with complement C3 deposition, consistent with LCV (Fig 3). The etiology was presumed to be secondary to nafcillin, given the known association between penicillins and LCVand the appearance of the rash 5 days after nafcillin was initiated. As a result, his nafcillin was discontinued and vancomycin started instead. By day 14 postadmission, the vasculitis was almost fully resolved without any further interventions.

### Hyperspectral imaging in automated digital dermoscopy screening for melanoma [^114uEuEq]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Study

This study was approved by the University of California, Irvine Institutional Review Board. After obtaining informed consent, 100 pigmented lesions from 91 adults 18 years and over who presented to the Department of Dermatology at the University of California, Irvine from December 2015 to July 2018 underwent imaging with the mAID hyperspectral dermatoscope prior to removal and histopathological analysis. All imaged lesions were assessed by dermatologists as suspicious pigmented lesions requiring a biopsy. After obtaining the final histopathologic diagnoses, 30 lesions were excluded from analysis due to their non‐binary classification (i.e. not a melanoma or nevus). These categories included atypical squamous proliferation (1), basal cell carcinoma (9), granulomatous reaction to tattoo pigment (1), lentigo (4), lichenoid keratosis (1), melanotic macule (1), seborrheic keratosis (9), splinter (1), squamous cell carcinoma (2), and thrombosed hemangioma (1). Seventy mAID hyperspectral images then underwent automated computer analysis, adapted as described below following previously published methods, to create a set of melanoma imaging biomarkers. These melanoma imaging biomarkers were derived using hand‐coded feature extraction in the matlab programming environment 4. Images from 52 of the total 70 pigmented lesions were successfully processed. The remaining 18 images were excluded due to one or more of the following errors in processing: bubbles in the imaging medium, image not in focus, camera slipped during imaging, or excessive hair was present in the image obscuring the lesion. In our machine learning, ground truth was the histopathological diagnosis of melanoma or nevus that was accessed automatically during learning. The machine learning, with the melanoma imaging biomarkers as inputs, was trained to output a risk score which was the likelihood of a melanoma diagnosis. In this way, the machine learning created the best transformation algorithm to arrive at the result of the invasive test but using only the noninvasive images acquired prior to the biopsy. A summary of the melanoma classification algorithms used is listed in Table 1. The derivation of melanoma imaging biomarkers and corresponding methods of image analysis have been previously described 4. The extension of single color channel imaging biomarkers to hyperspectral imaging entailed calculating 21 values for each imaging biomarker per hyperspectral image — one for each of the 21 color channels in the hyperspectral image. Using these quantitative metrics, the algorithm generated an overall Q‐score for each image — a value between zero and one in which a higher number indicates a higher probability of a lesion being cancerous. Images were also processed by spectral fitting to produce blood volume fraction (BVF) and oxygen saturation (O 2 sat), which are candidate components in identifying metabolic and immune irregularity in melanomas (Figure 3) 16.

### Effect of cuff inflation with lidocaine, saline, and air on tracheal tube cuff pressure during laparoscopic resection of colorectal neoplasms: a randomized clinical trial [^111gchE6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary goal was to compare the tracheal tube cuff pressure at various time points in the three groups. The secondary goal was to determine the relationship between endotracheal tube cuff pressure, ΔTD, and ΔCD; tracheal mucous injury at the end of surgery; the severity of postoperative airway complications such as sore throat, hoarseness, and hemorrhage of the laryngeal mucosa at 2, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. Patient's demographic information; peak airway pressure, mean airway pressure, respiratory rate from T 0.5 to T 2; peritoneal insufflation pressure at T 1; the durations of surgery, pneumoperitoneum and anesthesia (from anesthesia induction to extubation) were also determined. The tracheal mucous injury was graded by self-made classification accordingly: 0 indicates no injury; 1 indicates congestion or edema; 2 indicates punctate hemorrhage; 3 indicates splinter hemorrhage; 4 indicates ulcer; and 5 indicates fistula. Cough, hoarseness and sore throat were graded on 0–3 scales as follows. Cough: 0 = no cough, 1 = single cough, 2 = more than one episode of unsustained cough, 3 = severe sustained bouts of cough. Hoarseness: 0 = no hoarseness at any time, 1 = no hoarseness in the interview, 2 = hoarseness in the interview noted by the patient only, and 3 = hoarseness are easily noted in the interview. Sore throat: 0 = none, 1 = less severe than with a cold, 2 = similar to that noted with a cold, 3 = more severe than with a cold.

### Nail disorders in hemodialysis patients and renal transplant recipients: a case-control study [^114L7zLE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There is one published case-control study of nail disorders in hemodialysis patients. The nail changes that occur in renal transplant recipients have not been investigated specifically.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine prevalence rates of nail disorders in hemodialysis patients and renal transplant recipients, and to investigate whether these nail pathologies are related to hemodialysis and renal transplantation.

Methods

One hundred and eighty-two hemodialysis patients and 205 renal transplant recipients were screened for the presence of nail disorders. The findings in these groups were compared with findings in 143 healthy individuals.

Results

One hundred and twenty-seven patients (69.8%) in the hemodialysis group and 116 patients (56.6%) in the renal transplant recipients had at least one type of nail pathology. Absence of lunula, splinter hemorrhage, and half-and-half nails were significantly more common in the hemodialysis patients than in the renal transplant recipients. Leukonychia was significantly more frequent in the renal transplant recipients than in the hemodialysis patients and controls.

Conclusion

Hemodialysis patients and renal transplant recipients have higher rates of nail disease than the healthy population. Renal transplantation may reduce the frequencies of splinter hemorrhage and half-and-half nails. Interestingly, leukonychia increases significantly after renal transplantation.

### Dermoscopy of subclinical nail involvement in patients with diabetes mellitus: a case-control study [^111WQH8x]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that can lead to serious complications. Nails are a mirror for general health so changes in nails can be an indicator of disease progression in patients with DM.

Aim

To detect subclinical nail changes in patients with DM using dermoscopy.

Methods

In total, 100 participants were recruited, all of them from outpatient clinics, made up of a group with DM (n = 50) and an age- and sex-matched control group without DM (n = 50). All patients had clinically apparently normal nails. In both groups, dermoscopic examinations were conducted and compared.

Results

It was found that 33 patients in the DM group (66%) had dermoscopic nail findings in the form of microhaemorrhage (26%), longitudinal striations (24%), distal subungual onychomycosis (24%), superficial pitting (20%), distal onycholysis (18%), splinter haemorrhage (14%), subungual hyperkeratosis (12%), dilated vessels (10%) and distal yellowish discoloration (8%).

Conclusion

Nail examination can be accomplished with the help of dermoscopy to detect subclinical nail changes in patients diagnosed with DM and, therefore, can give us an idea about disease progression and help with control of DM and treatment plans.

### Patterns of retinal hemorrhage associated with increased intracranial pressure in children [^112yD4Bp]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) has been proposed as an isolated cause of retinal hemorrhages (RHs) in children with suspected traumatic head injury. We examined the incidence and patterns of RHs associated with increased ICP in children without trauma, measured by lumbar puncture (LP).

Methods

Children undergoing LP as part of their routine clinical care were studied prospectively at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and retrospectively at Nationwide Children's Hospital. Inclusion criteria were absence of trauma, LP opening pressure (OP) ≥ 20 cm of water (cm H2O), and a dilated fundus examination by an ophthalmologist or neuro-ophthalmologist.

Results

One hundred children were studied (mean age: 12 years; range: 3–17 years). Mean OP was 35 cm H2O (range: 20–56 cm H2O); 68 (68%) children had OP > 28 cm H2O. The most frequent etiology was idiopathic intracranial hypertension (70%). Seventy-four children had papilledema. Sixteen children had RH: 8 had superficial intraretinal peripapillary RH adjacent to a swollen optic disc, and 8 had only splinter hemorrhages directly on a swollen disc. All had significantly elevated OP (mean: 42 cm H2O).

Conclusions

Only a small proportion of children with nontraumatic elevated ICP have RHs. When present, RHs are associated with markedly elevated OP, intraretinal, and invariably located adjacent to a swollen optic disc. This peripapillary pattern is distinct from the multilayered, widespread pattern of RH in abusive head trauma. When RHs are numerous, multilayered, or not near a swollen optic disc (eg, elsewhere in the posterior pole or in the retinal periphery), increased ICP alone is unlikely to be the cause.

### Resolution of acquired palmoplantar keratoderma and scurvy after treatment of multivitamin deficiencies [^114BS4aB]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our patient's clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic findings are consistent with malnutrition-induced scurvy and PPK. No underlying malabsorptive process or alcohol abuse disorder was identified, and his severe malnutrition has been attributed to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and/or intestinal dysmotility. Numerous causes of acquired PPK have been described, including chemicals, drugs, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, myxedema, inflammatory skin diseases, and infections. Given our patient's extensive weight loss, there was significant concern for an undiagnosed malignancy. A thorough workup, including pan computed tomography scan, flow cytometry, endoscopy, and magnetic resonance enterography, was unrevealing. Instead, the most striking clinical and laboratory findings were related to severe malnutrition, including deficiency of vitamin A, thiamine, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin D. Our patient exhibited many of the classic mucocutaneous findings of scurvy, including perifollicular hemorrhages, corkscrew hairs, ecchymoses, splinter hemorrhages, and gingival hemorrhages, as well as extracutaneous manifestations, including hemarthrosis, anemia, and vasomotor instability (ie, transient low blood pressure). His dry eye syndrome may also be due to severe malnutrition, because both hypovitaminosis A and D are known causes of dry eye syndrome. Although other etiologies of his PPK were considered, including previously described causes of thyroid dysfunctionand Whipple disease, resolution of his PPK after improvement in his overall nutritional status and vitamin repletion is most supportive of a nutritional etiology.

### Follow-up care… [^113g7ken]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Splinters are common in children and adults, most often presenting as a foreign body embedded in the superficial or subcutaneous soft tissues of the extremities. Wood, glass, and metallic splinters are among the most common retained foreign bodies. SUPERFICIAL HORIZONTAL SPLINTERS Superficial horizontal splinters are generally visible on inspection or easily palpated. The skin overlying the splinter is cleaned with povidone-iodine solution and infiltrated with 1 to 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine. Using a no. 15 scalpel blade, the skin is incised over the length of the long axis of the splinter, completely exposing it. The splinter is then easily lifted out with the blade or a forceps, and the track is cleaned with normal saline or povidone-iodine solution. Anesthesia may be spared for removal of a small, superficial splinter.

The splinter may be removed by picking it out with an 18-gauge needle, using light feathering strokes to de-roof the skin over the splinter. 2 Once the sliver is reached, it can be lifted out with the needle tip or with the aid of small forceps. A firm pinching pressure applied to the local area reduces the amount of pain the patient may feel and controls the bleeding.
15. VERTICAL SPLINTERS Splinters or foreign bodies such as needles that are at a right angle to the skin surface are usually more painful and difficult to remove. After injection of local anesthesia and a povidone-iodine cleansing, a superficial incision is made over the splinter, followed by deeper incisions around the splinter, undermining both sides of the wound. This maneuver facilitates displacement of the splinter to the middle of the wound, where it is then excised with a deep elliptic incision around the wound entrance.

To remove such a splinter, the digit is anesthetized by means of a digital nerve block, and the nail plate overlying the splinter is partially avulsed. This can be accomplished by a variety of methods. Most commonly, a V-shaped piece of nail is cut using small, but strong, scissors. The point of the V is at the proximal tip of the splinter.

### Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages in eosinophilic endomyocarditis… [^111zR9fS]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

A, Nontender, small purpuric spots on all toes. B, Linear reddish-brown streaks on the distal portions of the nail plates of all fingers. C and D, After 3 months of treatment, all lesions on the toes and fingers have completely disappeared. Histopathological findings include thrombi or thromboemboli within the blood vessels in the dermis. Janeway lesions and splinter hemorrhages are a cutaneous sign of infective endocarditis. Janeway lesions are nontender, erythematous or violaceous maculae on the palms and/or soles that are also found in several noninfective diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and myxoma. 1 Splinter hemorrhages on multiple nails without any obvious trauma are indicative. Herein, we present a case of both Janeway lesions and splinter hemorrhages that arose in eosinophilic endomyocarditis and faded away as the underlying disease improved.

Linear reddish-brown streaks were noted on the distal portions of the nail plates of all fingers, which were consistent with splinter hemorrhages. There was no history of direct trauma to the fingertips or toes. These findings fit the definition of hypereosinophilic syndrome proposed by Simon et al4 in 2010: eosinophilia found on more than 1 occasion and exclusion of secondary eosinophilia for the diagnosis. Based on these detailed clinical evaluations, we diagnosed the patient as having Janeway lesions and splinter hemorrhages associated with eosinophilic endomyocarditis secondary to hypereosinophilic syndrome, also known as Loeffler endomyocarditis. With systemic steroids and thrombolytic therapy, the patient's general condition, eosinophilia, and abnormal findings on imaging studies were mostly improved 3 months later. As he recovered from the underlying disease, the Janeway lesions and the splinter hemorrhages eventually completely disappeared.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Janeway lesions or splinter hemorrhages in eosinophilic endomyocarditis. Both cutaneous manifestations are results of distal cutaneous vascular insufficiency following multiple embolisms, which can occur from any source. 1 We speculate that the source of the embolisms in the present case was intraventricular thrombus.
