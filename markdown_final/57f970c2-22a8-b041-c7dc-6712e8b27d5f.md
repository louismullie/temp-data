## Question

how long does it take metformin to work?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long it takes metformin to work. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "work" means clinically, including immediate pharmacodynamic effects, time to meaningful A1C change, and durability. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to anchor the early time course. Next, I will review randomized trials and meta-analyses for magnitude and timing of A1C effects. After that, I should consider dose, formulation, and titration, because these modify onset and tolerability. Finally, I will synthesize a practical timeline and note special scenarios like prediabetes, combination therapy, and real-world inertia that can delay apparent benefit.

> Let me first confirm what "work" should encompass. Clinically, patients and clinicians often mean three things: how fast fasting glucose drops after starting, when A1C meaningfully declines, and whether the effect persists over time. I need to ensure I address each of these with appropriate evidence and time frames, and I should distinguish immediate pharmacodynamic effects from clinically relevant A1C changes that reflect average glycemia over roughly 8–12 weeks.

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to anchor the early time course. Metformin is not metabolized, has a plasma half-life around 2–6 hours, and reaches peak plasma concentrations about 2–3 hours after dosing, but intracellular concentrations in liver and other tissues accumulate and persist, which helps explain sustained effects despite relatively short plasma kinetics. This supports the idea that fasting glucose can begin to fall within days, even though A1C lags behind [^ec6e6905] [^4a134c78].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of A1C reduction and when it stabilizes. Meta-analyses of randomized trials show metformin monotherapy lowers A1C by about 1.0–1.2% on average, with effects typically reaching a plateau by 12–16 weeks. This timing aligns with the biology of A1C, which reflects a weighted average of glycemia over the lifespan of red blood cells, so a 12-week horizon is a reasonable minimum to judge efficacy and adjust therapy [^e7f06260] [^d91f4f25].

> Hold on, I should verify dose and formulation effects because they modify onset and tolerability. Higher doses generally yield larger A1C reductions, but gastrointestinal side effects are dose dependent. Starting low and titrating every 1–2 weeks improves tolerability and adherence, and extended-release formulations reduce GI adverse effects without sacrificing glycemic efficacy, which can help patients reach effective doses more reliably and sustain benefit [^e7f06260] [^2365e70e] [^d8b0d38f].

> Let me consider the immediate fasting glucose response, since patients often feel that "it isn't working" if they don't see early changes. In dose-ranging studies, fasting plasma glucose begins to decline within days to a week, with larger absolute reductions at higher doses. This early signal can reassure patients while we wait for A1C to catch up, but I should caution that interindividual variability is substantial and some patients need more time or dose optimization [^notfound].

> Next, I should review durability and the need for intensification. Observational and randomized data suggest that metformin's glycemic effect wanes over time in a subset, with secondary failure occurring at roughly 4–5% per year in trials, and real-world cohorts show that many patients remain on suboptimal doses for months without up-titration. This is why guidelines advise reassessing A1C every 3 months and adding therapy if targets are not met, rather than waiting for prolonged hyperglycemia [^75560db0] [^d8282e77] [^d91f4f25].

> But wait, what if the context is prediabetes rather than established diabetes. I should double-check that timeline. In the Diabetes Prevention Program, metformin reduced incident diabetes over the 3-year trial, with benefits emerging within months and persisting in long-term follow-up. This is prevention rather than treatment of overt hyperglycemia, so the "time to work" question differs, but it reinforces that metformin's metabolic effects are detectable within weeks to months in high-risk individuals [^b9892cb8] [^12b16424].

> I need to ensure I account for real-world factors that can make metformin seem "slow". Therapeutic inertia is common, with delays in dose up-titration or adding second agents despite elevated A1C, and adherence issues, especially GI intolerance with immediate-release formulations, can blunt apparent effectiveness. Using ER, slow titration, and proactive follow-up can mitigate these delays and reveal metformin's true time course more accurately [^d8282e77] [^2365e70e].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline and sanity-check it against the evidence. Within 1–2 weeks, fasting glucose often begins to fall, particularly with adequate dosing and adherence. By 4–6 weeks, many patients see a 0.5–1.0% A1C reduction if dosed optimally. By 12–16 weeks, the full A1C effect is typically realized, and this is the appropriate checkpoint to evaluate efficacy and intensify if targets are not met. Over months to years, continued benefit is expected, but vigilance for secondary failure and timely combination therapy remain essential [^e7f06260] [^d91f4f25].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the maximal A1C effect might be evident as early as 8 weeks, but I should correct that. While some patients show substantial reductions by 8 weeks, meta-analytic data and guideline practice patterns support assessing the full effect at about 12–16 weeks, which better captures the red-cell glycation kinetics and minimizes premature judgment of nonresponse [^e7f06260] [^d91f4f25].

> Finally, I should confirm special scenarios. In older adults or those with eGFR 30–45, slower titration and renal monitoring are advised, which can modestly extend the time to full dose and full effect, but the same 12–16 week reassessment principle applies. In pregnancy or when using combination therapy, expectations and timelines should be individualized, but metformin's pharmacology still supports clinically meaningful effects within weeks when used appropriately [^e68be64d] [^6e867eeb] [^7d1f0b31].

Metformin begins to lower blood glucose within **1–2 weeks** of initiation, with clinically meaningful HbA1c reductions of about 1–1.5% typically seen by **12 weeks** at therapeutic doses. Early effects on fasting glucose are often noticeable within days, but **full glycemic benefit** requires 2–3 months and ongoing adherence. Dose titration, formulation (IR vs XR), and individual response vary, so monitor glucose and adjust therapy as needed [^e7f06260] [^d8282e77] [^2365e70e].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

- **Absorption**: Metformin is absorbed in the small intestine, with peak plasma levels 2–3 hours after dosing [^ec6e6905].
- **Distribution**: It is not protein bound and accumulates in the liver, muscle, and gut, where it exerts effects [^ec6e6905].
- **Mechanism**: Primarily suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity, with additional gut-mediated effects (e.g. GLP-1 release) [^ba5b32c7].

---

## Time to onset of action

- **Immediate effects**: Fasting plasma glucose may fall within 1–2 weeks of initiation or dose increase [^notfound].
- **Clinically meaningful effects**: HbA1c typically declines by about 1–1.5% over 12 weeks at therapeutic doses (e.g. 1,500–2,000 mg/day) [^e7f06260].
- **Full effect**: Maximum HbA1c reduction is usually achieved by 12–16 weeks, reflecting red blood cell turnover and steady-state pharmacodynamics [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing onset and magnitude of effect

Several factors influence **how quickly and how much** metformin lowers glucose:

| **Factor** | **Effect on onset and magnitude** |
|-|-|
| Dose and titration | Higher doses and gradual titration improve efficacy and tolerability; typical effective dose is 1,500–2,000 mg/day [^e7f06260] [^f887ff34] |
| Formulation | Extended-release (XR) reduces GI side effects and may improve adherence, but glycemic efficacy is similar to immediate-release (IR) [^d8b0d38f] |
| Baseline HbA1c | Greater absolute HbA1c reductions occur at higher baseline levels [^notfound] |
| Adherence | Consistent use is critical; poor adherence blunts observed effect [^f0a2485b] |
| Individual variability | Age, renal function, and genetic factors modulate response [^3282b071] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting time to effect

- **Meta-analysis**: Metformin monotherapy lowers HbA1c by ~1.12% vs placebo over 12–16 weeks, with dose-dependent effects [^e7f06260].
- **Dose-response**: Higher doses (e.g. 2,000 mg/day) yield larger HbA1c reductions than lower doses (e.g. 1,000 mg/day) without excess hypoglycemia [^e7f06260].
- **Real-world data**: Up-titration within 6 months is common, but delays are frequent; earlier optimization improves outcomes [^d8282e77].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Initial monitoring**: Check fasting glucose or HbA1c at 2–3 months to assess efficacy and adjust dose or add therapy if targets are not met [^d91f4f25].
- **Dose titration**: Start low (e.g. 500 mg with meals) and increase every 1–2 weeks to minimize GI effects and reach 1,500–2,000 mg/day [^f887ff34].
- **Persistence**: Continue metformin unless contraindicated; benefits persist and it can be combined with other agents as needed [^946daa25].

## Summary of metformin's time course

| **Timeframe** | **Clinical effect** |
|-|-|
| 1–2 weeks | Fasting glucose begins to decline |
| 4–6 weeks | Noticeable HbA1c reduction (~0.5–1.0%) |
| 12–16 weeks | Full HbA1c effect (~1.0–1.5%) |
| Long-term | Sustained glycemic control and cardiometabolic benefits |

---

Metformin begins to lower glucose within 1–2 weeks, with **full HbA1c benefit by 12–16 weeks**; dose titration, adherence, and individual factors shape the response, so monitor at 2–3 months and optimize therapy accordingly [^e7f06260] [^d91f4f25].

Introduction

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should remain the first choice for therapy in all patients as other anti-hyperglycemic medications have proven to have additional benefits in certain populations. It is important to understand the risks and benefits of metformin and other anti-hyperglycemic medications before making any change in clinical practice.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^f58a303a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Is it still worth pursuing the repurposing of metformin as a cancer therapeutic? [^c16305c2]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past 15 years, there has been great interest in the potential to repurpose the diabetes drug, metformin, as a cancer treatment. However, despite considerable efforts being made to investigate its efficacy in a number of large randomised clinical trials in different tumour types, results have been disappointing to date. This perspective article summarises how interest initially developed in the oncological potential of metformin and the diverse clinical programme of work to date including our contribution to establishing the intra-tumoral pharmacodynamic effects of metformin in the clinic. We also discuss the lessons that can be learnt from this experience and whether a further clinical investigation of metformin in cancer is warranted.

### Is it still worth pursuing the repurposing of metformin as a cancer therapeutic? [^74ae92c2]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The contrast here with the approach to metformin is clear. The work was led by a team of collaborators who worked together throughout each stage of the drug development project to ensure that each step was informed by the prior. At an early point during clinical evaluation detailed pharmacodynamic assessment of the drug was carried out at several dose levels. We believe this stepwise approach to pharmacodynamic characterisation prior to Phase II/III efficacy trials optimises the chances of success in a drug repurposing programme.

Introduction

A drug is described as being 'repurposed' when it exhibits clinical benefit for the treatment of cancer patients, despite being initially developed for an unrelated indication. As drug development costs rise for new entities, there is a growing attraction in looking to off-patent medicines that have established safety and pharmacokinetic profiles potentially reducing the time to entry into the oncology clinic. Indeed, a recent estimate suggested that the median cost to develop a single cancer drug is $648 million, although other analyses have suggested far higher sums. This outlay directly results in the great expense of drug therapy for patients and health systems, often more than $100,000 per year for new cancer drugs, and contributes to inequality of access to cancer treatment. For rare cancers, where low commercial returns may be prohibitive for drug development, repurposing may be of particular value.

Metformin is the most widely prescribed medicine for type 2 diabetes worldwide and on the World Health Organisation's list of essential medicines. A series of epidemiological studies which suggested that metformin may reduce cancer incidence in diabetic populations sparked great interest in its potential as a cancer treatment. However, there remains some debate as to its pharmacodynamic effects in tumours and recent randomised trials have not clearly demonstrated clinical benefit for any cancer indication to date. In this perspective article, we present a summary of the history of preclinical and clinical studies that informed the repurposing of metformin, discuss how this programme of work could have been better focused and coordinated and lastly describe oncological indications where there remains a strong rationale for investigation.

### Metformin action: concentrations matter [^43165f6d]. Cell Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Metformin has been used for nearly a century and is now the most widely prescribed oral anti-diabetic agent worldwide. Yet how metformin acts remains only partially understood and controversial. One key reason may be that almost all previous studies were conducted with supra-pharmacological concentrations (doses) of metformin, 10–100 times higher than maximally achievable therapeutic concentrations found in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Conclusion

Since metformin was approved by the FDA in 1994 it has quickly risen to front-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin has been associated with improvement in glycemic control, weight neutrality, and low cost as well as low risk for hypoglycemia. However, recent GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor outcomes trials have impacted the guidelines for diabetes management.

Appropriately, diabetes management has recently become more outcomes-focused, shifting from concentrating exclusively on glycemic control to considering the impact these medications have on complications from diabetes. Results from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials are already influencing current guidelines. The ADA Standards of Care still recommends metformin as first-line therapy while considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c in high-risk patients. Alternatively, the EASD recently recommended considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors as the first line for patients who have certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and renal disease. The difference in the optimal diabetes treatment in high-risk, drug-naïve patients will not resolve until we have more data from a head-to-head trial comparing metformin with newer glycemic-lowering medications or conclusive evidence from previous cardiovascular outcomes trials suggesting that metformin mitigates the beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors.

While they might seem different, the two guidelines are actually similar in recommending diabetes medications with beneficial cardiovascular effects for certain high-risk patients as early as possible. Despite the current recommendations, there is still only a small portion of eligible patients who are receiving these cardio-protective medications, probably due to cost and clinical inertia. Our focus should be on expanding the use of optimal medication with cardiovascular benefits.

In summary, there are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c, yet cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Are we closer to providing better guidance for prescribing metformin and exercise to patients? [^4e3f85d5]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

The authors reasonably suggest that clinicians can keep patients on metformin while they start exercising because it will not impair clinical benefits. We agree, given there is no strong evidence that adding exercise and metformin interferes with clinical outcomes in actual patients. But we note that VO₂ max is a known predictor for morbidity/mortality, and the goal of starting patients on exercise programs is to maximize well‐being. From that lens, we need to provide clinicians better guidance on how to prescribe metformin and exercise to patients. Addressing the unresolved questions of how the metformin and exercise "medicines" interact is critical.

### Metformin as firstline treatment for type 2 diabetes: are we sure? [^9f08896d]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^c75549e5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Metformin for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e9f9a404]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether metformin can prevent or delay T2DM and its complications in people with increased risk of developing T2DM is unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin for the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the T2DM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was March 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of one year or more comparing metformin with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or standard care in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or combinations of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs randomising 6774 participants. One trial contributed 48% of all participants. The duration of intervention in the trials varied from one to five years. We judged none of the trials to be at low risk of bias in all 'Risk of bias' domains. Our main outcome measures were all-cause mortality, incidence of T2DM, serious adverse events (SAEs), cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects. The following comparisons mostly reported only a fraction of our main outcome set. Fifteen RCTs compared metformin with diet and exercise with or without placebo: all-cause mortality was 7/1353 versus 7/1480 (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.01; P = 0.83; 2833 participants, 5 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 324/1751 versus 529/1881 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.65; P < 0.001; 3632 participants, 12 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was insufficient and diverse and meta-analysis could not be performed (reported numbers were 4/118 versus 2/191; 309 participants; 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); cardiovascular mortality was 1/1073 versus 4/1082 (2416 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported no clear difference in health-related quality of life after 3.2 years of follow-up (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the direct medical costs (DMC) per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $61 to $184 in the comparator group (2416 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Eight RCTs compared metformin with intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 7/1278 versus 4/1272 (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.23; P = 0.43; 2550 participants, 4 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 304/1455 versus 251/1505 (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.37; P = 0.42; 2960 participants, 7 trials; moderate-quality evidence); the reporting of SAEs was sparse and meta-analysis could not be performed (one trial reported 1/44 in the metformin group versus 0/36 in the intensive exercise and diet group with SAEs). One trial reported that 1/1073 participants in the metformin group compared with 2/1079 participants in the comparator group died from cardiovascular causes. One trial reported that no participant died due to cardiovascular causes (very low-quality evidence). Two trials estimated the DMC per participant for metformin varying from $220 to $1177 versus $225 to $3628 in the comparator group (2400 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with acarbose: all-cause mortality was 1/44 versus 0/45 (89 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 12/147 versus 7/148 (RR 1.72, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.14; P = 0.22; 295 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence); SAEs were 1/51 versus 2/50 (101 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin with thiazolidinediones: incidence of T2DM was 9/161 versus 9/159 (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.40; P = 0.98; 320 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). SAEs were 3/45 versus 0/41 (86 participants; 1 trial; very low-quality evidence). Three RCTs compared metformin plus intensive diet and exercise with identical intensive diet and exercise: all-cause mortality was 1/121 versus 1/120 participants (450 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence); incidence of T2DM was 48/166 versus 53/166 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.92; P = 0.49; 332 participants; 2 trials; very low-quality evidence). One trial estimated the DMC of metformin plus intensive diet and exercise to be $270 per participant compared with $225 in the comparator group (94 participants; 1 trial; very-low quality evidence). One trial in 45 participants compared metformin with a sulphonylurea. The trial reported no patient-important outcomes. For all comparisons there were no data on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or microvascular complications. We identified 11 ongoing trials which potentially could provide data of interest for this review. These trials will add a total of 17,853 participants in future updates of this review.

Authors' Conclusions

Metformin compared with placebo or diet and exercise reduced or delayed the risk of T2DM in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). However, metformin compared to intensive diet and exercise did not reduce or delay the risk of T2DM (moderate-quality evidence). Likewise, the combination of metformin and intensive diet and exercise compared to intensive diet and exercise only neither showed an advantage or disadvantage regarding the development of T2DM (very low-quality evidence). Data on patient-important outcomes such as mortality, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications and health-related quality of life were sparse or missing.

### An update to the article "Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^5950ffb0]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Editorial

Metformin is not a new drug, yet its use continues to expand for an ever-increasing range of indications. Metformin is safe, relatively low cost, easy to store, and simple to administer, making it an attractive option for patients and providers alike. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of prescriptions issued for metformin in the UK doubled to more than 20 million. However when metformin scripts are issued, there are surprisingly few robust sources of evidence on which to make good clinical decisions.

To tackle this evidence gap, we recently performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies that compared different formulations of metformin, i.e. immediate release (IR), sustained release (also known as long-acting or extended release; XR), or delayed release (DR). Delayed release metformin is a new formulation, with all global rights owned by Anji Pharmaceuticals; it is currently available only to participants in clinical studies. Studies were included in our analysis if they involved a head-to-head comparison of one or more different formulations. Overall, data were available from 15 different studies that randomised a total of 3765 participants.

Currently, metformin is the first-line medication to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in most guidelines and is used daily by > 200 million patients. Surprisingly, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic action are complex and are still not fully understood. Early evidence highlighted the liver as the major organ involved in the effect of metformin on reducing blood levels of glucose. However, increasing evidence points towards other sites of action that might also have an important role, including the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbial communities and the tissue-resident immune cells. At the molecular level, it seems that the mechanisms of action vary depending on the dose of metformin used and duration of treatment. Initial studies have shown that metformin targets hepatic mitochondria; however, the identification of a novel target at low concentrations of metformin at the lysosome surface might reveal a new mechanism of action. Based on the efficacy and safety records in T2DM, attention has been given to the repurposing of metformin as part of adjunct therapy for the treatment of cancer, age-related diseases, inflammatory diseases and COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of action of metformin and discuss potential emerging novel therapeutic uses.

### Update and next steps for real-world translation of interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention: reflections from a diabetes care editors' expert forum [^806d425c]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million adults worldwide now have diabetes and 318 million have impaired glucose tolerance. These numbers are expected to increase to 642 million and 482 million, respectively, by 2040. This burgeoning pandemic places an enormous burden on countries worldwide, particularly resource-poor regions. Numerous landmark trials evaluating both intensive lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions have persuasively demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or its onset can be delayed in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, key challenges remain, including how to scale up such approaches for widespread translation and implementation, how to select appropriately from various interventions and tailor them for different populations and settings, and how to ensure that preventive interventions yield clinically meaningful, cost-effective outcomes. In June 2015, a Diabetes Care Editors' Expert Forum convened to discuss these issues. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, begins with a summary of seminal prevention trials, followed by a discussion of considerations for selecting appropriate populations for intervention and the clinical implications of the various diagnostic criteria for prediabetes. The authors outline knowledge gaps in need of elucidation and explore a possible new avenue for securing regulatory approval of a prevention-related indication for metformin, as well as specific considerations for future pharmacological interventions to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. They conclude with descriptions of some innovative, pragmatic translational initiatives already under way around the world.

### Assessment of efficacy and tolerability of once-daily extended release metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^8b82cea8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Optimising metformin therapy is hindered by multiple daily dosing and persistent gastrointestinal side effects in some patients.

- Extended release metformin is associated with better tolerability and is preferred by patients when given the choice.

- Better compliance will lead to fewer long-term complications and better health outcomes.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^08361bc3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In recent years, metformin has become the first-line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. Thus far, metformin is the only antidiabetic agent which has shown reduced macrovascular outcomes which is likely explained by its effects beyond glycemic control. It has also been employed as an adjunct to lifestyle modifications in pre-diabetes and insulin-resistant states. A large amount of evidence in literature supports its use even in cases where it would be contra-indicated mainly due to the fear of lactic acidosis which has been over-emphasized as the available data suggest that lactate levels and risk of lactic acidosis do not differ appreciably in patients taking this drug versus other glucose-lowering agents. It has also recently gained attention as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^f59065fc]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### Therapeutic challenges in diabetes prevention: we have not found the "Exercise pill" [^6a4cc618]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes has become an enormous public health burden, making diabetes prevention a pressing issue. While lifestyle modification is the most effective preventive strategy, it is resource-intensive and not universally sustainable. We review the evidence on pharmacological options for diabetes prevention, in search of a medication that is efficacious, easy to adhere to, well tolerated, and cost-effective. With the exception of metformin, most other drugs have either limited efficacy or costly side effects.

### Steps toward the meaningful translation of prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes [^32c72dc2]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

In regards to implementation of any new treatment modality, observations suggest a significant delay from the time the clinical research finding is first reported to the time when the results are translated as an integral part of clinical care. However, with the current worldwide burden of new cases of diabetes and with the associated complications and comorbidities, the need for more rapid clinical translation of prevention strategies is not in question. Each year we seem to accumulate more evidence that prevention over a longer-term period may be feasible, as the data do support efficacy of lifestyle and metformin to delay progression to diabetes to some extent over time. The economic analyses related to the cost-effectiveness of the interventions also provide important food for thought. Nevertheless, other important issues related to prevention have not been adequately addressed. Are we really preventing the disease or, in reality, only delaying the diagnosis for a few years as the data may suggest? At what point in the prediabetic state would we suggest that intervention be initiated? Is there a level for A1C that could serve as a "cut point" that would trigger intervention, or would we rely on fasting or postprandial glucose values? What is the role of the oral glucose tolerance test as an initial diagnostic tool as opposed to its use in monitoring? Thus, the data reported in this issue of Diabetes Care, combined with the reports over the past few years, provide additional evidence and, therefore, some guidance on the specifics as required to realistically support large-scale translational efforts.

The newly reported data on both long-term follow-up of subjects in the prevention studies and cost analysis, when combined with the specific focus centered on prevention by organizations such as the ADA, will continue to keep the discussion on prevention moving forward. With the current economic realities facing our nation and with the ever-changing health care delivery landscape, the financial costs of such an initiative will indeed drive the discussion. On the one hand, one can argue that we cannot afford to implement prevention on a national level. On the other hand, we could also argue that we cannot afford not to! Perhaps one day the clinical research findings regarding delaying progression to type 2 diabetes in high-risk populations will become an integral and routine aspect of our health care system.

### Pharmacologic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes in adults-2024 update [^9b450c04]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, metformin, DC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate metformin as the initial antihyperglycemic medication due to its durable efficacy in lowering HbA1c, negligible risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain, relatively mild side effect profile, long-term track record, and affordability.

### Mechanisms of action of metformin with special reference to cardiovascular protection [^d6b29567]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The choice of treatments for type 2 diabetes is wider than ever before, and several drugs have now been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and/or the risk of premature mortality in this population. Nevertheless, at the time of writing, influential diabetes management guidelines continue to identify metformin as initial antidiabetic pharmacotherapy of choice (in the absence of contraindications) more than 60 years after its first therapeutic administration to a person with diabetes. 1 It is important to place our knowledge of the actions of metformin within the current context of increased emphasis on the need to protect the cardiovascular system in type 2 diabetes. In this review, we provide a concise snapshot of current knowledge concerning the effects of metformin on glycaemia and clinical cardiovascular outcomes, together with a review of the diverse range of proposed mechanisms of action that underlie such effects.

5 CURRENT AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

Improvements in cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients randomized to SGLT2 inhibitors and some members of the GLP‐1 agonist class (reviewed elsewhere 136, 137, 138) have been received with considerable (and justified) excitement. This review has sought to review outcomes and mechanisms for metformin, a much older antidiabetes medication, and indeed one that has been clinically available for 60 years. 59

The key to a successful outcome in type 2 diabetes is successful individualization of therapy, matching the right regimen to the patient. In addition, type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease, and the needs of the patient change, from the newly diagnosed setting where the risk of a cardiovascular event is rather low to the late, perhaps insulin‐requiring stage, where cardiovascular risk is much higher. The evidence that metformin improves cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes is substantial and has been seen in randomized trials and observational studies in people with early‐ and late‐stage diabetes, as described above. In addition, metformin can be combined with any other antidiabetic agent, and this therapy can be continued for patients without contraindications as newer medications are added on. In this way, adequate glycaemic control can be maintained using a metformin‐based regimen over the long‐term, maintaining protection from microvascular complications in addition to the cardiovascular benefits of metformin. In the opinion of the authors, this evidence base justifies the retention of metformin as initial pharmacologic antidiabetes therapy.

### Metformin pharmacogenomics: current status and future directions [^3282b071]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its costs to the health care system continue to rise. Despite the availability of at least 10 drug classes for the treatment of T2D, metformin remains the most widely used first-line pharmacotherapy for its treatment; however, marked interindividual variability in response and few clinical or biomarker predictors of response reduce its optimal use. As clinical care moves toward precision medicine, a variety of broad discovery-based "omics" approaches will be required. Technical innovation, decreasing sequencing cost, and routine sample storage and processing has made pharmacogenomics the most widely applied discovery-based approach to date. This opens up the opportunity to understand the genetics underlying the interindividual variation in metformin responses in order for clinicians to prescribe specific treatments to given individuals for better efficacy and safety: metformin for those predicted to respond and alternative therapies for those predicted to be nonresponders or who are at increased risk for adverse side effects. Furthermore, understanding of the genetic determinants of metformin response may lead to the identification of novel targets and development of more effective agents for diabetes treatment. The goals of this workshop sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases were to review the state of research on metformin pharmacogenomics, discuss the scientific and clinical hurdles to furthering our knowledge of the variability in patient responses to metformin, and consider how to effectively use this increased understanding to improve patient outcomes.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^7f722977]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed antihyperglycemic medication for diabetes in the U.S. and the U.K. and is the recommended first choice for oral therapy. The role of metformin in glucose lowering has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes. However, its effectiveness in glycemic control is not well documented, although estimates based on trials suggest that it reduces glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) by 1–2% (11–22 mmol/mol). A recent systematic review suggested that this is an overestimate of effect, but the meta-analysis included only seven trials of metformin, and it did not separately examine metformin use as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic medications. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of metformin with the aim of 1) quantifying its reduction in HbA 1c, 2) exploring the different treatment effects when administered as a monotherapy or as an add-on therapy, and 3) examining head-to-head trials of low versus high metformin doses to understand the effect metformin dose has on HbA 1c reduction.

### Metformin: from mechanisms of action to therapies [^9f26f3e2]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Metformin is currently the first-line drug treatment for type 2 diabetes. Besides its glucose-lowering effect, there is interest in actions of the drug of potential relevance to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms of action remain elusive. Convincing data place energy metabolism at the center of metformin's mechanism of action in diabetes and may also be of importance in cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Metformin-induced activation of the energy-sensor AMPK is well documented, but may not account for all actions of the drug. Here, we summarize current knowledge about the different AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent mechanisms underlying metformin action.

### Metformin for COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^08637a08]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarised the effects of metformin on patients with non-severe acute covid-19 infection. Metformin might have little or no impact on mortality, and little or no difference was shown for mechanical ventilation. Similarly, the effects of metformin on admission to hospital and duration of hospital stay remain uncertain, and it has little or no impact on adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation.

The findings suggest that metformin might decrease post-covid-19 conditions; the certainty of the evidence was low. The COVID-OUT trial was the only eligible trial that reported on long covid. The authors evaluated the effects of metformin on long covid based on participant reported receipt of a diagonosis of long covid from a medical provider. Analysis of data with 1126 participants revealed that outpatient treatment with metformin reduced long covid incidence by 40%, with an absolute risk reduction of 41 per 1000 compared with placebo after 300 days of follow-up.

Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this review include our comprehensive search, duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data extraction. We evaluated the certainty of evidence with the formal application of the GRADE approach, using the minimally important differences chosen by the WHO GDG as thresholds.

The review had potential limitations. The studies included a limited range of patients in terms of presentation and severity. We identified only three relevant studies with a very limited total sample size. The effects of metformin on mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and long covid were based on a single trial. We could not analyse the time to symptom resolution because studies did not report any data. Only one study included long term follow-up, and there is a high risk of bias owing to missing data for long covid. Although the study was blinded, the reliance on participant reported diagnoses of long covid by a medical provider, without a unified diagnostic criterion, could lead to misclassification. The generalisability of the findings is limited because almost half of the participants were non-vaccinated. Moreover, WHO commissioned this review when the appearance of the trial alerted the WHO GDG to the potential importance of long covid as a key outcome of trials primarily focused on the immediate consequences of covid-19 treatment. The apparent effect of metformin on long covid could have influenced the decision to commission the review, and might contribute to lower certainty in the existence of this effect.

### Analysis of long-term follow-up of a randomized clinical trial with departures from assigned treatments: estimation of metformin effects on diabetes and its complications in the diabetes prevention program outcomes study [^1f41bd72]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was a 3-year randomized clinical trial (RCT) with evaluation of lifestyle and metformin interventions compared with placebo for diabetes prevention in high-risk adults. Both interventions significantly reduced diabetes incidence, prompting the long-term Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) to assess the progression of diabetes and its complications over 22 years. During follow-up, departures from the original metformin or placebo assignment occurred primarily because of development of diabetes that, by protocol, was managed by clinicians outside the study, after participants developed diabetes with HbA1c ≥ 7.0%. Diabetes development led to changes in metformin treatment and addition of other glucose-lowering therapies. Using statistical methods designed to estimate intervention effects despite these deviations, we consistently found that metformin reduced diabetes incidence. However, using these methods to evaluate whether use of metformin for prediabetes confers continued benefits after diabetes diagnosis did not substantially change the conclusions from those of the simpler intention-to-treat analysis that did not account for treatment changes. All of the analytic methods used resulted in similar metformin effect estimates with 95% CIs for hazard ratios including 1.0 (no effect) for all outcomes except for diabetes incidence. Elucidating metformin's long-term role in mitigating diabetes-related complications beyond its effects on diabetes prevention is challenging.

### Beyond diabetes: harnessing the power of metformin in burn care [^482f46fe]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Metformin as a hypoglycemic agent

Decades after its introduction, metformin remains the cornerstone of type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) management, widely recognized as the first-line oral glucose-lowering treatment. Its value stems from its ability to effectively lower blood glucose, its affordability, its neutral impact on weight, and its relative safety, particularly, the minimal risk of hypoglycemia and a decreased risk of cardiovascular events. In the management of T2D, metformin is effective both as a standalone treatment and when used in combination with other glucose-lowering agents. Interestingly, when used as a monotherapy, metformin can reduce fasting plasma glucose by 19%, endogenous glucose production by 18%, and is capable of inducing weight loss in individuals with higher body mass index (BMI). Additionally, metformin therapy has been shown to result in a 42% reduction in diabetes-related death. Beyond its immediate benefits, metformin has further been shown to provide lasting reductions in microvascular risk, as well as decreased risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality. These continued benefits have been observed in overweight patients even after long-term follow-up.

It's important to note that the efficacy of metformin is dose dependent. In a 14-week, multicenter, double-blind study of 451 individuals with T2D, Garber and colleagues investigated the pharmacodynamic effects of different metformin doses, compared to a placebo, on changes in fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Interestingly, researchers found the minimal effective dose to be 500 mg, while maximal efficacy was achieved at a dose of 2000 mg. At daily doses between 500 and 2000 mg, metformin reduced the adjusted mean fasting plasma glucose from baseline by 19 to 84 mg/dL and decreased the adjusted mean glycated hemoglobin levels by 0.6% to 2.0% more than the placebo. Regarding safety, treatment with metformin was well tolerated by the study participants, with no significant adverse events reported compared to the placebo group, except for mild gastrointestinal disturbances.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^602a2138]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Based on the results of clinical trials and the known risks of progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes, an ADA Consensus Development Panel concluded that people with IGT and/or IFG should be counseled on lifestyle changes with goals similar to those of the DPP (5–10% weight loss and moderate physical activity of ∼30 min/day). Regarding the more difficult issue of drug therapy for diabetes prevention, the consensus panel felt that metformin should be the only drug considered for use in diabetes prevention. For other drugs, the issues of cost, side effects, and lack of persistence of effect in some studies led the panel to not recommend use for diabetes prevention. Metformin use was recommended only for very-high-risk individuals (those with combined IGT and IFG who are obese and have at least one other risk factor for diabetes) who are under 60 years of age. In addition, the panel highlighted the evidence that in the DPP, metformin was most effective compared with lifestyle in individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and those under age 60 years.

### Metformin monotherapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^4e767a3a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, there is an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metformin is still the recommended first-line glucose-lowering drug for people with T2DM. Despite this, the effects of metformin on patient-important outcomes are still not clarified.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin monotherapy in adults with T2DM.

Search Methods

We based our search on a systematic report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and topped-up the search in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews, as well as health technology assessment reports and medical agencies. The date of the last search for all databases was 2 December 2019, except Embase (searched up 28 April 2017).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one year's duration comparing metformin monotherapy with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs in adults with T2DM.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed risk of bias, and extracted outcome data independently. We resolved discrepancies by involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs with multiple study arms (N = 10,680). The percentage of participants finishing the trials was approximately 58% in all groups. Treatment duration ranged from one to 10.7 years. We judged no trials to be at low risk of bias on all 'Risk of bias' domains. The main outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events (SAEs), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-fatal myocardial infarction (NFMI), non-fatal stroke (NFS), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Two trials compared metformin (N = 370) with insulin (N = 454). Neither trial reported on all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI, NFS or ESRD. One trial provided information on HRQoL but did not show a substantial difference between the interventions. Seven trials compared metformin with sulphonylureas. Four trials reported on all-cause mortality: in three trials no participant died, and in the remaining trial 31/1454 participants (2.1%) in the metformin group died compared with 31/1441 participants (2.2%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on SAE: in two trials no SAE occurred (186 participants); in the other trial 331/1454 participants (22.8%) in the metformin group experienced a SAE compared with 308/1441 participants (21.4%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Two trials reported on CVM: in one trial no CVM was observed and in the other trial 4/1441 participants (0.3%) in the metformin group died of cardiovascular reasons compared with 8/1447 participants (0.6%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). Three trials reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred, and in the other trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 15/1441 participants (1.0%) in the sulphonylurea group (very low-certainty evidence). One trial reported no NFS occurred (very low-certainty evidence). No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Seven trials compared metformin with thiazolidinediones (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). Five trials reported on all-cause mortality: in two trials no participant died; the overall RR was 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.39; P = 0.57; 5 trials; 4402 participants). Four trials reported on SAE, the RR was 0,95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; P = 0.49; 3208 participants. Four trials reported on CVM, the RR was 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.39; P = 0.58; 3211 participants. Three trial reported on NFMI: in two trials no NFMI occurred and in one trial 21/1454 participants (1.4%) in the metformin group experienced a NFMI compared with 25/1456 participants (1.7%) in the thiazolidinedione group. One trial reported no NFS occurred. No trial reported on HRQoL or ESRD. Three trials compared metformin with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (one trial each with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin with altogether 1977 participants). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, SAE, CVM, NFMI and NFS (very low-certainty evidence for all outcomes). One trial compared metformin with a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue (very low-certainty evidence for all reported outcomes). There was no substantial difference between the interventions for all-cause mortality, CVM, NFMI and NFS. One or more SAEs were reported in 16/268 (6.0%) of the participants allocated to metformin compared with 35/539 (6.5%) of the participants allocated to a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue. HRQoL or ESRD were not reported. One trial compared metformin with meglitinide and two trials compared metformin with no intervention. No deaths or SAEs occurred (very low-certainty evidence) no other patient-important outcomes were reported. No trial compared metformin with placebo or a behaviour changing interventions. Four ongoing trials with 5824 participants are likely to report one or more of our outcomes of interest and are estimated to be completed between 2018 and 2024. Furthermore, 24 trials with 2369 participants are awaiting assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence whether metformin monotherapy compared with no intervention, behaviour changing interventions or other glucose-lowering drugs influences patient-important outcomes.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^b3b8b905]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Metformin's known benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality, as well as its neutral effects on body weight and low risk of hypoglycemia, has led to wide recommendations for routine prescribing. However, until now, it has not been clear how different patients may respond to treatment. By separately examining the effect of metformin treatment in various groups of patients, depending on their previous antidiabetes medication, we are providing a tool to assist decisions on treatment combinations and optimal doses.

This review demonstrates that metformin treatment can be used to reduce HbA 1c in all patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of prior antihyperglycemic medication or insulin treatment. Use of higher doses of metformin resulted in modestly higher decreases in HbA 1c compared with lower doses. Metformin use in type 1 diabetes may not, however, reduce HbA 1c. Despite this, there may be other indications for treating type 1 diabetic patients with metformin because a reduction in insulin dose required in the metformin arm of these trials was observed consistent with metformin's role as an insulin sensitizer.

### Pivotal role of timely basal insulin replacement after metformin failure in sustaining long-term blood glucose control at a target in type 2 diabetes [^ff04b5fd]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes over time associates with the development of vascular complications. The causative role of long-term elevation of blood glucose is well established, at least for microvascular complications, since intervention strategies directed at reducing hyperglycemia lower onset and/or progression of microangiopathy. The role of hyperglycemia and its treatment in the development of macrovascular complications is less well established. In fact, it takes a longer time to observe a positive effect of better blood glucose control (in addition to reducing the multiple risk factors often associated with type 2 diabetes such as hypertension, visceral obesity, and hyperdyslipidemia) on macroangiopathy compared with microangiopathy. Today's understanding of the complex relationship between hyperglycemia and complications in type 2 diabetes predicates that only an early and aggressive blood glucose–lowering intervention (in addition to reduction of the above mentioned risk factors), successfully sustained over time, will translate into benefits on macrovascular complications several years later (likely 10–15 years) (,–). Thus, the present recommendation is to intensively treat people with type 2 diabetes from the clinical onset of the disease, particularly subjects with short diabetes duration who likely have not yet developed vascular complications and who presumably have a long life-expectancy.

At present, the question is not whether to intensively treat people with type 2 diabetes at onset of the disease to prevent long-term complications. The question rather is how to intensively treat type 2 diabetes over the many years and decades of the progression of the disease to consistently keep A1C levels < 7.0% over the entire cycle of type 2 diabetes. At present, this question is difficult to answer, primarily because of the lack of evidence of long-term effects of one specific intervention, compared with several other possible intervention strategies in type 2 diabetes. In addition, one should always keep in mind that type 2 diabetes is a complex disease characterized by large heterogeneity among individuals and variable progression over time that may eventually result in a nearly total loss of pancreatic β-cell function in just a few years.

### Metformin and time to sustained recovery in adults with COVID-19: the ACTIV-6 randomized clinical trial [^34b870d0]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The effect of metformin on reducing symptom duration among outpatient adults with COVID-19 has not been studied.

Objective

To assess metformin compared with placebo for symptom resolution during acute infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines platform evaluated repurposed medications for mild to moderate COVID-19. Between September 19, 2023, and May 1, 2024, participants 30 years or older with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 2 or more COVID-19 symptoms for 7 days or less were included at 90 US sites.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to receive metformin (titrated to 1500 mg, daily) or placebo for 14 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to sustained recovery (3 consecutive days without COVID-19 symptoms) within 28 days of receiving the study drug. Secondary outcomes included time to clinic visit, emergency department (ED) visit, hospitalization, or death. Safety events of interest were hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.

Results

Among 2991 participants who were randomized and received study drug, the median age was 47 (IQR, 38–58) years; 1895 (63.4%) were female, 25 (0.8%) were American Indian of Alaska Native, 77 (2.6%) were Asian, 350 (11.7%) were Black, African American, or African, 1392 (46.5%) identified as Hispanic or Latino, 8 (0.3%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 2395 (80.1%) were White, and 2044 (68.3%) reported 2 or more doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Among 1443 (48.2%) participants who received metformin and 1548 (51.8%) who received placebo, differences in time to sustained recovery were not observed (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.89–1.03; P for efficacy = .11). The median time to sustained recovery was 9 days (95% CI, 9–10) for metformin and 10 days (95% CI, 9–10) for placebo. No deaths were reported; 103 participants reported clinic visits, ED visits, or hospitalization: 54 in the metformin group and 49 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CrI, 0.82–1.78; P for efficacy = .13). Overall, 35 (1.2%) reported ED visits or hospitalization (1.1% in the metformin and 1.3% in the placebo group). Seven participants who received metformin and 3 who received placebo experienced a serious adverse event over 180 days. There were 4 episodes of participant-reported hypoglycemia in the placebo group and 2 in the metformin group.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, metformin was not shown to shorten the time to symptom resolution in low-risk adults with COVID-19. The median days to symptom resolution was numerically but not significantly lower for metformin. Safety was not a limitation in the study population.

Metformin is the recommended first-line oral glucose-lowering drug initiated to control hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. It acts in the liver, small intestines, and skeletal muscles with its major effect on decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. It is safe, inexpensive, and weight neutral and can be associated with weight loss. It can reduce microvascular complication risk and its use is associated with a lower cardiovascular mortality compared with sulfonylurea therapy. It is also used to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in treating gestational diabetes, and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

Search strategy and study selection

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1950 to June 2010. Abstracts of identified articles were reviewed by two reviewers, and full texts were examined by two reviewers (J. A.H. and R. A.). For inclusion, trials were required to fulfill the following criteria: 1) be a randomized controlled design; 2) report data on participants with diabetes; 3) have a patient follow-up of at least 12 weeks; 4) have a treatment group of metformin monotherapy, or metformin as an add-on therapy; 5) have a placebo or background treatment comparator group; 6) randomize patients to a fixed dose of metformin; 7) blind patients to oral medications; 8) use the same metformin dose for each patient in the trial; and 9) use the same fixed dose of any other oral glucose-lowering medication used in combination with metformin in both the metformin and comparator arms.

### An update to the article "Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^d8b0d38f]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results showed that in terms of glycaemic control, there were no significant differences between the different formulations. This alone is valuable evidence for the clinician who seeks to optimise the management of diabetes. However, metformin's use now extends beyond diabetes care, making evaluation of differences in other parameters increasingly important. For example metformin XR was significantly more effective than IR in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which may be an important benefit in patients with significant obesity or other metabolic disease.

A key influence on real-world efficacy of any drug is tolerability. A drug with few unpleasant side effects is much more likely to produce good results outside of the highly regulated world of clinical trials, because patients are more likely to actually take it. An important element of our study was therefore to assess whether there are significant differences between metformin formulations in terms of tolerability, in particular the likelihood of experiencing gastrointestinal side effects. Gastrointestinal effects are a major barrier to tolerating metformin therapy, affecting 20–30% of patients taking metformin. Around 1 in 20 patients will experience effects bothersome enough for them to stop taking metformin altogether. Longer-acting formulations are often recommended to patients who experience gastrointestinal side effects with immediate release metformin, based on the idea that there may be fewer unwanted effects with these preparations. Our data support the idea that metformin DR is associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects than metformin IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.66, p < 0.0001). When metformin XR is compared to metformin IR, there is also a reduction in the likelihood of adverse gastrointestinal side effects, although this does not reach our pre-specified threshold for statistical significance.

### Prevention or delay of diabetes and associated comorbidities: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^12b16424]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Metformin — diabetes prevention efficacy and candidate subgroups: In the DPP, metformin was as effective as lifestyle modification in participants with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and in younger participants aged 25–44 years, and in individuals with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) it led to an equivalent 50% reduction in diabetes risk when compared with intensive lifestyle modification. By the 15-year follow-up, higher baseline fasting glucose (≥ 110 mg/dL [≥ 6.2 mmol/L] vs. 95–109 mg/dL [5.3–5.9 mmol/L]), higher A1C (6.0–6.4% [42–46 mmol/mol] vs. < 6.0% [< 42 mmol/mol]), and a history of GDM were associated with higher risk reductions with metformin. Based on DPP findings, metformin should be recommended as an option for high-risk individuals such as younger individuals, those with history of GDM, or those with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/ m2, acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

### Narrative review of data supporting alternate first-line therapies over metformin in type 2 diabetes [^5906eb19]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses regarding metformin's effects on adverse CV outcomes provide conflicting conclusions. Limited availability of long-term evaluations of metformin hinders effective meta-analysis. For example, one recent meta-analysis of the effect of metformin on the incidence of MI included seven trials, with durations ranging from 6 months to 10 years, and with numbers of events ranging from 14 to 423. In 2019, a very large meta-analysis included more than 1 million patients, who participated in 40 randomized or observational evaluations of metformin. Treatment with metformin versus no metformin therapy was associated with reduced risk of CV death (HR 0.81; 0.79–0.84). Moreover, all-cause mortality was reduced in the overall population (HR 0.67; 0.60–0.75) in those with prior MI (HR 0.79; 0.68–0.92) and in those with prior congestive heart failure (HR 0.84; 0.81–0.87). The frequency of CV events was also reduced although no significant effect was observed in the absence of type 2 diabetes.

Overall, the randomized trials that evaluated metformin were small by current trial standards, although the 10-year UKPDS employed a considerably longer follow-up duration than most other studies. The Kaplan–Meier curves for macrovascular outcomes in the metformin and conventional therapy groups did not diverge until about 6 years into the study. Larger studies which were not designed as outcomes trials were of shorter duration and insufficient to show benefit. The ongoing VA-IMPACT outcomes trial in subjects with prediabetes will provide additional clinical data to determine the cardiovascular efficacy of metformin. Results are expected to be reported in mid-2024. However, from approval until recently, metformin has shown at least non-inferiority and many times superiority in glycemic, weight, cardiovascular, and adverse effect outcomes compared to older agents used for diabetes. These studies ultimately led to major guidelines historically recommending metformin as their first line agent.

Benefits of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i

Research has shown that GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i in combination with metformin are effective in lowering A1c, reducing cardiovascular events, preventing renal disease progression, and decreasing body weight. Key literature is summarized in Tables 2 and 3 to illustrate the proven benefits of these therapies. It is important to note that all of these studies were done in patients taking metformin at baseline. The benefits of these drug classes were the initial driving factor in joining metformin as a first-line agent for diabetes.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^f37deeef]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS/RESEARCH NEEDS

For antihyperglycemic management of type 2 diabetes, the comparative evidence basis to date is relatively lean, especially beyond metformin monotherapy. There is a significant need for high-quality comparative-effectiveness research, not only regarding glycemic control, but also costs and those outcomes that matter most to patients — quality of life and the avoidance of morbid and life-limiting complications, especially CVD. Another issue about which more data are needed is the concept of durability of effectiveness (often ascribed to β-cell preservation), which would serve to stabilize metabolic control and decrease the future treatment burden for patients. Pharmacogenetics may very well inform treatment decisions in the future, guiding the clinician to recommend a therapy for an individual patient based on predictors of response and susceptibility to adverse effects. We need more clinical data on how phenotype and other patient/disease characteristics should drive drug choices. As new medications are introduced to the type 2 diabetes pharmacopeia, their benefit and safety should be demonstrated in studies versus best current treatment, substantial enough both in size and duration to provide meaningful data on meaningful outcomes. It is appreciated, however, that head-to-head comparisons of all combinations and permutations would be impossibly large. Informed judgment and the expertise of experienced clinicians will therefore always be necessary.

### Metformin affects heme function as a possible mechanism of action [^4a134c78]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

From a biochemical perspective, several lines of evidence point to a possible mode of intracellular action of metformin. First, metformin is not metabolized in humans and is excreted rapidly from the plasma without modification, suggesting a direct modulation of molecular function(s). Second, the total daily dosage of metformin in current medical practice ranges from 1000 mg to 2500 mg, and is often taken twice daily resulting in high micromolar to low millimolar concentrations in extracellular body fluids. Measured plasma metformin can reach as high as 0.85 mM in some individuals. This observation suggests that metformin either acts with a weak pharmacokinetic potency, or its target is of high abundance, or both. Third, although reports vary widely and early reports suggested low lntracellular concentrations of metforminat 2 μM, more recent reports of the same group indicate that metformin is retained intracellularly at very high concentrations (> 200 μM intracellularly vs. 5 μM extracellularly) and can be as high as 470 μM in some individuals. Furthermore, intracellular metformin has a much longer elimination half-life (23.4 h) than in the extracellular metformin (2.7 h), suggesting that intracellular metformin-binding targets are abundant. Among common body cells (hepatocytes and erythrocytes) that have been examined, the distribution of metformin is 3–24 fold higher in the cells than in the plasma, and the clearance time in erythrocytes can be 8.7-fold longer than for plasma. Thus, a high effective concentration is needed for medical efficacy. These findings together appear to support the concept that metformin may act on cellular targets of high abundance and prevalence. Given the ubiquitous and diverse metabolic effects elicited by metformin, which includes lowering blood glucose, impairing tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and suppressing gluconeogenesis, the targets of metformin may bear a common feature among these processes both structurally and functionally.

### Efficacy of metformin therapy in patients with cancer: a meta-analysis of 22 randomised controlled trials [^eaca01a0]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our findings are based on large samples from high-quality RCTs with relatively long-term follow-up and with between-study heterogeneity as low or medium, indicating that our conclusions are relatively reliable. However, there are several significant limitations. First, there was evidence indicating that the effect of metformin use on the survival of patients with diabetes depends on the cumulative metformin dose. However, we could not obtain baseline cumulative dose values and the duration of medication for each individual; therefore, we were unable to analyze the effects of cumulative metformin dose on PFS and OS. Future studies should pay more attention to the effect of the cumulative metformin dose on the survival of cancer patients. Second, as cancer treatment has entered the epoch of precision medicine, the number of included studies was limited, and more research is required to further classify cancers, such as classification on the organ level and even pathological diagnoses on the molecular level.

### Secondary failure of metformin monotherapy in clinical practice [^75560db0]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

The Diabetes Prevention Program and other primary prevention studies have shown that metformin therapy can slow the deterioration of glycemic control in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, thus delaying progression to diabetes. This suggests that initiation of metformin as soon as diabetes is diagnosed would also help to slow the trajectory of loss in insulin secretory capacity and glycemic control, delaying the need for subsequent therapy intensification and the substantial periods of chronic hyperglycemia that typically accompany anti-hyperglycemic failure. Therefore, the current American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines for the medical management of type 2 diabetes recommend the initiation of metformin concurrently with lifestyle intervention at diagnosis.

Observational studies indicate that initiation of metformin or sulfonylurea pharmacotherapy at lower levels of hyperglycemia appears to improve the effectiveness and durability of the therapy, but in these studies, duration of diabetes (delay in initiation of therapy) did not predict time to therapy failure. However, these studies were conducted when sulfonylureas were the first-line agent of choice, and they used an A1C cut point of 8% to define initial success and secondary treatment failure. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the potential benefits of immediate versus delayed metformin initiation used with a modern A1C treatment threshold of 7%. Furthermore, although metformin fails at a rate of ∼4% per year in clinical trials, the failure rate in the real world of clinical practice has not been reported.

We therefore sought to estimate the rate of secondary metformin monotherapy experienced by unselected patients in a nonresearch setting who had a documented history of successfully lowering their A1C to < 7% with metformin. We then sought to identify factors associated with slower loss of glycemic control. Our observational analyses were conducted within a managed care plan using electronic medical records with substantial information technology support, including built-in alerts for A1C testing.

### Mechanisms of action of metformin with special reference to cardiovascular protection [^5a48d050]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Management guidelines continue to identify metformin as initial pharmacologic antidiabetic therapy of choice for people with type 2 diabetes without contraindications, despite recent randomized trials that have demonstrated significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes with newer classes of antidiabetic therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge of metformin's therapeutic actions on blood glucose and cardiovascular clinical evidence and to consider the mechanisms that underlie them. The effects of metformin on glycaemia occur mainly in the liver, but metformin-stimulated glucose disposal by the gut has emerged as an increasingly import site of action of metformin. Additionally, metformin induces increased secretion of GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells. Clinical cardiovascular protection with metformin is supported by three randomized outcomes trials (in newly diagnosed and late stage insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients) and a wealth of observational data. Initial evidence suggests that cotreatment with metformin may enhance the impact of newer incretin-based therapies on cardiovascular outcomes, an important observation as metformin can be combined with any other antidiabetic agent. Multiple potential mechanisms support the concept of cardiovascular protection with metformin beyond those provided by reduced blood glucose, including weight loss, improvements in haemostatic function, reduced inflammation, and oxidative stress, and inhibition of key steps in the process of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, metformin remains well placed to support improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, from diagnosis and throughout the course of type 2 diabetes, even in this new age of improved outcomes in type 2 diabetes.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^0f0ef4a8]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.

Discussion

Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual. Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.

Summary

Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered, multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^4a9cd489]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

In their systematic review, Gillies et al. found that lifestyle and pharmacological interventions reduced the rate of progression to type 2 diabetes in people with IGT and that these interventions seem to be as effective as pharmacological treatment. Although compliance was high, treatment effect was not sustained after treatment was stopped. According to the results of their meta-analysis, lifestyle interventions may be more important in those with higher mean baseline body mass index BMI.

The best evidence for a potential role for metformin in the prevention of type 2 diabetes comes from The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial. Lifestyle intervention and metformin reduced diabetes incidence by 58% and 31%, respectively, when compared with placebo.

At the end of the DPP study, patients were observed for a one to two week wash out period. Diabetes incidence increased from 25.2 to 30.6% in the metformin group and from 33.4 to 36.7% in the placebo group. Even after including the wash out period in the overall analysis, metformin still significantly decreased diabetes incidence (risk ratio 0.75, p = 0.005) compared with placebo. These data suggest that, at least in the short-term, metformin may help delay the onset of diabetes. The benefits of metformin were primarily observed in patients < 60 years old (RR 0.66) and in patients with a BMI greater than 35 kg/m 2 (RR 0.47) (Table 1).

### Investigating metformin for cancer prevention and treatment: the end of the beginning [^9e4348dc]. Cancer Discovery (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Laboratory research and pharmacoepidemiology are providing converging evidence that the widely used antidiabetic drug metformin has antineoplastic activity, but there are caveats. Although population studies suggest that metformin exposure is associated with reduced cancer risk and/or improved prognosis, these data are mostly retrospective and nonrandomized. Laboratory models show antineoplastic activity, but metformin concentrations used in many experiments exceed those achieved with conventional doses used for diabetes treatment. Ongoing translational research should be useful in guiding design of clinical trials, not only to evaluate metformin at conventional antidiabetic doses, where reduction of elevated insulin levels may contribute to antineoplastic activity for certain subsets of patients, but also to explore more aggressive dosing of biguanides, which may lead to reprogramming of energy metabolism in a manner that could provide important opportunities for synthetic lethality through rational drug combinations or in the context of genetic lesions associated with hypersensitivity to energetic stress.

Significance

There are tantalizing clues that justify the investigation of antineoplastic activities of biguanides. The complexity of their biologic effects requires further translational research to guide clinical trial design.

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis "supported the use of metformin as first-line therapy for T2DM" due to benefits in HbA1c, weight, and ASCVD outcomes; however, "a separate systematic review found no evidence of reduced CVD events or CVD deaths with metformin". Safety notes include that "Metformin carries a small risk of lactic acidosis and must be used with caution in patients with CKD", and for initial management "clinicians can consider a trial of lifestyle therapies for 3 to 6 months before reconsideration of metformin" in younger or mildly elevated HbA1c cases.

### Metformin should not Be used to treat prediabetes [^4d85662d]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the results of the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS), in which metformin significantly decreased the development of diabetes in individuals with baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations of 110–125 vs. 100–109 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 vs. 5.6–6.0 mmol/L) and A1C levels 6.0–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) vs. < 6.0% and in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus, it has been suggested that metformin should be used to treat people with prediabetes. Since the association between prediabetes and cardiovascular disease is due to the associated nonglycemic risk factors in people with prediabetes, not to the slightly increased glycemia, the only reason to treat with metformin is to delay or prevent the development of diabetes. There are three reasons not to do so. First, approximately two-thirds of people with prediabetes do not develop diabetes, even after many years. Second, approximately one-third of people with prediabetes return to normal glucose regulation. Third, people who meet the glycemic criteria for prediabetes are not at risk for the microvascular complications of diabetes and thus metformin treatment will not affect this important outcome. Why put people who are not at risk for the microvascular complications of diabetes on a drug (possibly for the rest of their lives) that has no immediate advantage except to lower subdiabetes glycemia to even lower levels? Rather, individuals at the highest risk for developing diabetes-i.e., those with FPG concentrations of 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or A1C levels of 6.0–6.4% (42–46 mmol/mol) or women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus-should be followed closely and metformin immediately introduced only when they are diagnosed with diabetes.

### Metformin for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease [^f2cb5342]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Metformin has been used in the management of diabetes for decades. It is an effective, low-cost intervention with a well-established safety profile. Emerging evidence suggests that metformin targets a number of pathways that lead to chronic kidney damage, and long-term use may, therefore, slow the rate of kidney function decline and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of metformin therapy on kidney function decline in patients with CKD with or without diabetes mellitus and assess the safety and dose tolerability in this population.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 19 July 2023 with assistance from an Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported kidney-related outcomes with a minimum duration of 12 months delivery of the metformin intervention and whose eligibility criteria included adult participants with either i) a diagnosis of CKD of any aetiology and/or ii) those with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Comparisons included placebo, no intervention, non-pharmacological interventions, other antidiabetic medications or any other active control. Studies that included patients on any modality of kidney replacement therapy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently carried out data extraction using a standard data extraction form. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

This review included 11 studies reporting on 8449 randomised participants. Studies were conducted in patient populations with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) (four studies) or diabetes mellitus (seven studies). Six studies compared metformin with no active control, four studies compared metformin with active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), and one study included treatment arms that randomised to either metformin, diet and lifestyle modifications, or other antidiabetic therapies. The risk of bias in included studies varied; two studies were abstract-only publications and were judged to have a high risk of bias in most domains. Other included publications were judged to have a low risk of bias in most domains. Across comparisons, GRADE evaluations for most outcomes were judged as low or very low certainty, except for those relating to side effects, tolerance, and withdrawals, which were judged as moderate certainty. The evidence suggests that compared to placebo, metformin may result in i) a slightly smaller decline in kidney function (3 studies, 505 participants: MD 1.92 mL/min, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.51; I² = 0%; low certainty), ii) very uncertain effects on the incidence of kidney failure (1 study, 753 participants: RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.17 to 8.49), iii) little or no effect on death (3 studies, 865 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.32; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) little or no effect on the incidence of serious adverse events (3 studies, 576 participants: RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) likely higher incidence of intolerance leading to study withdrawal than placebo (4 studies, 646 participants: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 3.27; I² = 0%; moderate certainty). The certainty of the evidence for proteinuria was very uncertain. Compared to other active controls (rosiglitazone, glyburide, pioglitazone, or glipizide), metformin i) demonstrated very uncertain effects on kidney function decline, ii) may result in little or no difference in death (3 studies, 5608 participants: RR 0.95 95% CI 0.63 to 1.43; I² = 0%; low certainty), iii) probably results in little or no difference in intolerance leading to study withdrawal (3 studies, 5593 participants: RR 0.92, 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.08; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), iv) probably results in little or no difference in the incidence of serious adverse events (2 studies, 5545 participants: RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.71; I² = 0%; moderate certainty), and v) may increase the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (2 studies, 3836 participants: MD 14.61, 95% CI 8.17 to 21.05; I² = 0%; low certainty). No studies reported the incidence of kidney failure.

Authors' Conclusions

This review highlights the lack of RCTs reporting on the effects of metformin on kidney function, particularly in patients with CKD. Future research in this field requires adequately powered RCTs comparing metformin to placebo or standard care in those with CKD. Seven ongoing studies were identified in this review, and future updates, including their findings, may further inform the results of this review.

### Are we closer to providing better guidance for prescribing metformin and exercise to patients? [^69cc632d]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

The main finding by Moreno‐Cabanas et al. that metformin constrains improvement to VO₂ max following an exercise training program, confirms prior work (see reviews:). In contrast with much previous work, Moreno‐Cabanas et al. report that the presence of metformin did not change the magnitude of the training responses in terms of fasting insulin sensitivity. As correctly noted by the authors, metformin is a widely prescribed, effective, inexpensive medication with few side effects. Additionally, with overwhelming evidence that exercise benefits nearly every aspect of human health, health care providers are prescribing metformin while also strongly encouraging their patients to be physically active. The context in which metformin/exercise studies are done may help explain discrepant results. There is a fundamental difference between starting an exercise regimen in people already taking metformin versus starting them together. The former illustrates how medicated patients respond to exercise in a common "real‐world" situation, whereas the latter is a more controlled experimental design that also provides clinically relevant data. Both types of studies confirm that metformin impairs the cardiorespiratory responses to training, with a key unanswered question being the following: "what is the clinical relevance?" Moreno‐Cabanas et al. suggest that the smaller gain in VO₂ max is inconsequential for glycemic outcomes. We believe this claim should be interpreted with caution. One reason is that several other studies do report that blunted gains in VO₂ max parallel attenuated insulin sensitivity (via clamp or oral glucose tolerance test), blood pressure, and mitochondrial adaptations. Another reason is that there was a substantial difference between groups of the present work in key characteristics that likely impacted results. Most notably, the metformin group had mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 152 mg/dL, a value that exceeds the threshold for overt T2D. In contrast, the exercise‐only group started with FPG < 105 mg/dL, a value only slightly above the normal range. A main outcome, HOMA‐IR was 4.7 in the metformin group but only 3.1 in the exercise‐only group, a difference that tracks with the substantial gap in FPG and indicates that, in terms of glycemic outcomes, the two groups are difficult to directly compare (however, the groups were well matched on other metabolic syndrome criteria). Does this mean participant characteristics influenced the results? This is tricky to answer, as the presence of metformin was shown to blunt VO₂ max in participants who were euglycemic, as well as those with considerable dysglycemia. But whether that blunting effect contributes to clinically relevant issues may depend on participant characteristics, the order in which metformin and exercise are prescribed, and/or which outcomes are assessed (e.g. daily/nocturnal glycemia, glycated hemoglobin, oral glucose tolerance, progression from prediabetes to diabetes).

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^9d0ce4ef]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Metformin information… [^23fe34cb]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin-containing medicines are available by prescription only and are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin helps control blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping the body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar the liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar the intestines absorb from food. Metformin-containing medicines are available as single-ingredient products and also in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes.

### Long-term metformin adherence in the diabetes prevention program outcomes study [^e14f4e7b]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Results

Study sample

Of 1073 participants who were randomized to the metformin group in DPP, 923 (86%) enrolled in the DPPOS (figure 1). Of those 923 enrolled, 868 (94%) were eligible to take study metformin during DPPOS and 664 of those (76%) took at least some study metformin at one or more DPPOS visits. The remaining 204 (24%) took no study metformin during DPPOS follow-up. Primary reasons for not continuing metformin during DPPOS included: participants stopped it during the 1–2 weeks washout period after DPP and did not restart or patient-reported GI issues. The primary focus of this report is the 664 participants who took at least some metformin during DPPOS and a subset (n = 478) from whom we collected structured interview adherence data.

Predictors of metformin discontinuation

The distribution of selected DPP and DPPOS characteristics among the 868 participants who were eligible to take study metformin at start of DPPOS were compared for participants who took any metformin (n = 664) versus participants who took no metformin (n = 204) during the 11-year follow-up (online supplemental table S1). There were several significant differences between groups, including early adherence to metformin in DPP (p < 0.001), higher income at DPP baseline (p = 0.02), and greater median number of concomitant medications during DPPOS (p = 0.04), related to taking any metformin.

### Metformin er 750 mg (metformin) [^c5b4dda3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Your doctor may have you take other medicines along with metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets to control your blood sugar. These medicines may include insulin shots. Taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets with insulin may help you better control your blood sugar while reducing the insulin dose.

Continue your exercise and diet program and test your blood sugar regularly while taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Your doctor will monitor your diabetes and may perform blood tests on you from time to time to make sure your kidneys and your liver are functioning normally. There is no evidence that metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets causes harm to the liver or kidneys.

Tell your doctor if you:

- have an illness that causes severe vomiting, diarrhea or fever, or if you drink a much lower amount of liquid than normal. These conditions can lead to severe dehydration (loss of

water in your body). You may need to stop taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a short time.

- plan to have surgery or an x-ray procedure with injection of dye (contrast agent). You may need to stop taking metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a short time.

- start to take other medicines or change how you take a medicine. Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets can affect how well other drugs work, and some drugs can

Adverse effects of metformin

Gastrointestinal

The most common side effects of metformin are nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Many patients (20–30%) report experiencing at least one of these side effects. The gastrointestinal side effects will be less impactful if metformin is taken with a meal and the dose is titrated gradually. Metformin therapy could be initiated at a low dose of 500 mg twice daily and increased by 500 mg daily every 1–2 weeks until the patient reaches the maximum tolerated dose. For those that are unable to tolerate the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with the standard immediate-release formulation, extended-release tablets are available. While most patients either tolerate the side effects or switch to the slow-release option, approximately 5% discontinue the drug due to severe GI distress. The exact mechanisms of action which result in the common GI side effects are currently unknown. Possible mechanisms may be related to high concentrations of metformin within the GI tract, an increase in serotonin within GI cells, or metformin's effect on the gut microbiome, leading to opportunistic infections. Furthermore, it has been proposed that an individual's unique microbiome might influence metformin tolerance. Metformin's relationship with the gut microbiome continues to be a topic of scientific interest.

Lactic acidosis

While the association between metformin and lactic acidosis is notably less significant compared with other biguanides, there is still a slight risk of developing lactic acidosis while taking metformin. Lactic acidosis affects 3–10 per 100,000 persons per year in patients taking metformin. Originally, it was thought that people with renal impairment could not take metformin due to an increased risk of developing this potentially lethal side effect. However, in 2016, the FDA deemed the drug safe for people with mild-to-moderate kidney impairment. Most current evidence suggests that even in patients with contraindications such as in renal, hepatic, or cardiac failure, lactic acidosis associated with metformin use is considered extremely rare.

Vitamin B12 deficiency

Malabsorption of vitamin B12 is also linked to metformin use. Several studies have found low vitamin B12 levels in patients taking metformin. The major concern with this side effect is its possible association with irreversible neurological consequences. Low levels of vitamin B12 could potentially lead to an increased prevalence of peripheral neuropathy. As a precaution, regular testing of vitamin B12 levels in patients taking metformin has been suggested. In patients with low levels of vitamin B12, an oral supplement may be recommended.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges? [^70d4a099]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Further Lifestyle Advice and Oral Agents

At the time of diagnosis, an oral agent can have quite prominent glucose-lowering effects, especially when initiated along with lifestyle instruction/modification. The rapid action of the sulfonylureas can help achieve a rapid improvement of glycemic control, and the slower onset of action by metformin can similarly lead to an 11–22 mmol/mol (1.0–2.0%) reduction of HbA 1c, assisted by reversal of glucose toxicity. As noted above, guidelines generally recommend insulin instead if HbA 1c is very high, and this would be particularly true if lifestyle already seemed good or there was suspicion of LADA or pancreatic diabetes (Fig. 1).

In continuing ambulatory care, with established oral therapy, appropriate lifestyle advice will most often already have been given, even if full application of that advice was problematic to the individual. In these circumstances, delaying insulin or other effective therapy while expecting significant further change is unwise. However, when the patient has had limited or no prior education and instruction, further lifestyle counseling in conjunction with even a moderately effective additional therapy can achieve good results.

Otherwise, all oral agents have limited efficacy in the setting of failure of one or more prior oral therapies. The reduction in HbA 1c 12 months after supplementing prior oral therapy with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or a thiazolidinedione is no more than 5–11 mmol/mol (0.5–1.0%) from a baseline of ∼64 mmol/mol (8.0%), so very few people can be expected to get to target by adding these agents alone. DPP-4 inhibitors are probably even less effective and SGLT2 blockers no more effective. At higher HbA 1c, failure to attain target levels will be inevitable without other change. In all cases, reassessment of glycemic control after 4–6 months is desirable.

### Glyburide and metformin [^a1ec4f0d]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

5. Does glyburide and metformin work differently from other glucose-control medications?

Yes it does. Glyburide and metformin combines two glucose-lowering drugs, glyburide and metformin. These two drugs work together to improve the different metabolic defects found in type 2 diabetes. Glyburide lowers blood sugar primarily by causing more of the body's own insulin to be released, and metformin lowers blood sugar, in part, by helping your body use your own insulin more effectively. Together, they are efficient in helping you achieve better glucose control.

6. What happens if my blood sugar is still too high?

When blood sugar cannot be lowered enough by glyburide and metformin your doctor may prescribe injectable insulin or take other measures to control your diabetes.

7. Can glyburide and metformin cause side effects?

Glyburide and metformin, like all blood sugar-lowering medications, can cause side effects in some patients. Most of these side effects are minor. However, there are also serious, but rare, side effects related to glyburide and metformin (see q uestions 9 through 13).

8. What are the most common side effects of glyburide and metformin?

The most common side effects of glyburide and metformin are normally minor ones such as diarrhea, nausea, and upset stomach. If these side effects occur, they usually occur during the first few weeks of therapy. Taking your glyburide and metformin with meals can help reduce these side effects.

HOW TO USE:

Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking metformin and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, consult your doctor or pharmacist. Take this medication by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually once daily with the evening meal. Drink plenty of fluids while taking this medication unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Do not crush or chew this medication. Doing so can release all of the drug at once, increasing the risk of side effects. Also, do not split the tablets unless they have a score line and your doctor or pharmacist tells you to do so. Swallow the whole or split tablet without crushing or chewing. The dosage is based on your medical condition, kidney function, and response to treatment. Your doctor may direct you to take a low dose of this medication at first, gradually increasing your dose to lower the chance of side effects such as upset stomach. Your doctor will adjust your dose based on your blood sugar levels to find the best dose for you. Follow your doctor's directions carefully. Take this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. Remember to use it at the same time each day. If you are already taking another anti-diabetic drug (such as chlorpropamide), follow your doctor's directions carefully for stopping/continuing the old drug and starting metformin. Check your blood sugar regularly as directed by your doctor. Keep track of the results, and share them with your doctor. Tell your doctor if your blood sugar measurements are too high or too low. Your dosage/treatment may need to be changed.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^332efdc3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

The management of T2DM requires aggressive treatment to achieve glycemic and cardiovascular risk factor goals. In this setting, metformin, an old and widely accepted first line agent, stands out not only for its antihyperglycemic properties but also for its effects beyond glycemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, hemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles, and fat redistribution. These properties may have contributed to the decrease of adverse cardiovascular outcomes otherwise not attributable to metformin's mere antihyperglycemic effects. Several other classes of oral antidiabetic agents have been recently launched, introducing the need to evaluate the role of metformin as initial therapy and in combination with these newer drugs. There is increasing evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies supporting its anti-proliferative role in cancer and possibly a neuroprotective effect. Metformin's negligible risk of hypoglycemia in monotherapy and few drug interactions of clinical relevance give this drug a high safety profile. The tolerability of metformin may be improved by using an appropiate dose titration, starting with low doses, so that side-effects can be minimized or by switching to an extended release form. We reviewed the role of metformin in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and describe the additional benefits beyond its glycemic effect. We also discuss its potential role for a variety of insulin resistant and pre-diabetic states, obesity, metabolic abnormalities associated with HIV disease, gestational diabetes, cancer, and neuroprotection.

Table 1.
Metformin Concentrations Used in In Vitro Studies

Table 2.
Metformin Doses Used in In Vivo Studies

In nondiabetic patients treated with 1g metformin orally, plasma concentrations reach 25 µM within 3 hours of administration, while diabetic patients chronically administered 1g metformin twice daily reach peak plasma metformin concentrations of ~40 µM. Similar values are reported in healthy volunteers treated with either 1g of the instant or extended-release formulations of metformin for 1 week, with peak plasma concentrations ranging from 5 µM to 10 µM. Another study in patients with T2D given 1 g/day to 3 g/day for 8 weeks reported median plasma metformin concentrations of ~10 µM. Taken together, although additional pharmacokinetic studies would be beneficial to the field, it is likely that the true range of therapeutic plasma metformin concentrations in humans is ~10 µM to ~40 µM. However, as discussed below, hepatic concentrations of metformin in humans are probably 2- to 3-fold higher than this due to portal vein absorption and first pass uptake of metformin by the liver following oral dosing.

Treatment Guidelines and Approaches

Treatment guidelines developed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), as well as by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE), recommend metformin as the first-choice pharmacotherapy if lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, fail to achieve glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) goals within 3 months. Metformin does not cause significant hypoglycemia, is weight neutral, inexpensive, and has a long-standing evidence base for efficacy and safety; it may even reduce the risk of CV events. On the basis of the Diabetes Prevention Program study, metformin is also recommended for individuals with prediabetes, particularly those with a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m 2, aged less than 60 years, and women with previous gestational diabetes. If metformin is contraindicated (e.g. because of decreased renal function) or not tolerated, the AACE/ACE guidelines suggest the use of one of the newer agents, such as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, SGLT2 inhibitor, or DPP-4 inhibitor, over older agents (α-glucosidase inhibitors, TZDs, and SUs). The ADA/EASD Position Statement does not prioritize treatments and instead emphasizes patient preference and individualized treatment. Individuals with T2DM benefit from learning about managing their disease, adopting a healthier lifestyle, and understanding the pros and cons of their medications. Well-structured education, such as diabetes self-management education, should aim to support informed decision-making, problem-solving, and active collaboration with the health care team to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life in a cost-effective manner. Monitoring glycemic goals via determination of HbA1c levels and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) varies according to the individual and his or her treatment.

### Metformin and lifestyle modification for the glucose intolerance or… [^76772cf3]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin and Lifestyle Modification for the Glucose Intolerance or Increased Body Mass Index in Prostate Cancer Patients. This early phase I trial compares patients who make changes in lifestyle and also take a medicine called metformin to reduce the risk of metabolic disorders. Metformin is a medicine that works to lower the amount of sugar in the blood of people with diabetes or prediabetes. It does this by lowering the amount of sugar produced in the liver. Additionally, when patients have elevated blood sugar levels there are actions they can take to reduce their chance of developing diabetes, including changing their diet and exercise habits. This study may help researchers learn more about how metformin and lifestyle modification work in people with prostate cancer and metabolic disorders.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e87d5144]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Prediabetes — pharmacologic prevention and evidence quality: We recommend that clinicians continue monitoring the most up-to-date research for evidence-based changes in practice management related to prediabetes. The evidence informing this area is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, with sample sizes low and follow-up varying from 6.0 months to 3.5 years. In patients who are poor candidates for metformin, the benefits of using an alternative medication to prevent progression of prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus slightly outweighed the potential harm of side effects, such as nausea and diarrhea. Accordingly, in adults with prediabetes who have participated in healthy lifestyle modification and remain at high risk for progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest evaluating patient characteristics (e.g., age, life expectancy, co-occurring conditions, BMI, other risk factors) and offering metformin or other select medications to reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Treatment escalation and rise in HbA1c following successful initial metformin therapy [^3fafc9cb]. Diabetes Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe secondary failure of initial metformin therapy in patients who achieved initial HbA(1c) (A1C) < 8% and to identify predictors of failure.

Research Design and Methods

We identified 1,288 patients who achieved A1C < 8% within 1 year of initiating metformin as their first-ever antihyperglycemic drug. Subjects were followed until they added/switched antihyperglycemics, they terminated health plan membership, or 31 December 2004. We defined secondary failure using two separate but overlapping approaches: 1) addition/switch to another antihyperglycemic drug or 2) first A1C measurement > 8.0% after at least 6 months on metformin.

Results

The best A1C achieved within 1 year of metformin initiation was the most powerful predictor of avoiding secondary failure. Approximately 50% of subjects whose best A1C was 7–7.9% added/switched antihyperglycemic drugs within 36 months, whereas it took > 60 months for those in the 6–6.9% A1C category to reach a 50% failure rate. Those who achieved an A1C < 6% did not reach a 50% rate of adding/switching drugs until 84 months. For the alternative secondary failure outcome, about half of those whose best A1C was 7.0–7.9% reached an A1C > 8% within 24 months. Only approximately 25% of subjects in the 6–6.9% category failed by 48 months, and > 80% of subjects in the < 6% category remained below 8% through 60 months.

Conclusions

Whether defined by adding/switching to another drug or by reaching an A1C of 8%, secondary failure is inversely associated with the reduction of A1C achieved within the 1st year of metformin monotherapy.

### Metformin and second-or third-generation sulphonylurea combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^e32e67c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. The combination of metformin and sulphonylurea (M+S) is a widely used treatment. Whether M+S shows better or worse effects in comparison with other antidiabetic medications for people with T2DM is still controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of metformin and sulphonylurea (second- or third-generation) combination therapy for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Search Methods

We updated the search of a recent systematic review from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The updated search included CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. The date of the last search was March 2018. We searched manufacturers' websites and reference lists of included trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) randomising participants 18 years old or more with T2DM to M+S compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention or metformin monotherapy with a treatment duration of 52 weeks or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles and records, assessed risk of bias and extracted outcome data independently. We used a random-effects model to perform meta-analysis, and calculated risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument.

Main Results

We included 32 RCTs randomising 28,746 people. Treatment duration ranged between one to four years. We judged none of these trials as low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains.

Trials reported more hypoglycaemic episodes with M+S combination compared to all other metformin-antidiabetic agent combinations. Results for M+S versus metformin monotherapy were inconclusive. There were no RCTs comparing M+S with metformin plus insulin. We identified nine ongoing trials and two trials are awaiting assessment. Together these trials will include approximately 16,631 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

There is inconclusive evidence whether M+S combination therapy compared with metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention results in benefit or harm for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, SAEs, macrovascular and microvascular complications) with the exception of hypoglycaemia (more harm for M+S combination). No RCT reported on health-related quality of life.

### Quantifying the effect of metformin treatment and dose on glycemic control [^e7f06260]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Metformin is the first-line oral medication recommended for glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. We reviewed the literature to quantify the effect of metformin treatment on glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels in all types of diabetes and examine the impact of differing doses on glycemic control.

Research Design and Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1950 to June 2010 for trials of at least 12 weeks' duration in which diabetic patients were treated with either metformin monotherapy or as an add-on therapy. Data on change in HbA(1c) were pooled in a meta-analysis. Data from dose-comparison trials were separately pooled.

Results

A total of 35 trials were identified for the main analysis and 7 for the dose-comparison analysis. Metformin monotherapy lowered HbA(1c) by 1.12% (95% CI 0.92–1.32; I(2) = 80%) versus placebo, metformin added to oral therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.95% (0.77–1.13; I(2) = 77%) versus placebo added to oral therapy, and metformin added to insulin therapy lowered HbA(1c) by 0.60% (0.30–0.91; I(2) = 79.8%) versus insulin only. There was a significantly greater reduction in HbA(1c) using higher doses of metformin compared with lower doses of metformin with no significant increase in side effects.

Conclusions

Evidence supports the effectiveness of metformin therapy in a clinically important lowering of HbA(1c) used as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents. There is potential for using higher doses of metformin to maximize glycemic control in diabetic patients without increasing gastrointestinal effects.

### Dose distribution and up-titration patterns of metformin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes [^d8282e77]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study showed that dosing of metformin monotherapy in people with T2DM in the United Kingdom is influenced by HbA1c levels, and in prevalent users, also by duration of disease. Up‐titration was infrequent in the first year postinitiation and was dependent on subject's age and HbA1c levels.

Metformin is widely prescribed for T2DM globally, particularly in Western countries. 13, 15, 23, 24, 25 Metformin lowers blood glucose levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced and released by the liver, and by increasing insulin sensitivity. 26 A major advantage of this therapy is weight stability or modest weight loss, in contrast to many other antihyperglycaemic medications. It may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes. 27, 28 A recent US study found that up‐titration of metformin was as effective as adding a second T2DM drug in terms of the probability of glycaemic control after 6 months. 29 Despite these positive features of metformin therapy, optimization of the metformin dose appears to be infrequent.

The median time to up‐titration in the current study was around 175 days, regardless of HbA1c level. This suggests that up‐titration, if it happens, generally happens within the first 6 months of treatment. This is in accordance with international guidelines that recommend dose optimization over the first several weeks. 7, 8, 9 Studies of time to treatment intensification, that is, switching to another drug or adding a second drug, indicate that < 40% of people on metformin monotherapy intensify their treatment within the first year, 11, 18 with median times to initiation of second‐line therapy of 2‐2.3 years, 18, 19 suggesting there is a sufficiently long lag time between metformin initiation and the time to intensification during which to up‐titrate metformin. In most of our study population, however, this had not been done.

### Pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes: the potential of incretin-based therapies [^74913a0f]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Management guidelines recommend metformin as the first-line therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled by diet and exercise. Efficacy with metformin therapy is usually of limited duration, which necessitates the early introduction of one or two additional oral agents or the initiation of injections, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists or insulin. Although safe and effective, metformin monotherapy has been associated with gastrointestinal side effects (≈20% of treated patients in randomized studies) and is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or severe liver disease. Patients treated with a sulphonylurea are at increased risk for hypoglycaemia and moderate weight gain, whereas those receiving a thiazolidinedione are subject to an increased risk of weight gain, oedema, heart failure or fracture. Weight gain and hypoglycaemia are associated with insulin use. Thus, there is an unmet need for a safe and efficacious add-on agent after initial-therapy failure. Evidence suggests that incretin-based agents, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, can successfully achieve glycaemic targets and potentially provide cardiovascular and β-cell-function benefits. This review will examine current approaches for treating type 2 diabetes and discuss the place of incretin therapies, mainly GLP-1 agonists, in the type 2 diabetes treatment spectrum.

### Role of metformin in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^8f1c0174]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrinological disorder affecting 4–12% of women and also the most controversial. Metformin was logically introduced to establish the extent to which hyperinsulinaemia influences the pathogenesis of the condition. Early studies were very encouraging. Randomized controlled studies and several metaanalyses have changed the picture and put the drug that was once heralded as magic in a much contracted place. More work is needed to establish its right place in particular with regards to the prevention of many gestational and long-term complications.

### Metformin: therapeutic profile in the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^5dd81448]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metformin (dimethyl-biguanide) can claim its origins in the use of Galega officinalis as a plant treatment for symptoms ascribed to diabetes. Since the first clinical use of metformin as a glucose-lowering agent in 1957, this medicine has emerged as a first-line pharmacological option to support lifestyle interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It acts through multiple cellular pathways, principally in the gut, liver and muscle, to counter insulin resistance and lower blood glucose without weight gain or risk of overt hypoglycaemia. Other effects include improvements in lipid metabolism, decreased inflammation and lower long-term cardiovascular risk. Metformin is conveniently combined with other diabetes medications, can be prescribed in prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to T2D, and is used in some regions to assist glycaemic control in pregnancy. Consistent with its diversity of actions, established safety profile and cost-effectiveness, metformin is being assessed for further possible clinical applications. The use of metformin requires adequate renal function for drug elimination, and may cause initial gastrointestinal side effects, which can be moderated by taking with meals or using an extended-release formulation. Thus, metformin serves as a valuable therapeutic resource for use throughout the natural history of T2D.

### Striving for early effective glycaemic and weight management in type 2 diabetes: a narrative review [^2002def9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Normoglycaemia is not the current treatment target, but even patients with moderate glycaemic control do not always receive therapy advancement according to an analysis of a large US electronic health record database. In this study, 28% of people with HbA1c > 8.0% did not receive intervention within 6 months of metformin failure. This proportion increased to 31% and 38% in people with HbA1c > 7.5% and > 7.0%, respectively. Results of a systematic review aiming to better characterize therapeutic inertia in individuals with T2D and hyperglycaemia also demonstrated that therapeutic inertia increases with decreasing HbA1c. Although there is an appropriate rationale for targeting a higher HbA1c in a minority of individuals with T2D, these findings strongly suggest that therapeutic inertia is widely present.

An individualized approach that addresses both glucose‐lowering and excess adiposity may increase the potential for achieving near‐normal or normoglycaemia. The most recent ADA/EASD consensus guideline emphasizes that glycaemic treatment targets should be individualized and that a reasonable HbA1c target is ≤ 7.0% for most nonpregnant adults, while noting that a higher HbA1c target may be reasonable for some individuals with frailty or shortened life expectancy. However, lower HbA1c targets may be also reasonable for some individuals when they can be achieved safely without hypoglycaemia or other significant adverse effects. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommends a target HbA1c of ≤ 6.5% for most people. With glucose‐lowering treatments that are associated with markedly reduced hypoglycaemia risk and with additional non‐glucose‐lowering benefits, considering glycaemic targets that approach or reach normoglycaemia, when safe and on an individualized basis, may further reduce the risk of long‐term diabetes complications.

The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Type 2 Diabetes Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) study assessed the relative effectiveness of 4 classes of glucose‐lowering therapies (a GLP‐1 RA, sulfonylurea, DPP‐4i and long‐acting insulin) added on to metformin. A total of 5047 participants with a mean (standard deviation) T2D duration of 4.0 (2.7) years were followed for a mean of 5.0 years. A cardiovascular outcomes analysis of the GRADE trial demonstrated that the use of a GLP‐1 RA (liraglutide) as second‐line therapy after metformin resulted in fewer cardiovascular outcomes compared with other antihyperglycaemic therapies. This provides additional evidence that newer glucose‐lowering therapies may further accentuate the benefits of appropriate multifactorial treatment, potentially due to the associated weight reduction. Further research to highlight these potential benefits is needed.

### Adding saxagliptin to metformin extended release (XR) or uptitration of metformin XR: efficacy on daily glucose measures [^050bfd15]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), long-term control of blood glucose levels is necessary to help prevent the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Current guidelines from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (ADA/EASD) recommend that glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) be maintained at < 7.0% in most patients but be compatible with the patient's preferences, needs, and values, in line with the goal of providing patient-centered care. Guidelines from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) recommend a stringent HbA 1c target of 6.5%. HbA 1c is influenced by increases in daily measures of glucose levels including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial glucose (PPG), which are discrete values for measures of daily glucose levels. In addition, rapid daily fluctuations in glucose levels have been implicated as particularly important in contributing to diabetes-related complications. Because average daily glucose measurements are strongly correlated with HbA 1c and are important parameters for physicians to make therapeutic decisions, and because patients understand FPG and PPG better than HbA 1c, estimation of mean daily glucose parameters is critical. Twenty-four hour mean weighted glucose (MWG) can be used to provide an indication of the mean glucose exposure of the body over an entire day.

The ADA/EASD position statement recommends combination therapy when HbA 1c goals are not achieved or maintained during approximately 3 months with monotherapy. However, uptitration of monotherapy is often practiced rather than addition of another agent, which is delayed by an average 27–35 months. The ADA/EASD and AACE/ACE recommend metformin as first-line drug therapy for T2DM. Metformin is a biguanide that helps maintain glycemic control by suppressing glucose production by the liver. Gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) are the most common adverse events reported with metformin monotherapy, although the incidence is lower with metformin extended release (XR) versus metformin immediate release (IR).

Because T2DM is a progressive disease associated with worsening hyperglycemia, intensification of treatment over time through combination therapy typically becomes necessary for most patients to maintain glycemic goals. After metformin is used, various strategies to achieve glycemic control can be applied. Antidiabetic medications with complementary mechanisms of action and differing safety and tolerability profiles can help improve glycemic outcomes with greater tolerability compared with uptitration of a single antihyperglycemic agent to the maximum dose.

### Secondary failure of metformin monotherapy in clinical practice [^59c35dad]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Long-term observational follow-up of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study cohort showed that intensively treated patients maintained lower risks for any diabetes-related end point, microvascular disease, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality well after between-group differences in glycemic control disappeared. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study observations support the hypothesis that early control of hyperglycemia creates a beneficial "legacy effect" in cardiovascular disease prevention. A recent joint statement of trialists and scientific associations further supports this point of view. The association between immediate metformin initiation and preservation of glycemic control that we now report might therefore have significant health and economic benefits.

In our data, the importance of early initiation of metformin applied to the full range of patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Presence of microvascular and macrovascular comorbidities did not affect this finding, nor did other predictors including A1C at initiation, BMI, blood pressure, lipids, adherence, or estimated glomerular filtration rate. However, it is important to note that our results are limited to the subset of metformin initiators who succeeded in lowering their A1C to < 7%. We were surprised to find that this subset included only 53% of the 3,388 patients who initiated metformin monotherapy as their first-ever anti-hyperglycemic drug. Although metformin is reported to be well tolerated and effective, in our sample, 780 (23%) patients either did not refill their initial dispense, refilled sporadically, or added or switched to a second agent within 6 months of metformin initiation. Another 709 patients were unable to reduce their A1C to below 7%. Clinicians wishing to optimize their patients' glycemic control should recognize that metformin may be less tolerable, less effective, and less durable than is commonly believed and be prepared to respond to failure quickly.

### Should metformin continue as first-line pharmacotherapy… [^0dd2a8a8]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Yes: Metformin Is Still the Best Choice Metformin has been the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus for decades. The glucose-lowering effects of metformin were first discovered in the 1920s. 1 After extensive use throughout Europe, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with a 1995 randomized controlled trial demonstrating metformin's safety and efficacy. 2 Following two decades of widespread use in the United States, extended-release and combination formulations were introduced. Adding to the known glycemic effects of metformin, the 10-year United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study found improvement in patient-oriented outcomes, specifically diabetes-related endpoints, stroke, and mortality. 3 Of note, 85% of participants randomized to protocols including metformin had their dosage titrated up to a maximum of 2, 550 mg per day.

A follow-up randomized controlled study in 2008 showed a long-term benefit with early initiation of metformin, with risk reductions in diabetes-related endpoints, diabetes-related death, myocardial infarction, and death from any cause. Because many meta-analyses are based on composite outcomes of included trials instead of individual-level patient data, nuances like these do not make the headlines. A 2022 consensus report from the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes removed metformin as first-line therapy and focused on goal-based therapy, such as secondary ASCVD reduction in patients with established ASCVD, preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease, and weight management. 17 However, selecting therapy to meet patient goals is the approach every clinician should use for those with type 2 diabetes; this does not automatically exclude the use of metformin.

The goals for each patient are different and include considerations such as costs, adverse effects, and administration. Metformin's established safety and effectiveness at A1C reduction — in addition to its relatively low cost and widespread availability to patients — make it an ideal first-line option for many patients with diabetes. Because of safety concerns, metformin is preferred over other older and inexpensive options such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones.
9. Metformin should be included in first-line medication regimens. Whether additional therapies are started concurrently or deferred depends on individual patient goals. Primary care physicians should not overstate the ASCVD benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist medications.

6 NEXT STEPS

Subsequent to the UKPDS, other key trials including people with longer diabetes duration and more established comorbidities also studied lower or more intensive HbA1c targets. These trials did not demonstrate a cardiovascular benefit from achieving lower glycaemic targets, with one study (ACCORD) suggesting potential harm. These outcomes influenced diabetes management guidelines, and the need for individualized HbA1c targets was emphasized. However, these studies occurred before the availability of newer classes of glucose‐lowering therapies with no or lower associated risk of hypoglycaemia and that provide additional nonglycaemic benefits such as a reduction in cardiovascular risk and/or cardiorenal protection.

The potential benefits of newer therapies with high or very high glucose‐lowering efficacy in people with shorter T2D duration have not been formally assessed, including assessment of treatment durability, and further research is needed. SURPASS‐EARLY (NCT05433584) is an ongoing RCT that is investigating the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide in participants with T2D on stable treatment with metformin only for at least 90 days compared to other existing treatment options when treatment is initiated early, within the first 4 years after T2D diagnosis. In this phase 4 trial, approximately 780 participants will receive either tirzepatide at the maximum‐tolerated dose or the intensified conventional care dose of the prescribed glucose‐lowering medication. The trial will run over 4 years (208 weeks), with a primary endpoint of change in HbA1c (%) from baseline assessed at 2 years (104 weeks). Key secondary endpoints include changes in HbA1c, weight and waist circumference at 104 and 208 weeks, and among other metabolic changes studied, changes from baseline in β‐cell function and insulin sensitivity will be assessed.

To evaluate the potential legacy effect associated with early treatment with GLP‐1 RAs, GIPs/GLP‐1 RAs and SGLT‐2is, long‐term follow‐up of individuals with early T2D receiving these therapies is needed. Collecting real‐world evidence for the effect of early, multifactorial intervention in individuals with T2D is paramount. These observational studies provide an important opportunity to bridge the evidence gap. Additionally, as lower, individualized HbA1c goals can be considered with newer therapies, the potential benefits and long‐term outcomes of HbA1c targets in the prediabetes (< 6.5%) and normal (< 5.7%) ranges can be assessed. Looking into the future, novel therapies which may include additional targets and/or formulations may bring further promise of glucose lowering and weight loss and the potential to alter the course of metabolic health.

### Metformin in gestational diabetes: physiological actions and clinical applications [^6e867eeb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Metformin is an effective oral hypoglycaemic agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, its use in pregnancy for the treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains controversial owing to concerns around safety and efficacy. This comprehensive review outlines the physiological metabolic functions of metformin and synthesizes existing literature and key knowledge gaps pertaining to the use of metformin in pregnancy across various end points in women with GDM. On the basis of current evidence, metformin reduces gestational weight gain, neonatal hypoglycaemia and macrosomia and increases insulin sensitivity. However, considerable heterogeneity between existing studies and the grouping of aggregate and often inharmonious data within meta-analyses has led to disparate findings regarding the efficacy of metformin in treating hyperglycaemia in GDM. Innovative analytical approaches with stratification by individual-level characteristics (for example, obesity, ethnicity, GDM severity and so on) and treatment regimens (diagnostic criteria, treatment timing and follow-up duration) are needed to establish efficacy across a range of end points and to identify which, if any, subgroups might benefit from metformin treatment during pregnancy.

It further states, "Good practice in PCOS and IVF is the use of a GnRH antagonist protocol as it gives the flexibility of using a GnRH agonist trigger, freeze all strategy to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, if using a GnRH agonist long protocol then metformin could be considered". If metformin is used, "the following could be considered" including "Commence metformin at the start of GnRH agonist treatment", "Gradually titrate metformin up to a dose of between 1000mg to 2500mg daily in order to minimize side effects", and "Stopping metformin therapy at the time of the pregnancy test or pregnancy, unless the metformin therapy is otherwise indicated".

The randomized double-blind clinical trial of metformin or placebo followed by a 7-8-year open-label extension and analysis of adverse events, tolerability, and the effect of adherence on change in weight and waist circumference.

Results

No significant safety issues were identified. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in metformin than placebo participants and declined over time. During the DPP, average hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were slightly lower in the metformin group than in the placebo group. Decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit in the metformin group occurred during the first year following randomization, with no further changes observed over time. During the DPP, metformin participants had reduced body weight and waist circumference compared with placebo (weight by 2.06 ± 5.65% vs. 0.02 ± 5.52%, P < 0.001, and waist circumference by 2.13 ± 7.06 cm vs. 0.79 ± 6.54 cm, P < 0.001 in metformin vs. placebo, respectively). The magnitude of weight loss during the 2-year double-blind period was directly related to adherence (P < 0.001). Throughout the unblinded follow-up, weight loss remained significantly greater in the metformin group than in the placebo group (2.0 vs. 0.2%, P < 0.001), and this was related to the degree of continuing metformin adherence (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Metformin used for diabetes prevention is safe and well tolerated. Weight loss is related to adherence to metformin and is durable for at least 10 years of treatment.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^d91f4f25]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Step 2: addition of a second medication.

If lifestyle intervention and the maximal tolerated dose of metformin fail to achieve or sustain the glycemic goals, another medication should be added within 2–3 months of the initiation of therapy or at any time when the target A1C level is not achieved. Another medication may also be necessary if metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. The consensus regarding the second medication added to metformin was to choose either insulin or a sulfonylurea (Fig. 2). As discussed above, the A1C level will determine in part which agent is selected next, with consideration given to the more effective glycemia-lowering agent, insulin, for patients with an A1C level of > 8.5% or with symptoms secondary to ehyperglycemia. Insulin can be initiated with a basal (intermediate- or long-acting) insulin (see Fig. 1 for suggested initial insulin regimens). However, many newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients will usually respond to oral medications, even if symptoms of ehyperglycemia are present.

Step 3: further adjustments.

If lifestyle, metformin, and sulfonylurea or basal insulin do not result in achievement of target glycemia, the next step should be to start, or intensify, insulin therapy (Fig. 1). Intensification of insulin therapy usually consists of additional injections that might include a short- or rapid-acting insulin given before selected meals to reduce postprandial glucose excursions (Fig. 1). When insulin injections are started, insulin secretagogues (sulfonylurea or glinides) should be discontinued, or tapered and then discontinued, since they are not considered to be synergistic. Although addition of a third oral agent can be considered, especially if the A1C level is close to target (A1C < 8.0%), this approach is usually not preferred, as it is no more effective in lowering glycemia, and is more costly, than initiating or intensifying insulin.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^a2f0c359]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — metformin use and effectiveness: Metformin dosing is described as immediate- or extended-release with a recommended starting dose of 500 mg, once or twice daily, with gradual increases up to a maximum total daily dose of 2500 mg; adverse effects are dose-dependent (bloating, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea) and lactic acidosis is a serious but very rare pediatric complication. Metformin has not been approved as a weight-loss drug, and in adults with obesity showed modest (< 5%, or 1 BMI unit) weight reduction when used as an adjunct to lifestyle with effectiveness inconsistent across populations; pediatric effectiveness is similarly conflicting. In a randomized study of 39 teens 13 to 18 years of age in a lifestyle program, metformin hydrochloride XR 2000 mg or placebo once daily for 48 weeks led to approximately 1 kg/m² BMI reduction among adolescents taking metformin compared with a slight BMI increase in the lifestyle-only group. Another randomized study of 100 children 6 to 12 years of age with severe obesity (mean BMI 34.6 kg/m²) showed approximately 1 kg/m² BMI reduction at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily for 6 months, with gastrointestinal symptoms limiting the tolerated maximum dose in nearly 20% and no additional BMI reduction beyond 6 months. Across 16 metformin studies meeting inclusion, about two-thirds showed modest BMI reduction and one-third showed no benefit; given the modest and inconsistent effectiveness, metformin may be considered as an adjunct to intensive health behavior and lifestyle treatment and when other indications for metformin are present.

### Long-term effects of lifestyle intervention or metformin on diabetes development and microvascular complications over 15-year follow-up: the diabetes prevention program outcomes study [^b9892cb8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Procedures

DPP compared metformin at 850 mg twice per day or an individual behavioural lifestyle intervention program with placebo. The lifestyle program included a 16-session curriculum with individual sessions aimed at achieving a 7% weight loss through a healthy low-fat, low calorie diet and 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity physical activity. After the first 24 weeks, individual and group sessions were used to reinforce the lifestyle modification behaviors. The metformin and placebo treatment groups were double-masked but, for practical reasons, the lifestyle group was not. If diabetes was diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and confirmed, participants and their health care providers were informed. Study metformin or placebo was still provided until hyperglycemia worsened to FPG ≥ 7.78 mmol/L at which time study drugs were discontinued and diabetes management transferred to the participant's own health care provider. At DPP-end, following a brief metformin and placebo washout study, the placebo and metformin groups were subsequently unmasked to their treatment assignment and placebo stopped. Given the clear evidence of benefit of the lifestyle intervention, all participants were offered the lifestyle intervention in a group format during a one-year bridge period.

During DPPOS, as in DPP, metformin was provided to the group originally assigned to it; however, metformin was now unmasked. The same transition from study drug and care to the patient's care provider occurred as during DPP except that study metformin was continued until HbA1c was > 7%. Maintenance group lifestyle sessions, offered quarterly to all DPPOS participants, reinforced the basic lifestyle content and the weight loss and physical activity goals. In addition to the maintenance sessions, original lifestyle participants were offered supplementary group programs, reinforcing behavioural self-management activities, and an individual lifestyle "check-in", each twice per year.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^e68be64d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with type 2 diabetes — metformin use, renal thresholds, monitoring, and tolerability are outlined: Metformin may be used safely in some people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and lower doses may be used in those with an eGFR 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m2, with eGFR monitored every 3 to 6 months in those at risk for decline in kidney function; it is contraindicated in advanced renal insufficiency and should be used with caution in hypoperfusion, hypoxemia, impaired hepatic function, or heart failure due to lactic acidosis risk; metformin may be temporarily discontinued before iodinated-contrast procedures, during hospitalizations, and when acute illness may compromise renal or liver function; the daily dose should be slowly increased to minimize gastrointestinal side effects, reduction or elimination may be needed for persistent gastrointestinal side effects, and monitoring for vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered for long-term use; an extended-release formulation may be used as an alternative to immediate-release in older adults with difficulties maintaining medication plans or with gastrointestinal effects.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lifestyle changes, such as improving dietary habits and achieving exercise recommendations are crucial. If medication is indicated, metformin is first-line therapy, followed by consideration of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.
