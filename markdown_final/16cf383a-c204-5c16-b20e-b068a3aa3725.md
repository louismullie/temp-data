## Question

pathophysiology of AAA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initiating insults and risk factors that set the stage. Then, I should verify the inflammatory cascade and which immune cells drive matrix destruction. Next, I will examine extracellular matrix degradation and the protease–antiprotease imbalance. After that, I need to check vascular smooth muscle cell changes, including apoptosis and phenotypic switching. I will then consider oxidative stress and its links to proteolysis and cell death. I should also review biomechanical factors and how wall stress interacts with biology. Finally, I will integrate genetic and epigenetic modifiers, and close with the rupture threshold and clinical implications, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and initiating factors. AAA is a focal, progressive dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, typically defined as a diameter ≥ 3.0 cm or ≥ 50% enlargement, with multifactorial etiology spanning environmental and genetic drivers; smoking, age, male sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and family history are key risks, and diabetes appears negatively associated, which I should keep in mind as I interpret mechanisms and trials [^116m3bjd] [^114bzyzK]. Hold on, I should verify the heritability signal; yes, twin and family data support a strong genetic component, and large-scale GWAS have expanded the number of risk loci, reinforcing a polygenic architecture with lipid metabolism and extracellular matrix pathways prominently implicated [^1172kiQq] [^116m8jc2] [^112qHD1Z].

> Next, I should review the inflammatory cascade, because inflammation is a central driver rather than a mere bystander. Wait, let me verify the dominant infiltrates: macrophages and T lymphocytes predominate in human AAA tissue, with monocyte recruitment and macrophage polarization shaping the milieu; neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are increasingly recognized contributors in both animal models and human disease, amplifying proteolysis and tissue injury [^117HfScL] [^112W9FNM] [^115Jne8H]. I need to ensure I capture the chemokine axis; indeed, CCL3–CCR5 signaling has been shown to promote aortic inflammation and aneurysm formation in experimental models, and blocking this axis attenuates disease, supporting causality rather than correlation [^111BusG2].

> I will now examine extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, since structural failure underpins expansion. Elastin and collagen within the media and adventitia are progressively degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2 and MMP-9, produced by macrophages and dysfunctional smooth muscle cells; tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are concurrently downregulated, tilting the balance toward net proteolysis and wall weakening [^112uUDAF] [^113C3kAo]. Hold on, I should verify clinical relevance; yes, MMP-9 expression correlates with aneurysm size and rupture risk, and statins may exert partial benefit via attenuation of MMP activity, although the magnitude of growth reduction is modest and heterogeneous across studies [^111R1w11].

> Let me consider vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) biology next, because matrix synthesis and contractile integrity depend on healthy VSMCs. VSMCs undergo apoptosis and phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic/degradative state, reducing elastin/collagen production while increasing protease secretion; this dual hit accelerates ECM loss and impairs wall mechanics, and defective autophagy and senescence further destabilize the media [^116Suheh] [^11255Yxa] [^1177e2gV]. Wait, I should double-check that these changes are documented in human tissue; transcriptomic studies of human AAA aortas corroborate dysregulation of VSMC-related pathways and ECM homeostasis, aligning with mechanistic observations in animals [^111JNHqJ].

> Oxidative stress is intertwined with both inflammation and proteolysis, so I need to check its role carefully. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial sources amplify MMP activation, promote VSMC apoptosis, and destabilize the ECM; antioxidant strategies attenuate experimental aneurysm formation, though translation to humans remains limited, so I should be cautious not to overstate clinical applicability here [^111Z2jKh] [^111MmDi4]. But wait, what if ROS also modulate immune signaling? Yes, ROS can enhance inflammatory cytokine expression and leukocyte recruitment, creating a vicious cycle that sustains wall injury [^111Z2jKh].

> Biomechanics cannot be ignored, so I should review how hemodynamic forces interact with biology. According to the law of Laplace, wall tension rises with radius and pressure; however, rupture does not strictly obey a simple Laplace prediction, indicating that material properties and local stress distributions matter. Segmental aortic stiffening and asymmetric geometry elevate peak wall stress and correlate with faster growth and rupture risk, and biomechanical indices such as peak wall stress (PWS) and peak wall rupture index (PWRI) outperform diameter alone in some analyses, though validation remains ongoing [^11762Dgk] [^113XVG7A] [^1121QGEe]. Hold on, I should verify that these biomechanical markers have been linked to outcomes; indeed, higher PWS/PWRI associate with rupture even after adjustment for diameter, supporting their biological plausibility and potential clinical utility [^1175H4Zt].

> I need to ensure I integrate genetic and epigenetic modifiers, because they modulate susceptibility and phenotype. Large GWAS meta-analyses have identified dozens of loci implicating lipid metabolism, vascular development/remodeling, ECM dysregulation, and inflammation; Mendelian randomization supports a causal role for non–HDL cholesterol, and PCSK9 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target with preclinical validation [^116m8jc2] [^112qHD1Z]. Let me reconsider epigenetics; smoking and aging can induce DNA methylation changes that alter gene expression in pathways relevant to AAA, suggesting that epigenetic therapies could be explored, though direct evidence in AAA remains limited [^113yGqxU] [^111SmBeS].

> Next, I should review the rupture threshold and clinical implications, making sure I cite the right figures. Rupture risk escalates with diameter, but size alone is imperfect; women have higher rupture risk at smaller diameters, and contemporary data suggest roughly 6–10% annual rupture risk for diameters around 5.5–6.0 cm in men, with higher rates beyond 7.0 cm, while female-specific thresholds of 5.0 cm are often used clinically due to observed higher risk at smaller sizes [^115i8Xf5] [^116Heht8]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the mortality of ruptured AAA was uniformly 90–95%; I should correct that to 65–90% depending on cohort and access to care, with population estimates often cited around 80–85% [^1121VXUF] [^115kA9rW].

> Finally, I should synthesize the vicious cycle and highlight therapeutic implications. Initiating insults (smoking, hemodynamic stress, genetic susceptibility) trigger inflammation, which drives ECM degradation, VSMC loss, and oxidative stress; these changes weaken the wall, increase biomechanical stress, and further amplify inflammation and proteolysis, creating a self-perpetuating loop that culminates in rupture when wall stress exceeds strength [^112uUDAF] [^116Suheh]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about drugs; despite hundreds of preclinical successes, no medical therapy has definitively slowed growth or prevented rupture in humans, underscoring the need for larger, longer, biologically informed trials and better surrogate endpoints such as PWS/PWRI or molecular imaging of inflammation and protease activity [^115aBhut] [^1175H4Zt] [^115vVr7E].

---

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) arises from **chronic inflammation** [^117HfScL] and **extracellular matrix degradation** [^113C3kAo], driven by macrophage infiltration [^117HfScL], oxidative stress [^111Z2jKh], and protease activation (notably MMP-2/9) [^111BusG2], leading to loss of smooth muscle cells and wall weakening [^116Suheh]. Key risk factors include smoking, male sex, age, hypertension, and genetic predisposition [^1121VXUF] [^116m8jc2]; smoking accelerates expansion and rupture via proteolysis and oxidative stress [^113TzD4Q]. Biomechanical stress further weakens the wall [^11762Dgk], and rupture occurs when wall stress exceeds strength [^1121VXUF]. No medical therapy reliably halts progression [^111wfy1G], so management is surveillance and surgical repair when risk is high [^113FbPA8].

---

## Structural changes in the aortic wall

AAA is characterized by **degeneration of the aortic wall**, including:

- **Loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs)**: SMC apoptosis and phenotypic switching reduce contractility and matrix synthesis, weakening the wall [^116Suheh] [^11255Yxa].

- **Extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation**: Elastin and collagen breakdown by MMPs (especially MMP-2 and MMP-9) [^111BusG2] compromise wall integrity [^113C3kAo].

- **Inflammatory infiltration**: Macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils [^117HfScL] [^112W9FNM] accumulate, secreting cytokines and proteases that drive remodeling and injury [^115AC7C7].

---

## Molecular and cellular mechanisms

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie AAA pathogenesis:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Inflammation | Chronic inflammation with macrophage infiltration [^117HfScL] and cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) promotes ECM degradation and SMC apoptosis [^111BusG2]. |
| Oxidative stress | ROS activate MMPs and induce SMC apoptosis, accelerating wall weakening [^111Z2jKh] [^111MmDi4]. |
| Protease activity | MMPs, cathepsins, and serine proteases degrade elastin and collagen; TIMP levels are often reduced, tipping the balance toward proteolysis [^111BusG2] [^113C3kAo]. |
| Genetic predisposition | Polymorphisms in genes regulating ECM, inflammation, and proteases (e.g. MMP9, IL6, SMAD3) increase susceptibility [^116m8jc2] [^112qHD1Z]. |

---

## Role of risk factors

Key risk factors modulate AAA risk through **distinct mechanisms**:

- **Smoking**: Strongest modifiable risk; increases proteolysis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, and accelerates expansion and rupture [^113TzD4Q] [^112PmKfk].

- **Hypertension**: Elevated wall stress promotes ECM disruption and SMC apoptosis [^notfound].

- **Age and sex**: Prevalence rises with age and is higher in men; women have higher rupture risk at smaller diameters [^1121VXUF] [^116Heht8].

- **Genetics**: Family history and polygenic risk scores indicate heritable susceptibility [^116m8jc2] [^112qHD1Z].

---

## Biomechanical factors

Biomechanical forces contribute to **aneurysm growth and rupture**. Wall stress increases with diameter and pressure [^11762Dgk], and heterogeneous wall thickness and calcification create stress concentrations that predispose to rupture [^1121QGEe]. Rupture occurs when local wall stress exceeds the diminished tensile strength of the degenerated wall [^1121VXUF].

---

## Current therapeutic implications

There are **no approved pharmacologic therapies** that reliably halt AAA progression or prevent rupture [^111wfy1G]. Management centers on risk-factor modification (especially smoking cessation) [^111XYs4n], imaging surveillance, and elective repair when diameter thresholds or growth criteria are met [^113FbPA8]. Experimental strategies targeting inflammation, proteases, and oxidative stress are under investigation but have not yet translated into clinical practice [^1133gw2N].

---

AAA pathophysiology reflects a **multifactorial interplay** of inflammation, proteolysis, oxidative stress, and biomechanics, with smoking as a dominant driver; addressing these mechanisms is essential to developing effective medical therapies.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm: update on pathogenesis and medical treatments [^115L4WbW]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is an important cause of death in adults. Currently, the only treatment for AAA is open or endovascular surgical repair. In most parts of the developed world, AAAs can be identified at an early stage as a result of incidental imaging and screening programmes. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that early elective surgical repair of these small AAAs is not beneficial, and an unmet clinical need exists to develop medical therapies for small AAAs that limit or prevent the progressive expansion and rupture of the aneurysm. A large amount of research is currently being performed to increase the understanding of AAA pathogenesis and ultimately lead to the development of medical therapies, such as drug-based and cell-based strategies for this disease. This Review summarizes the latest research findings and current theories on AAA pathogenesis, including discussion of the pros and cons of current rodent models of AAA, and highlights potential medical therapies for AAA, summarizing previous, ongoing and potential clinical trials of medical interventions for small AAAs. This expanding volume of research on AAA is expected to result in a range of novel medical therapies for AAA within the next decade.

### Medical management… [^115tGdML]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is the abnormal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta of 3. 0 cm or more. 1 It occurs when the abdominal aortic wall weakens, causing it to bulge or balloon, resulting in permanent and progressive focal dilatation of the abdominal aorta 2. AAA is the 14th leading cause of mortality in the United States, resulting in 4, 500 deaths each year. Pathophysiology AAA occurs from the degenerative process of smooth muscle cell loss and structural deterioration of the aortic wall, specifically within the elastic media and adventitia. 9 Matrix metalloproteinase, a proteolytic enzyme released by T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and other chronic inflammatory cells, destroys the elasticity and collagen of smooth muscle. 10, 11. Presentation Most AAAs are asymptomatic until they rupture, although some may be identified during an evaluation of abdominal symptoms.

AAA is often detected as an incidental finding when ultrasonography, computed tomography of the abdomen, or magnetic resonance imaging is performed for other purposes. For patients who present with unexplained abdominal discomfort, such as pain that radiates to the back, flank, and groin, abdominal palpation is reasonably accurate in diagnosing AAA and does not increase the risk of rupture. 12 Early studies with a small sample size and limited follow-up suggested that the anti-inflammatory effects of certain antibiotics may reduce the AAA expansion rate. 28–30 One recent study of doxycycline, which was previously found to lower matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels, did not reduce aneurysm growth over two years. 29 Medical management of AAA predominantly involves cardiovascular risk reduction such as antihypertensive, statin, and antiplatelet therapy. 28, 31–33 Antihypertensive therapy should target the patient's blood pressure goal.

A meta-analysis showed that statins are associated with attenuation of AAA growth by slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease. 34 Patients with AAA are at high risk of cardiovascular events, and most guidelines recommend the use of anti-platelet agents for secondary prevention, such as aspirin or clopidogrel for those intolerant of aspirin. 28, 31 A combination of statins and beta blockers is associated with a reduction of perioperative mortality and incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction for patients undergoing surgery for AAA.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for small abdominal aortic aneurysms [^114VYhA9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) affect 5% of the population in developed countries and are characterized by progressive aortic dilatation with an unpredictable time course. This condition is more common in men than in women, and in smokers than in nonsmokers. If left untreated, AAA can result in aortic rupture and death. Pathologically, aortic extracellular matrix degradation, inflammation, and neovascularization are hallmarks of AAA. Diagnosis of AAA and subsequent surveillance utilize established aortic imaging methods, such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI. More-speculative diagnostic approaches include molecular and cellular imaging methods that interrogate the underlying pathological processes at work within the aneurysm. In this Review, we explore the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the management of AAA. We also describe the diagnostic potential of new imaging techniques and therapeutic potential of new treatments for the management of small AAA.

### Recent advances in molecular mechanisms of abdominal aortic aneurysm formation [^116T9dXW]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an increasingly common clinical condition with fatal implications. It is associated with advanced age, male gender, cigarette smoking, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and genetic predisposition. Although significant evidence has emerged in the last decade, the molecular mechanisms of AAA formation remain poorly understood. Currently, the treatment for AAA remains primarily surgical with the lone innovation of endovascular therapy. With advances in the human genome, understanding precisely which molecules and genes mediate AAA development and blocking their activity at the molecular level could lead to important new discoveries and therapies. This review summarizes recent updates in molecular mechanisms of AAA formation, including animal models, autoimmune components, infection, key molecules and cytokines, mechanical forces, genetics, and pharmacotherapy. This review will be helpful to those who want to recognize the newest endeavors within the field and identify possible lines of investigation in AAA.

### Pathophysiology and epidemiology of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^1164uKfX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are found in up to 8% of men aged > 65 years, yet usually remain asymptomatic until they rupture. Rupture of an AAA and its associated catastrophic physiological insult carries overall mortality in excess of 80%, and 2% of all deaths are AAA-related. Pathologically, AAAs are associated with inflammation, smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and matrix degradation. Once thought to be a consequence of advanced atherosclerosis, accruing evidence indicates that AAAs are a focal representation of a systemic disease of the vasculature. Risk factors for AAAs include increasing age, male sex, smoking, and low HDL-cholesterol levels. Familial associations exist and although susceptibility genes have been described on the basis of candidate-gene studies, robust genetic studies have failed to discover causative gene mutations. The surgical management of AAAs has been revolutionized by minimally invasive endovascular repair. Ongoing randomized trials will establish whether endovascular repair confers a survival advantage over open surgery for patients with a ruptured AAA. In many countries, centralization of vascular surgical services has largely been driven by the improved outcomes of elective aneurysm surgery in specialized centers, the widespread adoption of endovascular techniques, and the introduction of screening programs.

### Challenges and opportunities in abdominal aortic aneurysm research [^111ahZgP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) are associated with advanced age, male gender, cigarette smoking, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and genetic predisposition. Basic research studies have led to a better understanding of aneurysm disease over the past two decades. There has also been a growing appreciation that fundamental knowledge regarding the process of aneurysmal degeneration is still somewhat limited. Opportunities in research include: 1) the investigation of potential new mechanism-based pharmacologic interventions; 2) identify the genetic basis for an inherited predisposition; 3) develop and refine noninvasive approaches for the early detection; 4) examine potential novel surgical approaches and design new biomaterials; and 5) initiate and promote awareness programs for diagnosis and treatment of aortic aneurysms. The optimal approach to addressing these issues will require integrative, multidisciplinary research programs that involve basic scientists working in concert with vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons, as well as other clinical specialists with expertise in vascular disease.

### Novel insight into the pathobiology of abdominal aortic aneurysm and potential future treatment concepts [^1141wAgg]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) commonly is a nondiabetic, white man with a history of smoking. Moreover, AAA represents a leading cause of death in elderly men in Western countries. The purpose of this manuscript is to review current evidence as to the pathobiology of AAA as well as potential future drug targets to prevent progression of AAA.

### A review of biological factors implicated in abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture [^115QezJv]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is the 13th commonest cause of death in the Western World. Although considerable research has been applied to the aetiology and mechanism of aneurysm expansion, little is known about the mechanism of rupture. Aneurysm rupture was historically considered to be a simple physical process that occurred when the aortic wall could no longer contain the haemodynamic stress of the circulation. However, AAAs do not conform to the law of Laplace and there is growing evidence that aneurysm rupture involves a complex series of biological changes in the aortic wall. This paper reviews the available data on patient variables associated with aneurysm rupture and presents the evidence implicating biological factors in AAA rupture.

### Management of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^116m3bjd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on abdominal aortic aneurysm:

- **Definition**: An AAA is a structural disease of the abdominal aorta characterized by a pathological, localized dilatation of > 30 mm or > 50% of the original aortic size.
- **Pathophysiology**: Multiple environmental factors (including smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and collagen diseases) and genetic factors can induce and accelerate degeneration of the layers of the aortic wall. An inflammatory response in the aortic vessel wall leads to destruction of elastin and collagen in the media and adventitia, loss of smooth muscle cells, thinning of the media, and neovascularization.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the overall prevalence of AAA is estimated at 2,200 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: The majority of AAAs are asymptomatic and are detected as an incidental finding on diagnostic imaging performed for other purposes. AAAs can also present with abdominal pain or complications such as thrombosis, embolization and rupture.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with ruptured AAA is approximately 85–90%.

### Biomechanical determinants of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture [^11762Dgk]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) represents a significant clinical event, having a mortality rate of 90% and being currently ranked as the 13th leading cause of death in the US. The ability to reliably evaluate the susceptibility of a particular AAA to rupture on a case-specific basis could vastly improve the clinical management of these patients. Because AAA rupture represents a mechanical failure of the degenerated aortic wall, biomechanical considerations are important to understand this process and to improve our predictions of its occurrence. Presented here is an overview of research to date related to the biomechanics of AAA rupture. This includes a summary of results related to ex vivo and in vivo mechanical testing, noninvasive AAA wall stress estimations, and potential mechanisms of AAA wall weakening. We conclude with a demonstration of a biomechanics-based approach to predicting AAA rupture on a patient-specific basis, which may ultimately prove to be superior to the widely and currently used maximum diameter criterion.

### The putative role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^1152TyEe]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are a significant cause of worldwide mortality and morbidity. While the histopathological characteristics of AAA are well documented, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AAA are not entirely understood. Autophagy is a highly conserved basal cellular process in eukaryotic cells that involves the turnover of organelles and proteins. It is also activated as an adaptive response to stressful conditions to promote cell survival. While autophagy typically promotes pro-survival processes, it can sometimes lead to cellular demise. Preclinical studies have revealed autophagy to be a protective mechanism in certain vascular diseases with several autophagy-related genes reported to be markedly upregulated in human aneurysmal tissue. The role autophagy plays in the pathogenesis of AAA, however, remains poorly defined. In this review, we discuss the putative role of autophagy in AAA by reviewing several in vitro and in vivo studies that address the functional significance of autophagy in cells that are involved in the pathophysiology of AAA, amongst which are macrophages, smooth muscle and endothelial cells.

### Mechanisms of aortic aneurysm formation: translating preclinical studies into clinical therapies [^1133gw2N]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Aneurysms are common in the abdominal and thoracic regions of the aorta. While generally asymptomatic, progression of aneurysms is associated with the devastating consequences of aortic rupture. Current therapeutic options to prevent rupture are restricted to surgical repair, as there remains a lack of validated pharmaceutical approaches. Absence of proven medical therapies may be a consequence of the paucity of knowledge on mechanisms of aneurysmal initiation, progression and rupture. Many potential therapeutic targets have been identified in several widely used animal models of these diseases. A small number of these targets are currently under clinical evaluation, while many more are in preclinical stages of evaluation. The purpose of this review is to: (1) overview current understanding of mechanisms of aneurysmal initiation and progression and (2) summarise medical therapies that have been investigated clinically, as well as highlight future therapeutic targets.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms [^1121VXUF]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the infrarenal aorta. AAA is a multifactorial disease, and genetic and environmental factors play a part; smoking, male sex and a positive family history are the most important risk factors, and AAA is most common in men > 65 years of age. AAA results from changes in the aortic wall structure, including thinning of the media and adventitia due to the loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and degradation of the extracellular matrix. If the mechanical stress of the blood pressure acting on the wall exceeds the wall strength, the AAA ruptures, causing life-threatening intra-abdominal haemorrhage - the mortality for patients with ruptured AAA is 65–85%. Although AAAs of any size can rupture, the risk of rupture increases with diameter. Intact AAAs are typically asymptomatic, and in settings where screening programmes with ultrasonography are not implemented, most cases are diagnosed incidentally. Modern functional imaging techniques (PET, CT and MRI) may help to assess rupture risk. Elective repair of AAA with open surgery or endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) should be considered to prevent AAA rupture, although the morbidity and mortality associated with both techniques remain non-negligible.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms in women [^113Yw8sV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has long been recognized as a condition predominantly affecting males, with sex-associated differences described for almost every aspect of the disease from pathophysiology and epidemiology to morbidity and mortality. Women are generally spared from AAA formation by the immunomodulating effects of estrogen, but once they develop, the natural history of AAAs in women appears to be more aggressive, with more rapid expansion, a higher tendency to rupture at smaller diameters, and higher mortality following rupture. However, simply repairing AAAs at smaller diameters in women is a debatable solution, as even elective endovascular AAA repair is fraught with higher morbidity and mortality in women compared to men. The goal of this review is to summarize what is currently known about the effect of gender on AAA presentation, treatment, and outcomes. Additionally, we aim to review current controversies over screening recommendations and threshold for repair in women.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116Gbc61]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms cause 1.3% of all deaths among men aged 65–85 years in developed countries. These aneurysms are typically asymptomatic until the catastrophic event of rupture. Repair of large or symptomatic aneurysms by open surgery or endovascular repair is recommended, whereas repair of small abdominal aortic aneurysms does not provide a significant benefit. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is linked to the degradation of the elastic media of the atheromatous aorta. An inflammatory cell infiltrate, neovascularisation, and production and activation of various proteases and cytokines contribute to the development of this disorder, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this Seminar, we aim to provide an updated review of the pathophysiology, current and new diagnostic procedures, assessment, and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm to provide family practitioners with a working knowledge of this disorder.

### Monocytes and macrophages in abdominal aortic aneurysm [^117HfScL]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease associated with high morbidity, and high mortality in the event of aortic rupture. Major advances in open surgical and endovascular repair of AAA have been achieved during the past 2 decades. However, drug-based therapies are still lacking, highlighting a real need for better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in AAA formation and progression. The main pathological features of AAA include extracellular matrix remodelling associated with degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and accumulation and activation of inflammatory cells. The inflammatory process has a crucial role in AAA and substantially influences many determinants of aortic wall remodelling. In this Review, we focus specifically on the involvement of monocytes and macrophages, summarizing current knowledge on the roles, origin, and functions of these cells in AAA development and its complications. Furthermore, we show and propose that distinct monocyte and macrophage subsets have critical and differential roles in initiation, progression, and healing of the aneurysmal process. On the basis of experimental and clinical studies, we review potential translational applications to detect, assess, and image macrophage subsets in AAA, and discuss the relevance of these applications for clinical practice.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm: pathogenesis and implications for management [^113fTUSY]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) affects approximately 5% of elderly men and is responsible for a significant number of deaths in Western Countries. At present surgery by open or endovascular means is the only widely used therapy for this condition. In this review we examine the risk factors, serum, and genetic associations of AAA. Epidemiology studies suggest that smoking cessation and control of cholesterol and blood pressure should reduce the number of patients developing AAA. Natural history studies suggest that smoking cessation should reduce the rate of progression of AAA. Clear level 1 evidence for drug treatments of AAA are presently lacking; however, animal and human in vitro studies suggest that medication targeted at reducing inflammation and proteolysis are most likely to be beneficial, with limited data to support the use of statins, Angiotensin II inhibitors, and macrolides. Work has commenced in understanding which patients, identified by clinical, serum, and genotype, are more at risk of AAA progression and thus should be selected out for aggressive treatment. Well designed large multicenter randomized controlled trials are required to examine the medical treatment of AAA.

Discussion

The AAA is an enigmatic pathology. The disease generally remains clinically silent until manifested by an insidious and life‐threatening rupture. As a consequence, most diagnosed intact AAA reflect long‐standing disease, diagnosed as a coincidental finding during abdominal imaging, or a finding that results from active screening. By the same token, the actual mechanism(s) causing and driving the disease remain unclear, although epidemiological data, and the presence of clear (diffuse) genetic signalsand familial clustering, imply that the disease results from complex gene–environment interactions with smoking and male sex as critical cofactors.

Remarkably little is known about the molecular basis of AAA disease. Available molecular insight largely relies on data derived from surgical specimens that were collected during open aneurysm repair (ie, larger aneurysms that represent late‐stage disease). Assumptions on disease initiation and the earlier disease stages mainly rely on extrapolation of the pathological observations from late‐stage disease, and on data derived from rodent models of AAA, in particular the PPE model and the AngII model. Although these 2 models are widely applied, contrasting outcomes for pharmaceutical interventions performed in these models and the actual clinical context imply incomplete mimicry between the models and clinical disease. In light of this aspect, we considered an evaluation of parallel and incongruent genetic signals between clinical disease, and the 2 most commonly used models relevant.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysms [^116gZ3Qb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are prevalent among older adults and can cause significant morbidity and mortality if not addressed in a timely fashion. Their etiology remains the topic of continued investigation. Known causes include trauma, infection, and inflammatory disorders. Risk factors include cigarette smoking, advanced age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The pathophysiology of the disease is related to an initial arterial insult causing a cascade of inflammation and extracellular matrix protein breakdown by proteinases leading to arterial wall weakening. When identified early, aneurysms must be monitored for size, growth rate, and other factors which could increase the risk of rupture. Factors predisposing to rupture include size, active smoking, rate of growth, aberrant biomechanical properties of the aneurysmal sac, and female sex. Medical management includes the control of risk factors that may prevent growth, stabilize the aneurysm, and prevent rupture. Surgical management prevents rupture of high risk aneurysms, most commonly predicted by size. Less frequently, surgical management is required when the aneurysm has ruptured. Surgery involves a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate the patient's risk profile and to develop an operative plan involving either an endovascular or an open surgical repair. The patient must be carefully monitored post-operatively for complications and, in the case of endovascular repairs, for endoleaks. AAA management has evolved rapidly in recent years. Technical and technological advances have transformed the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.

### Cellular mechanisms of aortic aneurysm formation [^116Suheh]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Aortic aneurysms are a common vascular disease in Western populations that can involve virtually any portion of the aorta. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are much more common than thoracic aortic aneurysms and combined they account for > 25000 deaths in the United States annually. Although thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms share some common characteristics, including the gross anatomic appearance, alterations in extracellular matrix, and loss of smooth muscle cells, they are distinct diseases. In recent years, advances in genetic analysis, robust molecular tools, and increased availability of animal models have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysms. This review examines the various proposed cellular mechanisms responsible for aortic aneurysm formation and identifies opportunities for future studies.

Outlook of PET for AAA assessment

AAA remains a significant cause of mortality due to aortic rupture. USS reveals anatomical changes in AAA size and shape; however, there remain gaps in our knowledge of the molecular changes that precede physical manifestation of AAA and in our ability to visualize these pathological mechanisms at the molecular level. Despite the large number of AAA studies conducted, our knowledge of AAA pathobiology is incomplete, and there remains a lack of concrete data to translate preclinical findings to clinical practice. The contributions of inflammatory activity, biomechanical disturbances, calcification, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation to aortic growth and aneurysm progression remain only partially understood; these may be clarified with the application of PET imaging utilizing specific biologically targeted radiotracers. A better understanding of these functional changes in early-stage AAA may help stratify patients based on rupture risk early in the disease course and guide appropriate treatment selection. In this context, the multifactorial pathophysiology of AAA in humans represents a growing area in cardiovascular research, largely because clinical studies of AAA are predominantly limited to using late-stage aortic tissue obtained during surgery, owing to the asymptomatic presentation of early-stage AAA and lack of intervention (and easy access to tissue) at this stage. Although several risk factors and potential contributors to the disease process have been identified, such as sex, age, comorbidities, and smoking, these are not yet sufficiently predictive when applied to individual patients as reliable and accurate assessment methods for these factors are not yet readily available. Thus, as management decisions are made based solely on aortic size, many patients are needlessly subjected to the risks of aortic repair, even in cases wherein an aneurysm might not have ruptured if left untreated.

### Pathogenesis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113KcS3d]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a focal expansion of the abdominal aorta usually diagnosed by maximum aortic diameter of ≥ 30 mm on imaging. Abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic unless it ruptures which is fatal without successful surgical repair. It was reported that in 2017 there were 167 200 deaths and 3 million disability-adjusted life years worldwide attributable to AAA, although due to the low rates of post-mortems, it is likely these estimates are inaccurate. Efforts to reduce AAA-related burden have focused on early identification and improved surgical treatment. Randomized trials found that ultrasound screening in men aged ≥ 65 years to identify cases for elective repair reduced aneurysm-related mortality, but the effect on all-cause mortality is controversial with one analysis showing a small significant reduction and a more recent one not confirming this. Ultrasound screening of high-risk groups has been introduced in a number of countries, including Sweden, the UK, and the USA. With declining smoking rates, the age-adjusted prevalence of AAA has fallen in some countries, leading to questions about how screening can be delivered in the most cost-effective and ethical way. The widespread use of abdominal imaging has led to many asymptomatic AAA being identified incidentally, and advances in artificial intelligence are facilitating automatic referral to vascular surgeons and surveillance programs. There have been tremendous advances in minimally invasive devices for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but durability of this treatment remains a problem, and rupture can still occur.

### The cardiovascular and prognostic significance of the infrarenal aortic diameter [^112kGJBQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The normal aortic diameter in adults usually ranges from 16 to 18 mm in women and 19 to 21 mm in men. Individuals with diameters outside this range seem to be at increased risk of other cardiovascular disease. There is a graded association between increasing aortic diameter and both cardiovascular mortality and peripheral arterial disease. The magnitude of increased risk of cardiovascular death seems to be about 4% to 6% per mm increase over a diameter of about 23 mm. To a lesser extent, these outcomes are also increased in individuals with aortic diameters below the normal range. While the threshold of 3 cm is useful in the diagnosis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), it is arbitrary in terms of the vascular biology and pathophysiology of the abdominal aorta. This review examines the risk factors for aortic enlargement and the cardiovascular implications of this enlargement in patients with and without AAAs. The mechanisms underlying the association between aortic diameter and cardiovascular risk and the relevance to screening are also discussed.

### Aortic aneurysms: current pathogenesis and therapeutic targets [^112uUDAF]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic aneurysm is a chronic aortic disease characterized by permanent localized dilatation of the aorta through adverse remodeling of the aortic wall, and it can subsequently progress to life-threatening consequences through aortic rupture, which has a mortality of over 80% and causes 150,000–200,000 deaths each year worldwide –. Aortic aneurysms are generally classified as thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), which form in the ascending aorta, the arch, or the aorta above the diaphragm, or abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), which are localized in the aorta below the diaphragm in the supra- or infrarenal regions. Although distinct pathological mechanisms are present in TAA and AAA, many risk factors for aortic aneurysms are shared, including age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, male sex, white race, and a positive family history.

Aortic rupture is not only associated with increasing aneurysm diameters but also results from characteristic changes, which involve the progressive expansion and weakening of the three layers of the aorta: the intima, media, and adventitia. Multiple pathological processes, including extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown, inflammation, phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), oxidative stress, and neovascularization, contribute to this process. Furthermore, these biological mechanisms are thought to initiate the degradation of elastic fibers and alterations in collagen composition, ultimately compromising the structural integrity and reducing the flexibility of the aortic wall. Although the pathological mechanisms of aortic aneurysms have been defined (Fig. 1), there are no effective drugs to treat aortic aneurysm growth or rupture. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in aortic aneurysms and mainly focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms involving therapeutic targets.

### Aetiology and management of hereditary aortopathy [^1156SwkW]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Aortic aneurysms are a major health problem because they account for 1–2% of all deaths in the Western population. Although abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are more prevalent than thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs), TAAs have been more exhaustively studied over the past 2 decades because they have a higher heritability and affect younger individuals. Gene identification in both syndromic and nonsyndromic TAA is proceeding at a rapid pace and has already pinpointed > 20 genes associated with familial TAA risk. Whereas these genes explain < 30% of all cases of familial TAA, their functional characterization has substantially improved our knowledge of the underlying pathological mechanisms. As such, perturbed extracellular matrix homeostasis, transforming growth factor-β signalling, and vascular smooth muscle cell contractility have been proposed as important processes in TAA pathogenesis. These new insights enable novel treatment options that are currently being investigated in large clinical trials. Moreover, together with the advent of next-generation sequencing approaches, these genetic findings are promoting a shift in the management of patients with TAA by enabling gene-tailored interventions. In this Review, we comprehensively describe the molecular landscape of familial TAA, and we discuss whether familial TAA, from a biological point of view, can serve as a paradigm for the genetically more complex forms of the condition, such as sporadic TAA or AAA.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies risk loci for abdominal aortic aneurysm and highlights PCSK9 as a therapeutic target [^112qHD1Z]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 8
Biological mechanisms underlying genetic loci associated with AAA.

The AAA GWAS loci for which we have identified a candidate causal gene are depicted along with the plausible relationship to its underlying biological mechanism. Loci names are based on the candidate causal gene identified in our analysis. However, the biological pathway(s) remain unclear for many associated loci and, as such, the resultant annotation may prove incorrect in some cases. Gene names are colored according to the gene prioritization scheme used to obtain the candidate (red, protein-altering variants; blue, consensus of indicators and green, nearest gene).

Second, the genetic results highlight the critical role of lipids and lipid metabolism in AAA pathogenesis. Previous work has demonstrated the likely causal relationship between lipids and AAA, and current therapeutic strategies largely focus on LDL-C lowering for broad atherosclerotic risk factor modification in patients with AAA rather than specifically for disease prevention or treatment, in individuals or families at future risk of AAA. Here we expand upon these findings by observing that 42 of the 121 AAA risk loci are also associated with lipids, supporting the notion of AAA as an end-organ manifestation of atherosclerosis and that lipid-modulating therapies may have a role in the management of AAA. We additionally prioritize lipid subfractions beyond LDL-C, namely remnant cholesterol, as likely causally related to AAA. Molecules targeting the lipoprotein lipase pathway via APOC3 (ref.) are emerging therapies for cardiovascular disease but remain unstudied in patients with aneurysm. More broadly, our findings suggest that AAA shares important pathobiology with other forms of atherosclerotic vascular diseases and should be considered on this disease spectrum.

### Aortic aneurysms: current pathogenesis and therapeutic targets [^116Aqknk]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic aneurysm is a chronic disease characterized by localized expansion of the aorta, including the ascending aorta, arch, descending aorta, and abdominal aorta. Although aortic aneurysms are generally asymptomatic, they can threaten human health by sudden death due to aortic rupture. Aortic aneurysms are estimated to lead to 150,000~200,000 deaths per year worldwide. Currently, there are no effective drugs to prevent the growth or rupture of aortic aneurysms; surgical repair or endovascular repair is the only option for treating this condition. The pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets for aortic aneurysms have been examined over the past decade; however, there are unknown pathogenic mechanisms involved in cellular heterogeneity and plasticity, the complexity of the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway, inflammation, cell death, intramural neovascularization, and intercellular communication. This review summarizes the latest research findings and current pathogenic mechanisms of aortic aneurysms, which may enhance our understanding of aortic aneurysms.

### Assessing the potential risk of rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115XrSLw]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) involve complex interplays between inflammatory and biomechanical factors that can be elucidated with anatomical and functional imaging. Although AAA size has been well-established in the literature to correlate with risk of rupture (and subsequent need for vascular intervention), there are other less-well-known characteristics about AAAs that also contribute to higher risk of rupture. This review focuses on biomechanical, radiological, and epidemiological characteristics of AAAs that are associated with higher rupture risk. For clinicians, knowing and considering a wide variety of risk factors in addition to AAA size is important to initiate early and proper intervention for AAA repair. Although there is no official quantitative risk score of AAA rupture risk that takes other non-size-related variables into account, if clinicians are aware of these other parameters, it is hoped that intervention can be appropriately performed for higher-risk AAAs that have not met the size-threshold for elective repair.

Introduction

Aortic aneurysm is morphologically defined as a focal dilation and structural degradation of the aorta, which can occur at different sites along the aortic tree. Pathologically, formation and progression of an aortic aneurysm is driven by dysregulated cellular and acellular events. While thorough reviews on the cellular mechanisms and current medical management of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) – have been published elsewhere, this review focuses on the role of the aortic extracellular matrix (ECM) and the proteases and their inhibitors that maintain the integrity and homeostasis of the ECM in the pathogenesis of TAA or AAA in humans and animal models.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm pathogenesis

While research on AAA pathogenesis has been ongoing for decades using animal models, in vitro, and human observational studies, the recent findings from genetic studies have led to major advances in our understanding of AAA. This review focuses mainly on recent clinical genetic, observational studies, and trials. Readers are referred to previous reviews on AAA animal models and laboratory studies. Animal studies testing the effects of drugs on established aneurysms have been included since this experimental design simulates the clinical need for drug therapies to limit growth and rupture of small AAA.

Traditional risk factors including sex disparity

Past studies suggest higher AAA prevalence in Caucasians compared with black and Asian races. Racial inequality in access to AAA screening and treatment may account for the differences in prevalence reported. Older age, male sex, hypertension, smoking, coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and family history of aneurysm increase the risk of AAA (Table 1). Diabetes is negatively associated with AAA. Men have a 3- to 16-fold increased AAA risk when using a ≥ 30 mm definition. Given that women have a smaller body size than men, this criterion underdiagnoses AAA in women. Most animal research on sex disparity in AAA pathogenesis has focused on sex hormones or sex chromosomes. Multiple clinical studies have associated low serum testosterone with increased risk of AAA in older men. Both low and high estradiol have been associated with AAA. Women with both a history of smoking (≥ 20 pack year) and premature menopause have an increased risk of AAA. Sex differences in extracellular matrix remodeling, the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), inflammatory pathways, and oxidative stress control have been reported in studies within animal models, cells in vitro, and human populations (see previous review). One small study reported that the AAA wall strength was lower in samples from women compared with men; although the difference was not significant, this finding could contribute to the reported higher rate of small AAA rupture in females compared with males.

### Inflammation and cellular immune responses in abdominal aortic aneurysms [^115AC7C7]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

Expansion and rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) result in high morbidity and mortality rates. Like stenotic atherosclerotic lesions, AAA accumulate inflammatory cells, but usually exhibit much more extensive medial damage. Leukocyte recruitment and expression of pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokines typically characterize early atherogenesis of any kind, and modulation of inflammatory mediators mutes atheroma formation in mice. However, the mechanistic differences between stenotic and aneurysmal manifestations of atherosclerosis remain unexplained. We recently showed that aortic allografts deficient in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling developed AAA correlating with skewed Th2 cytokine environments, suggesting important regulatory roles for Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in modulating matrix remodeling and important implications for the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysm and atherosclerosis. Further probing of their distinct aspects of immune and inflammatory responses in vascular diseases should continue to shed new light on the pathophysiologic mechanisms that give rise to aneurysmal versus occlusive manifestations and atherosclerosis.

### Monitoring the biological activity of abdominal aortic aneurysms beyond ultrasound [^117QzeTj]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions and future challenges

Current evaluation of AAA disease (using the basic morphological parameter of maximum aneurysm diameter) facilitates only a generic, population-based estimate of future aneurysm progression. However, more sophisticated methods of risk prediction are now required to plan timely surgical intervention, to allow appropriate screening intervals during AAA surveillance and to rationalise health resources.

While aneurysm disease shares some of the common pathways of atherosclerosis, its unique and, as yet, incompletely understood pathobiology means that further AAA-specific research is required to assess the value of promising imaging techniques that have been explored in the carotid and coronary arteries. There is a pressing need to understand the evolving biology of AAAs and its contribution to future AAA-related events. Emerging molecular imaging techniques offer the potential to add this additional biological information to the established risk factors for disease progression and may facilitate individual patient risk assessment.

### Systematic review of circulating, biomechanical, and genetic markers for the prediction of abdominal aortic aneurysm growth and rupture [^112kQyup]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The natural course of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a steady increase of the diameter, and eventually, if left untreated, the aneurysm might rupture. 1 In most cases of AAA, this pathophysiological process remains asymptomatic until rupture. Such an event can be prevented by surgical AAA repair. The decision to perform surgery is commonly based on 3 characteristics being the: (1) maximum AAA diameter exceeding 5.0 cm in women and 5.5 cm in men; (2) experience of symptoms; or (3) aneurysm growth rate exceeds 1 cm/year. 2, 3 The first 2 characteristics are relatively easy to identify by imaging or by questioning the patient. However, AAA growth rate can only be considered retrospectively, because a prognostic value for expansion has not yet been acknowledged.

In the current AAA management, no marker for aneurysm progression or rupture has been implemented as common practice. This might be explained by little existing evidence and lack of experience with prognostic markers. Although numerous potential markers of aneurysm growth and rupture have been examined, a systematic review with a detailed and structured evaluation of markers for AAA expansion and rupture is lacking.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify promising markers of aneurysm expansion and rupture to aid clinicians in AAA management. We searched for retro‐ and prospective observational studies in which the prognostic value of circulating bloodmarkers, biomechanical properties, and genetic variations for AAA expansion or rupture are investigated.

### EACTS / STS guidelines for diagnosing and treating acute and chronic syndromes of the aortic organ [^116Heht8]. European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — definition, epidemiology, rupture risk and intervention thresholds are summarized as follows: An aneurysm is defined as at least a 50% increase in local aortic diameter or > 30 mm absolute diameter, and abdominal aortic aneurysms are up to 4 times more common in men. In men, rupture risk per year ranges from 0.3% to 0.8%, and surveillance of AAA < 55 mm is supported; in women, the risk of rupture may be up to 4 times higher, justifying intervention at 50 mm. Growth usually occurs initially at a smaller diameter (< 42.5 mm), and in patients with high-risk AAA, earlier intervention may be reasonable. For symptomatic, unruptured AAA, urgent repair is indicated to reduce the risk of rupture, and for ruptured AAA, emergency surgical or endovascular treatment is indicated.

### Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms and their possible role in abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111SmBeS]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of AAA is poorly defined, making targeting of new therapies problematic. Current evidence favours an interaction of multiple environmental and genetic factors in the initiation and progression of AAA. Epigenetics is the term used to define the properties of the genome that are not explained by the primary sequence, but are due to the modifications of DNA and/or associated proteins. Previous research indicates the association of gene specific promoter DNA hyper-methylation and global DNA hypo-methylation with atherosclerosis. Evidence also suggests an important role for epigenetic processes such as histone acetylation in cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis and restenosis. Altered DNA methylation or histone acetylation occur in inflammation, cellular proliferation and remodelling processes and therefore maybe relevant to the pathology of AAA. Important risk factors for AAA, including cigarette smoking, older age, male gender and hypertension, have been linked with epigenetic effects and thus could act in this way to promote AAA. In this review, we discuss the potential role of epigenetic mechanisms in AAA. Since epigenetic alterations are to some extent reversible, further study of this area may identify new treatment targets for AAA.

### Pathogenesis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116SK2ak]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current management of AAA is by imaging surveillance of small aneurysm and surgical repair of large, symptomatic, or ruptured aneurysms. Patients and clinicians require effective drug therapies to limit AAA growth and the risks of both AAA repair and rupture. The diabetes drug metformin holds some promise and is being evaluated in ongoing trials. Other areas that could be targeted regarding development of drugs are dyslipidemia, IL-6 signalling, and stabilization of the extracellular matrix.

### Differential expression analyses on human aortic tissue reveal novel genes and pathways associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm onset and progression [^111JNHqJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are characterized by a local dilation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta to about 1.5 times the normal adjacent aortic diameter or > 3 cm in maximum diameter. AAAs are accompanied by chronic inflammation, apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, and neovascularization. Additionally, extracellular matrix degradation, microcalcification, and oxidative stress contribute to the degeneration of the aortic wall. The disease is progressive, and most aneurysms develop without causing symptoms. However, in the event of AAA rupture, mortality rates can reach 80%. The only effective treatment currently available for AAA is aortic tissue repair, either through open surgery or endovascular repair.

Some AAA risk factors are known, including age, male sex, smoking, and family history of AAA. Smoking, in addition, is also known to increase the risk of rupture. Additionally, recent genomic studies have revealed 121 loci associated with risk of developing an AAA, contributing to the knowledge of the possible pathways leading to this disease. However, there is still an insufficient understanding of the clear mechanisms that underlie the initiation, progression, and rupture of AAAs.

The study of gene expression, known as transcriptomics, is a valuable tool to understand human disease and to reveal new therapeutic targets. Several studies have been performed to study the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between human dilated aortic tissue and nondilated control aorta using microarray technology, detecting DEGs especially associated with the immune and inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis. In the present study, we performed RNA sequencing of the complete transcriptome in 140 human abdominal aortic tissue samples (96 AAA aortas and 44 control aortas from deceased donors) from the TABS (Triple A Barcelona Study) cohort, to identify new DEGs and pathways associated with the pathophysiology of AAA initiation and progression, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome, and becoming the largest human RNA sequencing data set for AAA tissue. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the differences in alternative splicing patterns in the context of AAA, and the role of genetic variants in gene expression in AAA tissue. The study design is described in Figure 1.

### Abdominal aortic aneurysm and abdominal wall hernia as manifestations of a connective tissue disorder [^1138cd6n]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and abdominal wall hernias represent chronic degenerative conditions. Both aortic aneurysms and inguinal hernias share common epidemiologic features, and several investigators have found an increased propensity for hernia development in patients treated for aortic aneurysms. Chronic inflammation and dysregulation in connective tissue metabolism constitute underlying biological processes, whereas genetic influences appear to be independently associated with both disease states. A literature review was conducted to identify all published evidence correlating aneurysms and hernias to a common pathology.

Methods

PubMed/Medline was searched for studies investigating the clinical, biochemical, and genetic associations of AAAs and abdominal wall hernias. The literature was searched using the MeSH terms "aortic aneurysm, abdominal", "hernia, inguinal", "hernia, ventral", "collagen", "connective tissue", "matrix metalloproteinases", and "genetics" in all possible combinations. An evaluation, analysis, and critical overview of current clinical data and pathogenic mechanisms suggesting an association between aneurysms and hernias were undertaken.

Results

Ample evidence lending support to the clinical correlation between AAAs and abdominal wall hernias exists. Pooled analysis demonstrated that patients undergoing aortic aneurysm repair through a midline abdominal incision have a 2.9-fold increased risk of developing a postoperative incisional hernia compared with patients treated for aortoiliac occlusive disease (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–4.16; P < .00001), whereas the risk of inguinal hernia was 2.3 (odds ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.52–3.48; P < .0001). Emerging evidence has identified inguinal hernia as an independent risk factor for aneurysm development. Although mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling and the imbalance between connective tissue degrading enzymes and their inhibitors instigating inflammatory responses have separately been described for both disease states, comparative studies investigating these biological processes in aneurysm and hernia populations are scarce. A genetic predisposition has been documented in familial and observational segregation studies; however, the pertinent literature lacks sufficient supporting evidence for a common genetic basis for aneurysm and hernia.

Conclusions

Insufficient data are currently available to support a systemic connective tissue defect affecting the structural integrity of the aortic and abdominal wall. Future investigations may elucidate obscure aspects of aneurysm and hernia pathophysiology and create novel targets for pharmaceutical and gene strategies for disease prevention and treatment.

### Pathogenesis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^116eQB7N]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

A key remaining priority is the development of therapies to limit AAA growth and rupture. A survey of 191 participants with an AAA from Oxford UK found that their top three aneurysm research questions were 'discovering why an AAA develops' (selected by 83%), 'discovering new medications that can make AAA shrink back to normal size' (selected by 71%), and 'discovering new medications that can stop an AAA from growing further' (selected by 64%). A survey of 277 vascular surgeons working in Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South America found that their top three AAA research priorities were 'new tests that can predict if an AAA will be fast growing' (selected by 23%), 'new medications that can stop an AAA from growing further' (selected by 23%), and 'new medications that can make an AAA shrink back to normal size' (selected by 20%). Effective new AAA drugs or intra-arterial therapies could treat early-stage aneurysms, act as adjuvant treatment after EVAR, and be used in people unfit for surgical repair. This article outlines the evidence supporting current management of AAA and research being undertaken to address these top priorities of better understanding of AAA pathogenesis and developing drug therapies (Graphical Abstract).

### Role of noncoding RNAs in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113GweDu]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a local dilatation of the abdominal aortic vessel wall and is among the most challenging cardiovascular diseases as without urgent surgical intervention, ruptured AAA has a mortality rate of > 80%. Most patients present acutely after aneurysm rupture or dissection from a previously asymptomatic condition and are managed by either surgery or endovascular repair. Patients usually are old and have other concurrent diseases and conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypercholesterolemia making surgical intervention more difficult. Collectively, these issues have driven the search for alternative methods of diagnosing, monitoring, and treating AAA using therapeutics and less invasive approaches. Noncoding RNAs-short noncoding RNAs (microRNAs) and long-noncoding RNAs-are emerging as new fundamental regulators of gene expression. Researchers and clinicians are aiming at targeting these microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs and exploit their potential as clinical biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for AAAs. While the role of miRNAs in AAA is established, studies on long-noncoding RNAs are only beginning to emerge, suggesting their important yet unexplored role in vascular physiology and disease. Here, we review the role of noncoding RNAs and their target genes focusing on their role in AAA. We also discuss the animal models used for mechanistic understanding of AAA. Furthermore, we discuss the potential role of microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs as clinical biomarkers and therapeutics.

### Pathophysiology of AAA: heredity vs environment [^1172kiQq]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has a complex pathophysiology, in which both environmental and genetic factors play important roles, the most important being smoking. The recently reported falling prevalence rates of AAA in northern Europe and Australia/New Zeeland are largely explained by healthier smoking habits. Dietary factors and obesity, in particular abdominal obesity, are also of importance. A family history of AAA among first-degree relatives is present in approximately 13% of incident cases. The probability that a monozygotic twin of a person with an AAA has the disease is 24%, 71 times higher than that for a monozygotic twin of a person without AAA. Approximately 1000 SNPs in 100 candidate genes have been studied, and three genome-wide association studies were published, identifying different diverse weak associations. An example of interaction between environmental and genetic factors is the effect of cholesterol, where genetic and dietary factors affect levels of both HDL and LDL. True epigenetic studies have not yet been published.

### Surrogate markers of abdominal aortic aneurysm progression [^113eh5w5]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

The natural course of many abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is to gradually expand and eventually rupture and monitoring the disease progression is essential to their management. In this publication, we review surrogate markers of AAA progression. AAA diameter remains the most widely used and important marker of AAA growth. Standardized reporting of reproducible methods of measuring AAA diameter is essential. Newer imaging assessments, such as volume measurements, biomechanical analyses, and functional and molecular imaging, as well as circulating biomarkers, have potential to add important information about AAA progression. Currently, however, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use in clinical practice.

### Implications of targeting neutrophil extracellular traps in aortic aneurysms [^115Jne8H]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a chronic vascular inflammatory disease that manifests as a local enlargement of the abdominal aorta, typically in the infrarenal aorta. Currently, surgical or endovascular intervention is the only viable option to prevent rupture, and effective pharmacologic treatments for AAA are urgently required for this patient cohort. The molecular pathology of AAA is complex and multifactorial, involving the interplay of signaling events between immune cells and parenchymal cells leading to chronic inflammation and vascular remodeling. An inflammatory cell infiltrate, smooth muscle cell proliferation and plasticity, degradation of the elastic media of the atheromatous aorta, and the production and activation of various proteases and cytokines contribute to the development of this disorder. Recent studies have focused on the pathologic changes involving marked infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, leading to formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that contribute to the inflammatory milieu of the aortic tissue microenvironment. The formation of NETs generally represents a host defense mechanism for mitigating pathogenic responses via the extracellular network comprising bactericidal proteins. Although NETosis is beneficial for the entrapment and clearance of pathogens, the induction of NETosis in sterile inflammation has also been reported and signifies a contributory mechanism to the pathogenesis of AAA.

### Aortic wall inflammation predicts abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion, rupture, and need for surgical repair [^115rB2qF]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Abdominal aortic aneurysms have a prevalence of 5% in 65- to 74-year-old men and, when ruptured, are associated with a mortality of ≤ 90%. At a population level, ruptured aortic aneurysms are a major cause of death, being the 13th most common cause of death and accounting for > 150 000 deaths in 2013. Preemptive elective open surgical or endovascular repair can be life-saving and is considered when the abdominal aortic aneurysm diameter is > 55 mm, is rapidly expanding (≥ 10 mm/year), or causes symptoms. –

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually associated with no symptoms and are often identified incidentally or as part of an ultrasound-based screening program. Population screening has been established in some countries and is associated with a halving of the mortality associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, continued surveillance of aneurysms is challenging because of the nonlinearity and unpredictability of expansion rates, although the best current predictor of aneurysm expansion and rupture is the baseline aneurysm diameter. Furthermore, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying aneurysm expansion remain uncertain, and the role of cellular inflammation and macrophage infiltration has been debated. Last, ≤ 20% of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms are < 55 mm in diameter, and 40% of patients with aneurysm diameters between 70 and 100 mm do not experience aneurysm rupture. Therefore, an unmet clinical need exists to identify more reliable methods of identifying those patients at risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion and rupture, and techniques that assess both the structure and biology of aneurysms hold considerable promise.

Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide (USPIO) constitute a class of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent taken up by tissue-resident macrophages and can be used to identify cellular inflammation within tissues, including abdominal aortic aneurysms. In a small pilot study of 29 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, we have previously demonstrated that USPIO enhancement on MRI is associated with macrophage infiltration of the abdominal aortic aneurysm wall and more rapid rates of abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion. We therefore aimed to validate these preliminary findings in a larger multicenter cohort of patients and determine whether USPIO-enhanced MRI could predict the rate of abdominal aortic aneurysm expansion and subsequent rates of rupture or surgical repair.

### Segmental aortic stiffening contributes to experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm development [^113XVG7A]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Stiffening of the aortic wall is a phenomenon consistently observed in age and in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, its role in AAA pathophysiology is largely undefined.

Methods and Results

Using an established murine elastase-induced AAA model, we demonstrate that segmental aortic stiffening precedes aneurysm growth. Finite-element analysis reveals that early stiffening of the aneurysm-prone aortic segment leads to axial (longitudinal) wall stress generated by cyclic (systolic) tethering of adjacent, more compliant wall segments. Interventional stiffening of AAA-adjacent aortic segments (via external application of surgical adhesive) significantly reduces aneurysm growth. These changes correlate with the reduced segmental stiffness of the AAA-prone aorta (attributable to equalized stiffness in adjacent segments), reduced axial wall stress, decreased production of reactive oxygen species, attenuated elastin breakdown, and decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration, and attenuated apoptosis within the aortic wall, as well. Cyclic pressurization of segmentally stiffened aortic segments ex vivo increases the expression of genes related to inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. Finally, human ultrasound studies reveal that aging, a significant AAA risk factor, is accompanied by segmental infrarenal aortic stiffening.

Conclusions

The present study introduces the novel concept of segmental aortic stiffening as an early pathomechanism generating aortic wall stress and triggering aneurysmal growth, thereby delineating potential underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets. In addition, monitoring segmental aortic stiffening may aid the identification of patients at risk for AAA.

Current abdominal aortic aneurysm management and need for medical management to limit growth and rupture

Current management

Randomized controlled trials suggest that early elective open surgical repair (OSR) or EVAR of asymptomatic 40–55 mm AAA does not reduce mortality. One trial suggested that EVAR did not significantly reduce mortality in people with large AAA unfit for OSR although this evidence maybe outdated due to advances in EVAR. One trial found that EVAR and OSR had similar 30-day mortality for ruptured AAA. Quality of life was better in the EVAR group, and 3-year mortality was lower after EVAR in participants with proven rupture. The risk of small aneurysm rupture is higher, and outcome of surgery is worse in women compared with men. Based on this evidence, current European Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend monitoring of small AAA (< 55 mm in men; < 50 mm in women) through imaging surveillance, elective surgical repair of large aneurysms in fit patients, and EVAR of ruptured AAA, if morphologically suitable. The intervention threshold for women is not evidence-based and remains a research priority.

Small abdominal aortic aneurysm and large abdominal aortic aneurysm that do not undergo surgical repair

The risk of rupture of small AAA in men is < 1%/year. The 3-year rupture rate of unrepaired 50–54 mm AAA in women was 3.4% in a recent study. Most small AAA grow in size over time, with the UK small aneurysm trial finding that 70% of 40–55 mm AAA grew to 55 mm within 5 years. Large aneurysms have a higher risk of rupture (estimated as 2.2%, 6.0%, and 18.4% over 3 years for 55–60 mm, 61–70 mm, and > 70 mm AAA, respectively). Rupture rate of large AAA is significantly greater in women than men, with a recent study reporting women with unrepaired 61–70 mm AAA had a 3-year incidence of rupture of 12.8% compared with 4.5% in men. There is no evidence that the growth rate of small AAA has changed over time. Thus, medical treatments that can slow AAA growth and reduce the risk of small aneurysm rupture are needed. The remainder of this review summarizes previous research performed to test and develop medical therapy to limit AAA growth and rupture.

### Pathogenesis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1175H4Zt]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The main aim of interventional treatment is to limit the risk of aneurysm rupture. The risk factors (and likely mechanisms) for AAA growth and rupture are not identical, and thus, it cannot be assumed that the effect of a drug on aneurysm growth and rupture is the same (Tables 1 and 4). Of note, higher blood pressure had been associated with increased risk of small aneurysm rupture in some studies but not AAA growth (Table 4). Since the risk of small AAA rupturing is very low and most large aneurysms undergo repair, it is very difficult to design trials adequately powered to test the effect of a treatment on aneurysm rupture. In all previous placebo-controlled trials, increase in aneurysm size (mainly diameter) was the primary outcome. While the trials did record AAA-related events, these were dominated by elective aneurysm repairs (Table 3). Aneurysm diameter is not always an accurate reflection of the risk of rupture since some small AAA do rupture and many large aneurysm remain intact for many years. Methods have been developed for reproducible estimation of the biomechanical risk of AAA rupture using aortic peak wall stress (PWS) and peak wall rupture index (PWRI) (Figure 3). Previous meta-analyses have reported higher PWS and PWRI in ruptured than intact AAA. Although the association between PWS/PWRI and aneurysm rupture is attenuated by adjustment for aneurysm diameter, it is possible these alternative surrogate measures may better reflect the risk of AAA rupture and be valuable outcomes in trials of drug therapies. We used data from the TEDY trial to assess the impact of telmisartan and blood pressure reduction on the change in PWS and PWRI over 24 months of follow-up. In this sub-analysis of 124 participants from TEDY (n = 65 telmisartan; 59 placebo), telmisartan significantly reduced the increase in PWS and PWRI (Figure 4). As expected, allocation to telmisartan was associated with a reduction in blood pressure. After adjusted for systolic blood pressure at 1 year, the annual changes in PWS and PWRI were no longer significantly different between groups although in the same direction. The exploratory and selective nature of this analysis is acknowledged given the primary analysis for TEDY was negative. It should also be noted that the role of high PWS in aneurysm rupture remains controversial since low wall shear stress has also been associated with AAA growth and rupture. Collectively, however, these data provide evidence that blocking the RAS does not inhibit small aneurysm growth but may limit the risk of aneurysm rupture.

### Genome wide association studies: identifying the genes that determine the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113LyAND]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component. Aside from the major environmental risk factor of tobacco use, and the un-modifiable risk factors of advancing age and male gender, there is compelling evidence for the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of AAA, with up to ten-fold increased risk in first degree relatives of those with AAA. However, it is widely accepted that AAA is unlikely to be associated with a single gene, and that multiple genetic factors are responsible. This makes identifying the genes involved in AAA challenging, as conventional approaches that have been successful for monogenic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Huntingtons disease are not appropriate.

One approach has been through hypothesis-driven association studies, whereby the frequency of a common variant in a candidate gene is compared between a group of unrelated affected individuals and unaffected age-matched controls. The major limitation of this approach is that the selection of appropriate candidate genes relies on knowledge of the pathological processes underlying the disease in question, and since this is currently unclear for AAA, the choice of genes studied to date has been made on a 'best guess' basis. These studies have recently been reviewedand the genes that have been studied include inflammatory mediators, tissue proteases and their inhibitors, those involved in endothelial and smooth muscle cell biology and those coding for components of the renin-angiotensin system. While such approaches have often given inconsistent results in different laboratories, meta-analysis of the available data has shown some evidence for modest risk effects associated with common variants in the genes for Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.33, Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (OR 1.14)), and matrix metalloprotease-9 (OR 1.09).

Biological targets and potential molecular imaging techniques in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. As well as patient factors (such as smoking, hypertension and advancing age) that contribute to the risk of AAA formation, biological processes have been identified that are implicit in aneurysm formation. The key processes are illustrated above, along with the corresponding molecular imaging techniques (written in green arrows) that have been used in experimental or clinical studies to date (primarily in the coronary arteries). The combination of patient-related risk factors and biological processes leads to increased wall stress and decreased wall strength (which can be investigated using computational modelling techniques), and all of these factors lead to aneurysm expansion and vulnerability to rupture.

### Sex-specific risk of smoking for abdominal aortic aneurysm and exploration of potential mechanism: meta-analysis and prospective cohort study [^1139R4tD]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Current smoking is associated with a ≈1.8-fold higher relative risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm in women compared with men.
The proportionately lower abdominal aortic aneurysm incidence rate in exsmokers (versus current smokers) was more marked in women.
Sex-specific risks of current smoking for incident abdominal aortic aneurysm were not significantly modified by CRP (C-reactive protein), white blood cell count, or other inflammatory markers.
In the UK Biobank cohort, the sex-specific relative risks of current smoking risks were higher for abdominal aortic aneurysm than for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Smoking is a stronger risk factor for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) than for the incidence of most other common forms of cardiovascular disease. Three studies, 2 longitudinal and 1 screening, have previously indicated the relative effect of smoking on AAA development appears to be stronger in women than men. – Because AAA is up to 6× more common in men, and recently smoking rates among adult men are only slightly higher than in women, such observations may seem surprising. However, it is recognized that men and women may smoke differently and for different reasons. Men and women choose different types of cigarettesand appear to inhale cigarettes differently. Neuroimaging studies support the activation of differential brain pathways, with men smoking primarily for the reinforcing or reward effects of nicotine, whereas women tend to smoke to regulate mood or in response to cigarette-related cues.

The culmination of cultural and physiological differences may result in different health outcomes. There is strong evidence that the risks of smoking for the development of both coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are stronger in women than men. – No underlying mechanisms have been identified. The strength of the association of smoking with the development and growth of AAA may offer a better possibility of identifying mechanisms. Therefore, the aim of this study is to consolidate the evidence for sex-specific differences in AAA through systematic review and meta-analysis and explore UK Biobank data for underlying mechanisms. Because inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and may be relevant to coronary heart disease and AAA, the hypothesis that smoking induced a higher inflammatory response in women than in men, which mediated the sex-specific effect on AAA risk, was explored.

### Antiplatelet therapy, abdominal aortic aneurysm progression, and clinical outcomes [^114QRauv]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular disease linked to 1.3% of all deaths among men aged 65 to 85 years in developed countries. Despite its substantial risk of surgical mortality, guidelines currently recommend elective AAA repair if the diameter reaches 5.5 cm for symptomatic AAA or in cases of rapidly expanding AAA.

Currently identified risk factors for AAA development and progression include age, male sex, hypertension, and smoking, with smoking being the most impactful modifiable risk factor. Risk factor control is currently the best available form of prevention for patients with AAA; thus there is an unmet need for medical therapies to slow the progression of AAA. Pharmacotherapy with β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, doxycycline, and azithromycinhave all failed to show benefit in limiting AAA progression or decreasing risk of rupture. One potential therapy that is associated with reduced AAA progression is metformin. Preclinical studies have shown that biomechanical platelet activation in a disturbed flow environment common to AAA is a pathophysiologic mechanism driving AAA development and growth, in addition to intramural thrombus formation. Although antiplatelet therapy was shown to reduce the intramural thrombi formation and aneurysm inflammatory response, and thus decrease the risk of rupture in animal models of AAA, the outcomes of aspirin in humans with AAA remains unclear.

Multiple studies have investigated the association of antiplatelet therapy with aneurysm progression in different vascular beds, including intracranial aneurysmsand AAA, with conflicting evidence. Some studies found no association with AAA risk of rupture or growth rate, while others showed a decrease in AAA growthas well as the risk of rupture or dissection with aspirin use. Previous studies were, however, limited by small numbers of patients or aneurysms that are small in diameter. AAA has been considered a coronary artery disease equivalent in terms of cardiovascular events and mortality, and the use of aspirin at 75 mg to 162 mg daily in patients with AAA and intramural thrombus or penetrating ulcer has been given a class 2b (level of evidence: C) in the updated 2022 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease. However, large clinical data on the role of aspirin in progression and outcomes of patients with AAA remain limited. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association of aspirin use with the progression of AAA and associated long-term clinical outcomes.

### Nuclear receptors in abdominal aortic aneurysms [^1119sVVQ]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) pose a considerable health burden and at present are only managed surgically since there is no proven pharmacotherapy that will retard their expansion or reduce the incidence of fatal rupture. This pathology shares several pathophysiological mechanisms with atherosclerosis, such as macrophage infiltration, inflammation, and degradation of extracellular matrix. Therefore, therapeutic targets proven effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis could also be considered for treatment of AAA. Different members of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily have been extensively studied as potential targets in the treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and therefore might also be suited for AAA treatment. In this context, this review summarizes the role of different NRs in CVD, mostly atherosclerosis, and discusses in detail the current knowledge of their implications in AAA. From this overview it becomes apparent that NRs that were attributed a beneficial or adverse role in CVD have similar roles in AAA. Together, this overview provides compelling evidence to consider several NRs as attractive targets for future treatment of AAA.

### Aneurysmal disease: the abdominal aorta [^111kNhLR]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Approximately 80% of AAAs occur in the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Most are caused by a degenerative process in the aortic wall, and smoking is the risk factor most strongly associated with AAA. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the most reliable imaging modality. Open repair is more invasive initially but more durable, whereas endovascular aneurysm repair is less invasive but less durable. Since degradation of the aorta progresses with age, continuous follow-up after aneurysmal repair improves the long-term outcome.

### CD14 directs adventitial macrophage precursor recruitment: role in early abdominal aortic aneurysm formation [^112PsbtZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality, occurring in up to 12.5% and 5.2% of elderly men and women, respectively. Roughly 25 000 AAA repairs are performed each year, and despite the progress made in primary preventive measures and screening programs, AAAs account for > 13 000 deaths annually in the United States. Only 21% to 33% of patients with aortic rupture survive to surgery, with an additional 50% mortality following surgery. Risk factors associated with AAA include older age, smoking, male sex, hypertension, and the presence of atherosclerotic disease in coronary or peripheral arteries. – Despite the frequency and associated morbidity and mortality of AAA, the specific cellular mechanisms that underlie aneurysm formation and progression are poorly understood.

The immune system plays a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and AAA. In the case of atherosclerosis, monocyte adhesion to inflamed endothelium is one of the earliest pathological features, followed by macrophage uptake of lipoproteins, leading to foam cell formation within the intima. The innate immune system, which is the genetically conserved, nonspecific first line of defense in the recognition of pathogens, has been linked to atherosclerosis in experimental animal models and in humans. For example, endotoxin (LPS) levels in the blood are strongly and independently associated with atherosclerosis in humans, and endotoxin injections augment atherosclerotic lesion development in animal models. – Moreover, deletions of Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) or its adaptor protein, MyD88, both of which play a crucial role in innate immune signaling, ameliorate atherosclerosis in mice. –

### Vascular smooth muscle cells in aortic aneurysm: from genetics to mechanisms [^115iYX78]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Aortic aneurysm is characterized by a permanent increase in the diameter of the aorta (> 50% increase). Aortic aneurysm is the second most prevalent aortic disease following atherosclerosis and accounts for the ninth‐leading cause of death overall. The estimated incidence is 2.79 per 100 000 individuals. Although an aortic aneurysm can remain asymptomatic for a long time, sudden rupture leads to life‐threatening hemorrhage with a high mortality rate.

The aorta is divided into the thoracic aorta (including the aorta root, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta) and abdominal aorta (suprarenal aorta and infrarenal aorta). Aortic aneurysm can occur in the thoracic aorta (thoracic aortic aneurysm [TAA]) or abdominal aorta (abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA]). The prevalence of AAA is about 3 times that of TAA.TAA and AAA share many similarities but also have distinct features. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in aortic aneurysm and mainly focus on the role of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in this severe disease.

Conclusion

Our study adds several important mechanistic insights into the pathobiology of AAAs. We observed that both aortic inflammation and calcification are greater in patients with aortic aneurysm than those with atherosclerosis alone, that aortic inflammation typically extends beyond the aneurysmal sac to involve the entirety of the aorta and that greater thrombus burden is associated with less aneurysm inflammation. Future studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of measuring aortic inflammation and calcification to improve clinical decision-making in patients with asymptomatic AAA.

### In vivo molecular characterization of abdominal aortic aneurysms using fibrin-specific magnetic resonance imaging [^114wKr29]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diseases of the cardiovascular system still represent the main cause of death in Western societies. In this group, specifically, diseases of the aorta demonstrate an increase in incidence. 1, 2 In the group of cardiovascular diseases, the rupture of aortic aneurysms currently represents the third most common cause of sudden death, with myocardial infarction and stroke representing numbers one and two. In the general population older than 50 years, the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is ≈5%. Currently, more than 70 000 interventions and operations are performed for the treatment of AAAs in the United States. 3, 4 Even though AAAs represent a relevant disease, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms leading to their development are still unknown. Therefore, a large number of aneurysms are classified to have a nonspecific cause. 5 For only a limited number of aneurysms, definite causes are known and can be defined. These include infections, connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan disease) and trauma. Independent of the cause, it is thought that the rupture of the elastic laminae in the tunica media leads to the dissection of the aortic wall. This subsequently leads to a progressive dilation of the aortic lumen. If these processes remain unrecognized and untreated, an aortic rupture with fatal implications for the patient can be the consequence. 6

### Role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms [^111Z2jKh]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is well established. The inflammatory process leads to protease-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells (SMC), which are the predominant matrix synthesizing cells of the vascular wall. These processes act in concert to progressively weaken the aortic wall, resulting in dilatation and aneurysm formation. Oxidative stress is invariably increased in, and contributes importantly to, the pathophysiology of inflammation. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and induction of SMC apoptosis. ROS may also contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension, a risk factor for AAA. Emerging evidence suggests that ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are associated with AAA formation in animal models and in humans. Although experimental data are limited, several studies suggest that modulation of ROS production or activity may suppress AAA formation and improve experimental outcome in rodent models. Although a number of enzymes can produce injurious ROS in the vasculature, increasing evidence points toward a role for NADPH oxidase as a source of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of AAA.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) timing of intervention — symptomatic evaluation and rupture risk by size: For a known AAA with acute symptoms but without hemodynamic instability, "A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred". In selected stable symptomatic cases, "it may be appropriate to delay intervention for several hours" and "the patient should be closely monitored in an ICU". For asymptomatic large aneurysms, "A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA, > 5.4 cm in diameter". Size-based rupture risk estimates include "rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but > 33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in diameter", while more contemporary pooled data report "a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms > 7 cm in diameter".

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies risk loci for abdominal aortic aneurysm and highlights PCSK9 as a therapeutic target [^116m8jc2]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease with substantial heritability. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis from 14 discovery cohorts and uncovered 141 independent associations, including 97 previously unreported loci. A polygenic risk score derived from meta-analysis explained AAA risk beyond clinical risk factors. Genes at AAA risk loci indicate involvement of lipid metabolism, vascular development and remodeling, extracellular matrix dysregulation and inflammation as key mechanisms in AAA pathogenesis. These genes also indicate overlap between the development of AAA and other monogenic aortopathies, particularly via transforming growth factor β signaling. Motivated by the strong evidence for the role of lipid metabolism in AAA, we used Mendelian randomization to establish the central role of nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol in AAA and identified the opportunity for repurposing of proprotein convertase, subtilisin/kexin-type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. This was supported by a study demonstrating that PCSK9 loss of function prevented the development of AAA in a preclinical mouse model.

Aortic aneurysm, including thoracic aortic aneurysm and abdominal aortic aneurysm, is the second most prevalent aortic disease following atherosclerosis, representing the ninth-leading cause of death globally. Open surgery and endovascular procedures are the major treatments for aortic aneurysm. Typically, thoracic aortic aneurysm has a more robust genetic background than abdominal aortic aneurysm. Abdominal aortic aneurysm shares many features with thoracic aortic aneurysm, including loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), extracellular matrix degradation and inflammation.

Among the cell types involved in aortic aneurysm development, VSMC dysfunction correlates with loss of aortic wall structural integrity. Here, we discuss the role of VSMCs in aortic aneurysm development. The loss of VSMCs, VSMC phenotypic switching, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, elevated reactive oxygen species, defective autophagy, and increased senescence contribute to aortic aneurysm development. Further studies on aortic aneurysm pathogenesis and elucidation of the underlying signaling pathways are necessary to identify more novel targets for treating this prevalent and clinical impactful disease.

### Deficiency of ITGAM attenuates experimental abdominal aortic aneurysm in mice [^115RZzQk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common and life‐threatening disease characterized by focal, permanent dilation and degradation of the aortic wall. In White people, population‐based studies have found a prevalence of AAA ranging from 1.2% to 3.3% in men older than 60 years. 1 Currently, open surgery and endovascular aortic repair are the first choices for the treatment of AAA, but these 2 established therapies are associated with high postoperative morbidity and high risk of requiring reintervention, respectively. 2 Thus, extensive research on the underlying molecular mechanism of AAA is warranted to develop effective medical therapies.

Pathologically, AAA is considered a chronic inflammatory response that includes the infiltration of macrophages into the media and adventitia, which is accompanied by the excessive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). 3, 4 Notably, the first step in the infiltration of macrophages is the establishment of adhesive interactions between circulating monocytes and vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and these interactions are mediated by 2 families of molecules named selectins and integrins. 5 Targeting these cell adhesion molecules may favor the repression of monocyte/macrophage recruitment and reduce the vascular inflammatory response. Ricci et al demonstrated that an anti‐CD18 (integrin β 2) monoclonal antibody could ameliorate the exacerbation of AAA by reducing monocyte infiltration. 6 However, it remains unclear whether direct intervention targeting integrin‐induced monocyte adhesion could attenuate experimental AAA.

Mac‐1, as a member of integrins, is a heterodimeric protein composed of integrin α M (CD11b) and integrin β 2. Of these molecules, CD11b is not only a surface marker of circulating monocytes but also mediates various cell functions, including adhesion, chemotaxis, and migration. 7 Moreover, CD11b contains an inserted domain that broadly contributes to the binding of Mac‐1 by many ligands, including intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 and fibrinogen. 8 Previously, several studies determined that the CD11b‐mediated interaction between monocytes and ECs promoted neurovascular injury, lupus nephritis, and vascular inflammation. 9, 10, 11, 12 Samadzadeh et al found higher levels of CD11b on circulating monocytes from patients with AAA compared with those on circulating monocytes from control subjects. In vitro, monocytes isolated from patients with AAA showed increased adhesion and transmigration activities, which were also positively associated with AAA diameter. 13 Therefore, we hypothesized that depleting CD11b might limit monocyte/macrophage adhesion and transendothelial migration, reduce the inflammatory response, and promote vascular remodeling.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm — timing by presentation and status: The optimal timing of AAA repair is based on clinical presentation and aneurysm status: a ruptured AAA requires emergent repair; a symptomatic, nonruptured aneurysm is best treated urgently; and an asymptomatic AAA can be treated electively after completion of preoperative assessment. Delay in the treatment of an asymptomatic, large AAA should be minimized.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis identifies risk loci for abdominal aortic aneurysm and highlights PCSK9 as a therapeutic target [^111wfy1G]. Nature Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Main

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening condition in which progressive expansion of the infrarenal aorta may lead to rupture, which is associated with high mortality. Approximately 4% of the US population over 65 years of age is affected by AAA, resulting in ~41,000 deaths annually.

AAA is often discovered incidentally or as a result of screening programs in certain demographic groups. Current US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening via duplex ultrasonography in men aged 65–75 years who have ever smoked, because men develop AAA at three to four times the rate of womenand smoking is a key risk factor. The mainstay of management is longitudinal surveillance until the aneurysm size reaches the point at which the risk of rupture exceeds the risk of repair. This disease surveillance period, which may last several years, represents an ideal opportunity to intervene and prevent disease progression. Unfortunately, there are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for the prevention and treatment of AAA. Although multiple pharmacological therapies have been previously proposed, based on compelling biology and promising evidence from preclinical model systems, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors and statins, to date, none have been shown to affect aneurysm growth or rupture in human trials.

Over the last two decades, large-scale genetic analyses have been instrumental in revealing new targets and promising therapies for atherosclerotic conditions. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AAA have revealed 24 genomic risk loci for AAA –, but a substantial portion of AAA heritability remains unexplained. Here we leveraged genetic data across 17 studies to (1) perform a genetic discovery analysis for AAA with substantially higher numbers of participants with AAA than previous studies (fivefold increase); (2) create and test the predictive power of polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from this analysis; (3) prioritize causal genes and pathways leading to disease; (4) explore the spectrum of phenotypic consequences associated with AAA risk variants and (5) identify potential therapeutic targets that may help prevent and treat AAA.

Challenges and lessons from previous drug trials

All past trials have tested the effects of medications in limiting AAA growth, which is usually slow and subject to measurement error and incomplete data and competing risks, as patients are lost to events such as AAA repair or death. Also patients with AAA are usually elderly, often with multiple co-morbidities, meaning they frequently cannot tolerate drugs with side effects which can lower drug adherence. Only two previous trials included sample sizes over 300 patients, and one of these trials tested three different doses of drugs, and so group sizes were still under 90 participants, and the other has very poor drug adherence. All these trials likely overestimated the treatment effect of the intervention they tested. Much larger sample sizes of at least 300 patients per group with longer follow-up of ∼5 years are needed to identify a realistic treatment effect on AAA growth. Also, the effects of drugs on very small AAA could be different from those of AAA approaching the threshold for surgical repair but previous trials have not been designed to test this. The primary outcome in one current trial is the clinically relevant end-point of AAA repair or rupture rather than AAA growth, but this design requires a sample size of ∼2000 participants to reliably test a realistic treatment effect.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterised by the chronic degradation and gradual, irreversible dilation of the abdominal aorta. Smoking, genetics, male sex and increased age are major factors associated with developing AAA. Rupture contributes to around 2% of deaths in all Caucasians over 65, and there is no pharmaco-therapeutic treatment. Methylation is an epigenetic modification to DNA, where a methyl group is added to a cytosine base 5' to a guanine (CpG dinucleotide). Methylation patterns are long term, inherited signatures that can induce changes in gene transcription, and can be affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Methylation changes are involved in hypertension and atherosclerosis, both of which are risk factors of, and often coexist with AAA. Extra-cellular matrix degradation and inflammation, both important pathological hallmarks of AAA, are also promoted by changes in CpG methylation in other diseases. Additionally, the adverse effects of smoking and ageing take place largely through epigenetic manipulation of the genome. Every factor associated with AAA appears to be associated with DNA methylation, yet no direct evidence confirms this. Future work to identify a link between global methylation and AAA, and differentially methylated regions may reveal valuable insight. The identification of a common epigenetic switching process may also signify a promising future for AAA pharmaco-therapeutic strategies. Epigenetic therapies are being designed to target pathogenic CpG methylation changes in other diseases, and it is feasible that these therapies may also be applicable to AAA in the future.

### Surveillance… [^115m5oWn]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is an abdominal aortic dilation of 3. 0 cm or greater. 1 The prevalence of AAA increases with age. It is uncommon in persons younger than 50 years; however, 12. 5% of men and
5. 2% of women 74 to 84 years of age have AAA. 1 It accounts for approximately 11, 000 deaths each year in the United States, with mortality rates from ruptured AAAs reaching up to 90%.
2. A ruptured AAA is a medical emergency associated with high mortality rates. The classic syndrome is characterized by hypotension, shooting abdominal or back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass. This triad may be incomplete or absent, and misdiagnosis can occur in up to 60% of cases. Therefore, physicians must be mindful of atypical presentations and attentive to new-onset, nonspecific back or abdominal pain in patients at risk of AAA.
8. Four randomized, controlled, population-based studies provide much of the available data on AAA screening.

11–14 The Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study was the largest, following approximately 70, 000 men between 65 and 74 years of age for 10 years. 11 Participants were randomized to an offer of ultrasonography or to a control group. Those with AAA detected at screening were followed by ultrasound surveillance or elective surgery based on predefined criteria. The reduction in AAA-related mortality improved from 42% at four-year follow-up to 48% at 10-year follow-up, demonstrating continued benefit over the duration of the study. 11 This program also demonstrated continued cost-effectiveness, particularly as the study progressed, because the major costs of screening occur early with initial screening and intervention. 15 Other data have substantiated the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening.
16. 26, 27 Although there have been recommendations supporting statin use, the evidence for reducing AAA growth or rupture has been poor, and better-quality studies do not indicate a direct benefit.

27, 28 Statins are likely to be used for overall cardiovascular risk reduction and do improve all-cause mortality in patients after AAA repair. 28 Additionally, roxithromycin and doxycycline have weak evidence for inhibiting AAA growth, because secondary infection in the aortic wall, likely from Chlamydophila pneumoniae, may promote AAA progression. 27, 29.

### Novel contributions of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the role of neutrophil extracellular traps: a systematic review [^112W9FNM]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disorder caused by a dilatation of the aortic diameter that can be potentially lethal in case of rupture. Molecular mechanisms underlying the development of AAA are complex and not completely understood. However, inflammation plays a pivotal role in AAA development. Infiltration of inflammatory cells, especially macrophages, has been widely observed in lesion areas. Nevertheless, neutrophils have been gaining importance in the context of AAA. The release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), extracellular structures formed by DNA, histones, granular and cytoplasmic proteins, is a recently discovered mechanism of neutrophil activation that can be triggered by endogenous inflammatory stimulus. The number of studies about the role of NETs in several vascular diseases like thrombosis and atherosclerosis has increased in last decade. However, its role in AAA has been scarcely analysed. The aim of this review is to deepen in the latest advances concerning the potential role neutrophils and especially NETs in AAA development.

### Chemokine receptor 2 is a theranostic biomarker for abdominal aortic aneurysms [^111EtzGw]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Various studies have identified inflammation as a key feature associated with AAA pathogenesis. The presumed process is that cytokines and chemokines are secreted by immune cells following vascular injury, which in turn promotes recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, and further infiltration in the aortic tissues that cause further damage. Increased tissue oxidative stress and local release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is thought to trigger vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation, which results in AAA expansion. As such, recent studies have investigated whether targeting inflammation signaling pathways can decrease AAA expansion and prevent its rupture. Despite early promising data in rodent models, to date there has been very limited translation in humans with AAA, and therefore the search for an inflammation-mediating strategy for AAA management remains critically needed.

An unmet clinical challenge for the management of AAA patients is to sensitively and specifically determine AAA progression and assess its vulnerability in a noninvasive manner. Clinical imaging modalities for AAAs such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), computed tomography angiogram (CTA), and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging mainly focus on the anatomic features (diameter, volume) of the AAA. Although new imaging parameters such as AAA volume and aortic size index (ratio of aortic diameter and body surface area) are being explored, their applications to predict the risk of AAA rupture are limited. Ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxide-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging had shown potential to predict the rate of AAA growth and clinical outcome. However, the assessment needs to be integrated with established clinical factors. Functional imaging-based modalities such as [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose and sodium [18 F] fluoride have demonstrated some promise in patients with AAAs. However, both lack specificity for critical determinants of the inflammatory response in AAA development and theranostic potential for patients undergoing expectant management. In contrast to anatomy-based imaging modalities, molecular imaging affords the potential to noninvasively track cell surface biomarkers to gain insight into AAA pathogenesis and to uncover underlying mechanisms for potential therapy. So far, many molecular imaging agents have been developed for AAA detection in preclinical and/or clinical research with promising results such as MMPs and integrin. However, a theranostic strategy that pairs detection of a biologic target of vulnerable AAA with a therapeutic to the same target to blunt disease progression has never been realized.

### Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm [^1168iDwv]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) accounts for 5% to 10% of all cases of AAA and differs from typical atherosclerotic AAA in many important ways. Although both inflammatory and atherosclerotic AAA most commonly affect the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta, patients with the inflammatory variant are younger and usually symptomatic, chiefly from back or abdominal pain. Unlike patients with atherosclerotic AAA, most with the inflammatory variant have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or abnormalities of other serum inflammatory markers. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are both sensitive for demonstrating the cuff of soft tissue inflammation surrounding the aneurysm that is characteristic of inflammatory AAA. In contrast to atherosclerotic AAA, the inflammatory variant is characterized pathologically by marked thickening of the aneurysm wall, fibrosis of the adjacent retroperitoneum, and rigid adherence of the adjacent structures to the anterior aneurysm wall. An extraordinary expansion of the adventitia due to inflammation also distinguishes inflammatory from atherosclerotic AAA. Although the pathogenesis of inflammatory AAA appears to involve an immune response localized to the vessel wall, the etiology of the inflammatory reaction is unknown. Inflammatory AAA is almost never associated with inflammation of other arteries. Male sex and smoking, the main risk factors for atherosclerotic AAA, are even stronger risk factors for the inflammatory variant. Smoking cessation is the first step of medical therapy. Corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapies may also have roles. Although inflammatory AAA appears less likely to rupture than atherosclerotic AAA, surgical intervention appears prudent once the diameter of the aneurysm exceeds 5.5 cm. Knowing the features of inflammatory AAA should allow physicians to distinguish it from atherosclerotic AAA or from systemic vasculitis and to treat it with the appropriate combination of medical and surgical therapies.

### New approaches to abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture risk assessment: engineering insights with clinical gain [^1121QGEe]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture remains a significant cause of death in the developed world. Current treatment approaches rely heavily on the size of the aneurysm to decide on the most appropriate time for clinical intervention and treatment. However, in recent years, several alternative rupture risk indicators have been proposed. This brief review examines some of these new approaches to AAA rupture risk assessment, from both numeric and experimental aspects and also what the future may hold for AAA rupture risk. Although numerically predicted wall stress, finite element analysis rupture index, rupture potential index, severity parameter, and geometric factors, such as asymmetry, have all been developed and show promise in possibly helping to predict AAA rupture risk, validation of these tools remains a significant challenge. Validation of biomechanics-based rupture indicators may be feasible by combining in vitro modeling of realistic AAA analogues with both retrospective and prospective monitoring and modeling of AAA cases. Peak wall stress is arguably the primary result obtained from numeric analyses; however, as the majority of ruptures occur in the posterior and posterior-lateral regions, the role of posterior wall stress has also recently been highlighted as potentially significant. It is also known that wall stress alone is not enough to cause rupture, as wall strength plays an equal role. Therefore, should a biomechanics-based rupture risk be implemented? There have been some significant steps, both numerically and experimentally, toward answering this and other questions relating to AAA rupture risk prediction, yet regardless of the efforts that are under way in several laboratories, the introduction of a numerically predicted rupture risk parameter into the clinicians' decision-making process may still be quite some time away.

### Prevention of CaCl-induced aortic inflammation and subsequent aneurysm formation by the CCL3-CCR5 axis [^111BusG2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by enlarged aorta with the structural destruction composed of the fragmentation of the extracellular matrix. Several conditions including aging, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, infection, genetic conditions, and trauma are denoted as risk factors for AAA formation. Moreover, males are reported to have a much higher risk of developing AAA than females. AAA usually causes no severe symptoms, at most with faint abdominal, back, or leg pains, and as a consequence, it frequently ruptures without preceding symptoms and progresses rapidly, resulting in high acute mortality up to about 80%. Thus, AAA is one of the major causes of sudden unexpected natural death.

Multiple factors such as atherosclerosis, hemodynamics, genetic deficiency, microbiological infection, trauma, environmental conditions, and immunological states are presumed to be involved in the pathogenesis of AAA. Inflammation is temporally and spatially associated with disruption of the orderly lamellar structure of the aortic media and eventually leads to AAA development and progression. In support of this assumption, human AAA lesions exhibit dense infiltration of a myriad of innate and adaptive immune cells, including macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells. Among these infiltrates, macrophages and T lymphocytes are the predominant cell types. Consistently, the intense inflammatory response can cause gradual aortic dilatation and subsequent aneurysm formation in the aorta and carotid artery in animal models. Moreover, blocking aortic wall inflammation can limit the development and progression of aortic aneurysm, and accentuation of inflammation can increase the frequency and size of the aneurysms.

Inflammation in the aorta can frequently induce the breakdown of normally long-lived matrix macromolecules present in aortic walls, such as collagen and elastin, and eventually dilate the aortic wall, resulting in aneurysm formation. Collagen and elastin are mainly degraded by a family of endopeptidases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Moreover, several lines of evidence indicate that MMPs with a high capacity to degrade collagen, particularly MMP-9, was expressed by infiltrating macrophages as well as resident vascular smooth muscle cells in aneurysm lesions –. Based on these observations, the efficacy of MMP inhibitors was examined in preclinical animal models – and in early clinical trials for patients with aneurysm. However, MMP inhibitors could only delay the speed of aneurysm formation without preventing its progression. Thus, it is necessary to establish an effective therapeutic strategy for aneurysm based on the understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying aneurysm formation.

### Protein drug targets for abdominal aortic aneurysm and proteomic associations between modifiable risk factors and abdominal aortic aneurysm [^113AqHwT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common vascular condition defined by abdominal aorta enlargement exceeding 50% of the normal aortic diameter or measuring > 3 cm in diameter. The mechanism of AAA remains obscure. Risk factors include smoking, advanced age, male sex, family history of AAA, hypertension, and obesity, among others. If an aneurysm ruptures, the condition becomes life threatening. Current therapeutic approaches primarily involve surgical interventions such as open surgery and endovascular aneurysm repair. No pharmacological therapy has demonstrated definitive efficacy in inhibiting the progression or preventing the rupture of small, asymptomatic AAAs. Consequently, patients with small AAAs or those unsuitable for surgery are limited to risk factor management and regular monitoring, highlighting an urgent need to identify viable drug targets. Conventional drug development, from discovery through clinical application, is a time‐intensive and costly process with a high failure rate. Integrating genetic evidence into drug target identification can improve the efficiency and likelihood of successful drug development. Accumulating data indicate that plasma proteins serve as the primary executors of various biological functions and represent prominent therapeutic targets. Recent large‐scale genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) on plasma proteins and AAA have opened new avenues for discovering potential drug targets.

Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical methodology that uses genetic variants to determine causal relationships between risk factors and disease outcomes. By integrating proteomic and genomic data, MR has been widely used to identify potential therapeutic targets.MR is based on 3 key assumptions: (1) the genetic variants must be significantly associated with the exposure; (2) there are no confounders between the genetic variants and the outcome; and (3) the genetic variants should have no direct association with the outcome, except via the exposure. Compared with observational studies, MR offers enhanced resistance to confounding factors and reverse causation, given that an individual's genotype is established at zygote formation.

In this study, a comprehensive proteome‐wide MR analysis was conducted to identify potential therapeutic targets for AAA. Subsequent sensitivity analyses and validation studies ensured result reliability. Enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were employed to examine the biological functions of the identified protein targets. Their druggability, tissue distribution, and single‐cell localization within AAA tissues were further evaluated. Additionally, key proteins were validated through immunohistochemistry and external blood data. Mediation MR analysis was then applied to clarify the proteomic pathways connecting modifiable risk factors to AAA.

### Understanding the effects of tobacco smoke on the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm [^113TzD4Q]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Aneurysmal arterial disease is a vascular degenerative condition that is distinct from atherosclerotic and other occlusive arterial diseases. There is regionalization of the predisposition to aneurysm formation within the vascular tree, and the pathological process varies with location. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common manifestation of aneurysmal disease, and smoking is the dominant risk factor. Smoking is a much greater risk factor for AAA than for atherosclerosis. In addition to playing a role in the pathogenesis of AAA, smoking also increases the rate of expansion and risk of rupture of established AAA. The mechanistic relationship between AAA and smoking is being established by the use of enhanced animal models that are dependent on smoke or smoke components. The mechanisms seem to involve durable alterations in vascular smooth muscle cell and inflammatory cell function. This review examines the clinical, epidemiological, and mechanistic evidence implicating smoking as a cause of aneurysms, focusing on AAA.

### Opportunities in abdominal aortic aneurysm research: epidemiology, genetics, and pathophysiology [^116AiYXK]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Aortic aneurysms are a complex genetic disorder with known environmental risk factors such as smoking. Along the length of the aorta, significant heterogeneity occurs in the distribution of aneurysmal disease. The prevalence of aneurysm in the abdominal aorta is at least nine times higher than that in the thoracic section of the aorta. A number of studies have shown that aortic aneurysms are frequently familial, even when they are not associated with rare heritable disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. The pathobiology of aortic aneurysms is complex and largely unsolved. Unbiased whole-genome approaches are now being used to elucidate the genetic basis of aortic aneurysms to uncover the germline genetic variants that influence the disease risk. The findings will provide critical information about underlying biology of the disease and will help identify potential targets for pharmacological therapies. These studies may lead to therapies that may increase survival rates for individuals with aortic aneurysms and reduce the need for surgical interventions. Abdominal aortic aneurysms were the topic of an international conference "Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Epidemiology, Genetics, and Pathophysiology" held recently at the Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania.

### Parallel murine and human aortic wall genomics reveals metabolic reprogramming as key driver of abdominal aortic aneurysm progression [^114pRyma]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a medical catastrophe with an estimated overall mortality of 80%. Risk of rupture progressively associates with AAA diameter. As a consequence, current guidelines advise elective repair of larger (> 55 mm) aneurysms. Multiple trials have shown no survival benefit for repair of smaller AAA, implying a potential for medical interventions aimed at stabilizing small AAA ("keep small aneurysms small").

Remarkably, while several hundred therapies have been shown to effectively interfere with AAA formation or progression in experimental models, this enormous investment has not produced any notable clinical application. In fact, there is currently no established pharmaceutical therapy for aneurysm stabilization. The sharp contrast between preclinical successes and clinical failures is discouraging, and may imply limited translatability of the available experimental models for clinical, late‐stage AAA disease.

By far the most commonly used models of AAA disease are the angiotensin‐II mouse model (AngII) and the rodent "elastase" model. Aneurysm formation in the elastase model is triggered by brief porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) exposure of an isolated infrarenal aorta segment. Exposure results in an initial, modest expansion caused by a loss of elastic recoil in response to the elastase exposure. This initial dilatation is then followed by a secondary dilatation that occurs approximately 1 week after the elastase exposure, and that is considered the actual aneurysm formation. The secondary dilatation is thought to result from a delayed inflammatory response elicited by the elastase infusion or its consequences. The ultimately aortic dilatation in the model varies between 150 and 200%. A major criticism of the model is that the model stabilizes as result of fibrotic changes ("heals"), and generally does not associate with rupture.

### Statins reduce abdominal aortic aneurysm growth, rupture, and perioperative mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111R1w11]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Proposed Mechanisms and Explanation of Findings

The exact mechanism by which statins may attenuate AAA growth is unknown, but several theories exist. The prevailing theory is that statins reduce intramural aortic MMP expression. 59, 60, 61 Overexpression of these collagenases is thought to be an integral pathophysiologic mechanism for AAA development and progression. Culture and tissue studies have demonstrated higher levels of MMPs 1, 2, 8, 9, and 13, and lower levels of their corresponding inhibitors in aneurysmal cells and tissues and at sites of aneurysm rupture. 62, 63, 64, 65, 66 Furthermore, correlation between degree of inflammation and MMP expression has been shown, and immunochemistry studies have localized MMP production to macrophages and B cells in the adventitia of aneurysmal aortas. 65, 66, 67 At least in part, statin‐mediated MMP expression attenuation is thought to be derived from the anti‐inflammatory properties of statuns. 20, 59

Aneurysm diameter and growth rate are well‐established risk factors for AAA rupture, lending validity to the observed association between statin use and AAA rupture rate. 68, 69, 70, 71, 72 Furthermore, even though a submillimeter annual growth rate reduction is of questionable clinical significance, the association with a 37% lower rupture rate in the statin arm of our meta‐analysis highlights the potential clinical importance of this effect. This small annual growth rate effect may accumulate over time to produce the observed effect on rupture rate. However, it is difficult to confidently make this assertion due to limited and incomplete reporting of follow‐up in the rupture studies. An alternative explanation for the lower rupture rate among statin users may involve additional AAA stabilization by the attenuation of underlying inflammation and associated tissue friability.

### Differential expression analyses on human aortic tissue reveal novel genes and pathways associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm onset and progression [^111cvEGg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta that expand progressively, increasing their risk of rupture. Rupture of an AAA is associated with high mortality rates, but the mechanisms underlying the initiation, expansion, and rupture of AAAs are not yet fully understood. We aimed to characterize the pathophysiology of AAAs and identify new genes associated with AAA initiation and progression.

Methods and Results

This study used RNA sequencing data on 140 samples, becoming the largest RNA sequencing data set for differential expression studies of AAAs. We performed differential expression analyses and analyses of differential splicing between dilated and nondilated aortic tissue samples, and between AAAs of different diameters. We identified 3002 differentially expressed genes between AAAs and controls that were independent of ischemic time, 1425 of which were new. Additionally, 8 genes (EXTL3, ZFR, DUSP8, DISP1, USP33, VPS37C, ZNF784, RFX1) were differentially expressed between AAAs of varying diameters and between AAAs and control samples. Finally, 7 genes (SPP1, FHL1, GNAS, MORF4L2, HMGN1, ARL1, RNASE4) with differential splicing patterns were also differentially expressed genes between AAAs and controls, suggesting that splicing differences in these genes may contribute to the observed expression changes and disease development.

Conclusions

This study identifies new genes and splicing patterns associated with AAAs and validates previous relevant pathways on AAAs. These findings contribute to the understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying AAAs and may provide potential targets to limit AAA progression and mortality risk.

### Deficiency of peroxiredoxin 2 exacerbates angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm [^111MmDi4]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an aortic disorder with a prevalence of 2 to 8% in men older than 65 years. If rupture occurs, AAA has a mortality rate that has been reported to be between 85 and 90%. Degradation of the elastic media, activation of various proteases, infiltration of inflammatory cells, increased production of cytokines and formation of neovessels are closely linked to the development of AAA. Oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during inflammatory processes involved in the pathogenesis of AAA induces the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and proteolytic degradation of structural proteins. Evidence of increased oxidative stress in tissue samples from patients with AAA implicates ROS in the pathogenesis of AAA –. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of oxidative stress attenuates aneurysmal aortic diseases in animal models. Despite our advanced understanding of AAA pathology, surgical management, including open surgery and endovascular repair, is currently the only proven effective intervention because of the lack of pharmacological agents. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β blockers have failed to inhibit aneurysm expansion in clinical trials –. It is necessary to clarify the effects of statins, tetracycline, and macrolides on the progression of aneurysmal disease –. Thus, novel candidates for the regulation of AAA progression are needed for the development of pharmacological agents with favorable safety profiles.

### Phosphodiesterase 4D contributes to angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm through smooth muscle cell apoptosis [^1157yusa]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a chronic vessel wall degenerative disease characterized by the irreversible progressive dilatation of the abdominal aorta over 3.0 cm (1.5-fold of normal abdominal aorta). AAA is a multifactorial disease that predominantly affects elderly males 65 years or older. AAA rupture is a life-threatening medical emergency, with mortality rates > 81%. At present, there are no effective clinical medicines to prevent, delay, or reverse the growth or rupture of AAA, except surgical repair. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms and identifying regulators underlying the pathogenesis of AAA are essential for developing potential therapeutic strategies. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are the major cell type in the medial layer of large arteries. SMCs regulate vascular contractility in response to pulsatile blood flow and pressure in aortas. SMCs are the major contributors to elastin fibers that maintain the elasticity of aortas. Increasing evidence has indicated that the loss of vascular SMCs contributes to aortic wall weakening, dilation, and aneurysm formation.

The second messenger cyclic nucleotides 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (3′,5′-cAMP) and 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3′,5′-cGMP) are important in regulating smooth muscle contractile function and vessel wall structure integrity. Abnormal cyclic nucleotide homeostasis contributes to a variety of cardiovascular diseases –. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of enzymes responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic nucleotides and thus play crucial roles in regulating the duration, magnitude, and compartmentalization of cyclic nucleotide responses. There are 11 families within the PDE superfamily (PDE1 to PDE11), and each family contains multiple subtypes. PDE dysregulation has been associated with numerous diseases. Over the past decades, PDEs have been proven to be ideal and feasible drug targets. Several family-specific PDE inhibitors are currently used or are currently under clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of diseases –.

### Associations of tissue and soluble LOX-1 with human abdominal aortic aneurysm [^112C3x7W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are defined by a dilation of the aortic diameter > 30 mm. Risk factors include family history of AAA, smoking, age > 65 years, male sex, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. Unexpected rupture of AAA without preceding symptoms is often the first clinical manifestation and a life‐threatening condition. Small AAAs (< 50 mm) are monitored for their maximum aortic diameter, and elective surgery, either by open repair or endovascular therapy, is indicated at 55 mm. To date, surgical therapy is the only treatment option for patients with AAA, and the decision relies on the maximum aortic diameter. Nonetheless, rupture at a diameter < 50 mm is possible, and discovery of novel biomarkers that diagnose AAA, predict disease progression and fast‐growing AAA has top priority in the field of research. The majority of AAAs are covered by a nonocclusive intraluminal thrombus (ILT) that eventually affects vessel wall remodeling and rupture risk (eg, by secreting inflammatory cells or matrix‐degrading enzymes). Formation of the ILT involves hemodynamics, the coagulation cascade, inflammatory cell activation, and cytokine/protease release.

The lectin‐like oxidized low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐1 (LOX‐1) was originally identified as the major receptor for uptake of oxidized low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (oxLDL) in endothelial cells.LOX‐1 is also expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and platelets. Angiotensin II, oxLDL, proinflammatory cytokines, hypertension, diabetes, as well as pro‐oxidative and mechanical stimuli can induce LOX‐1 expression. Upon activation, LOX‐1 promotes atherosclerosis by affecting inflammation, apoptosis, and vascular remodeling.LOX‐1 is highly expressed in atherosclerotic plaques obtained from patients with carotid artery stenosisand CAD, but nothing is known about its gene expression in human AAA. Although AAA and atherosclerosis share common risk factors and mechanisms, both are considered as independent diseases with distinct pathomechanisms.

### Propionate alleviates abdominal aortic Aneurysm by modulating colonic Regulatory T-Cell expansion and Recirculation [^114vUn2G]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) refers to the deterioration and dilatation of the abdominal aorta and manifests as a diameter increase of more than 50%. Clinically, aortic deterioration and expansion progress asymptomatically until lethal rupture, which results in a mortality rate of 85% to 90%. The pathology of AAA involves chronic inflammation, apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Inflammation triggers deterioration of the aorta, whereas fragments of the degraded aortic wall in turn recruit proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages and T cells, which produce proteases, especially matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, causing further damage to the aortic wall. Among infiltrating immune cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) modulate inflammation by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting proinflammatory macrophages. Despite recent advances in pathophysiology, AAA remains a threat in the elderly population. However, no medication can be prescribed to prevent the progression of AAA. Inhibiting chronic and excessive inflammation in subjects with AAA may be a strategy for restricting aortic expansion.

Increasing evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiota plays a role in inflammatory cardiovascular diseases. The microbiota regulates the host immune system by producing active metabolites in the intestine, among which short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are attracting interest.SCFAs, mainly acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which are products of bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon, have been reported to alleviate inflammatory bowel diseases by expanding Tregs. Beyond the actions reported in intestinal immune homeostasis, SCFAs have been found to play critical roles in nonintestinal inflammatory disorders, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. However, whether and how SCFAs modulate AAA remains unclear.

In the present study, we aimed to identify whether and how SCFAs influence AAA. We confirmed the protective effect of SCFAs in both Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 -induced and elastase-induced mouse models of AAA and subsequently elucidated the underlying mechanisms by focusing on how a representative and potent SCFA, propionate, mitigated AAA. Our results highlight the prominent role of SCFAs in aortic inflammation and provide a basis for the development and translation of prebiotic-based therapeutics for human AAA.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture — population risk and predictors — in the UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT), the annual risk of rupture was 2.2%; factors significantly and independently associated with rupture included female gender, large initial aneurysm diameter, low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, current smoking history, and elevated mean blood pressure; multiple studies have suggested that women are at greater risk for rupture and that patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy after major organ transplantation are also at risk; in a Swedish population study, women with a history of smoking of > 20 pack-years were nearly twice as likely to develop AAA as men with a similar smoking history, and the risk of AAA after smoking cessation declines more rapidly in women than in men; increased aortic mural calcification has also been suggested as a risk factor for rupture.
