## Question

Does an elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) test result indicate active rheumatoid arthritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an elevated rheumatoid factor by itself indicates active rheumatoid arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what rheumatoid factor actually measures, including isotypes and assay variability. Then, I should distinguish RF serostatus from the clinical definition of active disease. Next, I will review longitudinal evidence on RF preceding disease and its prognostic implications. After that, I need to check for confounders that can elevate RF without RA. Finally, I will align this with guideline-based disease activity assessment and synthesize a clear clinical answer and next steps for practice.

> Let me first confirm the biology and testing nuances. Rheumatoid factor comprises autoantibodies, most commonly IgM but also IgG and IgA, directed against the Fc portion of IgG; low-titer IgM-RF is nonspecific and can occur in healthy persons, while high and persistent titers and the presence of IgG or IgA RF raise specificity for RA, although absolute thresholds vary across studies and labs, so I need to ensure I interpret titers in the context of the local assay and reference range [^111XWZpr] [^115sXHV1] [^115YYJGo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about activity. Active RA requires clinical evidence of synovitis that is not better explained by another diagnosis, and while RF contributes points to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, serology alone does not satisfy the requirement for joint involvement, which means RF by itself cannot establish disease activity at the bedside [^115Umhze].

> Next, I should review whether RF can precede disease and what risk gradients look like. Large prospective cohort data show that elevated RF levels can predate clinical RA by years and stratify future risk in a titer-dependent fashion, with particularly high absolute 10-year risks at titers above 100 IU/mL in specific subgroups, so an elevated RF increases probability of future RA but is not proof of current activity; wait, let me verify the commonly used threshold, yes, a ROC-derived cut point around 25 IU/mL is often cited in these cohorts [^113HKLEp] [^111GHr19] [^111X9Zc7].

> I will now examine whether RF levels track disease activity over time. In early inflammatory arthritis cohorts, both RF and ACPA can convert and revert over 24 months, and these fluctuations did not predict disease activity, remission, or most outcomes, which argues against using RF level as a real-time activity biomarker; I should double-check that persistent ACPA positivity had some erosive association, but RF fluctuations themselves were not linked to activity indices [^117KiFDU].

> Let me consider severity signals and combinatorial serology. The combination of RF and ACPA positivity is associated with higher disease activity, higher CRP, and proinflammatory cytokines compared with single-positive or double-negative states, and baseline RF and or ACPA positivity predicts radiographic progression in early RA, indicating prognostic — not activity — information; but wait, I should confirm that ACPA generally has higher specificity than RF for classification and prognosis, which meta-analytic data support [^112BLNiA] [^113rMUXd] [^114XnAVw].

> But wait, what if the RF elevation is from something else. I need to check common confounders: smoking is strongly associated with higher odds of RF positivity in people without arthritis, RF and immunoglobulins can nonspecifically elevate acute-phase reactants complicating interpretation of ESR and CRP, and RF can cause false positives in unrelated assays such as malaria rapid tests, so isolated RF elevation must be contextualized clinically [^113kifac] [^112Uay71] [^1111u6v3].

> Next, I should review how activity is supposed to be measured. Guideline-endorsed RA activity assessment relies on composite indices that integrate tender and swollen joint counts, patient and provider assessments, and acute-phase reactants, and contemporary remission definitions do not include RF, while guidance for difficult-to-treat RA emphasizes reevaluating diagnosis and considering comorbidity confounding rather than treating a lab value, so I need to ensure I am not substituting RF for proper activity measurement [^113WKMss] [^111u2B9b] [^114t11qr] [^114q2h7i].

> Synthesis time. No — an elevated RF test result does not by itself indicate active rheumatoid arthritis; RF is a risk and prognostic biomarker that can precede disease, correlate with severity in combination with ACPA, and contribute to classification, but activity determination is clinical and composite index based, and RF lacks the specificity and temporal responsiveness needed to serve as an activity marker, so I should confirm synovitis and use validated indices to judge activity [^115Umhze] [^113WKMss] [^115jkF8m].

> Finally, practical next steps. If RF is elevated, I should confirm or refute clinical synovitis on examination, obtain ACPA and acute-phase reactants, consider ultrasound or MRI if there is arthralgia with suspected subclinical synovitis, counsel smoking cessation where relevant, and interpret RF titers with assay specifics in mind; if RA is diagnosed, I should proceed with treat-to-target management using validated activity measures, whereas if there is no synovitis, I should avoid labeling this as active RA and instead risk-stratify and monitor over time, especially at higher RF titers or with ACPA positivity [^115Umhze] [^112eFAEj] [^114XnAVw] [^115jkF8m].

No, a high rheumatoid factor (RF) test does not mean **active rheumatoid arthritis (RA)** [^113WKMss]. RF is a nonspecific autoantibody [^111XWZpr] that may be elevated in other autoimmune diseases and infections [^114XnAVw], as well as in healthy individuals — particularly older adults [^notfound] and smokers [^113kifac]. RF is a **prognostic marker** for severe disease and joint damage, but it does not reliably track disease activity or treatment response. Active RA is defined by clinical assessment and composite scores (DAS28, CDAI, SDAI), **not by RF alone** [^113WKMss]. RF should be interpreted [^111XWZpr] alongside clinical findings, anti-CCP [^115Umhze], CRP/ESR, and imaging to guide diagnosis and management [^112vfWzV].

---

## Clinical significance of rheumatoid factor

RF is an autoantibody against the Fc portion of IgG — typically IgM [^111XWZpr] — and is **present in about 70–90% of RA patients** [^114XnAVw]. However, RF is **nonspecific** and can be elevated in:

- Other autoimmune diseases (e.g. Sjögren's, SLE, systemic sclerosis) [^111XWZpr]
- Chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis C, tuberculosis, endocarditis)
- Healthy individuals, especially older adults [^114VZ3uA] or smokers [^113kifac]

Thus, RF positivity alone is **insufficient to diagnose RA** or indicate active disease [^115Umhze].

---

## RF and RA disease activity

RF is associated with more severe disease, joint damage, and extra-articular manifestations [^111XWZpr]; however, it is not a **reliable marker** of current activity [^117KiFDU]. RF levels can remain elevated despite clinical remission or effective therapy [^112kBAjj], and fluctuations **do not consistently reflect activity** or treatment response.

---

## Clinical assessment of RA activity

Active RA is defined by clinical evaluation and validated composite measures, **not by RF alone** [^113WKMss]. Key tools include:

- **DAS28**: Combines tender/swollen joint counts, ESR/CRP, and patient global assessment [^113WKMss].
- **CDAI/SDAI**: Include joint counts, patient and physician global assessments, and CRP (SDAI) [^113WKMss].
- **ACR/EULAR remission criteria**: Stringent definitions for remission and low disease activity [^111u2B9b].

These measures guide treatment decisions and monitoring, whereas RF is primarily a **prognostic marker**.

---

## RF in RA diagnosis and prognosis

RF is part of the 2010 ACR/EULAR **classification criteria**, contributing to the serology domain [^115Umhze]. However, diagnosis **requires integration of RF with clinical findings**, anti-CCP, acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration [^111Gso8L]. RF positivity, especially at high titer, is associated with more severe disease, joint damage, and extra-articular manifestations, yet **does not indicate current activity** [^111XWZpr].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can **confound RF interpretation**:

- **Age**: RF positivity increases with age, reducing specificity.
- **Smoking**: Strongly associated with RF positivity and higher titers [^113kifac].
- **Comorbidities**: Other autoimmune diseases and chronic infections can elevate RF [^111XWZpr].

These factors underscore the need to **interpret RF within the clinical context** [^112vfWzV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that RF **should not be used alone** to assess activity or guide therapy. Instead, management should be guided by **composite measures** (DAS28, CDAI, SDAI) and clinical judgment [^113WKMss] [^114t11qr]. RF is most useful for prognosis and risk stratification, not for monitoring activity [^1171XpmJ].

## Summary of key points

| **Aspect** | **RF positivity** | **Active RA** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Autoantibody against IgG Fc | Clinically active inflammation |
| Specificity | Low (elevated in other conditions) | High (clinical assessment) |
| Prognostic value | High (severe disease, joint damage) | High (current inflammation) |
| Diagnostic value | Moderate (part of criteria) | High (clinical assessment) |
| Monitoring utility | Limited (does not reflect activity) | High (guides therapy) |

---

A high RF test **does not mean active RA**; it is a **prognostic marker** associated with severe disease and does not reflect current activity. Active RA is defined by clinical assessment and composite scores; RF should be interpreted alongside clinical findings, anti-CCP, CRP/ESR, and imaging to guide diagnosis and management [^115Umhze].

### Autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis - rheumatoid factor, anticitrullinated protein antibodies and beyond [^111XWZpr]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid factors (RFs) are a family of autoantibodies that recognize diverse antigenic determinants on the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG). In contrast to most other autoantibodies, the major RF species is the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype, whereas IgG-RF and IgA-RF occur less frequently. Low-titer IgM-RF is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and can be found in several rheumatic and infectious diseases and also in up to 10% of healthy individuals. However, chronic persistence of IgM-RF at elevated titer, as well as the presence of IgG and IgA subtypes, is a characteristic feature of RA. IgM-RF can be detected in 50–60% of RA patients at disease onset, usually co-occurring with anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and related anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (AMPAs). The co-occurrence of IgM-RF and ACPA is a characteristic serological feature of RA that is rarely observed in other rheumatic diseases.

RFs of all subtypes may be present already in the earliest stages of the disease and can precede the onset of RA by several years. Among RF subtypes, IgA-RF shows the highest specificity but is less sensitive than IgM-RF, whereas the diagnostic performance of IgG-RF is inferior to the other isotypes. However, the added diagnostic value of IgA-RF is limited because it occurs almost exclusively together with IgM-RF. Nevertheless, its determination might be helpful, particularly in ACPA-negative patients, because double positivity for IgM- and IgA-RF has a higher specificity than either isotype alone. Importantly, IgA-RF also has some prognostic value because, similar to high-titer IgM-RF, it is associated with certain disease features.

### Anticitrullinated protein antibodies and rheumatoid factor fluctuate in early inflammatory arthritis and do not predict clinical outcomes [^117KiFDU]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

In inflammatory arthritis, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are believed to be associated with more severe clinical outcomes. Our objective was to determine whether ACPA and RF remain stable in early inflammatory arthritis and whether their trajectories over time or baseline levels predicted clinical outcomes.

The study population consisted of patients enrolled in the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort Study with baseline and at least 12-month follow-up values of RF and ACPA. Primary outcomes were Disease Activity Score (DAS) remission and the presence of erosions at 12 and 24 months. Other objectives included swollen joint count, Health Assessment Questionnaire score, and DAS.

At baseline, 225/342 (66%) patients were ACPA-positive, and 334/520 (64%) were RF-positive. At 24 months, 15/181 (8%) ACPA-positive patients became negative, while a larger number of patients changed from ACPA-negative to positive: 13/123 (11%). For RF, fluctuations were more common: 67/240 (28%) reverted from positive to negative, and 21/136 (18%) converted from negative to positive. RF and ACPA fluctuations did not predict disease outcomes. Patients who remained ACPA-positive throughout follow-up were more likely to have erosive disease (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.68, 8.92).

RF and ACPA have the potential to revert and convert during the early course of disease. Fluctuations in RF and ACPA were not associated with clinical outcomes.

### Smoking history and serum cotinine and thiocyanate concentrations as determinants of rheumatoid factor in non-rheumatoid subjects [^113kifac]. Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Smoking is associated with false-positive rheumatoid factor (RF). This study explored the dose-response relationship of this association, using smoking history and serum cotinine and thiocyanate concentrations as measures of tobacco exposure.

A total of 6,947 men and women aged 30 years or over and free of clinical arthritis were included in the Mini-Finland Health Survey carried out between 1978 and 1980. Detailed histories of smoking and RF (sensitized sheep cell agglutination test) were obtained in the basic examination. In 2000, serum cotinine and thiocyanate were determined from serum samples collected at baseline and stored at -20 degrees Celsius. A cut-off point of 100 micrograms per liter was used for serum cotinine, and 10 micromoles per liter for thiocyanate, to indicate active smoking.

There was a close association between smoking and strongly positive RF. After adjustment for age, sex, coffee consumption, and region, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals in brackets) for smokers and those who had quit smoking were 3.94 (2.04–7.61) and 2.71 (1.33–5.53), respectively, compared with those who had never smoked. Among smokers, the intensity, duration, or tertiles of pack-years of smoking were not related to RF. No relationship between serum cotinine or thiocyanate and RF positivity was observed within the subgroups of smokers and those who had quit. Among those who reported that they had never smoked but nevertheless had serum cotinine levels of at least 100 micrograms per liter, the adjusted odds ratio of strongly positive RF was 4.48 (1.48–13.50) compared with those who had never smoked.

### 2019 update of the American College of Rheumatology recommended rheumatoid arthritis disease activity measures [^113WKMss]. Arthritis Care & Research (2019). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to provide updated American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity measurements to facilitate a treat-to-target approach in routine clinical care.
- **Methods**: A working group conducted a systematic literature review from the time of the prior ACR recommendations literature search. Properties of disease activity measures were abstracted, and study quality was assessed using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments 4-point scoring method, allowing for overall level of evidence assessment. Measures that fulfilled a minimum standard were identified, and through a modified Delphi process, preferred measures were selected for regular use in most clinic settings.
- **Results**: The search identified 5,199 articles, of which 110 were included in the review. This search identified 46 RA disease activity measures that contained patient, provider, laboratory, and/or imaging data. Descriptions of the measures, properties, study quality, level of evidence, and feasibility were abstracted and scored. Following a modified Delphi process, 11 measures fulfilled a minimum standard for regular use in most clinic settings, and 5 measures were recommended: the Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints with Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate or C-Reactive Protein Level, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3, and Patient Activity Scale-II.

In conclusion, we have updated prior ACR recommendations for preferred RA disease activity measures.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^111GHr19]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 4 illustrates the risk of rheumatoid arthritis as a function of rheumatoid factor level in 9,712 participants in the Copenhagen City Heart Study, with analysis by length of follow-up (either the full 28 years or the first 10 years) and the number of hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis. All hazard ratios were multivariable adjusted (see text for details).

In an attempt to exclude patients misclassified with rheumatoid arthritis, we also examined patients with at least two hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis at least six weeks apart. This reduced the number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but strengthened the association between elevated rheumatoid factor and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (Figure 4, right-hand panels). These results were also not influenced by the competing risk of death (supplementary Figure 5, right-hand panels). Sensitivity analyses restricted to participants with complete information on covariates at baseline also showed similar results (supplementary Figure 6).
- **Absolute 10 year risk of rheumatoid arthritis**:
	- The highest absolute 10-year risk of rheumatoid arthritis of 32% was observed for 50–69-year-old women who smoked and had rheumatoid factor levels > 100 IU/mL (Figure 5, far right middle panel). This means that one out of three of such women will develop rheumatoid arthritis within 10 years from blood sampling. The lowest absolute 10-year risk of rheumatoid arthritis of 0.1% was observed for men aged ≥ 70 years with rheumatoid factor levels < 25 IU/mL, irrespective of smoking status (Figure 5, bottom panels, far left and inner left).

### Do we need to lower the cut point of the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis [^116Y9EKp]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria to identify more patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among early inflammatory arthritis patients.
- **Methods**: We included early arthritis patients from the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort with at least one joint with clinical synovitis and symptoms for less than one year, with no other explanation for their symptoms. The demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient were recorded at baseline. Patients were classified as case or non-case at the 1-year follow-up by the definition used in the development of the 2010 criteria (MTX initiation). To assess the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria, the sensitivity and specificity at each cut point were determined.
- **Results**: We included 557 patients in our analysis. At the 1-year follow-up, 253 patients (45%) were classified as case (MTX use). In the group of patients who scored 0–5 points (n = 328), 98 patients (30%) were classified as case (MTX use). The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria using the cut point of 6 were 61% and 76%, respectively. With the cut point of 5, the sensitivity would increase to 76% and the specificity would decrease to 68%.
- **Conclusion**: By lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria from 6 to 5 points, we were able to identify 15% more RA patients at the cost of 8% more false-positive patients.

### Incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of acute exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112emJBE]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although RA-ILD was often accompanied by high titers of RF and ACPA, no studies have shown that RF and ACPA are associated with AE-RA-ILD. In patients with RA-ILD treated with tocilizumab, poorly controlled disease activity was associated with AE. However, the results of two studies suggested no significant difference between AE and non-AE groups, either at the onset of AE, at the last follow-up, or in the AE-free period. In a recent study in which patients with RA-ILD were followed annually for three years, no correlation was observed between lung function trajectory and disease activity. Overall, the correlation between disease activity and AE-RA-ILD remains unclear.

Consistent with the result of a multivariate analysis, lower baseline FVC% indicated an increased risk of AE-RA-ILD in our meta-analysis. Lower FVC% was also a risk factor for AE in patients with IPF. Our pooled analysis suggested that DLCO% was not associated with AE-RA-ILD. However, we noticed that both studies included in the analysis suggested that lower DLCO% was a risk factor for AE-RA-ILD and that considerable heterogeneity was observed between the two studies. Lower DLCO% was associated with an increased risk of AE-RA-ILD in a multivariate analysis. Therefore, this result must be viewed with caution. More research on the relationship between lung function tests, especially DLCO%, and AE-RA-ILD is needed. Next, by pooling eight studies, we observed that the UIP pattern on high-resolution computed tomography was not associated with AE-RA-ILD. Heterogeneity was observed across the studies. We noticed that heterogeneity needs further investigation.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective cohort study [^115EXUqQ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Our finding of a particularly high absolute risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis in women with elevated rheumatoid factor who smoked is yet another reason to promote cessation of smoking among such women. In addition, our finding of high risks of developing rheumatoid arthritis based on elevated levels of rheumatoid factor alone suggests the need for early referral to a rheumatologist or early arthritis clinics for examination on the basis of a positive rheumatoid factor test — even in the absence of the typical arthritic joint symptoms — because there is a better response to therapy the earlier it is initiated in rheumatoid arthritis.

The superior specificity of anti-citrullinated protein antibody tests has somewhat diminished interest in rheumatoid factor at the time of diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, but not necessarily when it comes to the prediction of long-term risk. Future work should include a comparison of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody tests for the long-term prediction of the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Also, larger studies might be able to confirm or refute that elevated rheumatoid factor is associated with future risk for other autoimmune rheumatic diseases.

Finally, our absolute risk estimates could be used for designing a randomized controlled trial studying early intervention in high-risk people, by designing the inclusion criteria around patient groups with, for example, a ≥ 20% elevated 10-year absolute risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: Common questions about diagnosis and management [^111Gso8L]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 1% worldwide. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Rheumatoid arthritis should be considered if there is at least one joint with definite swelling that is not better explained by another disease. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, elevated C-reactive protein level, or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis may impact organs other than the joints, including lungs, skin, and eyes. Rapid diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, which is associated with better outcomes. The goal of therapy is to initiate early medical treatment to achieve disease remission or the lowest disease activity possible. Methotrexate is typically the first-line agent for rheumatoid arthritis. Additional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or biologic agents should be added if disease activity persists. Comorbid conditions, including hepatitis B or C or tuberculosis infections, must be considered when choosing medical treatments. Although rheumatoid arthritis is often a chronic disease, some patients can taper and discontinue medications and remain in long-term remission.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long-term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^116yHuz1]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Our study has several strengths. The large study population was homogeneous and representative of the general population. The study population was well-characterized, with a follow-up of more than 28 years, achieving 100% follow-up. With a median age of entry to the study above 50 years, the 28 years of follow-up extended well beyond the age of 70 years, when the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis peaks. Importantly, rheumatoid factor concentrations were measured up to 28 years after blood sampling and were not reported to participants or their doctors. As a result, these measurements did not influence the ascertainment of rheumatoid arthritis during follow-up. In essence, we studied the natural progression from an elevated rheumatoid factor to a clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential limitations include selection bias. However, since we enrolled a sample randomly selected from the general population without regard to disease status, selection bias is unlikely to account for our findings. Another potential limitation is the validity of the diagnostic information. Nevertheless, most rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses in the Danish registries were confirmed, and random misclassification would tend to bias the results towards the null hypothesis. This cannot explain the present results, as illustrated by our sensitivity analysis. Additionally, because rheumatoid factor is part of the classification of rheumatoid arthritis, individuals with lifelong elevated rheumatoid factor may have a heightened probability of being diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

### Very recent onset rheumatoid arthritis: Clinical and serological patient characteristics associated with radiographic progression over the first years of disease [^113rMUXd]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Despite early recognition and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment, a sizable proportion of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients show radiological progression. This study was performed to determine the frequency of erosive arthritis and the pace of radiological progression in an inception cohort of patients with very early RA (≤ 3 months after onset of symptoms).
- **Methods**: In order to determine possible prognostic factors for development of erosive disease, we linked the clinical features of these patients to radiological progression in a regression model. About 55 patients with RA and follow-up of at least 3 years were analyzed. All had complete series of clinical, serological, and radiographic assessments. Radiographs were scored according to the Larsen method.
- **Results**: Erosive disease developed in 63.6% of the patients over 3 years, with the majority (74.3%) appearing already in the first year and 97.2% by the end of the second year. Among all variables available, rheumatoid factor (RF) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) first presentation were the most predictive for both development of erosions and the degree of radiological progression. None of the clinical variables at onset was useful to discriminate between erosive and non-erosive patients. In the final regression model, however, cumulative clinical activity substantially contributed to explaining radiological progression.
- **Conclusion**: Despite early treatment, substantial damage occurred in some patients and was associated with the presence of strong 'constitutive' predi.

### What is rheumatoid factor? From screening to personalized management [^117M8NC4]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Association between the pathology of RA and high RF levels: Many attempts have been made to stratify patients according to their pathological conditions. To understand the pathology and evaluate the validity of molecular targets, we collected peripheral lymphocytes from patients with RA, stained their lymphocytes with approximately 50 types of antibodies, and analyzed the immunophenotypes using multicolour flow cytometry. Although hierarchical cluster analysis of the immunophenotypes enabled the classification of patients with RA into several clusters, significant results useful for the differential use of molecular-targeted drugs have not been obtained. Other institutions are investigating the cellular and molecular pathways in the synovium of patients with RA by performing ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy. Based on these investigations, patients with low or absent synovial B cell molecular signatures were found to be less responsive to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab than to the anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antibody tocilizumab. In real-world clinical settings, it is challenging to perform a biopsy on every patient, and further research is needed to develop simpler methods for patient classification.

### Rheumatoid factor as a potentiator of anti-citrullinated protein antibody-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis [^112BLNiA]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). High credibility.

The co-occurrence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well described. However, the mechanisms underlying the potential interaction between these two distinct autoantibodies have not been well defined. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiologic and molecular interaction of ACPAs and RF and its association with both disease activity and measures of RA-associated inflammation.

In a cohort of 1,488 US veterans with RA, measures of disease activity and serum levels of cytokines and multiplex ACPAs were compared between the following groups of patients: double-negative (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP]- / RF-), anti-CCP+ / RF-, anti-CCP- / RF+, or double-positive (anti-CCP+ / RF+). Additional studies were performed using an in vitro immune complex (IC) stimulation assay in which macrophages were incubated with ACPA ICs in the presence or absence of monoclonal IgM-RF, and tumor necrosis factor α production measured as a readout of macrophage activation.

Compared with the double-negative subgroup (as well as each single-positive subgroup), the double-positive subgroup exhibited higher disease activity as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines (all P < 0.001). In vitro stimulation of macrophages by ACPA ICs increased cytokine production, and the addition of monoclonal IgM-RF significantly increased macrophage tumor necrosis factor α production (P = 0.003 versus ACPA ICs alone).

The combined presence of ACPAs and IgM-RF appears to potentiate inflammation in RA, contributing to increased disease activity and cytokine production.

### Imaging tests as predictors of progression to rheumatoid arthritis in clinically suspect arthralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112VjMA2]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Different progression rates to inflammatory arthritis (IA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be explained by differences in antibody status, subclinical synovitis on imaging, or swollen joints at baseline, as well as differing inclusion criteria used. Studies that include participants with more signs, symptoms, or antibodies, indicating a later phase of the preclinical risk spectrum, have higher progression rates. Spectrum bias may have varying effects on sensitivity and specificity.

- **Prevention of bias**: Steps to prevent this type of bias include the recruitment of individuals that represent the population in which the test will typically be used, in line with STARD guidelines and PRISMA for diagnostic test accuracy, taking into consideration different preclinical phases of RA. A recent systematic review in participants with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) reported high sensitivities and low specificities for imaging tests in the prediction of RA. Participants with UA are further along the disease spectrum, which may explain the difference in results observed.
- **Recent trials**: Of interest, recent placebo-controlled trials in participants with arthralgia and subclinical inflammation, as detected by MRI or US, have shown a beneficial effect of DMARDs in pre-RA. The TREAT EARLIER trial compared 1-year methotrexate to placebo in participants with arthralgia and MRI subclinical inflammation, of which a third were ACPA/RF positive. Similar rates of progression to IA were seen in both groups at 2 years. While methotrexate did not prevent IA progression, a milder form and sustained improvement in MRI subclinical inflammation was observed in the methotrexate group. The ARIAA trial compared aba…

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^1114KFnN]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease affecting 0.5–2% of the population. Although modern treatments for rheumatoid arthritis can induce remission in many patients, diagnosis in the early stages of the disease is important for preventing irreversible damage to the synovial lining and cartilage of diseased joints and for preventing progression into later disease stages. At present, there is no good clinical indicator available for the long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis.

Rheumatoid factor is an autoantibody targeting the Fc region of IgG antibodies. Testing for rheumatoid factor is the most widely used blood test in the classification of rheumatoid arthritis. In the classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, "definite rheumatoid arthritis" is based on the confirmed presence of synovitis in at least one joint, absence of an alternate diagnosis better explaining the synovitis, and achievement of a total score of ≥ 6 (of a possible 10) on a scoring system. The score is derived from four criteria:

- **Number and site of affected joints**: Range 0–5.
- **Serological abnormality**: Elevated levels of rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody; range 0–3.
- **Elevated acute phase response**: Range 0–1.
- **Symptom duration**: < 6 vs. ≥ 6 weeks; range 0–1.

It is often stated that levels of rheumatoid factor increase with age, but convincing data for this statement is difficult to find. About 80% of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis will eventually be seropositive for rheumatoid factor, while only 40% are positive at clinical onset.

### Prognostic factors in rheumatoid arthritis in the era of biologic agents [^111YJrKY]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has changed dramatically in recent years, largely because of the unrivaled efficacy of biologic agents in ameliorating clinical disease activity and in preventing joint damage. However, the use of biologic agents is associated with medical risks and socioeconomic costs. Guidance is, therefore, needed to identify those patients who might benefit most from this intensive treatment approach — and to identify those individuals who can be spared the potential adverse effects of such treatment without risking disease progression.

As reviewed here, a variety of serological, clinical, immunological, radiological, and genetic markers have been proposed to predict clinical outcomes in RA. These markers can all be determined without difficulty; however, with the notable exception of the genetic markers and erosions, these parameters are for the most part indicative of inflammatory disease activity and, therefore, subject to variation. As tight control of disease activity dissociates the prognostic markers from the clinical course, these predictive parameters should be assessed at baseline for every patient and used to guide individualized treatment strategies.

### Anti-type II collagen antibodies, anti-CCP, IgA RF and IgM RF are associated with joint damage, assessed eight years after onset of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) [^1168X5RG]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous condition with the time of onset before the age of 16. The diversity in clinical manifestations differs from that in adult arthritis, but some findings point to similarities among children and adults. Reliable biomarkers for predicting outcomes and the choice of treatment in JIA are scarce.

JIA is currently described by the International League of Associations for Rheumatism (ILAR) classification system as a disease comprising seven categories based on clinical characteristics, heredity, and laboratory results. While IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) is a determinant of the polyarticular categories, the occurrence of IgA RF and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), for which the most common clinical test is anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), are not included in the ILAR classification.

In population-based studies on JIA, IgM RF has an occurrence rate of 2–3% and defines a subset of JIA resembling that of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a polyarticular disease, a higher age at onset, and a higher risk of joint damage. IgA RF has been studied far less but is also discussed as a risk factor for joint space narrowing or joint erosions.

In RA, anti-CCP can be detected several years before disease onset, has high disease specificity, and is now included in the 2010 classification criteria for RA. The prognostic role of anti-CCP in JIA resembles that of IgM RF. Anti-CCP has a low prevalence (2–15%) and is present in particular in the RF-positive, polyarticular JIA category. The majority of JIA study cohorts indicate that anti-CCP presence aligns with more severe disease manifestations, underlining its importance in potential early diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^113HKLEp]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 12.1 SE software. All tests were two-sided. We used log transformation of rheumatoid factor levels to calculate geometric means for each age group. Plasma levels of rheumatoid factor were illustrated using box plots with 1%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 99% on the log scale.

Receiver operator characteristics curves of plasma levels of rheumatoid factor at baseline and all future events of rheumatoid arthritis were used to determine an optimal threshold concentration of rheumatoid factor of 25 IU/mL — that is, the level above and below which individuals are best separated into those with and without future rheumatoid arthritis (see supplementary fig 1 in online data supplement). From this threshold, we chose categories of rheumatoid factor of 100 IU/mL — cut-off values were doublings starting from 25 IU/mL. For trend tests across these categories, we used the logarithm of individuals' rheumatoid factor values on a continuous scale.

### Predictive value of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide in patients with very early inflammatory arthritis [^115GdSP4]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the prognostic value of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF), both independently and in combination, in patients with very early synovitis.
- **Methods**: A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with established inflammatory and noninflammatory diseases to validate the assay in our unit and confirm previously reported sensitivities and specificities of anti-CCP antibodies. Subsequently, patients with synovitis of 3 months' duration were followed for 72 weeks to evaluate the ability of anti-CCP antibodies and RF to predict the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and persistent inflammatory arthritis.
- **Results**: One hundred twenty-four patients participated in the initial cross-sectional study. Anti-CCP antibodies and RF were detected by ELISA in only 4% of patients with non-RA inflammatory disease and in none of the patients with noninflammatory disease. Ninety-six patients with very early synovitis were assessed longitudinally. In these patients, the combination of anti-CCP antibodies and RF demonstrated a specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and negative predictive value (NPV) for a diagnosis of RA of 100%, 100%, 58%, and 88%, respectively. The specificity, PPV, sensitivity, and NPV of this antibody combination for developing persistent disease meeting classification criteria for RA were 97%, 86%, 63%, and 91%, respectively.

In conclusion, the study found that in patients with synovitis of 3 months' duration, the combination of anti-CCP antibodies and RF has a high specificity and PPV for the development of rheumatoid arthritis.

### Comparative study of different enzyme immunoassays for measurement of IgM and IgA rheumatoid factors [^115sXHV1]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the value of various IgM and IgA rheumatoid factor (RF) tests for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Firstly, the latex test, one global assay (for IgM, IgA, and IgG RF), six IgM, and four IgA RF assays were compared in a particularly challenging situation with 67 patients who had RA — many of whom were latex negative — and 91 non-RA controls, many of whom were latex positive. A more detailed evaluation followed with three IgM RF tests (two commercially available kits and one assay developed in our laboratory) and two IgA RF tests (one commercially available and one from our laboratory) in two more representative samples of rheumatological patients, comprising 146 RA and 75 non-RA controls.

Diagnostic performance differed considerably between the assays. For IgM RF detection, the highest sensitivity (88%) was obtained with the Diamedix kit (specificity 67%), and for IgA RF with the Inova kit (sensitivity 65%, specificity 88%). Combining one IgM and one IgA RF test improved diagnostic performance when both tests were in agreement. However, this combination yielded 15–27% of discrepant results, which did not facilitate ruling RA in or out. Meanwhile, mean concentration values differed significantly among IgM RF tests, and concentrations were not correlated in most cases.

The study concluded that available tests for the IgM RF isotype vary in accuracy, and none is uniformly better than all the others. For the IgA RF isotype, the Inova kit appears to be superior. However, quantitative results cannot be compared across tests. Combining an IgM and an IgA RF test may improve diagnosis, though the benefit is limited by the presence of discrepant results.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis [^116Q3BA4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation and joint damage with a heterogeneous course and different pathogenic mechanisms leading to common signs and symptoms. In routine clinical practices, early diagnosis and recognition of inflammatory arthritis of short duration that develops into established RA in the future is sometimes difficult. In contrast to a few patients with inflammatory arthritis who may undergo spontaneous remission and some who may have a mild disease course with slow progression, more patients have moderate to high disease activity and some develop aggressive joint damage and systemic complications. Therefore, laboratory biomarkers and/or imaging assessments that would be more effective in the diagnosis of early disease are needed.

Although RA is a clinical diagnosis and has no specific pathognomonic test defined so far, serological tests represent the most important parameters for diagnosis and for the identification of at-risk patients. Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (ACPAs), especially in high levels, are associated with aggressive disease and, together with acute phase reactants, were implemented in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA. Fulfillment of these criteria thus persuades clinicians to initiate appropriate therapy early to avoid irreversible damage. Despite the high diagnostic value of ACPAs and rheumatoid factors (RFs), there is still a need for novel biomarkers to further improve the diagnosis.

### Relative clinical influence of clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations in early arthritis on the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Data from the French Early Arthritis Cohort ESPOIR [^115MpDb8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

To evaluate the relative level of influence of usual investigations in early arthritis on the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patients included in the ESPOIR early arthritis cohort were studied. This cohort consists of individuals with grade ≥ 2 synovitis for more than 6 weeks but less than 6 months. The diagnostic properties of variables assessed at baseline were measured against the diagnosis of RA defined by American College of Rheumatology criteria at any time point between inclusion and 12-month follow-up, as well as expert opinion. Various models were examined:

1.

- **Clinical data**: included clinical assessments only.
2.

- **Clinical + radiographic data**: combined clinical assessments with plain radiographs.
3.

- **Addition of RF and/or anti-CCP**: further included rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP).
4.

- **Addition of HLA-DR typing**: incorporated HLA-DR typing into the model.

These models were assessed by comparing areas under the curves for ROC curves.

Of 731 patients studied, 372 (50.9%) satisfied criteria for RA at 1 year. In univariate analysis, sensitivity was highest for distal articular presentation (94.6%), presence of IgM RF (69.4%), pain on metatarso-phalangeal squeeze test (66.1%), and presence of anti-CCP (65.6%); whereas specificity was highest for nodules (100%), HLA typing: shared-epitope double dose (95.9%), radiographic erosions (86.5%), and anti-CCP antibodies (86.4%). The most efficient model included swollen joint count, morning stiffness, erosions, RF, and anti-CCP. Adding rheumatoid nodules, C-reactive protein, or HLA-DR information was not contributive.

In conclusion, in addition to clinical variables and radiographs, RF and anti-CCP are the single variables of interest that are co-dominant in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.

### Multifaceted immune dysregulation characterizes individuals at-risk for rheumatoid arthritis [^117UcWHN]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Studies of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) show that markers of autoimmunity, including antibodies to citrullinated protein/peptide antigens (ACPA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and others, can be present in blood many years prior to the clinically apparent onset of inflammatory arthritis (IA) and classified RA. The period of autoantibody elevations before the onset of IA has been called 'pre-RA' and is reasonably viewed as a distinct stage toward the development of clinically apparent IA and classifiable RA. Notably, ACPA(+) individuals, especially those with higher titers of the common clinically used ACPA assay 'anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP)', have a significantly elevated risk of developing future classified RA, and thus these individuals can be designated to be in an "At-Risk" state, and defined as such for studies.

Importantly, the identification of a pre-RA period has underpinned the development and execution of several prevention trials in RA, testing the ability of a variety of agents to prevent or delay the progression to IA and classified RA. However, despite the increasing interest in disease prevention, major knowledge gaps exist regarding the causal pathways and pathogenic processes that promote the initial break in tolerance to citrullinated self-antigens in At-Risk populations. Some data suggest that epigenetic changes are present in such individuals, but it is not known whether unique peripheral blood cell sub-populations exhibit distinct epigenetic changes in disease-related pathways.

### What is rheumatoid factor? From screening to personalized management [^115wc3hy]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

RA, which is defined as a prolonged destructive arthritis, is an autoimmune disease with multiorgan involvement that manifests with polyarthritis as its primary pathology. Based on the elucidation of the pathological mechanisms of RA, immunosuppressive agents are used to adjust immune abnormalities and control the disease. The immunosuppressive agents used for RA treatment are called DMARD. These drugs can be further classified into conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD), such as MTX, targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD), such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and biological DMARD (bDMARD) derived from biological agents.

MTX is the initial standard of care for patients diagnosed with RA without contraindications. When the use of MTX fails to achieve improvement within 3 months or remission within 6 months, the use of a bDMARD is recommended. If the goal is still not achieved, other appropriate bDMARDs or JAK inhibitors are administered for approximately 3–6 months until remission is induced. Such treatment strategies have enabled physicians to induce remission and prevent progression of structural damage and dysfunction of joints in most patients with RA.

### Rheumatoid arthritis [^113YGn6o]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2018). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints and is associated with autoantibodies targeting various molecules, including modified self-epitopes. The identification of novel autoantibodies has improved diagnostic accuracy, and newly developed classification criteria facilitate the early recognition and study of the disease. New clinical assessment tools better characterize disease activity states, which correlate with the progression of damage and disability and permit improved follow-up. Additionally, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of RA through recognizing key cells and cytokines has led to developing targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

Altogether, the improved understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved and rational use of established and new drugs with reliable assessment tools have drastically altered the lives of individuals with RA over the past two decades. Strategies focus on early referral, early diagnosis, and the early start of effective therapy aimed at remission or, at the least, low disease activity, with rapid adaptation of treatment if this target is not achieved. This treat-to-target approach prevents the progression of joint damage and optimizes physical functioning, work, and social participation. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of RA.

### American College of Rheumatology/EULAR remission criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: 2022 revision [^111u2B9b]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Since their publication, arguments have been made claiming that remission definitions may, on the one hand, be too stringent, with the risk of overtreatment if used as treatment targets, or, on the other hand, too lenient, proposing the addition of imaging confirmation of remission. A particular matter of debate was the requirement of achieving a PtGA score of ≤ 1; the stringent threshold for the PtGA has been criticized because some patients do not achieve it, despite the absence of tender and swollen joints and an elevated CRP level. Moreover, the agreement between the Boolean and index definitions was only moderate, primarily due to the PtGA threshold. However, the PtGA is the core set measure most sensitive to change in RA trials, best differentiating between patients receiving active treatment and those receiving placebo; thus, PtGA is an important measure of disease activity. Consequently, the PtGA was included in the ACR core set, composite activity scores, and remission definitions. However, PtGA may also be influenced by other factors related to RA. For example, patients with pain from irreversible joint damage may have elevations in PtGA even if their RA is in clinical remission.

To circumvent the strictness of the 1.0 rule for PtGA and to increase agreement with SDAI-defined remission, a higher PtGA threshold has been proposed. Furthermore, since the index-based criteria can be used instead of Boolean criteria, both criteria should identify the same patients as having disease in remission. However, remission rates based on SDAI are higher than those using the Boolean criteria.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective cohort study [^113SdbHQ]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The study aims to determine whether an elevated concentration of rheumatoid factor is associated with the long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis. This prospective cohort study, known as the Copenhagen City Heart Study, involved drawing blood from participants between 1981 and 1983, with follow-up extending until August 10, 2010. The setting for this research was the Copenhagen general population.

The study included 9,712 white Danish individuals, aged 20 to 100 years, without rheumatoid arthritis at the onset of the study. The main outcome measures centered on rheumatoid arthritis development according to baseline plasma IgM rheumatoid factor levels categorized into 25–50, 50.1–100, and greater than 100 IU/mL, compared with 100 IU/mL.

### The immunopathogenesis of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis: from triggering to targeting [^117DTkz4]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into two major subsets characterized by the presence versus absence of antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF). The antibody-positive subset of the disease, also known as seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, constitutes approximately two-thirds of all cases of rheumatoid arthritis and generally has a more severe disease course. ACPAs and RF are often present in the blood long before any signs of joint inflammation, which suggests that the triggering of autoimmunity may occur at sites other than the joints (for example, in the lung).

This review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of this gradual disease development in seropositive patients. We also emphasize the implications of this new understanding for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. Similar temporal and spatial separation of immune triggering and clinical manifestations, with novel opportunities for early intervention, may also occur in other immune-mediated diseases.

**Rheumatology key messages**: High-titer RF impacts Fc-containing TNFi biokinetics, highlighting its role beyond diagnosis and prognosis. As an Fc-free TNFi, certolizumab is unaffected by RF binding and has low ADAb formation. Non-TNFi biologics with Fc fragments are less impacted, likely due to B-cell modulation.

### Second generation automated anti-CCP test better predicts the clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis [^1149aB72]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common systemic autoimmune diseases. The presence of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) is better at discriminating RA patients and is also associated with significantly more disease activity compared to serum rheumatoid factor. In this study, we assessed two new automated second-generation tests to detect the presence of anti-CCP antibodies in 226 serum samples submitted to the Clinical Immunology Laboratory for anti-CCP antibody testing.

We compared CCP antibody results on these samples obtained using the ImmunoCAP 250 (Phadia) and the Architect i2000SR (Abbott Laboratories) instruments to our currently used CCP IgG third generation manual ELISA (Inova Diagnostics). One hundred and fifty-four samples were negative while 52 were positive by all three tests. Eighteen samples were negative by the automated tests but weakly/moderately positive by manual ELISA, yielding an overall concordance of 79%.

When we compared the discordant test results to patient diagnosis, we observed a better correlation with clinical RA diagnosis for the new automated tests compared to the manual ELISA. These two new anti-CCP antibody tests have the benefit of automation and may have better positive predictive value for the diagnosis of RA than our manual ELISA.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically in the management of difficult-to-treat disease, EULAR 2022 guidelines recommend interpreting composite indices and clinical evaluation with caution in the presence of comorbidities, particularly obesity and fibromyalgia. These conditions may directly heighten inflammatory activity and/or overestimate disease activity.

### Commentary - ordering lab tests for suspected rheumatic disease [^116ETEKs]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2008). Low credibility.

This short report summarizes the evidence base supporting a more limited use of ANA and rheumatoid factor tests by primary care physicians evaluating children for musculoskeletal complaints and/or suspected rheumatic disease. It acts as a review for primary care physicians who wish to better understand how to use and interpret these commonly ordered tests.

Rheumatoid factor (RF) tests remain a standard assay for screening adult patients with musculoskeletal complaints and, depending on the studied population, may be positive in as many as 85% of adults with rheumatoid arthritis and fewer than 10% of healthy adult individuals. This test, performed using several methods, detects IgM antibodies directed against the Fc portion of IgG molecules. However, in 1986, Eichenfield and colleagues demonstrated that: [1] most children with positive RF tests do not have JRA/JIA; [2] most children with JRA/JIA do not have positive RF tests; [3] children with JRA/JIA who did have positive RF tests could be easily identified based on history and physical examination. The test did not contribute to establishing the diagnosis. McGhee and colleagues corroborated this finding. In their study, 16 children were referred for evaluation of positive rheumatoid factor tests, of whom three (19%) had JRA/JIA. As reported in the Eichenfield paper, the test added nothing to the history and physical examination, which would have established the diagnosis even if the RF test had been negative.

### Meta-analysis: Diagnostic accuracy of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor for rheumatoid arthritis [^114XnAVw]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid factor (RF) and autoantibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) are markers that might help physicians diagnose rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Purpose**: To determine whether anti-CCP antibody more accurately identifies patients with rheumatoid arthritis and better predicts radiographic progression than does RF.
- **Data sources**: MEDLINE through September 2006 and reference lists of retrieved studies and review articles.
- **Study selection**: Studies in any language that enrolled at least 10 participants and examined the role of anti-CCP antibody and RF in the diagnosis or prognosis of known or suspected rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently evaluated studies for inclusion, rated methodological quality, and abstracted relevant data.
- **Data synthesis**: The DerSimonian-Laird random-effects method was used to summarize sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios from 37 studies of anti-CCP antibody and 50 studies of RF. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for anti-CCP antibody were 67% (95% CI, 62% to 72%), 95% (CI, 94% to 97%), 12.46 (CI, 9.72 to 15.98), and 0.36 (CI, 0.31 to 0.42), respectively. For IgM RF, the values were 69% (CI, 65% to 73%), 85% (CI, 82% to 88%), 4.86 (CI, 3.95 to 5.97), and 0.38 (CI, 0.33 to 0.44). Likelihood ratios among IgM RF, IgG RF, and IgA RF seemed to be similar. Results from studies of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis were similar to those from all studies. Three out of four studies found that the risk for radiographic progression was significant.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: a prospective cohort study [^111X9Zc7]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

The principal findings in this study of 9,712 individuals without rheumatoid arthritis recruited from the general population of Copenhagen are noteworthy. Those with elevated levels of rheumatoid factor had up to a 26-fold higher long-term risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and up to a 32% ten-year absolute risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. These findings are novel; importantly, these data do not serve as evidence that rheumatoid factor plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.

### The new European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how are they performing [^113PGXe6]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

This era of early aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) calls for criteria that allow timely classification of patients at risk of persistent erosive disease. We review how the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria meet up to this challenge.

Recent findings indicate that the new 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed using initiation of methotrexate as an anchor in a population with undifferentiated arthritis. Many studies from different countries have now been published that have addressed the performances of these new criteria.

The goal of earlier classification of RA seems to be met with the new criteria, but exclusion of other diagnoses is essential. Increased sensitivity comes at the price of loss of specificity, and indiscriminate use of these classification criteria as a diagnostic tool carries the risk of overtreatment.

### Rheumatoid factors revisited in the age of biologic therapy [^115gvfwk]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid factors (RF) bind to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of immunoglobulin and, thus, could potentially bind to the Fc portion of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), attenuating their clinical efficacy. These potential interactions should be of no relevance for TNFi without an Fc part. Data from the multicentre ANSWER cohort in Japan demonstrated that in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with RF values over 166 IU/ml, those treated with TNFi without Fc had a significantly lower Disease Activity Score 28 - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) after 12 months compared with those treated with TNFi with Fc, showing a score of 3.2 (2.3–4.2) vs. 2.7 (2.0–3.0), which still remained significant in multivariate analysis. This suggests that TNFi without Fc may be more efficacious than TNFi with Fc in RA patients with high RF titres.

Additionally, another study showed that drug levels of infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL) were significantly lower in patients with higher baseline RF titres compared with seronegative patients after six months, while certolizumab pegol (CZP) levels remained stable irrespective of baseline RF titres, showing no significant differences among quartiles. In another analysis conducted in the same cohort, patients were stratified based on RF levels as ≤ 203 or > 203 IU/ml. At six months, CZP serum levels remained unaffected in patients with RF > 203 IU/ml, whereas IFX and ADL serum levels were significantly lower. Secondary non-response was 3.6 times higher in patients with RF > 203 IU/ml treated with IFX and ADL. In contrast, treatment discontinuation with CZP was independent of RF levels.

Moreover, in a longitudinal, retrospective, and multicentre study including RA patients treated with any TNFi, CZP showed a longer retention rate than monoclonal antibodies.

### In the era of nephelometry, latex agglutination is still good enough to detect rheumatoid factor [^115YYJGo]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

To compare quantitative nephelometry to the traditional semiquantitative latex agglutination (LAT) test for rheumatoid factor (RF), we evaluated 564 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 155 controls using both techniques. A cutoff value of 40 IU/ml was established for a positive RF result.
- **Results**: Sensitivity of LAT and nephelometry was 85.5% and 88.3%, respectively. Both techniques had similar specificity and a positive predictive value exceeding 95%. Agreement (kappa = 0.86) and correlation (0.87) between the two methods were significant.

In conclusion, in routine practice, particularly in developing countries such as India, LAT can still be the preferred method for RF determination.

### Laboratory biomarkers or imaging in the diagnostics of rheumatoid arthritis [^112eFAEj]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Despite many unanswered questions about the mechanisms driving the immunological changes during the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there is evidence that systemic abnormalities, defined as the presence of RA-related autoantibodies, can occur several years before clinical symptoms appear. Serological biomarkers can be investigated as predictive factors in subjects who are likely to be at higher risk of developing RA, such as first-degree relatives of RA patients. Simultaneous assessment of rheumatoid factors (RFs) along with various anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) tests, and presumably with novel serological biomarkers, may be used in screening at the primary care level. This may help identify patients with early disease among subjects showing symptoms without clinical arthritis, and in those with undifferentiated arthritis or where clinical judgment is uncertain.

In addition, combining a positive ultrasound (US) Doppler signal with clinical joint assessment can significantly improve diagnostic certainty of RA in seronegative patients. By revealing subclinical synovitis and radiographically undetected bone erosions, RA can be carefully explored with US, especially in patients with early undifferentiated arthritis. The American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 RA classification criteria indicated that US may be used for confirmation of clinical findings regarding joint involvement.

In conclusion, novel serological biomarkers along with joint ultrasound may provide additional benefit in the diagnosis of RA, particularly in those with early and ACPA-negative disease.

### Imaging in rheumatology: Reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^115GbdTR]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Disease activity and response to treatment are usually assessed by clinical criteria and blood tests. For straightforward cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatologist might not need much or any imaging input. Imaging, however, is required for all cases that are not straightforward. Patients presenting with fairly non-specific aches, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory diseases, might be early presentations of these disorders, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disorders. As early diagnosis results in far better long-term outcomes, a wait-and-see approach is no longer acceptable.

The questions asked of the radiologist in these cases are typically some or all of these: Is there inflammation? Which joint or organ is affected? What is the anatomical pattern of involvement?

### Rheumatoid factors revisited in the age of biologic therapy [^112kBAjj]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Anti-TNF agents and RF data have emerged indicating that treatments with IFX, ETN, and ADL are associated with reductions in autoantibody and RF levels, which correlate with treatment response. In a study involving patients on IFX, ETN, and ADL, anti-TNF alpha drugs were shown to decrease IgM, IgG, and IgA-RF titers in association with clinical response. Interestingly, higher pre-treatment IgA-RF levels were linked to poorer clinical response to TNF alpha inhibitors in that study. However, there are also conflicting results in the literature regarding the association of pre-treatment and post-treatment RF levels with clinical response. A study involving patients on the same drugs found that the presence of IgM-RF antibodies did not affect the response to TNF alpha inhibitors.

Another cohort study with long-standing RA patients treated with IFX showed greater reductions in IgM-RF titers compared with ACPA titers, though changes in neither IgM-RF nor ACPA titers correlated with a 48-week treatment response. While reductions in both ACPA and IgM-RF were linked to clinical response, IgM-RF reduction was also associated with decreases in acute-phase reactants. In a large cohort treated with ADL, IgM-RF levels decreased more significantly (31%) compared with ACPA levels (8%), with 17% of IgM-RF-positive patients seroconverting to negative, whereas ACPA-positive patients rarely seroconverted.

### Validation of a novel multibiomarker test to assess rheumatoid arthritis disease activity [^112Uay71]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests represent one approach to providing additional information, incorporating markers such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level into disease activity assessment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, both the ESR and CRP are nonspecific markers of inflammation and can also be increased by factors such as aging, anemia, and the presence of immunoglobulins, including rheumatoid factor (RF). Furthermore, some RA patients with active disease may present normal levels of these markers, possibly due to genetic influences. Consequently, these markers may not be beneficial for all RA patients.

We hypothesized that a multibiomarker test measuring diverse biologic pathways involved in RA could offer clinicians a robust and objective measure of RA disease activity. Such a test could be utilized alongside clinical examination and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in routine clinical practice, proving particularly useful in situations where clinical assessment is challenging or confounded, such as for patients with comorbidities. In previous work, we developed an algorithm that integrates the levels of 12 serum biomarkers: interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor receptor type I (TNFRI), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), YKL-40, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA), leptin, and resistin. This algorithm generates a multibiomarker disease activity (MBDA) score between 1 and 100 (Vectra DA, Crescendo Bioscience).

### Autoantibody profiling as early diagnostic and prognostic tool for rheumatoid arthritis [^1163tkxi]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Early treatment prevents progression of joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but diagnosis in early disease is impeded by lack of appropriate diagnostic criteria.
- **Objective**: To study the value of rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (anti-CCP), and anti-RA33 autoantibodies for diagnosis of RA and prediction of outcome in patients with very early arthritis.
- **Methods**: The prospective follow-up inception cohort included 200 patients with very early arthritis. RF ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP showed similar sensitivity and high specificity for RA, but overlapped considerably. Anti-RA33 was less specific and did not correlate with RF or anti-CCP. Among patients with RA, 72% showed at least one of these three autoantibodies, compared with 15% of non-RA patients. RF ≥ 50 U/ml and anti-CCP were predictors of erosive disease, whereas anti-RA33 was associated with mild disease.
- **Conclusions**: Stepwise autoantibody testing in early inflammatory joint disease, starting with RF, followed by anti-CCP (in patients with RF < 50 U/ml), and finally anti-RA33, should be considered for early diagnosis and prognosis of RA.

### The need to better classify and diagnose early and very early rheumatoid arthritis [^117CZXD8]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and very early RA are major targets of research and clinical practice. Remission has become a realistic goal in the management of RA, particularly in early disease. The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) RA classification criteria, the EULAR treatment recommendations for RA, and the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis focus on early disease and translate the knowledge related to early RA into classification and management. Nevertheless, there is a need for further improvement and progress.

Results from six recent studies are summarized, evaluating the performance of the 2010 ACR/EULAR RA classification criteria. The data show a significant risk of misclassification and highlight that overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis may become important issues if the criteria recommend synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Therefore, some considerations are presented on how the problems and limitations could be overcome in clinical practice and future research. A consensus is needed to better define the early phase of RA and differentiate it from other early arthritis. The possible effect of misclassification on spontaneous and drug-induced remission of early and very early RA awaits further elucidation. Such research will eventually lead to more reliable diagnostic and classification criteria for new-onset RA.

### Regional differences in Finland in the prevalence of rheumatoid factor in the presence and absence of arthritis [^114VZ3uA]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To investigate potential regional differences in the prevalence of rheumatoid factor (RF) with and without arthritis, a study was conducted involving a representative sample of the Finnish population aged 30 years and over. This sample primarily consisted of 8000 individuals, out of which 7217 participated in the field survey carried out from 1978 to 1980. RF was determined from serum samples collected from 7116 participants using the Waaler-Rose test, a sensitized sheep cell agglutination method. Titers of 32 or greater were deemed positive, while titers of 128 or greater were considered strongly positive. Arthritis was diagnosed through thorough clinical examination.

In the absence of arthritis, the prevalence of positive and strongly positive RF reactions was found to be 2.1% and 1.0%, respectively. The lowest prevalence of strongly "false positive" RF was observed in southwestern Finland. After adjusting for factors such as age, sex, smoking, and coffee consumption, the odds ratio of having a strongly "false positive" RF reaction in eastern Finland was 3.16 (95% confidence interval: 1.29 to 7.72) and in northern Finland it was 2.94 (1.13 to 7.64), in comparison to southwestern Finland. Additionally, the corresponding odds ratio of strongly RF positive arthritis in eastern Finland was 5.08 (1.41 to 18.27).

The study concludes that there are regional differences in the prevalence of a strongly positive RF reaction within the Finnish population. These findings align with recent studies highlighting regional variations in the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis in Finland.

### Imaging tests as predictors of progression to rheumatoid arthritis in clinically suspect arthralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112z3ZHz]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: This is the largest systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests in people with inflammatory joint pain or clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA) for predicting rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Imaging tests can identify subclinical inflammation in people with CSA. The presence of MRI or ultrasound imaging characteristics may help identify people at risk of progression to inflammatory arthritis.

### What are the dominant cytokines in early rheumatoid arthritis [^115MyVfi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The preponderance of ACPA and/or rheumatoid factor seropositive patients with rheumatoid arthritis amongst populations studied in most of the clinical trials alluded to here is notable. Where available, accumulating data identifies seronegative rheumatoid arthritis as subject to relatively unfavorable treatment responses, irrespective of the targeted cytokine. Perhaps this is unsurprising given the etiological distinction of this subgroup, but it highlights persistent unmet needs: not only in pathophysiological understanding, but also in our ability to map therapeutic response to measurable markers of the heterogeneous disease process at an individual patient level. Pretreatment levels of circulating cytokines themselves have so far proved to be of little value for this purpose, and the ability to measure their effects at a cellular level and/or within synovial tissue holds promise for stratified treatment approaches.

### What is rheumatoid factor? From screening to personalized management [^114kwfkQ]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

High serum rheumatoid factor (RF) levels are associated with decreased treatment responsiveness to TNF inhibitors and other drugs, decreased treatment retention rate, high disease activity, and progression of joint destruction. By administering a combination of methotrexate (MTX) and infliximab (IFX) to treat refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA), De Rycke et al. found a significant reduction in serum IgM-RF levels at week 30 but no changes in the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody levels. Furthermore, these investigators revealed that baseline serum IgM-RF levels are inversely correlated with the rates of changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) after IFX therapy. Thus, patients with high IgM-RF levels are less responsive to IFX.

In the RISING study (Clinical Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Increased Dose of TA-650 [IFX] in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis), in which patients resistant to MTX were treated with different doses of IFX (3, 6, and 10 mg/kg), blood IFX concentrations increased more slowly with increasing serum RF levels. In fact, remission was difficult to achieve with 3 mg/kg of IFX in patients with high serum RF levels. Overall, 10 mg/kg of IFX was found to be required to achieve remission.

In the REALISTIC trial (RA Evaluation in Subjects Receiving TNF Inhibitor CZP), patients with RA who did not respond to TNF inhibitors received a placebo or certolizumab pegol (CZP) and were divided into quartiles based on baseline serum RF levels to evaluate the treatment efficacy. The percentage of patients who achieved a 28-joint disease activity score based on CRP (DAS28-CRP) of < 2.6 at week 36 was l.

### Is rheumatoid arthritis an autoimmune disease [^115aTEfC]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not a homogenous disease entity but a syndrome with different causes and abnormalities sharing clinical manifestations. A major subset is anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive RA, which represents the larger fraction of RA patients. Here, autoantibodies and HLA class II association imply an autoimmune condition. In recent years, significant attention has been given to the specificity of the ACPA response and the possibility of subdividing patients based on ACPA subgroups. However, the effector functions of the autoantibodies and underlying lymphocytes have not been as thoroughly explored.

The review, based on HLA, discusses the generation of the autoreactive citrulline-specific T-cell repertoire. It highlights our understanding of T-cell specificities and effector functions of both T cells and ACPAs.

Dividing RA into subsets has only marginally influenced clinical practice, primarily by indicating a better response to therapies modulating adaptive immunity, such as rituximab, in the ACPA+ disease subset. Nonetheless, a more detailed understanding of immune reactions underlying various RA subsets may change our perspective on RA therapeutics and prevention. It is assumed that autoimmune variants of RA should be both curable and preventable.

### Rheumatoid arthritis: The continuum of disease and strategies for prediction, early intervention, and prevention [^116YANLt]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to include a pre-RA stage characterized by familial or genetic risk factors, biomarker abnormalities (e.g. anticitrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA]), symptoms, and even abnormal imaging findings prior to the development of clinical RA with inflammatory arthritis that is evident on physical examination. There are multiple completed or ongoing retrospective case-control as well as prospective observational studies aimed at identifying the key biological drivers of the disease.

Building on the predictive ability of combinations of biomarkers, symptoms, and imaging for future RA, multiple clinical trials are completed, underway, or in development to identify approaches that may prevent, delay, or ameliorate future clinical RA in at-risk individuals. Although an effective preventive intervention has not yet been identified, at-risk individuals are increasingly identified in clinical care. This presents a challenge in managing these individuals in clinical practice.

This review will discuss the understanding of the biology and natural history of RA development, nomenclature, and models for prediction of future RA. Additionally, it will evaluate ongoing clinical prevention trials with the overall goal of providing insights into the challenges and opportunities in RA prevention. Moreover, this review will offer up-to-date options for the clinical management of individuals at risk for RA.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis [^1123Ye3G]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Criteria for diagnosis include having at least one joint with definite swelling that is not explained by another disease. The likelihood of a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis increases with the number of small joints involved. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or elevated C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggests a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

Initial laboratory evaluation should also include complete blood count with differential and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Patients taking biologic agents should be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Earlier diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. Combinations of medications are often used to control the disease. Methotrexate is typically the first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, are generally considered second-line agents or can be added for dual therapy. The goals of treatment include minimization of joint pain and swelling, prevention of radiographic damage and visible deformity, and continuation of work and personal activities. Joint replacement is indicated for patients with severe joint damage whose symptoms are poorly controlled by medical management.

### Imaging tests as predictors of progression to rheumatoid arthritis in clinically suspect arthralgia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YYnys]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause progressive joint damage and deformity. Management of RA aims at controlling inflammation and slowing disease progression with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); however, delaying treatment may result in irreversible structural damage, leading to functional disability and affecting overall productivity and quality of life. Early diagnosis enables the earlier initiation of treatment with DMARDs, thereby improving outcomes. In the absence of a definitive diagnostic test, RA classification criteria are often utilized to aid diagnosis.

There is a shift in focus towards identifying individuals at higher risk of RA before clinical inflammatory arthritis (IA) becomes evident. Inflammatory arthralgia has been recognized as a phase preceding the development of IA and serves as a sensitive predictor of RA. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has defined arthralgia suspicious for progression to RA, or clinically suspect arthralgia (CSA), based on items including inflammatory joint symptoms to be used in patients with no apparent clinical arthritis. Approximately 20% of CSA cases will progress to RA.

Initiating DMARDs at the CSA phase may improve outcomes compared to starting at more advanced phases. However, DMARDs may confer side effects, necessitate regular monitoring blood tests, and incur high costs, which highlights the importance of predicting which patients are at higher risk of RA. Recent trials on interventions in the preclinical phases of RA, such as CSA, have considered subclinical inflammation. Both ultrasound and MRI can detect subclinical synovitis in people with arthritis.

### False-positive results for rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in patients with rheumatoid factor [^1111u6v3]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Four different rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria were evaluated by testing three patient groups: 82 healthy control patients, 89 Plasmodium vivax-infected patients, and 92 rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive nonmalaria patients. The false-positive rate for RF-positive patients ranged from 2.2% to 13%. High RF levels are associated with increased malaria RDT false positivity.

### Elevated rheumatoid factor and long term risk of rheumatoid arthritis: A prospective cohort study [^1142fGhL]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To test whether elevated concentration of rheumatoid factor is associated with long-term development of rheumatoid arthritis, a prospective cohort study was conducted. This study, known as the Copenhagen City Heart Study, involved blood samples drawn in 1981–83, and participants were followed until August 10, 2010.

The setting was the Copenhagen general population, specifically including 9,712 white Danish individuals aged between 20 and 100 years who did not have rheumatoid arthritis at the study's onset.
- **Main outcome measures**: Rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated according to baseline plasma IgM rheumatoid factor levels with categories set at 25–50, 50.1–100, and > 100 IU/mL, compared with a baseline of 100 IU/mL.

The conclusion pointed to a correlation between elevated rheumatoid factor levels and the development of rheumatoid arthritis over the long term.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis: A review [^115jkF8m]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs in about 5 per 1000 people and can lead to severe joint damage and disability. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades regarding the understanding of disease pathophysiology, optimal outcome measures, and effective treatment strategies, including the recognition of the importance of diagnosing and treating RA early.
- **Observations**: Early diagnosis and treatment of RA can avert or substantially slow the progression of joint damage in up to 90% of patients, thereby preventing irreversible disability. The development of novel instruments to measure disease activity and identify the presence or absence of remission has facilitated new treatment strategies to arrest RA before joints are damaged irreversibly. Outcomes have been improved by recognizing the benefits of early diagnosis and early therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The treatment target is remission or a state of at least low disease activity, which should be attained within six months. Methotrexate is first-line therapy and should be prescribed at an optimal dose of 25 mg weekly and in combination with glucocorticoids; 40% to 50% of patients reach remission or at least low disease activity with this regimen. If this treatment fails, the sequential application of targeted therapies, such as biologic agents (e.g. tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitors) or Janus kinase inhibitors in combination with methotrexate, has allowed up to 75% of these patients to reach the treatment target over time.

### 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^115Umhze]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2010). High credibility.

The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical calculator developed jointly by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). This calculator is used to classify patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are applied to patients who have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling) not better explained by another disease. The criteria are based on the weighted sum of four domains: joint involvement, serology (including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status), acute-phase reactants (C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and duration of symptoms.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in its early stages, and to differentiate it from other forms of arthritis or joint diseases. It is not intended to be used as the sole criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis but rather as a tool to support clinical judgment.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients with conditions that could better explain the synovitis, such as lupus or psoriatic arthritis. The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis assist in determining whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for the condition by evaluating four main areas: joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and duration of symptoms.

### What is rheumatoid factor? From screening to personalized management [^1171XpmJ]. Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

The measurement of RF is simple and easy to perform even in actual clinical practice. As described above, serum RF positivity and RF concentration are used as predictors for joint and life prognoses to establish appropriate treatment strategies. The significance of serum RF in disease management has been recognized. Serum RF is detected approximately 10 years before the onset of RA, and the presence of RF in combination with genetic and environmental factors is considered to lead to the onset of RA. Although the methods for measuring serum RF levels are assumed to be compatible, the definition of high RF levels varies slightly among different studies. Generally, 200 IU/ml or higher may be considered elevated.

High serum RF levels are associated with high disease activity and progressive joint destruction. The association between high serum RF levels and progression of joint destruction was investigated in the Active-Controlled Study of Patients Receiving IFX for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis of Early Onset (ASPIRE) trial, comprising patients with early-stage RA who were resistant to MTX and were treated with placebo or IFX. Such association was also assessed in the sub-analyses performed in the Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Trial in RA with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) trial. These trials revealed a clear association between high serum RF levels and progression of joint destruction despite the low degree of progression not only during treatment with MTX but also with MTX and a TNF inhibitor, such as IFX. Interestingly, owing to the analyses performed in these trials, RF has shown significant implications in RA progression.
