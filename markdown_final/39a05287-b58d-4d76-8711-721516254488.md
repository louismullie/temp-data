## Question

Can you take jardiance in CKD 4

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Jardiance (empagliflozin) can be used in CKD stage 4, which corresponds to eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², and if so, under what conditions and dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications and explicit eGFR thresholds for initiation and continuation. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial evidence, especially EMPA-KIDNEY, to see if benefits extend to eGFR below 30. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions that may allow initiation at lower eGFR than the original label. After that, I need to check safety considerations and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with dosing and monitoring advice, making sure I reconcile any apparent contradictions between label language and guideline practice.

> Let me first confirm the FDA labeling, because that sets the regulatory floor. The current U.S. prescribing information indicates empagliflozin is indicated to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESKD, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression, and it is also indicated for heart failure and for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, but it explicitly states that use is not recommended to improve glycemic control when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m² because it is likely to be ineffective mechanistically, and the label further notes that efficacy and safety were not studied in patients with eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis, though enrolled patients were not required to stop therapy if eGFR fell below 20 during follow-up [^115WjsaV] [^113viz4T].

> Wait, let me verify the trial data that inform practice below eGFR 30. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial enrolled adults with eGFR 20–44 mL/min/1.73 m² regardless of albuminuria, and also those with eGFR 45–89 mL/min/1.73 m² with albuminuria ≥ 200 mg/g, and showed a 28% reduction in kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death with empagliflozin 10 mg daily versus placebo, with benefits consistent across subgroups including those with eGFR less than 30, among whom 34.5% of participants were represented, and with no major safety signals down to eGFR 20 [^116P9R89] [^113MwDGD] [^114bpzdA].

> Hold on, I should verify how guidelines interpret this evidence relative to the label. Contemporary diabetes and kidney guidelines have moved to recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² based on EMPA-KIDNEY and related trials, emphasizing kidney and cardiovascular risk reduction even when glycemic efficacy is limited, and they note that benefits persist in people without diabetes and at low eGFR, aligning with the trial's scope and outcomes [^111Ei8NA] [^114GBnZa] [^114nVspG].

> I need to check safety and monitoring considerations carefully. The pooled safety analyses and EMPA-KIDNEY indicate no new safety concerns in advanced CKD, with similar rates of serious adverse events and special-interest events versus placebo, and empagliflozin may reduce hyperkalemia and edema, though volume depletion and urinary tract infections can occur and warrant vigilance, particularly in older adults or those on diuretics; clinically, I should confirm volume status, review diuretics, and monitor for genital mycotic infections, while expecting an initial eGFR dip of about 2–3 mL/min that stabilizes thereafter [^112gGCZB] [^117LRXDw] [^114bpzdA] [^1112dVvq].

> Let me think about dosing, because I should confirm the regimen that matches the evidence. For CKD risk reduction, the studied and recommended dose is 10 mg once daily, and dose adjustment is not required for renal impairment; importantly, while the 25 mg dose is used for glycemic control in T2D, it is not necessary for kidney or heart failure indications and should not be escalated for renal protection, so I should avoid the temptation to increase the dose for non-glycemic goals [^113N1FKn] [^116hMxBK].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on an SGLT2 inhibitor and the eGFR drifts below 20 mL/min/1.73 m² or dialysis is initiated; should I stop it. The FDA notes that patients in the trials were not required to discontinue if eGFR fell below 20 or if dialysis started, and some guidelines suggest continuation unless kidney replacement therapy is required, though evidence for efficacy on dialysis is limited; in practice, I should individualize, recognizing that ongoing kidney and heart failure benefits may persist even at very low eGFR, while acknowledging uncertainty and coordinating with nephrology [^113viz4T] [^112La1Bp] [^1158cmfL] [^116uVXD5].

> I should double-check the practical bottom line. For CKD stage 4 with eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m², initiation of empagliflozin 10 mg daily is reasonable if the goal is kidney and cardiovascular risk reduction rather than glycemic lowering, provided eGFR is at least 20 mL/min/1.73 m², with counseling about the initial eGFR dip, volume status optimization, and infection precautions; if eGFR is below 20, evidence is sparse and label language discourages initiation, though continuation may still be considered case-by-case in coordination with nephrology, especially if the patient is already benefiting and tolerating therapy [^116P9R89] [^111Ei8NA] [^113viz4T] [^1158cmfL].

---

Empagliflozin (Jardiance) is **not recommended for glycemic control** in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² because of limited efficacy [^115WjsaV] [^115xgBLx]. However, it is **approved for kidney protection** in CKD stage 4 (eGFR 15–29) at 10 mg daily [^113N1FKn] to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, with benefits confirmed in EMPA-KIDNEY [^116P9R89] and supported by guidelines [^111Ei8NA] [^114nVspG]. Monitor for volume depletion, hyperkalemia, and ketoacidosis, and avoid use in dialysis or severe renal impairment without specialist guidance [^113viz4T] [^112La1Bp].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in CKD stage 4

Empagliflozin's pharmacokinetics are **altered in CKD stage 4**: reduced renal clearance increases exposure, and lower GFR diminishes glycemic efficacy because less filtered glucose is available for SGLT2 blockade [^115xgBLx]. Despite this, **kidney-protective effects persist**, likely via hemodynamic and antifibrotic mechanisms rather than glycemic lowering [^113dFj4k].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use in CKD stage 4

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial enrolled patients with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and showed that empagliflozin **reduced kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28%** (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.82) [^116P9R89], with consistent benefits across eGFR subgroups, including eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^116P9R89]. Post hoc analyses also showed a **27% reduction in kidney failure or sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline** in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114nVspG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines support empagliflozin in CKD stage 4 for kidney protection, with initiation down to **eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^111Ei8NA] [^114GBnZa]. The ADA 2025 Standards recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for high-risk CKD, including eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events [^111Ei8NA]. KDIGO 2022 similarly endorses SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD progression risk reduction, including patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^114GBnZa].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Empagliflozin is **generally safe in CKD stage 4**, but clinicians should monitor for:

- **Volume depletion**: Increased risk due to osmotic diuresis; monitor volume status and adjust diuretics as needed [^113viz4T] [^1112dVvq].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor potassium, especially with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^114DdjW2].
- **Ketoacidosis**: Rare but possible; monitor ketones if symptoms occur [^114MXAA8].
- **Genital infections**: More frequent in women; counsel on hygiene and prompt treatment [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Empagliflozin is **contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² for glycemic control** because of limited efficacy [^115WjsaV] [^115xgBLx]. For kidney protection, it is not contraindicated but should be used cautiously in advanced CKD or dialysis, with close monitoring and specialist input [^111Ei8NA] [^113viz4T].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

Empagliflozin provides **significant clinical benefits** in CKD stage 4, including:

- **Slowing CKD progression**: Reduces risk of sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, ESKD, or renal death [^11456F53].
- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations [^115WjsaV].
- **All-cause hospitalizations**: Reduces risk by 14% (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.95) [^113mjF6e].

---

## Limitations and uncertainties

Evidence is **limited in patients with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** or on dialysis; benefits are less certain in these groups [^113viz4T]. Long-term safety data in advanced CKD remain limited, necessitating ongoing monitoring and individualized risk–benefit assessment [^notfound].

---

Empagliflozin is **approved for kidney protection in CKD stage 4** at 10 mg daily, with robust evidence of slowed CKD progression and cardiovascular benefits [^116P9R89]. It is not recommended for glycemic control at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² due to limited efficacy [^115WjsaV]. Clinicians should monitor for volume depletion, hyperkalemia, and ketoacidosis, and coordinate care with nephrology in advanced CKD [^113viz4T].

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

JARDIANCE is indicated:

to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure.
to reduce the risk of sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease.
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Limitations of Use

JARDIANCE is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

JARDIANCE is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. JARDIANCE is likely to be ineffective in this setting based upon its mechanism of action.

JARDIANCE is not recommended for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in patients with polycystic kidney disease or patients requiring or with a recent history of intravenous immunosuppressive therapy or greater than 45 mg of prednisone or equivalent for kidney disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. JARDIANCE is not expected to be effective in these populations.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE for glycemic control were evaluated in a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with mild and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In this trial, 195 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 91 adult patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in adult patients with worsening renal function. The risks of renal impairment, volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection-related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Use of JARDIANCE for glycemic control in patients without established cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.

JARDIANCE was evaluated in 7,020 adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, in a total of 9,718 patients with heart failure (eGFR greater than or equal to 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, and in 6,609 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 20 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the EMPA-KIDNEY study. The safety profile across eGFR subgroups in these trials was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

Efficacy and safety trials with JARDIANCE did not enroll adult patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled, adult patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials were not required to discontinue therapy for worsening of eGFR to less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2or initiation of dialysis [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.5)].

At baseline, 85% of patients were treated with ACE inhibitor or ARB, 64% with statins, and 34% with antiplatelet agents.

JARDIANCE was superior to placebo in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, or CV or renal death. The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. JARDIANCE also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization (see Table 18 and Figure 13); information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit.

Figure 13	Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint, Sustained ≥ 40% eGFR Decline, Sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m, ESKD or Renal Death, or CV Death

The results of the primary composite endpoint were generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups examined, including eGFR categories, underlying cause of kidney disease, diabetes status, or background use of RAS inhibitors (see Figure 14). The treatment benefit with JARDIANCE on the primary composite endpoint was not evident in patients with very low levels of albuminuria, however there were few events in these patients.

The dosage of empagliflozin PO for treatment of chronic kidney disease in adults (reduction of decline in renal function, progression to end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure hospitalization) is 10 mg PO qAM

---

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^115xgBLx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The glucose lowering efficacy of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased with decreasing level of renal function in the mild to moderate range. Least square mean HbA1c changes at 24 weeks were -0.6%, -0.5%, and -0.2% for those with a baseline eGFR of 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. For placebo, least square mean HbA1c changes at 24 weeks were 0.1%, -0.1%, and 0.2% for patients with a baseline eGFR of 60 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.

For patients with severe renal impairment, the analyses of changes in HbA1c and FPG showed no discernible treatment effect of JARDIANCE 25 mg compared to placebo [see Indications and Usage (1), Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older. Use of JARDIANCE for this indication is supported by evidence from a 26-week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period of up to 52 weeks in 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a pediatric pharmacokinetic study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The safety profile of pediatric patients treated with JARDIANCE was similar to that observed in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the exception of hypoglycemia risk which was higher in pediatric patients treated with JARDIANCE regardless of concomitant insulin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE have not been established in pediatric patients to reduce the risk of:

cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with heart failure.
sustained decline in eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease.

Clinical Trial in Pediatric Patients Aged 10 to 17 Years with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

JARDIANCE was administered to 52 patients in a trial of 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a mean exposure to JARDIANCE of 23.8 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none (5.7%). The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0% and the mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2.1 years. The mean age was 14.5 years (range: 10–17 years) and 51.6% were aged 15 years and older. Approximately, 50% were White, 6% were Asian, 31% were Black or African American, and 38% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 36.0 kg/m2and mean BMI Z-score was 3.0. Approximately 25% of the trial population had microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria.

The risk of hypoglycemia was higher in pediatric patients treated with JARDIANCE regardless of concomitant insulin use. Hypoglycemia, defined as a blood glucose < 54 mg/dL, occurred in 10 (19.2%) patients and in 4 (7.5%) patients treated with JARDIANCE and placebo, respectively. No severe hypoglycemic events occurred (severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon or take other corrective actions).

Clinical Trials in Adults with Heart Failure

No new adverse reactions were identified in EMPEROR-Reduced or EMPEROR-Preserved heart failure trials.

Clinical Trial in Adults with Chronic Kidney Disease

The safety profile in patients with chronic kidney disease was generally consistent with that observed across the studied indications. In a long-term cardio-renal outcome trial [see Clinical Studies 14.5], in patients with chronic kidney disease, the occurrence of lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 2.9, and 4.3 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, and JARDIANCE 10 mg treatment arms, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

---

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^115a3VDn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

JARDIANCE significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.99). The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of CV death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.77), with no change in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (see Table 15 and Figures 5 and 6). Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin dosages were consistent with results for the combined dosage groups.

The efficacy of JARDIANCE on CV death was generally consistent across major demographic and disease subgroups.

Vital status was obtained for 99.2% of subjects in the trial. A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Most of these deaths were categorized as CV deaths. The non-CV deaths were only a small proportion of deaths and were balanced between the treatment groups (2.1% in patients treated with JARDIANCE, and 2.4% of patients treated with placebo).

8.5 Geriatric Use

In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a total of 2,721 (32%) patients treated with JARDIANCE were 65 years of age and older, and 491 (6%) were 75 years of age and older. JARDIANCE is expected to have diminished glycemic efficacy in elderly patients with renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The risk of volume depletion-related adverse reactions increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 2.1%, 2.3%, and 4.4% for placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg. The risk of urinary tract infections increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 10.5%, 15.7%, and 15.1% in patients randomized to placebo, JARDIANCE 10 mg, and JARDIANCE 25 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY trials, no overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients. EMPEROR-Reduced included 1,188 (64%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 503 (27%) patients 75 years of age and older. EMPEROR-Preserved included 2,402 (80%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 1,281 (43%) patients 75 years of age and older. EMPA-KIDNEY included 2,089 (32%) patients treated with JARDIANCE 65 years of age and older, and 1,518 (23%) patients 75 years of age and older.

### Safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: pooled analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112gGCZB]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (category G3–4) enrolled in clinical trials.

Research Design and Methods

This analysis pooled data from 19 randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1–4 clinical trials and 1 randomized, placebo-controlled extension study in which patients received empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg daily. Time to first occurrence of adverse events (AEs) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression models.

Results

Among a total of 15,081 patients who received at least one study drug dose, 1,522, 722, and 123 were classified as having G3A, G3B, and G4 CKD, respectively, at baseline. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between treatment groups across CKD categories. Rates of serious AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and events of special interest (including lower limb amputations and acute renal failure [ARF]) were also similar between empagliflozin and placebo across CKD subgroups. In adjusted Cox regression analyses, risks for volume depletion and ARF were similar for empagliflozin and placebo in the combined group with CKD categories G3B and G4 and the G3A group. Notably lower risks were observed in both groups for hyperkalemia (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.37–0.96, P = 0.0323] and 0.48 [0.26–0.91, P = 0.0243], respectively) and edema (0.47 [0.33–0.68, P < 0.0001] and 0.44 [0.28–0.68, P = 0.0002], respectively).

Conclusions

Use of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD raised no new safety concerns and may have beneficial effects on the development of hyperkalemia and edema.

### Efficacy and safety of empagliflozin added to existing antidiabetes treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115gRbL1]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Methods

We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min per 1·73 m(2); n = 290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min per 1·73 m(2); n = 374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164501.

Findings

In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0·52% (95% CI -0·72 to -0·32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0·68% (-0·88 to -0·49) for empagliflozin 25 mg (both p < 0·0001). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was -0·42% (-0·56 to -0·28) for empagliflozin 25 mg (p < 0·0001). In patients with stage 2 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 83 patients (87%) on placebo (15 severe [16%] and 11 serious [12%]), 86 (88%) on empagliflozin 10 mg (six severe [6%] and six serious [6%]) and 78 (80%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (eight severe [8%] and seven serious [7%]). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 156 patients (83%) on placebo (15 severe [8%] and 23 serious [12%]) and 156 (83%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (18 severe [10%] and 22 serious [12%]).

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 or 3 CKD, empagliflozin reduced HbA1c and was well tolerated. However, our findings might not be applicable to the general population of patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^117NHFcY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Slowing chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and avoiding end-stage kidney disease (ESKD, i.e. the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation) is highly desirable, given the associated adverse effects on quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and high economic costs. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was established to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression. Findings from the active part of this trial and other large trials provided compelling evidence that SGLT2 inhibitors substantially slowed kidney disease progression and reduced cardiovascular risk. – SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced risk of hospitalization for heart failure and acute kidney injury in patients with CKD and other high-risk conditions (including diabetes and heart failure).

Post-trial follow-up tests how benefits evolve once participants stop study drug, as it is possible that additional cardiorenal benefits or harms could emerge after its discontinuation. Our trial was relatively short, as it was stopped early for efficacy after a median of two years of follow-up. Consequently, there were a lower number of primary outcomes in participants who progressed more slowly, and a low number of ESKD and fatal outcomes. Post-trial follow-up provides particular value through prospectively collecting more ESKD outcomes, as these outcomes take longer to accrue than surrogates of progression (e.g. percentage declines in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). We now report the effects of the total of two years of empagliflozin as study drug provided on risk of kidney disease progression and mortality outcomes during the active trial plus two years of post-trial observation.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^115cLkeT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The results of the active period of EMPA-KIDNEY were previously reported; empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome of progression of kidney disease or cardiovascular death during 2 years of active trial treatment in its population of participants with a wide range of CKD etiologies, levels of kidney function and albuminuria, with no major safety concerns. We now report the results of two years of post-trial prospective observation in which patients and clinicians were blinded to participants' original treatment allocation, and during which between-group use of SGLT2 inhibitors was similar. We found that there were residual cardiorenal benefits among patients allocated empagliflozin after study drug (empagliflozin or placebo) was discontinued. Mathematically, if there had been no off-treatment effect of empagliflozin post-trial (i.e. the hazard ratio was 1.0 after study drug stopped), absolute benefits would be observed to diminish from the end of the active trial period (see supplementary methods). Instead, we observed that absolute benefits both for the primary outcome and for the key secondary outcome of death or ESKD were initially maintained. In relative terms, the carry-over effect on the primary outcome was less than the effect of taking empagliflozin during the active trial period and appeared to last for up to 12 months, with most additional benefit exerted in the first 6 months after the active trial ended. Although not demonstrated directly, this suggests that to maximize the cardiorenal clinical benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD requires long-term treatment.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113fj2jE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin exerted positive cardiorenal effects in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial; this study reports active trial plus post-trial data.

Methods

In this trial, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate 20- < 45; or 45- < 90mL/min/1.73m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≥ 200mg/g received either empagliflozin 10mg daily or matching placebo for two years (median). Subsequently, surviving participants who consented were observed post-trial for two additional years. No study drug was issued in the post-trial period, but local doctors could prescribe SGLT2 inhibitors. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death assessed from the start of the active trial to the end of the post-trial period.

Results

4891 of 6609 randomized participants (74%) entered the post-trial period, during which, SGLT2 inhibitor use was similar between groups (empagliflozin group 43% vs. placebo 40%). Over the entirety of follow-up (study initiation to post-trial observation end) a primary outcome occurred in 865/3304 (26.2%) of the empagliflozin group and 1001/3305 (30.3%) of the placebo group (HR = 0.79, 95%CI 0.72–0.87). There was a 13% (0.87, 0.76–0.99) reduction in risk of the primary outcome during the post-trial period in the empagliflozin group. Compared with placebo, original allocation to empagliflozin reduced risk of kidney disease progression (23.5%vs.27.1%), the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease (16.9%vs.19.6%), and cardiovascular death (3.8%vs.4.9%). There was no effect on non-cardiovascular death (5.3%vs.5.3%).

Conclusions

In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease, empagliflozin continued to exert additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued. (Funding: Boehringer Ingelheim & others. Trial registration numbers:: NCT03594110; EuDRACT: 2017–002971–24.)

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116P9R89]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

The effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease who are at risk for disease progression are not well understood. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was designed to assess the effects of treatment with empagliflozin in a broad range of such patients.

Methods

We enrolled patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area, or who had an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Patients were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of progression of kidney disease (defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥ 40% from baseline, or death from renal causes) or death from cardiovascular causes.

Results

A total of 6609 patients underwent randomization. During a median of 2.0 years of follow-up, progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 432 of 3304 patients (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and in 558 of 3305 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.82; P < 0.001). Results were consistent among patients with or without diabetes and across subgroups defined according to eGFR ranges. The rate of hospitalization from any cause was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003), but there were no significant between-group differences with respect to the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes (which occurred in 4.0% in the empagliflozin group and 4.6% in the placebo group) or death from any cause (in 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression, empagliflozin therapy led to a lower risk of progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes than placebo.

Methods

Trial Design and Oversight

Details of rationale of the present study and trial design have been reported previously. Our study was designed and led by a Steering Committee that included representatives from the central coordinating office at the University of Oxford, each recruiting region, the sponsor (Boehringer Ingelheim), and other clinical and statistical experts. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB, known as the Data Monitoring Committee) was responsible for regular review of unblinded data to ensure participant safety, and for a Protocol-defined formal interim analysis for efficacy. The Protocol and the Data Analysis Plan (DAP) are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org and at empakidney.org. The trial was conducted at 241 centers in eight countries. Regulatory authorities and ethics committees for each center approved the trial.

Participants

Adults with a race-adjusted CKD-EPIeGFR of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area (irrespective of level of albuminuria); or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary ACR of at least 200 mg/g at the screening visit were eligible provided they were prescribed a clinically appropriate dose of single-agent RAS-inhibitor. Patients could also be included if an investigator judged that such treatment was either not tolerated or not indicated. Patients with or without diabetes were eligible. Those with polycystic kidney disease or a kidney transplant were excluded. Full details of eligibility criteria are provided in the Protocol (see Supplementary material available at). All participants provided written informed consent.

Discussion

In this population of patients with a wide range of causes of CKD, GFR and levels of albuminuria, empagliflozin safely reduced the risk of the primary outcome of kidney disease progression or death from cardiovascular causes by about 28%. Treatment was effective irrespective of whether patients had diabetes, and across a broad range of eGFR down to around 20 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. Risk of hospitalization for any cause was also reduced by 14%.

The effect of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death seen in the present trial is quantitatively similar to that seen in two other large placebo-controlled trials in CKD populations. The CREDENCE trial of canagliflozin required all participants to have type 2 diabetes and a urinary ACR of at least 300 mg/g, and excluded patients with an eGFR of less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. The DAPA-CKD trial of dapagliflozin required participants to have a urinary ACR of 200 mg/g and an eGFR of 25 to 75 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. It included 1398 participants without diabetes and 624 participants with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2.EMPA-KIDNEY adds substantially to the existing evidence by demonstrating consistent benefits among 3569 (54%) participants without diabetes and, separately, among 2282 (35%) participants with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. Despite recruiting 3192 (48%) participants with a urinary ACR below 300 mg/g, there was a limited number of primary outcomes in these types of patient as their CKD was progressing at a slower rate than participants with a urinary ACR of at least 300 mg/g. Prespecified exploratory analyses of the annual rate of change in eGFR - an accepted surrogate for kidney disease progression– showed empagliflozin slowed the rate of chronic eGFR decline in patients with a urinary ACR below 300 mg/g at baseline (including those with urinary ACR < 30 mg/g).

Outcomes

The pre-specified primary post-trial assessment was the effect of allocation to empagliflozin during the original active trial on the time to the composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death occurring at any time during the entire follow-up period (i.e. the active trial and post-trial follow-up periods combined). Kidney disease progression was defined as a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization, ESKD, a sustained eGFR below 10 mL/min/1.73m 2, or death from kidney failure. Confirmation of "sustained" required values on two consecutive eGFR measurements at least 30 days apart, or was assumed if it was the last eGFR value before death, withdrawal of consent or the end of a participant's follow-up. In primary analyses, previously reported primary outcomes from the active trial period were carried over irrespective of later eGFR results collected during the post-trial period. As central samples were not collected during the post-trial follow-up period, all eGFR-based post-trial measurements were relative to the local eGFR measurement at baseline (see Supplementary Methods for more details).

The post-trial follow-up protocol pre-specified key secondary outcomes of kidney disease progression alone, and the composite of death from any cause or ESKD. The other secondary outcome was ESKD. Tertiary outcomes were death from any cause and, separately, death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes (the latter being the safety outcome for post-trial follow-up); and the primary outcome assessed by key subgroups of interest. These subgroups were by diabetes status, eGFR, uACR, and primary kidney disease at randomization (using categories pre-specified for the primary trial report). Analyses explored the effect of empagliflozin on the primary and secondary outcomes by year, and eGFR in different follow-up windows.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1 The global rise in diabetes has led to an increase in the incidence of CKD, with over 35% of patients with diabetes aged ≥ 20 years having a diagnosis of CKD. 2 Optimal glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD is crucial, to reduce the risk of further complications, as well as the progression rate of CKD. 3 However, glucose‐lowering treatment options in this population are limited, and several drugs have label restrictions concerning CKD. 3, 4, 5 Furthermore, patients with CKD are at greater risk of developing severe hypoglycaemia, and medications that carry a high risk of hypoglycaemia 3, 4, 5, 6 may be less appropriate for this population. New treatment options for patients with diabetes and CKD are therefore needed to optimize outcomes.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111r1LCF]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Key trial strengths are its large size and broad eligibility criteria, the high level of adherence to study treatment, and the almost complete follow-up of all participants.

The trial has certain limitations, including the lower-than-expected cardiovascular event rate, which reduced statistical power to assess the secondary or tertiary cardiovascular outcomes. Nevertheless, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular outcomes are consistent with the totality of the evidence: a meta-analysis of the other CKD trials indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors lower risk of cardiovascular death by 16% (0.84; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.97) and the composite of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death by 27% (0.73; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.82).

In summary, in a broad range of patients with CKD, including large numbers without diabetes, with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2, and with low urinary ACR, we found that empagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney disease progression or death from cardiovascular causes in a broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111tPVXR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug.

Methods

In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period.

Results

Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups).

Conclusions

In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

### Effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease: a prespecified secondary analysis from the empa-kidney trial [^114bpzdA]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce progression of chronic kidney disease and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients. However, their effects on kidney disease progression in some patients with chronic kidney disease are unclear because few clinical kidney outcomes occurred among such patients in the completed trials. In particular, some guidelines stratify their level of recommendation about who should be treated with SGLT2 inhibitors based on diabetes status and albuminuria. We aimed to assess the effects of empagliflozin on progression of chronic kidney disease both overall and among specific types of participants in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial.

Methods

EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centres in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the United States), and included individuals aged 18 years or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to less than 45 mL/min per 1·73 m 2, or with an eGFR of 45 to less than 90 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of 200 mg/g or higher. We explored the effects of 10 mg oral empagliflozin once daily versus placebo on the annualised rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR slope), a tertiary outcome. We studied the acute slope (from randomisation to 2 months) and chronic slope (from 2 months onwards) separately, using shared parameter models to estimate the latter. Analyses were done in all randomly assigned participants by intention to treat. EMPA-KIDNEY is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110.

Findings

Between May 15, 2019, and April 16, 2021, 6609 participants were randomly assigned and then followed up for a median of 2·0 years (IQR 1·5–2·4). Prespecified subgroups of eGFR included 2282 (34·5%) participants with an eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1·73 m 2, 2928 (44·3%) with an eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min per 1·73 m 2, and 1399 (21·2%) with an eGFR 45 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 or higher. Prespecified subgroups of uACR included 1328 (20·1%) with a uACR of less than 30 mg/g, 1864 (28·2%) with a uACR of 30 to 300 mg/g, and 3417 (51·7%) with a uACR of more than 300 mg/g. Overall, allocation to empagliflozin caused an acute 2·12 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (95% CI 1·83–2·41) reduction in eGFR, equivalent to a 6% (5–6) dip in the first 2 months. After this, it halved the chronic slope from -2·75 to -1·37 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 per year (relative difference 50%, 95% CI 42–58). The absolute and relative benefits of empagliflozin on the magnitude of the chronic slope varied significantly depending on diabetes status and baseline levels of eGFR and uACR. In particular, the absolute difference in chronic slopes was lower in patients with lower baseline uACR, but because this group progressed more slowly than those with higher uACR, this translated to a larger relative difference in chronic slopes in this group (86% [36–136] reduction in the chronic slope among those with baseline uACR < 30 mg/g compared with a 29% [19–38] reduction for those with baseline uACR ≥ 2000 mg/g; p trend < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Empagliflozin slowed the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease among all types of participant in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, including those with little albuminuria. Albuminuria alone should not be used to determine whether to treat with an SGLT2 inhibitor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Aims

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial aimed to randomize ∼6000 people with pre-existing CKD to empagliflozin 10 mg daily versus matching placebo in order to assess empagliflozin's effect on time to the primary composite outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death (Figure 1). Kidney disease progression is defined as ESKD, renal death, a sustained decline in eGFR to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or a ≥ 40% eGFR decline from randomization. Key secondary aims are to assess the effect of empagliflozin on time to hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death, occurrences of hospitalizations from any cause and time to death from any cause. Other assessments include analyses of safety and biochemical effects.

EMPA-KIDNEY's design is streamlined, with work for collaborating sites kept to a minimum and only essential information collected. The trial focusses on readily identifiable and important clinical outcomes and data collection relies mainly on participant-reported information recorded at interviews directly into a bespoke web-based system and centrally measured serum creatinine.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and associated with reduced quality of life and increased risks of kidney failure (which is fatal without costly kidney replacement therapy), cardiovascular disease and mortality. – Trials in CKD populations have traditionally used dichotomous composite clinical outcomes which combine kidney failure (an infrequent outcome) with a proportional reduction in kidney function (as measured by change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) from baseline in excess of a particular threshold, usually 40% to 57%. The latter component is now accepted by regulatory authorities as a valid surrogate outcome for kidney failure itself in randomized trials. Like all dichotomous outcomes, the majority of such outcomes during the trial follow-up period occurs in patients at highest risk, unlike in the general population where the majority of events occur during the lifetime of patients at moderate risk because of the much larger number of such patients. Therefore analyses based on these outcomes have less statistical sensitivity for determining the effects of treatment among groups of patients who are at lower risk of kidney failure (including those with better preserved kidney function) but from whom ultimately come the majority of patients with kidney failure in the general population. There is therefore interest in examining the annualised rate of decline of kidney function ("eGFR slope") because this parameter can be calculated for all participants, and so eGFR slopes have improved statistical sensitivity when comparing the effect of an intervention in different types of patient. It may also be considered as a valid surrogate of CKD progression per se and be used as a primary outcome in trials. Importantly, the effect of a treatment on eGFR slope is not necessarily homogeneous over time; many renoprotective treatments including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and finerenone, cause an early 'acute' negative effect on slope (referred to as an acute dip), followed by a long-term (or 'chronic') reduction in eGFR slope. It is therefore important to understand the effects of new treatments on these two components of the 'total' slope.

Randomized trials of SGLT2i have consistently shown that this class of treatment reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease (measured with dichotomous outcomes) in patients with CKD with or without diabetes, irrespective of underlying primary kidney disease. – Secondary analyses of two previous trials of SGLT2i in CKD populations found some evidence that the effects of SGLT2i on eGFR slope varied in different types of patient, but because the trials only recruited patients with significant albuminuria, they were limited in their ability to explore whether this effect varied according to baseline albuminuria as well as other clinical characteristics. Here we present the effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on eGFR slope from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial which recruited a uniquely broad range of patients with CKD at risk of progression, including those with minimal albuminuria, low eGFR, and with and without diabetes.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

EMPA-KIDNEY (empagliflozin) in chronic kidney disease — eligibility and outcomes at low eGFR: participants had an eGFR of at least 20 but less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with a UACR of at least 200 mg/g creatinine; approximately one-half of the 6,609 participants had diabetes. Empagliflozin lowered progression of kidney disease and death from cardiovascular causes (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.64–0.82]; P < 0.001). Notably, while glucose-lowering effects are blunted with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, renal and cardiovascular benefits were still seen at eGFR levels as low as < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with no significant change in long-term eGFR decline compared with standard of care.

Discussion

Our analyses show that in this cohort of patients with CKD at risk of progression, allocation to empagliflozin causes a small dip in kidney function of approximately 2 mL/min/1.73m 2 (or 6%) and then halves the subsequent rate of long-term loss of kidney function. This overall result complements the 29% (95% CI 19–38%) reduction in risk of kidney disease progression when assessed with the categorical composite outcome of end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease from baseline in eGFR of at least 40% or to less than 10 mL/min/1.73m 2, or death from kidney failure. The beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the progression of CKD varied by diabetes status and eGFR, but most prominently by albuminuria, where relative benefits may in fact be larger among participants with lower albuminuria. These findings are consistent with observations in other trials of SGLT2i in CKD, although these trials focussed on patients with diabetes and/or with significant levels of albuminuria. The broad range of patients included in the large EMPA-KIDNEY trial has allowed this to be explored in a more diverse population than those included in other large trials of SGLT2 inhibition in CKD; in particular, EMPA-KIDNEY included participants with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m 2 and with uACR < 200 mg/g who were excluded from these previous trials and consequently their analysis of eGFR slopes.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^1119vw2p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113FWeNa]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

This increased efficacy at higher baseline HbA1c values is also interesting in terms of the open-label arm of this study. Patients who were otherwise eligible but with screening HbA1c > 10.0% were not randomized but instead were all assigned open-label empagliflozin 25 mg. At baseline, mean HbA1c in this group was 11.5%, and by week 24 it had fallen to 7.6%. This mean level is still above the recommended target for most patients, yet 28% of this group reached a goal of HbA1c < 7.0%. Although an open-label study such as this must be interpreted with caution, it suggests that empagliflozin may provide useful glycemic improvements across a range of baseline HbA1c values.

Further phase 3 placebo-controlled trials have shown significant reductions in HbA1c when empagliflozin was used as add-on to metformin, pioglitazone with or without metformin, and sulfonylureas plus metformin. Reductions were of a similar amount to those seen with monotherapy and to those expected for other SGLT2 inhibitors. Empagliflozin has also been studied in twice-daily combinations with metformin (immediate-release) in treatment-naïve patients and fixed-dose combinations with linagliptin in treatment-naïve patients or patients already on stable metformin. Two studies recruited patients on insulin (either basal insulin or multiple daily injections) and both showed significant reductions even in these typically refractory patients. This demonstrates one of the key features of the mechanism of action — that empagliflozin can be used across the diabetes spectrum since it does not depend on endogenous insulin. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that many patients with advanced T2DM, and thus likely to be on insulin, will also have some degree of renal impairment, and this can impact the HbA1c reduction. Because of its mechanism of action, empagliflozin relies on adequate renal function to be effective and is contraindicated in people with severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or dialysis. However, empagliflozin has been studied in patients with renal impairment over the range of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15–90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 in a 52-week study with the primary endpoint being change in HbA1c after 24 weeks. In patients with eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 ml/min/1.73 m 2 [stage 2 chronic kidney disease (CKD)], empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg were both associated with significant reductions in HbA1c versus placebo (−0.52% for empagliflozin 10 mg and −0.68% for empagliflozin 25 mg; both P < 0.0001). Patients with eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (stage 3 CKD) were only randomized to placebo or the higher dose of empagliflozin (25 mg), and again empagliflozin gave a significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo, although this appeared more modest than in patients with mild renal impairment (mean −0.42%; P < 0.0001). The study included a relatively small number of patients (n = 74) with stage 4 CKD (≥ 15 to < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and in this group empagliflozin was not associated with significant reductions in HbA1c; in fact, the mean change was a small increase of 0.04%, although the investigators noted reductions in BP and body weight. Overall, this suggests that empagliflozin may be useful in patients with T2DM and mild or moderate renal impairment, especially since there are relatively few options in this group.

### Kidney and cardiovascular effectiveness of empagliflozin compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes [^111an7tm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Placebo-controlled trials of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors demonstrate kidney and cardiovascular benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We used real-world data to compare the kidney and cardiovascular effectiveness of empagliflozin to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is), a commonly prescribed antiglycemic medication, in a diverse population with and without CKD. Using electronic health record data from 20 large US health systems, we leveraged propensity overlap weighting to compare the outcomes for empagliflozin and DPP4i initiators with type 2 diabetes between 2016 and 2020. The primary composite kidney outcome included 40% estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease, incident end-stage kidney disease, or all-cause mortality through 2 years or censoring. We also assessed cardiovascular and safety outcomes. Of 62,197 new users, 20,279 initiated empagliflozin and 41,918 initiated DPP4i. Over a median follow-up of 1.1 years, empagliflozin prescription was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.87) than DPP4is. The risks for mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.92) and a cardiovascular composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.95) were also lower for empagliflozin initiators. No difference in heart failure hospitalization risk between groups was observed. Genital mycotic infections were more common in patients prescribed empagliflozin (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.58 to 1.88). Empagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome in patients with CKD (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88) and those without CKD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94). In conclusion, the initiation of empagliflozin was associated with a significantly lower risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes than DPP4is over a median of just over 1 year. The association with a lower risk for clinical outcomes was apparent even for patients without known CKD at baseline.

### Design, recruitment, and baseline characteristics of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^116NnC2d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular disease have not been tested in a dedicated population of people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial is an international randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing whether empagliflozin 10 mg daily decreases the risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death in people with CKD. People with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) were eligible provided they had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 but < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 or an eGFR ≥ 45 but < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (uACR) ≥ 200 mg/g. The trial design is streamlined, as extra work for collaborating sites is kept to a minimum and only essential information is collected.

Results

Between 15 May 2019 and 16 April 2021, 6609 people from eight countries in Europe, North America and East Asia were randomized. The mean age at randomization was 63.8 years [standard deviation (SD) 13.9)], 2192 (33%) were female and 3570 (54%) had no prior history of DM. The mean eGFR was 37.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD 14.8), including 5185 (78%) with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. The median uACR was 412 mg/g) (quartile 1-quartile 3 94–1190), with a uACR < 300 mg/g in 3194 (48%). The causes of kidney disease included diabetic kidney disease [n = 2057 (31%)], glomerular disease [n = 1669 (25%)], hypertensive/renovascular disease [n = 1445 (22%)], other [n = 808 (12%)] and unknown causes [n = 630 (10%)].

Conclusions

EMPA-KIDNEY will evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in a widely generalizable population of people with CKD at risk of kidney disease progression. Results are anticipated in 2022.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111PspSL]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The mechanisms for any persisting effects of SGLT2 inhibitors still need to be elucidated. Preservation of nephron number during the active trial period might conceivably reduce hyperfiltration and risk of ESKD, and preservation of kidney function may have mediated some of the post-trial observed benefits on cardiovascular death. The acute eGFR dip with SGLT2 inhibition reversed within 4 weeks after discontinuation, so some of the observed post-trial benefit on eGFR components of kidney disease progression could result from reversal of the acute eGFR dip after cessation of study drug. However, that does not explain continuing benefits on ESKD.

Participants who did not start an SGLT2 inhibitor had twice the predicted risk of kidney failure of participants who started an SGLT2 inhibitor post-trial. This phenomenon may reflect some uncertainty about the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition in those with more advanced CKD, and inertia in changes in practice owing to the time taken for regulatory/payer approvals. This prognostic imbalance implies, in particular, that any comparison of outcomes between participants allocated empagliflozin who started an SGLT2 inhibitor post-trial versus those allocated placebo who remained off SGLT2 inhibition post-trial will be confounded, and hence unreliable.

Current international guidance on use of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD provide recommendations of different strengths for patients who were eligible for EMPA-KIDNEY based on different levels of albuminuria. The almost doubling of the number of first primary outcomes from 990 in the active trial's report to 1866 after post-trial follow-up appears to help us to address uncertainties resulting from the active trial period. Benefits on the post-trial follow-up primary outcome, kidney disease progression, and difference in eGFR on last measurement were similar irrespective of level of albuminuria, as well as diabetes status, level of kidney function, and primary kidney diagnosis. This is consistent with effects on eGFR-slope from the active trial phase.

Our trial was designed to ensure that findings would be widely generalizable. Other key strengths of this trial were its large size and broad eligibility criteria, high levels of adherence to study drug, the high volunteer rate for post-trial follow-up, and the almost complete follow-up. Post-trial follow-up addresses some of the limitations of the active trial, including its low number of cardiovascular deaths.

### Shifts in KDIGO CKD risk groups with empagliflozin: kidney-protection from SGLT2 inhibition across the spectrum of risk [^113VqNFq]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

T2D is a well-established risk factor for development and progression of CKD. KDIGO recommends categorization of risk by likelihood of progression to ESKD. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin decreases likelihood of worsening (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62–0.78) and increases likelihood of improvement (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30–1.86) in KDIGO risk category.

### Significant reduction in chronic kidney disease progression with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes in a UK clinical setting: an observational outcomes study based on international guidelines for kidney disease [^114SJU5d]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Although previous studies have investigated the efficacy and effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors to improve renal endpoints, none of the previous studies have directly compared the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors against DPP‐4 inhibitors for clinically important renal endpoints. The only other study that compared the same two classes of drugs in the same patient group was one by Rhee et al, who compared SGLT2 inhibitors with DPP‐4 inhibitors across different stages of CKD in T2D, however, renal endpoints were not among the outcomes explored. Interestingly, in that study, the cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were only seen in patients with T2D with no CKD or those with CKD stages 1 or 2 (ie, eGFR > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2). A similar trend was observed in this study, where SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with lower risks of all‐cause death and composite renal outcomes in T2D with baseline eGFR > 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in the subgroup analyses, although between‐group differences were not statistically significant.

The findings of the present study, using the new consensus definitions for kidney outcomesbuild on those of our previous retrospective observational study that used more crude hospitalization definitions, which also reported improved kidney outcomes in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. In patients with no history of cardio‐renal disease (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63‐0.88; P < 0.001), and those with established or high risk of CVD (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.43‐0.54; P < 0.001), SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reductions in hospitalization for CKD.

In the EMPEROR‐Reduced trial, empagliflozin reduced the risks of the primary outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF), total hospitalizations for HF, and kidney outcomes, independently of baseline severity of diabetes, and was effective across HbA1c levels compared with placebo in patients with class II to IV HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or less. In a similar cohort to that of EMPEROR‐Reduced, the DAPA‐HF study showed that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death, regardless of the presence or absence of T2D, compared with placebo. These studies enrolled patients predominately based on HF and, therefore, a different cohort from that in the present analysis. Despite this, the results for cardiovascular mortality are broadly consistent with our results.

### The long-term effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease: a time-to-event analysis [^117FKNqf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, the patient-level data used covered a broad range of CKD severity, but data in those with less severe disease were limited to patients who also had T2D. Patients across a broad range of UACR, with or without T2D, were included in the clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in chronic kidney disease (EMPA-KIDNEY), demonstrating a 28% reduction in the primary composite outcome (progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes) over a 2.0-year follow-up period. Nevertheless, it did not provide outcomes for constituent components of the composite endpoint stratified by combinations of both mild UACR (< 200 mg/g) and mild eGFR impairment (> 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2), thereby obviating direct comparison with the present results. In addition, long-term effects have been previously demonstrated in patients with albuminuric CKD (A3, > 300 mg/g) without T2D, where treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in addition to standard therapy were found to avoid progression to kidney failure. However, our pooled population analysis suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are also effective in the wider CKD population, including patients with milder disease and low UACR. Future observational studies are needed to validate the clinical outcomes estimated here in a comparable population without T2D.

### Editorial: the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the management of chronic kidney disease [^116LNTwJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the alleged pathways by which SGLT2 inhibitors slow progression of CKD is correction of hyperfiltration. Since the long-term benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are unlikely mediated by reductions in HbA1c and various types of kidney diseases are characterized by hyperfiltration, it is tempting to speculate on the role of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD without type 2 diabetes, as reviewed by Dekkers and Gansevoort. Previous studies have indeed suggested that the pharmacodynamic activity persists in non-diabetic conditions. For example, in nearly 400 obese individuals, canagliflozin reduced body weight, blood pressure and uric acid. Moreover, in 10 patients with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, reductions in both numerical and measured proteinuria were noted, although these did not reach statistical significance. Further mechanistic and clinical outcome trials are ongoing in patients with CKD. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD trial assesses the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD with and without diabetes. The rationale and the design of the trial are described in this month's issue of NDT. The Empagliflozin Kidney (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial is another large clinical trial to assess the efficacy of empagliflozin on major kidney outcomes. The results will increase our understanding about the position of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD without diabetes.

Should SGLT2 inhibitors be prescribed to any patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD? It is possible that some patients do not tolerate these drugs or use concomitant medications, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors or loop diuretics that may impact the efficacy or safety of SGLT2 inhibitors. These questions are discussed by Neuen et al. in this NDT supplement.

After more than a century of research into the physiology of tubular glucose reabsorption, we are now entering a new era of kidney protection with proven effective therapeutic approaches that prevent clinically important outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is now up to the nephrology community to implement these treatments in clinical practice.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in stage 4 chronic kidney disease [^11732Jtf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin significantly reduced risk of kidney failure and prolonged survival in patients with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Adults with eGFR of 25–75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200–5000 mg/g had been randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo. Here, we conducted a prespecified analysis of dapagliflozin's effects in patients with stage 4 CKD (eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) at baseline. The primary end point was a composite of time to ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESKD, or kidney or cardiovascular death. Secondary end points were a kidney composite (same as the primary end point but without cardiovascular death), a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause death.

Results

A total of 293 participants with stage 4 CKD received dapagliflozin and 331 received placebo. Patients with stage 4 CKD randomized to dapagliflozin experienced a 27% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: -2 to 47%) reduction in the primary composite endpoint, and 29% (-2 to 51%), 17% (-53 to 55%), and 32% (-21 to 61%) reductions in the kidney, cardiovascular and mortality endpoints, respectively, relative to placebo. Interaction P-values were 0.22, 0.13, 0.63, and 0.95, respectively, comparing CKD stages 4 versus 2/3. The eGFR slope declined by 2.15 and 3.38 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.005). Patients treated with dapagliflozin or placebo had similar rates of serious adverse events and adverse events of interest.

Conclusions

Among patients with stage 4 CKD and albuminuria, the effects of dapagliflozin were consistent with those observed in the DAPA-CKD trial overall, with no evidence of increased risks.

### Empagliflozin in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome: five Japanese cases [^113ETzmG]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to exert cardiorenal protective effects in diabetic patients and are widely used clinically. In addition, an increasing number of reports now suggest these drugs may even be beneficial in non-diabetic patients. However, SGLT2 inhibitors are rarely prescribed for kidney transplant recipients due to the risk of renal graft damage and urogenital infections.

Case Presentation

We report the cases of 5 renal transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome who were administered the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, which yielded beneficial results in 4 cases. With the exception of one patient with an initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, administration of empagliflozin elicited beneficial metabolic effects. There were no significant reductions in eGFR before or after empagliflozin administration, and no dehydration or urogenital infections were observed during the treatment course.

Conclusion

Empagliflozin showed some positive effects in 4 cases with better renal function than CKD stage 4. Further studies will be required to clarify the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in a larger group of patients with similar medical conditions.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors: new horizons for rheumatologists [^112kz7iF]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease with proteinuria with or without diabetes mellitus

SGLT2 inhibitors are approved for patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial enrolled 4304 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–75 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine 200–5000 mg/g (median 950 mg/g). One-third of enrolled patients did not have diabetes. Patients were assigned dapagliflozin 10 mg daily vs. placebo. At follow up of 2.4 years, patients in the dapagliflozin group had statistically significant decreased end stage kidney disease (5.1 vs. 7.5%) and all-cause mortality (4.7 vs. 6.8%). The risk of 50% or greater decline in eGFR decreased from 9.3 to 5.2%.

The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) trial enrolled 6609 patients with either eGFR 20–44 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or eGFR 45–89 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio greater than 200 mg/g. Notably, less than 50% of enrolled patients had diabetes. Patient were treated with either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo. At the end of 2 years, the treatment group demonstrated a reduced incidence of end-stage renal disease (3.3 vs. 4.8%), sustained decline in eGFR to less than 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (3.5 vs. 5.1%), and sustained decrease in eGFR of 40% or more (10.9 vs. 14.3%). The risks of all-cause mortality (4.5 vs. 5.1%) and nonfatal cardiovascular events (4.3 vs. 4.6%) were similar between the groups. The largest benefits were noted in patients with the highest urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios.

### Consistent effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes irrespective of diabetic kidney disease categories: insights from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial [^113LA1up]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To explore the cardiovascular (CV) and kidney effects of empagliflozin in patients with different clinical phenotypes of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (i.e. with the presence or absence of overt albuminuria) participating in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.

Materials and Methods

EMPA-REG OUTCOME randomized participants (1:1:1) to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25mg or placebo, added to standard of care. Post hoc, patients with different clinical phenotypes of DKD at baseline were categorized in three subgroups: (a) overt DKD (overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of > 300mg/g] with any estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]; n = 769); (b) non-overt DKD (kidney impairment [eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2] without overt albuminuria [urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≤ 300mg/g]; n = 1290); and (c) 'all others' (eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2 without overt albuminuria; n = 4893). Analyses included CV (death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization) and selected kidney outcomes, change in eGFR and kidney safety. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the consistency of treatment effect across subgroups.

Results

Empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of CV and kidney outcomes across all subgroups (P-values for interaction > .05), consistent with the overall trial population findings. Empagliflozin also significantly reduced the yearly loss of eGFR, assessed by chronic slopes, in all subgroups. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin was similar across all subgroups.

Conclusions

Empagliflozin may improve CV and kidney outcomes and slow the progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes patients with DKD, irrespective of its clinical form, both with or without the presence of overt albuminuria.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor trials and impact at lower eGFR: Inclusion thresholds were eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in DAPA-CKD and ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in EMPA-Kidney; the primary composite kidney outcome — end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or ≥ 40% decline from baseline, or renal or cardiovascular death — was reduced by 28% (95% CI, 18%-36%). In EMPA-Kidney, of 6,609 participants, 34.5% had an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and this stratum showed a 27% (95% CI, 14%-38%) reduction, and post hoc DAPA-CKD analyses in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a 27% (95% CI, 2%-47%) reduction. Expanding the lower limit at which an SGLT2 inhibitor may be initiated provides additional options for treatment to more than 750,000 US adults living with stage 4 CKD, 39% of whom have diabetes.

DAPA-CKD and EMPEROR enrolled patients down to an eGFR of 25 and 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2, respectively. EMPA-KIDNEY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03594110) is enrolling patients down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. It may be appropriate in patients with uACR > 1,000 mg/g who are at high risk for rapid decline in eGFR or have a history of rapid eGFR decline to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, as the DAPA-CKD trial is directly applicable to patients with CKD.

The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained ≥ 40% eGFR decline, sustained eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and CV death. There were few renal deaths during the trial. Empagliflozin also reduced the risk of first and recurrent hospitalization; information collected on the reason for hospitalization was insufficient to further characterize the benefit. Because of the metformin HCl component, SYNJARDY and SYNJARDY XR are not indicated for use in patients with CKD without type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Indications and Usage (1)].

The effect of empagliflozin in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint was consistent in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.54, 0.78)], and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metformin HCl as background therapy [HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.48, 1.09)].

### Comparison of effectiveness among different sodium-glucose cotransoporter-2 inhibitors according to underlying conditions: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111hDQ2T]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and network meta‐analysis of large RCTs, the differences in reducing cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, as well as safety profiles, across SGLT2 inhibitors were not consistently significant, although empagliflozin might benefit patients without CKD. Our findings may assist clinicians in tailoring the optimal SGLT2 inhibitors to each patient's individual clinical scenario; however, further well‐designed studies are warranted to clarify these findings.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^116go8hp]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

These clinical practice guidelines pertain to use of SGLT-2 inhibition in people with CKD. The standard of care in many forms of CKD is the use of RAS blockers, with clear evidence of benefit in diabetic nephropathy. All CREDENCE participants were on stable maximally tolerated RAS blockade, as were 97% of DAPA-CKD participants and 85% of participants in EMPA-KIDNEY. We therefore provide a grade 1A Recommendation to prescribe RAS blockade and ensure clinically appropriate dosing alongside any SGLT-2 inhibitor use. Note that it has been suggested that, mechanistically, SGLT-2 inhibition may have the potential to activate RAS. However the large trials in people with type 2 DM at high atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk have been combined in meta- analysis and have raised a hypothesis that the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression could extend to people with type 2 DM not on RAS blockade. The lack of heterogeneity of effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome stratified by use of RAS inhibition in EMPA-KIDNEY lends further support to this hypothesis.

Note that we recommend single agent RAS blockade, as combination therapy (i.e. dual blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] plus angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) has been found to increase the risk of serious hyperkalaemia or acute kidney injury, and has not been shown to importantly slow CKD progression.
3 We suggest following NICE guidelines on use of uACR for screening of albuminuria (NICE NG203). We recognise that more pragmatic approaches to identifying risk of kidney disease progression may be necessary whilst local access to uACR measurement is improved (Grade 2C).

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Subjects

This 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted at 89 centres in 19 countries and consisted of an AHA adjustment period (if required; consisting of a dose titration period of up to 4 weeks and an 8-week dose stable period); a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period; a 26-week, double-blind, core treatment period; and a 26-week, double-blind, extension period (data to be reported in a separate publication). Eligible subjects were men and women aged ≥ 25 years with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0 and ≤ 10.5%) and stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and were either not on AHA therapy or were on a stable AHA regimen (monotherapy or combination therapy with any approved agent including metformin, sulphonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, α-glucosidase inhibitor, GLP-1 analogue, pioglitazone or insulin) for ≥ 8 weeks (≥ 12 weeks with pioglitazone) prior to the week –2 visit. Subjects were required to have generally stable renal function, as determined by a ≤ 25% decrease in eGFR from the screening to the week –2 visits. Subjects on AHA regimens not consistent with local prescribing guidelines (e.g. metformin therapy) underwent an AHA adjustment period of up to 12 weeks before the placebo run-in period. Subjects were to remain on their stable AHA regimens through the completion of the 52-week treatment period (unless glycaemic rescue criteria were met, as discussed below).

Subjects were excluded if they had repeated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) > 15.0 mmol/l (270 mg/dl) during the pretreatment phase; a history of T1DM; renal disease that required immunosuppressive therapy, dialysis or transplant; nephrotic syndrome or inflammatory renal disease; New York Heart Association Class III-IV cardiovascular disease; myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization procedure or cerebrovascular accident within 3 months prior to screening; or haemoglobin concentration < 100 g/l (10 g/dl) at screening.

The study protocol and amendments were approved by the institutional review boards at participating institutions and the study was conducted under the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices and the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^116uVXD5]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Two of the four clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibition conducted in people with CKD have enrolled people without diabetes (DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY), and in both trials SGLT-2 inhibition has been continued below an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 without evidence of increased adverse events. In EMPA-KIDNEY, in which over half of the participants did not have diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibition was shown to have consistent relative benefits across the spectrum of eGFR, including among people with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 (Fig. 4). Given that people with low eGFR are at high risk of progression to kidney failure, the absolute benefit is likely to be considerable for this population, irrespective of diabetes status. We therefore provide a grade 2B Recommendation for initiation of use of SGLT-2 inhibition for people without type 2 DM with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m 2.

Recommendations for implementation in people with or without type 2 diabetes

We recommend using SGLT-2 inhibitors with demonstrated efficacy for their given indications (Grade 1A).

Rationale

Government regulators review data from randomised trials and assess their reliability through regulatory inspections. Regulatory licences/indications therefore provide a key guide to which SGLT-2 inhibitors have generated definitive evidence of efficacy and safety for a given use. We therefore recommend selecting SGLT-2 inhibitors according to these licensed indications, wherever possible (summaries of which are provided in section 4 of the Supplementary appendix).
2 We recommend using clinically appropriate single agent renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in combination with SGLT-2 inhibition, wherever RAS blockade is indicated and tolerated (Grade 1A)

### Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: a consensus statement [^1112dVvq]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall, genital mycotic infections are the most frequent side effect observed with SGLT2i. The incidence of UTI in patients treated with SGLT2i is similar to that seen in all people with T2DM. Hypoglycemia can occur when a SGLT2i is used as an add-on to other agents causing hypoglycemia, such as insulin or sulfonylureas. Volume depletion and hypotension are rare and can be minimized by adjusting diuretic and antihypertensive treatment in patients at risk. The incidences of AKI, amputation (largely feet and toes), and fractures are rare and can be prevented by careful monitoring and avoiding use in high-risk patients.

Ongoing SGLT2i Trials Assessing Renal Outcomes

Multiple trials assessing the renal benefits of SGLT2i are ongoing. The RACELINES trial will assess the clinical effects and mechanism of monotherapy and combination therapy of the SGLT2i empagliflozin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor linagliptin on renal physiology and biomarkers in metformin-treated T2DM patients. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will compare the renal effect of a SGLT2i and a sulfonylurea. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial will evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on kidney disease progression or CV death in people without T2DM. Despite optimal treatment with RAAS inhibitors, many patients with non-diabetic kidney disease show progressive kidney function loss, which is associated with high residual proteinuria. The recently completed DIAMOND study was conducted to assess the renoprotective effects of dapagliflozin in non-diabetic patients with proteinuria. The DAPA-CKD trial, evaluating the efficacy of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion, with and without T2D, will be stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The treatment paradigm for CKD, for people with and without T2DM, may change after the release of the ongoing trial results over the next few years. These trials are listed in Table 4 with their primary outcome measures.

SGLT2 inhibitors and dialysis

Many health organizations recommend discontinuing SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in patients with severe renal impairment; however, clinical trials have been conducted in patients receiving dialysis. The recommendation is to consider SGLT2is in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and hospitalized heart failure patients if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is greater than 20 ml/min/1.73 m². There are no contraindications for low-dose use: the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin should not exceed 10 mg/day, and canagliflozin should not exceed 25 mg/day. Recent guidelines do not advocate initiating SGLT2is in patients receiving dialysis with heart failure and recommend discontinuation if the patient is off dialysis.

A recent trial involving 125 patients with eGFRs below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² and stage 5 dialysis (G5D) demonstrated the effectiveness of dapagliflozin and the non-adenosine nature of the treatment. The data provide solid evidence supporting the use of SGLT2is in patients on dialysis. Three phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating SGLT2is, aimed at understanding their impact on kidney survival, cardiovascular events, and mortality, were reviewed to assess benefits for patient management. The nephrology society has modified recommendations for patients with a GFR below 30 ml/min/1.73 m² regarding high doses of the tested SGLT2is. Multidisciplinary stewardship should be applied when using SGLT2is in G5D patients due to patient preferences, the presence of hyperkalemia, fluid restrictions, and comorbidities. Experts advise administering SGLT2is at least 2 h post-dialysis and adjusting doses based on weekly drug clearance.

Abstract

Background

Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have shown that sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Whether these benefits extend to CKD patients without type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease is unknown. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial (NCT03036150) will assess the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients with CKD with and without diabetes.

Methods

DAPA-CKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial in which ∼4300 patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion will be enrolled. The vast majority will be receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor at enrolment.

Results

After a screening assessment, eligible patients with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 200 mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 are randomly assigned to placebo or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day. Enrolment is monitored to ensure that at least 30% of patients do not have diabetes and that no more than 10% have an eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The primary endpoint is a composite of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage renal disease, renal death or cardiovascular death. The trial will conclude when 681 primary renal events have occurred, providing 90% power to detect a 22% relative risk reduction (α level of 0.05).

Conclusion

DAPA-CKD will determine whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to guideline-recommended therapies, safely reduces the rate of renal and cardiovascular events in patients across multiple CKD stages with and without diabetes.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors represent a major step in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with evidence from several large randomised clinical trials and collaborative meta-analyses indicating that this medication class reduces progression of kidney disease and kidney failure in a broad range of people with CKD irrespective of diabetes (DM) status, level of kidney function, or primary kidney diagnosis. Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to improve outcomes in people with diabetes with high cardiovascular risk, and in people with heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction.

In addition to well-established efficacy, SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to be safe, with few associated risks, which include mycotic infections, lower limb amputations and ketoacidosis. Importantly, serious side effects are rare, particularly among people without diabetes. A recent meta-analysis assessing the balance of risk and benefit in CKD indicates that the absolute benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition in terms of kidney disease progression, cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, and acute kidney injury substantially outweigh any associated risks in the studied populations (Fig. 1).

Given these findings, there is a need to provide practical and pragmatic guidance for the use of this class of medication to facilitate rapid, effective and safe implementation in clinical practice. In 2021, the UK Kidney Association (UKKA) Clinical Practice Guideline: SGLT-2 Inhibition in Adults with Kidney Disease Working Group published a Clinical Practice Guideline on the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in adults with kidney disease in order to facilitate this, with emphasis on relevant large-scale randomised evidence for the efficacy and safety of SGLT-2 inhibition. This 2023 guideline presents updated Recommendations in light of new evidence from the recent DELIVER and EMPA-KIDNEY trials. This guideline's aims were to: (i) provide guidance on use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with CKD, focusing on the potential to modify risk of kidney disease progression; and (ii) support safe implementation of SGLT-2 inhibitors into clinical practice in people with CKD.

### SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD: are they really effective in all patients? [^114Lhouj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of numerous large clinical trials has provided robust evidence that Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors significantly delay the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and reduce cardiovascular events in patients with CKD, regardless of diabetes status. These findings have driven the regulatory approval of SGLT2 inhibitors with broad indications for adult CKD, not including CKD patients with polycystic kidney disease. However, the universal applicability of these benefits remains uncertain. Do these benefits extend uniformly to all CKD patients, or are there other subpopulations where efficacy is limited or uncertain?

Importance

No large randomized clinical trial has directly compared empagliflozin with dapagliflozin, leaving their comparative effectiveness regarding kidney outcomes unknown.

Objective

To compare kidney outcomes between initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected Danish health care data to compare initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who received antihyperglycemic treatment between June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to August 2024. Persons were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first.

Exposure

Initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a competing event.

Results

A total of 32 819 individuals who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and 17 464 with dapagliflozin were included (median [IQR] age, 63 [54–71] years; 18 872 female individuals [37.5%]; median [IQR] estimated glomerular filtration rate, 88 [73–104] mL/min/1.73 m2). After weighting, all measured covariates were well balanced between the groups. In intention-to-treat analyses, people who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin exhibited comparable 6-year risks of acute kidney injury (18.2% vs 18.5%; risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.06), chronic kidney disease stages G3 to G5 (11.8% vs 12.1%; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89–1.05), chronic kidney disease stage A2 or A3 (14.8% vs 14.3%; risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93–1.15), and progression of chronic kidney disease (5.3% vs 5.7%; risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.56–1.58). The primary analyses were supported by corresponding per-protocol analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that people with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin had comparable long-term kidney outcomes.

### Empagliflozin and cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across KDIGO risk categories: analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial [^112V86o4]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG Outcome), empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care, significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular death by 38%, hospitalization for heart failure by 35%, and incident or worsening nephropathy by 39% compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Using EMPA-REG Outcome data, we assessed whether the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD classification had an influence on the treatment effect of empagliflozin.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Patients with type 2 diabetes, established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and eGFR ≥ 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. Post hoc, we analyzed cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, and safety, using the two-dimensional KDIGO classification framework.

Results

Of 6952 patients with baseline eGFR and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio values, 47%, 29%, 15%, and 8% were classified into low, moderately increased, high, and very high KDIGO risk categories, respectively. Empagliflozin showed consistent risk reductions across KDIGO categories for cardiovascular outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.26 to 0.85) and kidney outcomes (P values for treatment by subgroup interactions ranged from 0.16 to 0.60). In all KDIGO risk categories, placebo and empagliflozin had similar adverse event rates, the notable exception being genital infection events, which were more common with empagliflozin for each category.

Conclusions

The observed effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were consistent across the KDIGO risk categories, indicating that the effect of treatment benefit of empagliflozin was unaffected by baseline CKD status.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114xfYwD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

2.1 Testing Prior to Initiation of TRIJARDY XR

Assess renal function before initiating TRIJARDY XR and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4)].
Assess volume status. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating TRIJARDY XR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage and Administration

Individualize the starting dosage of TRIJARDY XR based on the patient's current regimen:
In patients on metformin HCl, with or without linagliptin, switch to TRIJARDY XR containing a similar total daily dosage of metformin HCl and a total daily dosage of empagliflozin 10 mg and linagliptin 5 mg;
In patients on metformin HCl and any regimen containing empagliflozin, with or without linagliptin, switch to TRIJARDY XR containing a similar total daily dosage of metformin HCl, the same total daily dosage of empagliflozin and linagliptin 5 mg.
Monitor effectiveness and tolerability, and adjust dosing as appropriate, not to exceed the maximum recommended daily dosage of empagliflozin 25 mg, linagliptin 5 mg and metformin HCl 2,000 mg.
Take TRIJARDY XR orally, once daily with a meal in the morning.
Take TRIJARDY XR 10 mg/5 mg/1,000 mg or TRIJARDY XR 25 mg/5 mg/1,000 mg as a single tablet once daily.
Take TRIJARDY XR 5 mg/2.5 mg/1,000 mg or TRIJARDY XR 12.5 mg/2.5 mg/1,000 mg as two tablets together once daily.
Swallow TRIJARDY XR tablets whole. Do not split, crush, dissolve, or chew.

2.3 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment

Initiation of TRIJARDY XR is not recommended in patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, due to the metformin component.
TRIJARDY XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2or in patients on dialysis [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Rationale and protocol of the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized controlled trial [^114r6EXh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have shown that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Whether these benefits extend to CKD patients without type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease is unknown. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial (NCT03036150) will assess the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients with CKD with and without diabetes.

Methods

DAPA-CKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial in which ∼4300 patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion will be enrolled. The vast majority will be receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor at enrolment.

Results

After a screening assessment, eligible patients with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 200mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 and 75mL/min/1.73m2 are randomly assigned to placebo or dapagliflozin 10mg/day. Enrolment is monitored to ensure that at least 30% of patients do not have diabetes and that no more than 10% have an eGFR > 60mL/min/1.73m2. The primary endpoint is a composite of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage renal disease, renal death or cardiovascular death. The trial will conclude when 681 primary renal events have occurred, providing 90% power to detect a 22% relative risk reduction (α level of 0.05).

Conclusion

DAPA-CKD will determine whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to guideline-recommended therapies, safely reduces the rate of renal and cardiovascular events in patients across multiple CKD stages with and without diabetes.

### Empagliflozin reduces risk of hospitalization in patients with chronic kidney disease in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^113mjF6e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases hospitalization risk. In the randomized, phase III, EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin significantly reduced risk of all-cause hospitalizations (ACH; first and recurrent) vs placebo. This post hoc analysis of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial examines the burden of ACH in CKD and the effects of empagliflozin on ACH.

Methods

Participants with CKD (n = 6609) were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Reasons for hospitalizations were derived from adverse events leading to hospitalization, assessed by system organ class.

Findings

Overall, 1995 participants (1035 placebo, 960 empagliflozin) had ≥ 1 ACH (1895 ACH in placebo and 1611 in the empagliflozin 10-mg groups). The estimated mortality rate after first hospitalization in participants with ≥ 1 hospitalization was 12% after 1 year and 18% after 2 years, and risk of death was ∼10 times higher vs those without (hazard ratio [HR] 9.53; 95% confidence interval, 7.18–12.64; P < 0.0001). The most common reasons for hospitalization were infections and infestations, surgical and medical procedures, investigations, cardiac disorders, renal and urinary disorders, and metabolic disorders. Risk of ACH was significantly reduced for empagliflozin vs placebo (HR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.78–0.95, P = 0.003). This was consistent regardless of baseline diabetes status, estimated glomerular filtration rate, or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Mean cumulative incidence of ACH in empagliflozin and placebo groups diverged shortly after randomization and separated further over time. Risk of hospital admissions from cardiovascular (CV), renal, or metabolic conditions was significantly lower with empagliflozin vs placebo (P < 0.05).

Implications

Treatment with empagliflozin significantly reduced risk of ACH, including those attributed to CV, renal, or metabolic conditions.

### Treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in persons with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^114DdjW2]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The main adverse effect of RAS inhibitor therapy is hyperkalemia, particularly in the advanced stages of disease. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 20 studies covering 47,122 participants reported that hyperkalemia is twice as common (risk ratio 2.03; 95% CI 1.67–2.48) in participants on drugs that act on the RAS compared with the control group. In most individuals, the clinical benefit of RAS inhibition outweighs the risk of hyperkalemia. Moreover, the risk can be managed without the need to discontinue therapy with RAS inhibitors by using strategies such as reducing potassium intake or prescribing loop diuretics and potassium binders, and the risk of hyperkalemia is lower in people on SGLT2 inhibitors.

SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption by kidney proximal tubular cells, by their action on SGLT2, a sodium‐coupled glucose transporter, which is upregulated in diabetes.

Data from randomized controlled trials (CREDENCE, SCORED, DAPA‐CKD, and EMPA‐KIDNEY) demonstrate improvements in cardiorenal outcomes following SGLT2‐inhibitor treatment in diabetic kidney disease (and non‐diabetic CKD).

CREDENCE (NCT02065791) was a double‐blind, randomized trial evaluating the effects of canagliflozin on kidney and CV outcomes in participants with T2D and albuminuric CKD who were randomized to receive canagliflozin or placebo in addition to maximally tolerated/clinically appropriate RAS blockade. The primary endpoint was a composite kidney outcome, including end‐stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained eGFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from kidney or CV causes. In participants receiving canagliflozin, the relative risk of the composite kidney outcome was 30% lower compared with the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient‐years, respectively (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59–0.82). The risk of CV death, MI, or stroke was also lowered (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67–0.95). In participants with a history of CVD, the relative risk of the composite kidney outcome was 30% lower compared with the placebo group (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56–0.88). The event rates per 1000 patient‐years were 46.8 and 65.1 in the canagliflozin and placebo arm, respectively.

### Effects of empagliflozin on quality of life and healthcare use and costs in chronic kidney disease: a health economic analysis of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^116G6Zrj]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In EMPA-KIDNEY, 2 years of treatment with empagliflozin led to a small but measurable improvement in QALYs and lower costs for hospital admissions, concomitant medications and ESKD management. These cost savings offset about three quarters of the cost of empagliflozin during the median 2 years follow-up in the active trial. The further reductions in ESKD cost, observed during the 2 years post-trial follow-up period, led to net total healthcare cost savings and high probability of cost-effectiveness over 4 years. The relative effects of empagliflozin on costs of hospital admissions, medications and ESKD management were similar across categories of participants including by diabetes status, level of kidney function and albuminuria, and kidney failure risk, with larger total healthcare cost savings over 4 years estimated in categories at higher risk of CKD progression.

A unique feature of these analyses is the direct assessment of randomised effects of about 2 years of empagliflozin on quality-of-life-adjusted survival and healthcare costs over 2 years and costs of ESKD management over 4 years. The availability of post-trial follow-up data in EMPA-KIDNEY allowed us to more fully assess the effect of empagliflozin on the risk of progression to, and costs of, ESKD across different categories of patients with CKD. Our findings indicate that empagliflozin reduced ESKD costs in all categories of patients with CKD regardless of diabetes status, level of albuminuria or kidney function, or primary kidney diagnosis, with larger effects among those at greater risk of progression to ESKD. The consistency of effects across categories of patients indicate that empagliflozin is likely to confer benefits also among patients with CKD without albuminuria although it may take somewhat longer for benefits to emerge.

### Empagliflozin in kidney transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease G3a-4 and metabolic syndrome: five Japanese cases [^112WxaU2]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in non-transplanted patients, administration of SGLT2 inhibitors to renal transplant patients remains controversial. Shivaswamy et al. have expressed concerns about potential genitourinary infections and decreased renal function related to dehydration. They suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors should be avoided in renal transplant recipients until their safety is better established. The main findings of the SGLT2 inhibitor trials in KTR we searched are summarized in Table 3. These 5 studies explored the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in renal transplant recipients with CKD stage 1–3b, where renal function was relatively preserved. However, results from several other reports suggest SGLT2 inhibitors may also be useful in patients with more severe renal damage. Although SGLT inhibitors were previously thought to be ineffective in advanced CKD patients, there is increasing evidence showing their efficacy. Yamout et al. compared 338 patients receiving canagliflozin at 100 mg/day and 365 patients receiving 300 mg/day with 382 patients receiving placebo. In each group the eGFR averaged about 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and both doses significantly decreased HbA1c, body weight and systolic blood pressure as compared to placebo. In 5 other studies, SGLT2 inhibitors were reported to have similar effects in patients with stage 3–4 CKD.

In case 3 in the present study, the patient had an eGFR of 25.9 ml/min/1.73m 2 (CKD stage 4) before empagliflozin administration, and no useful effect of this drug was observed. In this case, the excretion of urinary sugar induced by empagliflozin was considered to be insufficient due to advanced renal dysfunction, and no good effect was obtained. In the other 4 cases, however, empagliflozin administration led to weight loss, decreased blood pressure, decreased ALT or γ-GTP, decreased HbA1c, and/or decreased UACR. In case 2, the patient exhibited decreases in both ALT and γ-GTP after empagliflozin administration. We suggest that these decreases in ALT and γ-GTP were due to improvement in this patient's fatty liver disease.

### Analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOMEtrial indicates empagliflozin may assist in preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics [^114YCBZj]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) disease, empagliflozin (EMPA) decreased progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely via a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. Due to prevalent comorbidities, such as hypertension and albuminuria, patients often receive other agents that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used by some individuals. In this exploratory, non-prespecified analysis, we investigated whether the kidney benefits of EMPA are altered in individuals already using the medications in these categories. In the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME ®) trial, 7020 patients were essentially equally randomized to EMPA 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo added to their standard care. Differences in risk of incident or worsening nephropathy for pooled EMPA vs placebo across subgroups by baseline background medications (to which patients were not randomized) were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Risk reductions in incident or worsening nephropathy with EMPA were consistent across medication subgroups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect. As a representative example, the risk for acute renal failure was overall slightly increased in patients using ACEi/ARBs in all groups (placebo, EMPA 10 mg or EMPA 25 mg) but incidence rates were numerically lower in those assigned to EMPA. Similar patterns were observed for other medications included in this analysis. Thus, EMPA may assist to prevent CKD progression in patients with T2DM with CV disease, irrespective of common background medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, and without increasing acute renal adverse events.

SGLT‐2 inhibitor CVOTs: renal outcomes in T2D patients without DKD

The EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial included patients (N = 7034) with an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or higher at screening, and 26% of patients had renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) at baseline. 35, 81 Microalbuminuria was reported in 29% and macroalbuminuria in 11% of patients. Following the initiation of treatment with empagliflozin, a transient but significant decline in eGFR was observed at week 4 compared with placebo (mean ± SE change from baseline [mL/min/1.73 m 2]: −0.62 ± 0.04 in the 10 mg group, −0.82 ± 0.04 in the 25 mg group and +0.01 ± 0.04 in the placebo group; P < .001 for both comparisons). However, during long‐term treatment from week 4 to end of study, eGFR remained stable in the empagliflozin compared with the placebo group, where there was a steady decline in the eGFR (mean ± SE annual rate of decline [mL/min/1.73 m 2]: −0.19 ± 0.11 in both 10 and 25 mg groups vs. −1.67 ± 0.13 in the placebo group; P < .001 for both comparisons). The risk of doubling of serum creatinine was 44% lower in the empagliflozin group than placebo (HR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.39‐0.79; P < .001). 81 The relative risk of incident or worsening nephropathy (defined as progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine level, initiation of renal‐replacement therapy or death from renal disease) was 39% lower in the empagliflozin compared with the placebo group (HR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.53‐0.70; P < .001). In addition, empagliflozin reduced progression to macroalbuminuria by 38% (HR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.54‐0.72; P < .001) and the risk of renal‐replacement therapy by 55% (HR 0.45, 95% CI, 0.21‐0.75; P < .001). There was no significant difference between the empagliflozin and placebo groups for the risk of incident albuminuria in patients with normal albuminuria. 81

### Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes [^116BsyB6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.

Results

Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P < 0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% lower relative risk in the empagliflozin group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of incident albuminuria. The adverse-event profile of empagliflozin in patients with impaired kidney function at baseline was similar to that reported in the overall trial population.

Conclusions

In patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin was associated with slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events than was placebo when added to standard care.

### The treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic kidney disease: what to expect from new oral hypoglycemic agents [^113wQjkD]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people have chronic kidney disease (CKD), whose most common causes include hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes. About 40% of patients with diabetes develop CKD and intensive blood glucose control through pharmacological intervention can delay CKD progression. Standard therapies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus include metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. While these drugs have an important role in the management of type 2 diabetes, only the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone can be used across the spectrum of CKD (stages 2–5) and without dose adjustment. Newer therapies, particularly dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, are increasingly being used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, a major consideration is whether these newer therapies can also be used safely and effectively across the spectrum of renal impairment.

### EMPA-REG OUTCOME: the nephrologist's point of view [^114e7uug]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have renoprotective effects, as demonstrated by the renal analyses from clinical trials including Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients-Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), CANagliflozin Treatment And Trial Analysis versus SUlphonylurea (CANTATA-SU), and the dapagliflozin renal study. The potential mechanisms responsible are likely multifactorial, and direct renovascular and hemodynamic effects are postulated to play a central role. This report reviews the renal outcomes data from key SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials, discusses the hypotheses for SGLT2 inhibitor-associated renoprotection, and considers the main renal safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) — cardiorenal effects and prioritization — are summarized, noting that SGLT2is "continue to exert their renal protective benefit for those with low eGFRs (eg, < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2)" and "modestly increase LDL-C levels (4 to 8 mg/dL)". Cardiovascular outcome trials report "Empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated reduction in MACE in CVOTs; empagliflozin also demonstrated decreased CV death and all-cause mortality" and "Empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin have shown a decrease in hospitalization for HF in their CVOTs". Regulatory indications include that "the FDA has given canagliflozin an indication to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with T2D and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria" and "Dapagliflozin based on the DAPA-CKD RCT has received an FDA indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, and hospitalization for HF in adults with CKD at risk of progression". Consequently, "individuals with T2D at significant risk for or with established ASCVD, HF, and/or CKD should be treated with a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven benefit for the individual's specific conditions".

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated.

Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### Effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes: an individual participant-level meta-analysis [^114s7GMb]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains about effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition on kidney outcomes in individuals with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease (eg, low albuminuria) and those at risk of large acute estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dips on initiation of such treatment. We aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on a range of kidney outcomes in these population subtypes.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, we used individual-level data from 23340 participants in four large placebo-controlled trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY) to assess the effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes. We then assessed whether effects varied by predicted size of the acute eGFR dip on treatment initiation or among other key population subtypes using tests for heterogeneity and trend. The individual-level data were requested from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany).

Findings

Compared with placebo, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of a marker of acute kidney injury (a ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine in consecutive follow-up samples) by 20% (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·72–0·88]; 1573 outcomes), acute kidney injury adverse events by 27% (0·73 [0·63–0·85]; 694 outcomes), a categorical chronic kidney disease progression outcome by 30% (0·70 [0·63–0·78]; 1403 outcomes), and kidney failure by 34% (0·66 [0·55–0·79]; 490 outcomes). Empagliflozin slowed a chronic annual rate of eGFR decline by 64% (95% CI 59–69) and off-treatment dip-free slope-a post-hoc outcome using randomisation and off-treatment eGFR values available in a subset of 10630 participants-by 64% (54–73). These kidney benefits were similar in subgroups divided by predicted size of acute eGFR dip, and were present irrespective of diabetes or heart failure status, level of kidney function, or albuminuria.

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibition reduces risk of acute and chronic kidney outcomes irrespective of the size of the acute dip in eGFR. Kidney benefits are evident irrespective of diabetes status, heart failure status, primary cause of kidney disease, and markers of severity of these diseases.

### Empagliflozin improves kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure [^112MVzQg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background In EMPA-REG OUTCOME (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. Post hoc, we evaluated empagliflozin on kidney outcomes in patients with or without heart failure (HF). Methods and Results Individuals were randomized to empagliflozin 10 mg, 25 mg, or placebo. Prespecified analyses by baseline HF status included risk of incident or worsening nephropathy and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope analyses. Cox proportional hazards models assessed consistency of treatment effect across subgroups. Safety evaluations included kidney-related adverse events. At baseline, 244 (10.5%) and 462 (9.9%) patients had HF in the placebo and empagliflozin groups, respectively. Overall, the incidence of kidney outcome events was numerically higher in patients with than without HF. In the HF group, empagliflozin reduced risk of incident or worsening nephropathy or cardiovascular death by 43% (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42–0.77]) and progression to macroalbuminuria by 50% (hazard ratio, 0.50 [0.33–0.75]). After an initial transient decrease, estimated glomerular filtration rate stabilized over time with empagliflozin but gradually declined with placebo. Kidney effects in patients with HF were consistent with those in the overall study population (all P values for interaction > 0.05). Across groups, the incidence rate of kidney-related adverse events/100 patient-years was higher in patients with than without HF; however, overall rates were comparable between groups. Conclusions These findings from EMPA-REG OUTCOME support the hypothesis that empagliflozin could reduce the risk of clinically relevant kidney events and may slow progression of chronic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus regardless of HF status.

### Dual-faced guardians: SGLT2 inhibitors' kidney protection and health challenges: a position statement by kasralainy nephrology group (KANG) [^117Uvee8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors exhibit cardiovascular benefits, including reduced heart failure risk and improved outcomes in patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. Expanding evidence supports their use in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD, heart failure, and potentially type 1 diabetes.

Current indications for SGLT2 inhibitors include CKD, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Emerging evidence indicates these drugs are also prescribed to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Approved SGLT2 inhibitors include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin. The latter is the first dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor and is approved in Europe for both type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM.

As a result, SGLT2 inhibitors have become indispensable in managing CKD, DKD, and associated cardiovascular risks, underscoring their growing importance in nephrology. However, careful patient selection, monitoring, and management of potential side effects are essential.

Review Points.

Verify the latest clinical guidelines regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in nephrology.
Include recent trial data and ensure that the draft incorporates the most current evidence.
Ensure accuracy in recommended dose adjustments and monitoring protocols for patients with varying levels of kidney function.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease, with and without other cardiovascular medications: DAPA-CKD trial [^113LztJ5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

In the DAPA‐CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease)) trial, the sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular events and prolonged survival in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without type 2 diabetes. Similar results had been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial, in which canagliflozin significantly reduced the risks of progressive kidney disease and major cardiovascular events but not cardiovascular mortality. Previous studies with these and other SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits (EMPA‐REG (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome), DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58), and CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study).

Patients included in these and other cardiovascular trials are typically treated with a variety of concomitant medications, many of which are indicated either for control of hypertension or for prevention or treatment of other cardiovascular conditions (eg, hypercholesterolemia, coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation). In DAPA‐CKD and other trials, maximally tolerated doses of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors were required by protocol.

The DAPA‐CKD trial required that all patients be treated with standard of care (regional guideline–concordant) therapies for kidney, cardiovascular, and other conditions unless contraindicated. The protocol itself did not mandate specific drugs or doses, with the exception of the RAAS inhibitors, as previously described.

In this prespecified analysis of the DAPA‐CKD trial, we aimed to examine whether baseline use of cardiovascular medications modified the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular end points and on safety in patients with CKD and albuminuria.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 30–40% of all patients with diabetes also have chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both diabetes and CKD account for an increased risk of premature mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and end-stage kidney failure. Few effective therapies are available for such patients and novel therapeutic options aimed at improving clinical outcomes in this high-risk population are therefore highly desirable.

Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are anti-diabetes drugs that block the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the S1 segment of the proximal tubule, thereby augmenting urinary glucose and sodium excretion. Inhibition of urinary glucose reabsorption results in a reduction in plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Inhibition of sodium reabsorption, on the other hand, leads to increased delivery of sodium to the macula densa, which stimulates tubuloglomerular feedback and afferent arterial vasoconstriction and reduces glomerular hyperfiltration. This is clinically manifested as an acute reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria. The GFR decline is completely reversible after drug discontinuation.

Only a few clinical studies have explored the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with impaired kidney function. These studies have predominantly included patients with Stage 3 CKD [estimated GFR (eGFR) 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m 2], and have demonstrated that the glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in these patients is diminished compared with patients with preserved kidney function. This attenuated hypoglycemic action is most likely a result of reduced glucose filtration. Whether SGLT2 inhibitors are effective and safe in patients with more severely impaired kidney function (i.e. Stages 3b and 4 CKD, characterized by an eGFR of 15–45 mL/min/1.73m 2) is not fully known. We therefore performed a pooled analysis of multiple phase 3 clinical trials to characterize the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes with Stages 3b and 4 CKD.

### Effects of empagliflozin on quality of life and healthcare use and costs in chronic kidney disease: a health economic analysis of the EMPA-KIDNEY trial [^111ZyX8c]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Estimated effects of 2 years treatment with empagliflozin on participants' quality-adjusted life years and healthcare use and costs in EMPA-KIDNEY.

Fig. 1
Probability of 2 years treatment with empagliflozin being cost-effective over 2 and 4 years. The light blue and dark blue solid lines represent the probability of 2 years treatment with empagliflozin being cost-effective over 2 years or 4 years, respectively, across different willingness to pay thresholds. Probabilities of empagliflozin being cost-effective over 2 years were 43% and 61% and over 4 years were 91% and 94% at willingness to pay thresholds of £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY gained (grey and black dashed lines), respectively. ESKD = end-stage kidney disease (i.e. maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation); QALY = quality-adjusted life year.

Over the 2 year post-trial period, per participant originally allocation to empagliflozin there were fewer days in ESKD (−11, −20 to −2) and lower ESKD costs (−£842, −1441 to −242) (Table 2). Overall, adding these cost savings from reduced progression to ESKD to the effects within 2 years active-trial period, allocation to empagliflozin treatment for 2 years led to per participant net total healthcare costs of −£593 (−1384 to 198) over 4 years, resulting in 91% to 94% probability of being cost-effective at thresholds of £20,000 to £30,000 per QALY gained (Table 2, Fig. 1, Figure S2).

Across categories of participants, the proportional effects of allocation to empagliflozin on QoL, costs of hospital admissions, concomitant medications, and ESKD management were similar across categories of participants (Tables S6–S10). Using the overall proportional effects of allocation to empagliflozin, similar net absolute effects of allocation to empagliflozin were estimated over the 2 years active-trial period in key categories of participant, including those with and without diabetes, and across the spectrum of albuminuria, eGFR and kidney failure risk (Table S11). Adding the 2 years post-trial ESKD costs, larger net total healthcare cost savings were estimated among participants at higher risk of CKD progression (Fig. 2, Figure S3). Overall, 2 years of treatment with empagliflozin was highly cost-effective in most categories of participants over 4 years of follow-up in EMPA-KIDNEY (Figure S4).
