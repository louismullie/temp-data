## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the lengths of the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid with bases AD = 2 and BC = 1, and lateral sides AB = CD = 1. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry and whether the trapezoid is isosceles. Then, I should verify the height using the Pythagorean theorem. Next, I will apply the law of cosines in triangles ABD and ABC to find the diagonals. Finally, I should double-check the results with an alternative approach or by symmetry arguments to ensure consistency.

> Let me first confirm the shape and notation. The trapezoid ABCD has AD = 2 as the longer base, BC = 1 as the shorter base, and AB = CD = 1 as the non-parallel sides, which makes it an isosceles trapezoid; this symmetry will be useful later, so I should keep that in mind as I proceed [^notfound].

> I need to find the height h. Let me drop perpendiculars from B and C to AD, meeting AD at P and Q respectively; then PQ = BC = 1, and AP = QD = (AD − BC)/2 = (2 − 1)/2 = 0.5. Now, in right triangle ABP, I can apply the Pythagorean theorem: AB² = AP² + h², so 1² = 0.5² + h², which gives h² = 1 − 0.25 = 0.75 and h = √0.75 = √3/2. Wait, let me verify that arithmetic: 1 − 0.25 is indeed 0.75, and √0.75 simplifies to √3/2, so the height is √3/2 units [^notfound].

> Next, I should find diagonal AC. I will use the law of cosines in triangle ABC. First, I need angle B. Because the trapezoid is isosceles, base angles at A and D are equal; let me call each base angle θ. In right triangle ABP, cos θ = AP/AB = 0.5/1 = 0.5, so θ = 60°. Hold on, I should verify that this angle makes sense geometrically; with base angles of 60°, the figure is consistent with the given side lengths, so I can proceed. Now, in triangle ABC, angle ABC is 180° − θ = 120°, so by the law of cosines: AC² = AB² + BC² − 2·AB·BC·cos(120°) = 1² + 1² − 2·1·1·(−0.5) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, hence AC = √3 [^notfound].

> I will now examine diagonal BD. By symmetry, the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are equal, so BD should equal AC. But wait, let me verify this explicitly rather than assume. Using triangle ABD, angle A is θ = 60°, AD = 2, and AB = 1; applying the law of cosines: BD² = AB² + AD² − 2·AB·AD·cos(60°) = 1² + 2² − 2·1·2·0.5 = 1 + 4 − 2 = 3, so BD = √3 as well. This confirms the symmetry argument and reassures me that both diagonals are indeed equal [^notfound].

> Alternative check: I could also compute BD using the height and the horizontal offset. In right triangle formed by projecting B onto AD, the horizontal leg is AP + AD − AP = 1.5 and the vertical leg is h = √3/2, so BD² = (√3/2)² + (1.5)² = 0.75 + 2.25 = 3, again yielding BD = √3. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the horizontal leg was simply AD = 2, but that would ignore the offset; correcting that, the horizontal span from B's projection to D is 1.5, which gives the same result, so the consistency holds [^notfound].

> Final answer: Both diagonals AC and BD are equal to √3. I should double-check that this aligns with the earlier steps; yes, both independent approaches give √3, so I can conclude confidently that each diagonal is √3 units long [^notfound].

The diagonals of trapezoid ABCD are both **√3**. This is found by dropping perpendiculars from B and C to AD, creating right triangles with legs 0.5 and height √3/2, then applying the Pythagorean theorem to compute each diagonal as √(1.5² + (√3/2)²) = √3.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: draw the trapezoid and identify key elements

Draw trapezoid ABCD with AD = 2 (longer base), BC = 1 (shorter base), and AB = CD = 1 (lateral sides). Drop perpendiculars from B and C to AD, meeting AD at P and Q respectively. This divides AD into three segments: AP, PQ, and QD, where PQ = BC = 1 and AP = QD = (AD − PQ)/2 = (2 − 1)/2 = 0.5.

---

### Step 2: calculate the height of the trapezoid

In right triangle ABP, AB = 1 (hypotenuse) and AP = 0.5 (one leg). Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height h:

h = √[AB² − AP²] = √[1² − 0.5²] = √0.75 = [√3/2]

---

### Step 3: calculate the length of diagonal AC

Diagonal AC forms the hypotenuse of right triangle AQC, with AQ = AP + PQ = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5 and CQ = h = √3/2. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:

AC = √[AQ² + CQ²] = √[1.5² + ([√3/2])²] = √[2.25 + 0.75] = √3

---

### Step 4: calculate the length of diagonal BD

By symmetry, diagonal BD has the same length as AC. Alternatively, compute BD using right triangle BPD, with BP = h = √3/2 and PD = PQ + QD = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5:

BD = √[BP² + PD²] = √[([√3/2])² + 1.5²] = √[0.75 + 2.25] = √3

---

## Final answer

Both diagonals of trapezoid ABCD are **√3**.

Fig. 1
Example trial sequences.

During the first 150 training trials, participants selected from either the AB or the CD pair. Option labels were randomized (e.g. Option S could correspond to A, B, C, or D in the reward schedule). The total virtual points earned were displayed at the top of the screen. After each selection, participants received feedback on the number of points gained. In the subsequent 100 transfer trials, participants chose from the remaining four option combinations (i.e. 25 trials for each) — CA, BD, AD, and CB — without cumulative point displays or feedback. They were instructed to rely on knowledge acquired during the training phase to maximize their points.

Table 1
Reward Structure

N(M, SD) indicates continuous normal distributions of rewards for each option. M is the mean and SD is the standard deviation. "Base-rate" indicates how frequently each choice pair is presented during training, relative to the other choice pair. For example, 2:1 means the first pair is presented twice as often as the second pair.

In the training phase, participants made choices between option A versus option B, or option C vs option D. There were 100 AB trials, and 50 CD trials, with each trial type randomly distributed over the 150 training trials. Rewards were centered at each deck's mean value (A = 0.65, B = 0.35, C = 0.75, D = 0.25). For the HV condition, rewards were normally distributed with the standard deviation mirroring that of a binomial distribution. For decks A and B, this was, and for C and D this was. For the MV condition, the standard deviation in rewards was half that of the HV condition (i.e.24 for AB;.22 for CD), and the LV condition was a quarter of those in the HV condition (i.e. 0.12 for AB;.11 for CD)

After training, participants were told they would now choose between different option pairs. Transfer test trials included 25 of each AC, AD, BC and BD trials, in random order. No feedback was provided for choices in the test phase.

This study was not preregistered; however, our experiment was carefully designed and provided clear predictions regarding the expected direction of the effects. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.

### Glass-cutting medical images via a mechanical image segmentation method based on crack propagation [^b06e7ef0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Initial crack

In each partial model, we set an initial crack. The initial crack will grow along grooves under external load until reaching object boundaries. For the first local model, the initial crack needs to be specified. After completing crack propagation in the current region, the next local model can be determined according to the position and the orientation of the crack. The new area will partially overlap the old one so that it can contain the end portion of the crack in the previous area as the initial crack.

The initial crack in the first local model can be provided either manually or automatically (Fig. 10b). In the manual method (top half of Fig. 10b), one needs only to choose a short line a few pixels in length along the target boundary as the position of the initial crack in the mechanical model. This selection is simple and accurate because the target boundary is generally very clear in such a location and there is an obvious groove corresponding to the target boundary in the mechanical model. For the automatic method (bottom half of Fig. 10b), the initial crack can be generated by the following procedure: define the side length of square ABCD representing the local image to be 2 L. The target boundary intersects with the two parallel edges AD and BC. Draw a straight line starting from P M1, the midpoint of the side AB, and passing through P M2, the midpoint of the side DC, ending at the point O. The distance from P M1 to O is N times the length of AB (N > 1). Therefore, a triangle AOB is formed with angle at point O equal to φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N)). Dividing φ by an integer m defines the angle increment, Δ φ = 2 arctan(1/(2 N))/ m. Starting at line OA, and sweeping toward line OB by incrementing the angle by Δ φ each iteration, the ray with angle φ i = i Δ φ (i = 0, 1, 2,…) will intersect the target boundary at the point P i in this local image area. Because the grayscale value of the pixels at the target boundary changes significantly, an edge-detection operator, such as the Canny edge detector, can easily identify the coordinates of the points P i. After detecting several boundary points, the initial crack of the first local model can be automatically formed by connecting these points to form a small line segment.

Figure 2
Four categories of polymorphism markers that can be used in genetic study in clonal F 1 populations. In category I or ABCD, each marker shows four identifiable alleles between the two clonal parents, represented by A, B, C, and D (see the four different colors in Figure 1). In the clonal population, four genotypes can be identified, represented by AC, AD, BC, and BD. In category II or A = B, one allele can be seen in the female parent and two alleles can be seen in male parent. In the clonal population, only two genotypes can be identified, represented by XC and XD, where X can be either A or B. In category III or C = D, two alleles can be seen in the female parent and one allele can be seen in male parent. The two identifiable genotypes in the clonal population are represented by AX and BX, where X can be either C or D. In category IV or AB = CD, both clonal parents show the same two heterozygous genotype. The two alleles in parents are represented by A and B, and three genotypes in their progenies are represented by AA, AB, and BB.

Category I (or ABCD) represents the case of fully informative markers. By fully informative, we mean the four genotypes at one locus in progenies can be clearly identified. In other words, the two alleles in any clonal progeny can be traced back to its female and male parents (Figure 2). For category I markers, two alleles can be identified in either parent. The four genotypes in progenies are coded as AC, AD, BC, and BD (Figure 2). When no distortion occurs, the four genotypes will follow the Mendelian ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, it is possible that one female allele is the same as one male allele. For example, when allele A is equal to allele C at a marker locus, there is no problem assigning the two alleles in a progeny to the two parents. This marker is still classified as category I.

In addition to characterizing the kinematics, quantifying the stiffness of the breathing and shearing modes is important for the application of our theory towards origami engineering. Such modal stiffness is frequently modeled via a truss model with Hookean potentials for the folding, bending, and stretching of the panels. In contrast to our theory, such truss models utilize virtual creases across the diagonals of the panels to quantify panel bending. Since our theory attempts to directly model the deflection field of the panels instead, it may be possible to equate the stiffness associated with the vertex amplitudes and the face amplitudes with scaling relations based on the dimensions of the panels and the elastic moduli of the constituent material. This could be especially valuable for the design of impact mitigating origami crash-boxes that utilize trapezoidal faces. Our vision is to extend the utility of the computational design enabled by, e.g. ref.to include the target effective elastic behavior in addition to the target shapes.

Left: baseline energy (red hatched triangle ABE), on which the inspiratory energy associated with the tidal volume (area BCDE) is added. Yellow hatched area to the right of line BC represents the inspiratory dissipated energy needed to move the gas, to overcome surface tension forces, to make the extracellular sheets slide across one another (tissue resistances), and possibly to reinflate collapsed pulmonary units. Light green hatched area on the left of line BC defines the elastic energy (trapezoid EBCD) cyclically added to the respiratory system during inspiration. Total area included in the triangle ACD is the total energy level present in the respiratory system at end inspiration. Right: energy changes during expiration. Of the total energy accumulated at end inspiration (triangle ACD), the area of the trapezoid EBCD is the energy released during expiration. The fraction of energy included in the hysteresis area (light blue hatched area) is dissipated into the respiratory system, while the remaining area (dark blue hatched area) is energy dissipated into the atmosphere through the connecting circuit. Note that whatever maneuver (as controlled expiration) reduces the hysteresis area will reduce the energy dissipated into the respiratory system (potentially dangerous?).

Controls for droplet-level sequencing biases

Biases in droplet-level sequencing can happen due to electrocoalescence of more than one RNA droplet to barcoding droplet and cross-overs between two different droplet barcodes during PCR steps. To quantify this, four 5 pL emulsions (A, B, C, and D) were prepared, each with: a distinct pair of hairpin RNA reporters at a final concentration of 5 nM, a set of 4 WXYZ ribozymes with the same IGS (gAg, gCg, gUg, and gGg) but in different proportions (total concentrations summing to 100 nM) and 1.6 µM of Z fragment. The concentrations of WXYZ in the four sets are as follows; Set A: 10 nM WXYZ (GA), 20 nM WXYZ (CA), 30 nM WXYZ (AA), 40 nM WXYZ (UA). Set B: 1 nM WXYZ (CC), 2.5 nM WXYZ (AC), 5 nM WXYZ (UC), 91.5 nM WXYZ (GC). Set C: 0.1 nM WXYZ (CU), 0.25 nM WXYZ (UU), 0.5 nM WXYZ (AU), 99.15 nM WXYZ (GU). Set D: 0.01 nM WXYZ (UG), 0.05 nM WXYZ (CG), 65 nM WXYZ (AG), 34.94 nM WXYZ (GG). The four emulsions were mixed and then singly fused to droplets containing hydrogel beads as described above to perform droplet-level sequencing. The data was processed as above using the same thresholding strategy. We quantified the bias as the proportion of droplets containing pure (A, B, C, or D) and compared to mixed populations (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, ABC, ABD, BCD, and ABCD, Supplementary Fig. 5d).

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^5b430ca6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We repeat this analysis for the nonrigid isometry which we cannot describe in terms of changes to the dihedral angles exclusively. Since this crease pattern falls within the broader set of TBO that our theory applies to, the nonrigid isometry is represented by the vertex amplitudesand the face amplitudes. We again integrate the changes in the lattice vectors and the lattice rotation matrices, then average according to our coarse-graining procedure to find:where we determine σ 1 and σ 2 directly fromandand find that the diagonal components of the strain vanish: ε φ φ = ε z z = 0. We confirm these quantities are self consistent with δ I φ z = δ I z φ = R 2 σ 1 + σ 2, δ I I φ z = δ I I z φ = R σ 1 without any adjustment to the averaging step of our coarse-graining procedure. Here, there is an apparent discrepancy regarding the units of σ 1 and σ 2: from dimensional analysis of Eqn. (7), σ 1 must have units of inverse area and σ 2 must be dimensionless. However, our calculations leading to Eqns. ((15), (16)) use a dimensionless face amplitude to simplify our calculations while the integration framework assumes the face amplitude has units of inverse length. This is in contrast to the vertex amplitudes which are always dimensionless. Introducing such a length scale, for example from the square root of the cell area, resolves the apparent discrepancy. The self consistency of our results relies on both the averaging process in our coarse-graining method and the inclusion of the Jacobian to transform from the discrete lattice coordinates to the continuous surface coordinates. While for the nonrigid isometries of parallelogram-based origami the averaging is also important, the Jacobian may be neglected because the ground states are quasi-planar.

### Segmentation strategy of de novo designed four-helical bundles expands protein oligomerization modalities for cell regulation [^7010acaf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Dimerization domains can be constructed as semi-equal (2:2) or unequal (1:3) segmentations of 4HBs. The arrangement of peptides is denoted in the names based on the number of peptide segments (e.g. AB:CD and DAB:C).

Semi-equal dimerization segmentation comprises two genetically fused peptides in each dimerization module (Fig. 1b). This reduces the number of combinations for the antiparallel 4HB due to peptide orientation, as only two combinations of antiparallel segments can be fused by a short linker, allowing the fusion of AB and DA combinations with CD and BC, respectively. We observed successful 2:2 dimerization of both AB:CD and DA:BC 2:2 arrangements (Fig. 2b), which was not significantly affected by which split luciferase domain was fused to one or the other dimerization module (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Unequal segmentation results in dimerization modules with one peptide in one and three peptides in the other dimerization domain (Fig. 1b). In this case, there are four possible combinations, regardless of the 4HB topology. Different levels of dimerization were observed among the different dimerization domains. A:BCD, BCD:A, B:CDA, and CDA:B resulted in strong; D:ABC and ABC:D in medium; and C:DAB, and DAB:C in a low reconstitution of the split luciferase (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Observed differences were unexpected, as the interaction surfaces of all four peptides were similar and expected to result in a comparable affinity. These results indicate that, with segmentation into 1:3 dimerization modules, the contribution of individual peptides to 4HB formation can be evaluated. Therefore, for this particular 4HB, three of the four theoretically possible 1:3 combinations were successful for 4HB assembly.

### Cryo-EM structure of the bacteriophage T4 portal protein assembly at near-atomic resolution [^774d8747]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Determining the most likely phylogenetic tree

The portal protein structures were compared pairwise using the HOMOLOGY program. The results were used to produce manually a table giving the sequence alignment of all four known portal structures (Supplementary Fig. 4). The number of residues that could be equivalenced between any two structures was used to evaluate all possible rooted trees that might represent the evolution of portal proteins. The different rooted trees that could represent the divergence of the portal proteins for the tailed phages A, B, C or D are shown in Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 7. The evolutionary distance between any pair of these structures can be represented by AB, AC, AD, BC, BD and CD. Two different schemes (P − r) and (100 P / r) were explored for defining evolutionary distance, where r is the number of residues that could be spatially equivalenced between any two structures and P is a constant representing the number of residues in the primordial protein. The lengths of the tree branches were represented by the six variables a, b, c, d, e and f. Six linear observational equations can be written for any one tree representing the distance between any pair of structures. For instance, the six observational equations for tree 2 (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 7) would be

The rate of evolutionary change is likely to be similar for each viral portal protein since its divergence from a common primordial structure. Thus, the distance (g) from the tree's root (R) to any one of the current structures (A, B, C or D) should be the same. Hence, four additional observational equations can be written expressing this constraint, resulting in a total of 10 observational equations to determine seven parameters. The additional equations for tree 2 are:

From these 10 observational equations, seven normal equations were calculated and solved for a, b, c, d, e, f and g. The resultant values can be substituted into the 10 observational equations to calculate values for AB, AC and so on in equations (1) and (2). An 'R' factor was then calculated between the observed and calculated distances (Dist) (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD and CD) according to

Analysis of Arc-Morph origami

We introduce the family of Arc-Morph origami, such as the example shown in Fig. 3 A. This family generalizes the Arc-Miura crease patterns presented in refs. to include the non-developable vertex geometry from the family of Morph parallelogram-based origami introduced in ref. The unit cell of these periodic crease patterns is constructed from copies of a base vertex that is parameterized by the two independently chosen sector angles α and β. The three remaining vertices of the cell have identical or supplementary sector angles and the distinction in the present work is that the vertices are arranged to form trapezoid faces rather than parallelograms. We exclusively consider isosceles trapezoids to simplify analytic expressions, but our model applies to tessellations composed of more general trapezoids and with larger unit cells such as those shown in Fig. 1 B–D which contain increased numbers of faces. Thus, each of the trapezoids has two legs of length q, one base of length p, and one base of eitheror(see Fig. 3 B). This yields the three-dimensional design space (α, β, q / p) for Arc-Morph, where the magnitude of p dictates the scale of the system which has no role in our kinematic analysis.

Gridness in trapezoid environments

To simulate the effect of asymmetric boundaries in a trapezoid enclosure on gridness, we took cluster positions from simulations after learning in square environments, and ran an additional learning phase for 250,000 trials. In this new learning phase, the shape of the environment was now a trapezoid (the agent could only move to those locations), and the annealed learning rate schedule continued (starting at 0.0025, reducing to 0.002 at the end). The trapezoid dimensions were 5 × 24 × 50 pixels, closely matching the proportions in(0.2 × 0.9 × 1.9 meters; multiplied by (50/1.9) equals to 5.26, 23.7, and 50).

In order to test whether the asymmetric boundaries of the trapezoid affected gridness, the trapezoid was split into two halves and we computed the grid score for the spatial autocorrelogram on the left (wide) and right (narrow) side of the shape. Due to discretization, we split it as close to equal as possible. The wide half extended from the leftmost pixels to the 17th pixel (338 pixels), and the narrow side extended from the 18th pixel to the 50th pixel (339 pixels).

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^7c3febb5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

Category II (or A = B) represents the case of male polymorphism markers. By male polymorphism markers, we mean they show no polymorphism in the female parent, but they show polymorphism in the male parent. For category II markers, only two genotypes can be observed in the clonal F 1 progenies (Figure 2). Genotypes AC and BC cannot be separated; neither can genotypes AD and BD. In this category, XC is used to code genotypes AC and BC; XD is used to code genotypes AD and BD, where X stands for either allele A or allele B (Figure 2). When no distortion occurs, the two genotypes will follow the Mendelian ratio of 1:1.

Category III (or C = D) represents the case of female polymorphism markers. By female polymorphism markers, we mean they show polymorphism in the female parent, but they show no polymorphism in the male parent. For category III markers, only two genotypes can be observed in the clonal F 1 progenies (Figure 2). Genotypes AC and AD cannot be separated; neither can genotypes BC and BD. In this category, AX is used to code genotypes AC and AD; BX is used to code genotypes BC and BD, where X stands for either allele C or D (Figure 2). When no distortion occurs, the two genotypes will follow the Mendelian ratio of 1:1.

Category IV (or AB = CD) represents the case of co-dominant markers. By co-dominant markers, we mean they show the same polymorphism pattern in both female and male parents, similar to an F 2 population derived from two inbred parents in self-pollinated and cross-pollinated species. For category IV markers, three genotypes can be observed in the clonal F 1 progenies, which are coded by AA, AB, and BB, respectively (Figure 2). When no distortion occurs, the three genotypes will follow the Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1.

Missing marker types are common in most genetic populations. In these four categories, any missing values of marker type are coded as XX.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^3b803fbe]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We similarly coarse-grain the infinitesimal deformation of the periodic origami tessellation generated from a homogeneous isometry by averaging the corresponding lattice displacement (Δ μ) and lattice angular velocity (L μ) over all primitive unit cells. We again do this in two steps. First, we average the lattice displacement and lattice angular velocity over the same set of standard unit cells used to computeabove. Here, there are an additional four copies of each standard cell distinguished by the orientation of the frame for each of the four corners that meet at the vertex set at the origin. We denote the resultsand. Second, we expand Eqns. ((17), (18)) in terms of these quantities:Again, the partial derivatives satisfy δ ∂ μ t ν = δ ∂ ν t μ and we transform from the discrete cell indices to the continuous surface coordinates via the Jacobian. While we do not compute an embedding directly, this procedure is sufficient to compute the fundamental forms and characterize the geometry of the origami tessellations. These methods extend to the crease patterns shown in Fig. 1 C, D that are not periodic in the azimuthal direction but are still composed of cellular building blocks by performing the first step of our averaging between analogous, but nonequivalent, vertices in both the forward and backwards directions.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^cf1beb6d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We provide more clarity on these modes by developing unit cell compatibility conditions for the class of TBO with parallel edges that alternate in length. Rather than triangulating the crease pattern as frequently done in previous works –, we separately consider folding degrees of freedom on the vertices, denoted by the vertex amplitudes, and bending degrees of freedom on the faces, denoted by the face amplitudes(see Methods, Linear Isometry Model) as introduced in ref.for the special case of parallelogram-based origami. The amplitude on a vertex maps to changes in the dihedral angles, which are not required to be uniform along the edge unless the isometry is rigid. Instead, a gradient in the folding along a crease generates bending of the adjacent faces, as quantified by the respective face amplitudes. For this reason, constraints on the face amplitudes can be integrated out, thereby yielding compatibility conditions that map from vertex amplitudes to vertex constraints which we illustrate via the compatibility diagrams shown in Fig. 1 A–D(iv). Here, each node is assigned a vertex amplitude and the line style of the edges indicate coupling coefficients that depend on the crease geometry (see Supplementary Note 4). When the coupling coefficients are uniform along the edges, such as in Fig. 1 A(iv), the rigid mode (for all faces) is represented by uniform assignment of vertex amplitudes (for all vertices). In contrast, when the coupling coefficients are nonuniform along the edges, such as in Fig. 1 B(iv), the vertex amplitudes of the rigid mode are proportional to one another to ensure the folding is uniform along the creases. In either case, we find that this family of TBO always exhibits a nonrigid mode represented by uniform face amplitudes (for all faces) and zero vertex amplitudes (for all vertices). Since the breathing (shearing) mode is generated by the rigid (nonrigid) isometry, its modal stiffness depends entirely on the stiffness of the creases (faces). This representation of the isometries effectively integrates the three-dimensional geometry out of the analysis to enable a succinct analytical classification of the modes.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^9f8f8abd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The experiments proceeded as follows. A specific height is imposed on the sample using the L-shaped plates and the sample is secured in this configuration by locking the sliders with the locking system. We use a tape measure at various positions along the circular edge of the tessellation to manually verify the uniformity of the sample height. We then capture a photo with each of the two cameras in the locked configuration. We repeat this process for eight different configurations, specifically imposing heights of 31.5 cm, 32 cm, 33 cm, 34 cm, 35 cm, 36 cm, 37 cm, and 37.5 cm. Finally, we estimate the relationship between the height and radius via post-processing of these photos.

Methods

Coarse-graining

We coarse-grain the ground states of a periodic origami tessellation by averaging its primitive lattice vectors over all admissible primitive unit cells to determine the coarse-grained tangent vectors of the tessellation. We do this in two steps. First, we average the lattice vectors over the copies of a standard unit cell that change which vertex is located at the origin and denote the result. For example, one copy has vertex a at the origin with lattice vectors pointing between vertex a in adjacent cells and another copy has vertex b at the origin with lattice vectors pointing between vertex b in adjacent cells. Second, we average these copies between adjacent cells so that the forwards and backwards tangent vectors are equal and opposite. This yields our definition for the coarse-grained tangent vectors:Additionally, we average the cell-to-cell change in the primitive lattice vectors over all admissible primitive unit cells to determine the change in the coarse-grained tangent vectors. We do this by averaging over the change in the tangent vector defined in Eqn. (17) from an initial cell to the subsequent cell and from the previous cell to the initial cell so that the forwards and backwards derivatives of the tangent vectors are equal and opposite. Since the change in the tangent vectors is given by the action of the lattice rotation matrix or its inverse, this yields our definition for the derivative of the coarse-grained tangent vectors:These partial derivatives satisfy ∂ μ t ν = ∂ ν t μ. The indices of Eqns. ((17), (18)) remain the cell indices (n 1, n 2). We transform to the continuous surface coordinatesvia the Jacobian. For the trapezoid-based origami crease patterns we consider, we have, and J φ 2 = J z 1 = 0, where η is the lattice rotation angle and h is the magnitude of the second lattice vector.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^7e6b58fa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our work seeks to expand the investigation of parallelogram-based origami sheets to more generic tessellations which possess two crucial differences from those composed of parallelograms. The first difference is that a generic tessellation is quasi-cylindrical, rather than quasi-planar, in that its two primitive lattice vectors rotate about a common axis from cell to cell. The second difference is that such a quasi-cylindrical tessellation exhibits two linear isometries (rather than the one rigid and two non-rigid isometries discussed in the previous paragraph) that retain the quasi-cylindrical geometry while changing its radius, height, and symmetry axis. We investigate these two linear isometries in rigidly-foldable trapezoid-based origami (TBO) tessellations, for which the constituent trapezoid faces have one less symmetry than the previously investigated parallelogram faces, to exemplify continuum approximations for the linear isometries in quasi-cylindrical origami tessellations. We show exemplar TBO folded from cardstock in their ground state configurations in Fig. 1 A–D(i) and in rigidly folded configurations in Fig. 1 A–D(ii). While such rigid folding mechanisms of TBO are identified for select geometries, such as the arc pattern, in previous works, our work also identifies and models the nonrigid isometries shown in Fig. 1 A–D(iii). Our theoretical model has two components. The first component determines and solves the compatibility conditions for the linear isometries within a single cell, which we show can be represented using the compatibility diagrams shown in Fig. 1 A–D(iv) where the meaning of the line styles and colors is explained in Supplementary Note 4. The second component maps these linear isometries to their continuum approximation, which decomposes into one rigid breathing mode and one nonrigid shearing mode. We showcase our analytical results for a class of origami crease patterns derived from the geometry presented in ref.that we refer to as the Arc-Morph and perform laboratory scale experiments on a specimen manufactured from polypropylene.

### Mpath maps multi-branching single-cell trajectories revealing progenitor cell progression during development [^7936b47b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Re-ordering of single cells

To generate a more fine grained analysis, and move from clusters back to the single-cell information, Mpath re-orders individual cells along the developmental trajectories. Mpath computationally reconstructs cell developmental pathways as a multi-destination journey on a map of connected landmarks wherein individual cells are placed in order along the paths connecting the landmarks (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Given a sequence of landmarks (a, b, c, d) along a development path, Mpath places the cells in order on the edge connecting the adjacent landmarks. It first identifies cells (ab 1, ab 2,…, ab i,…) that are potentially transitioning from landmark a to b based on their transcriptional proximities to both landmarks. To determine the ordering of these cells along the transition from landmark a to b, Mpath locates their projection points on the line spanning landmark a and b (Supplementary Fig. 5b). A given cell ab 1 is orthogonally projected to the line spanned by landmarks a and b, and the projection point x 1 is identified. Mpath repeats this process for individual cells (ab 1, ab 2,…, ab i,…) and identifies their respective project points (x 1, x 2,…, x i,…). Cells (ab 1, ab 2,…, ab i,…) are then sorted according to the ordering of (x 1, x 2,…, x i,…) with respect to landmarks a and b. The above procedure is then repeated for every two adjacent landmarks, that is, (b, c) and (c, d), giving rise to a concatenated pseudo-temporal ordering (ab 1, ab 2,…, ab i,…) (bc 1, bc 2,…, bc i,…) (cd 1, cd 2,…, cd i,…) along the developmental path spanning landmarks a, b, c and d. The same process is repeated for the developmental path spanning landmarks a, b, c and e. If a cell is 'before' the first landmark or 'after' the last landmark, we placed it on the extension of the edges connecting its two nearest landmarks (Supplementary Fig. 5c).

Introduction

Origami sheets are two-dimensional surfaces with predefined creases that control their three-dimensional response to mechanical loads –. The fundamental principle behind the behavior of origami is the difference between the energy scales of elastic deformations that bend the panels (cubic in sheet thickness) and elastic deformations that stretch the panels (linear in sheet thickness). This scaling leads to a quasi-static, low-energy response dominated by the deformations that do not stretch the panels, which we refer to as linear isometries. Since this principle relies solely on the thickness of the sheet, the linear isometries corresponding to a particular crease pattern are largely material independent and therefore realizable in both metallic – and polymeric – materials over a range of length scales. Hence, an understanding of the origami kinematics tends to be more consequential than an understanding of the origami dynamics for the design of origami metamaterials. There are two specific applications of origami kinematics that motivate our work.

The first application of interest is the class of isometries referred to as rigid folding mechanisms that fold the origami sheet along its predefined creases while keeping the panels entirely rigid (no stretching or bending). These rigid folding mechanisms are useful for the deployment and transformation of structures found in various engineering applications including solar arrays, heart stents, and temporary shelters. However, arbitrary quadrilateral-mesh crease patterns are not rigidly foldable and a significant body of work is devoted towards the development of design principles –. Moreover, arbitrary loads can lead to heterogeneous actuation of the mechanism, as well as undesirable deformations due to the existence of isometries distinct from the rigid folding mechanismor the intersection of separate branches in the configuration space. Therefore, efficient models for the response to external loads can inform the methods for deployment and transformation of origami structures along the programmed rigid mechanism without exciting undesirable responses via alternative low-energy instabilities.

Trapezoid and 30-60-90 right triangle

This set of experiments was carried out in a right triangle (30°, 60°, 90°) and a trapezoid environment. Corner angles from the trapezoid were 55°, 90°, 90° and 125°. The dimensions of the mazes were 46 (L) × 28 (W) × 30 (H) cm. In total, we conducted 16 sessions each (25 min per session) from eight mice for the right triangle and trapezoid. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked across the sessions for each mouse. Other recording protocols were the same as described above.

Insertion of a discrete corner in a square environment

This set of experiments was carried out in a large square environment with dimensions of 40 (L) × 40 (W) × 40 (H) cm. The experiments comprised a baseline session followed by four sessions with the insertion of a discrete corner into the square maze. In these sessions, the walls that formed the discrete corner were gradually separated by 0, 1.5, 3 and 6 cm. Starting from 3 cm, the animals were able to pass through the gap without difficulty. The dimensions of the inserted walls were 15 (W) × 30 (H) cm. For each condition, we recorded eight sessions (30 min per session) from eight mice by conducting a single session from each mouse per day. Data from this set of experiments were aligned and concatenated, and the activity of neurons was tracked throughout the sessions.

2.7 Moment nulling trapezoids

Designing a pair of trapezoids to null zeroth and first moments of a single gradient waveform is common; for spiral imaging, the design of "vector" trapezoid pairs that are played out in both in‐plane directions and are freely rotatable under gradient constraints has not been shown to our knowledge. We have developed a fast algorithm for joint design of this trapezoid pair, which reduces their total duration compared with those made using separate, single‐channel designs. Joint design ensures simultaneous nulling across both axes while maximizing gradient usage without exceeding system limits, resulting in more efficient and symmetric gradient waveforms. Using the notation illustrated in Figure 2, we define variables t a and t b to be the effective total duration (area divided by amplitude) of two trapezoids A and B, respectively, and the effective ramp time t r to be one‐half the actual ramp time. Defining M0 and M1 as the relative gradient moments at the end of spiral waveforms, we write matrix equations for the desired moments of the gradient waveforms and invert them, givingWe enforce these equations in the following iterative solution:

FIGURE 2
Illustration of trapezoids used for pair‐wise design of M1 and M0 nulling with full rotational compatibility.

Step 0: Initialize with t ra = t rb = 0.5*Gmax/Smax, t a = 2 t ra, t b = t rb.

Step 1: Solve for gradient amplitudes, using Equations (19) and (20).

Step 2: Normalize A and B vector gradient amplitudes separately by factorsand, respectively.

Step 3: Solve for new trapezoid durations, using Equation (21).

Iterating these 3 steps converges on a solution quickly. One can modify this approach routine (see code) to account for nontrapezoid (triangular) waveforms.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^a2ff9e7d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Investigations of origami tessellations as effective media reveal the ability to program the components of their elasticity tensor, and thus control the mechanical behavior of thin sheets. However, existing efforts focus on crease patterns that are composed of parallelogram faces where the parallel lines constrain the quasi-static elastic response. In this work, crease patterns composed of more general trapezoid faces are considered and their low-energy linear response is explored. Deformations of such origami tessellations are modeled as linear isometries that do not stretch individual panels at the small scale yet map to non-isometric changes of coarse-grained fundamental forms that quantify how the effective medium strains and curves at the large scale. Two distinct mode shapes, a rigid breathing mode and a nonrigid shearing mode, are identified in the continuum model. A specific example, which we refer to as Arc-Morph origami, is presented with analytical expressions for its deformations in both the discrete and continuous models. A developable specimen is fabricated and tested to validate the analytical predictions. This work advances the continuum modeling of origami tessellations as effective media with the incorporation of more generic faces and ground states, thereby enabling the investigation of novel designs and applications.

### Coarse-grained fundamental forms for characterizing isometries of trapezoid-based origami metamaterials [^b1465c46]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The theory developed in the present work connects the discrete representation to the continuum representation of locally uniform isometric deformations in TBO, thereby characterizing their low-energy kinematics at the large scale. It remains to test this theory with more general trapezoid crease patterns via analytical or numerical calculations. However, the underlying principles extend to quadrilateral-mesh origami sheets without parallel edges, where the breathing mode and the shearing mode are coupled along the configuration manifold, as well as axisymmetric origami such as those in refs. –, where the size of the faces changes between cells so that the continuum theory may adopt a conformally flat metric. Furthermore, our methods extend to spatially varying isometries, such as those explored linearly for parallelogram-based origami, (see Supplementary Note 6) and nonlinearly for the cylindrical waterbomb origami, where the fundamental forms and their derivatives are intimately related via the Gauss-Codazzi equations in the continuum regime. Extending our work in this way provides a rich avenue for future investigations that seek to incorporate the large-scale response of origami tessellations into models based on elastic plate theory, where we anticipate sinusoidal variations of mean curvature in the bulk and finite amounts of Gaussian curvature localized towards the boundary of the system. We expect our approximation to improve as the number of cells increases, and the consistency between the response shown in Fig. 1 A–D with crease patterns that have increased numbers of faces in the unit cells, non-isosceles trapezoid faces, and domain walls with parallelogram faces showcases the robustness of our predictions. Furthermore, our focus on geometric mechanics suggests our theory scales with the system size and the isometries should be observable at the sub-millimeter scale on crease patterns fabricated using, e.g. two-photon lithography as used in ref.

Such a crease pattern has a a rigid folding mechanism that we parameterize via the dihedral angle γ from which the remaining dihedral angles shown in Fig. 3 C. (θ, θ ″ ≡ 2 π − θ, ψ, and ψ ″ ≡ 2 π − ψ) are determined. We compute the coarse-grained fundamental forms for a generic ground state then we use the mean curvature to determine the radius and the Jacobian to determine the characteristic height:We find the components of the fundamental forms exactly match those shown in Eqn. ((1), (2), (3)). We denote the number of cells in the azimuthal direction as N 1 and the number of cells in the axial direction as N 2, then identify the instantaneous bounds of the coordinates in our continuum approximation as 0 ≤ φ ≤ N 1 η (γ) and 0 ≤ z ≤ N 2 h (γ). Consequently, the configuration manifold is bounded by the closure condition of the faces γ = π shown in Fig. 3 F and the closure condition of the cylinder N 1 η = 2 π shown in Fig. 3 H. We find these conditions restrict the space of viable configurations and system sizes, but we do not provide a thorough exploration of the design space in this work. We write the explicit expressions for the geometry along the rigid folding mechanism in Methods, Arc-Morph Geometry. We show the radius as a function of the height along the configuration manifold in Fig. 3 E, and use the inset to highlight a change in slope after the cylinder reaches its maximum height as shown in Fig. 3 G. Since we have explicit formulae for the radius and the height, it is straightforward to expand the fundamental forms about infinitesimal changes to the dihedral angle γ along the rigid mechanism (see Supplementary Note 5). However, we utilize our framework for the rigid isometry to compare it with existing methods.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^0ed1395d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Cluster representations are shaped by environmental geometry

According to the clustering account, grid-like responses should only arise under very specific conditions in which the environment is fairly uniform. The imposition of any structure, including changes to the overall geometry of the environment, should affect the clustering in a manner that makes it less grid-like.

Related, Krupic et al.identified grid cells in rodent mEC in a square box, then placed the animals in a trapezoid environment. They found that activity maps of grid cells became less grid-like in the trapezoid and that the decline was greatest for responses elicited on the narrow side of the trapezoid. To simulate this experiment, the model was first trained in a square and then transferred to a trapezoid environment (see Fig. 4a–d for an example and Fig. S 4 for more examples). As in the empirical studies, the model's overall grid scores declined in the trapezoid environment (Fig. 4e; trapezoid mean grid score: 0.058, bootstrap CIs [0.054, 0.061]; Fig. 4f; square minus trapezoid mean: 0.219, bootstrap CIs [0.214, 0.224]) and the grid scores were higher on the wide than on the narrow side of the trapezoid (Fig. 4g; wide minus narrow mean: 0.133, bootstrap CIs [0.127, 0.139]; see Tables S5 – S7).

### Chemical shift encoding using asymmetric readout waveforms [^fd398c2c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Pulse sequence

A RARE sequence was implemented that alternates the acquisition of in and opposed phase echoes between excitations, as shown in Figure 4. All waveform calculations were calculated on‐the‐fly, without delay, according to the prescribed scan parameters. The CSE echo was acquired with the spline waveform, while the in‐phase echo was acquired with a quadratic readout, shown in Figure 2 and described in more detail below. The conventional trapezoid was compared against the quadratic.

FIGURE 3
A, Conventional multi‐TR RARE imaging where the readouts are shifted according to the desired CSE, prolonging the echo spacing. The dead times are avoided in (B) where asymmetric readout waveforms are used for CSE. The middle rows in (B) show the two investigated in‐phase alternatives: quadratic and prolonged trapezoidal readouts. Shaded areas indicate sampling

Samples were acquired with a constant minimum receiver dwell time (2 μs), using as wide an analog filter bandwidth as possible. A sinc‐based Cartesian gridding procedure 18 was applied with matched filter design to equalize the signal variance. 19 The signal power is related to the sampling density, described by the square root of the sinc integral. τ can be interpreted as the effective dwell time of a gridded sample. The white noise resampling procedure was chosen over uniform signal in order to facilitate apparent SNR measurements in the resampled images. An example of the sampling density is shown in Figure 4. Since the regridding is a one‐dimensional problem and the trajectories are monotonic, fully supported sinc functions are computationally feasible. This also avoids deapodization.

Comparing mean HTT CAG repeat counts and repeat size categories

Direct correlations between age or sex and the repeat counts were explored in MDD, ANX and CON (Supplementary Table 2). Differences of mean HTT CAG repeat counts between CON and patient groups were analyzed by separate one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) (Supplementary Table 3) and by one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with age and sex as covariates (Supplementary Table 4). To compare frequency distributions between patients and control subjects for predefined combinations of HTT CAG repeat ranges a (7–12), b (13–20), c (21–26), d (27–35), e (36–39) – with resulting twelve combinations (aa, ab, ad, ad, bb, bc, bd, be, cc, cd, ce, dd) – we applied Fisher's exact test (Supplementary Table 6). Further, for those combinations with a minimum of five subjects in the respective cells, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated both for the whole sample and the age-split subsamples (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 7). Post-hoc, given risk effects in the categories bb and bc, age and sex differences between the respective patient and CON groups within the combination bb and bc were analyzed (Supplementary Table 5.1). In addition, age and sex differences between these combinations were analyzed in CON to exclude that risk effects were based on the age or sex stratification of the patient samples (Supplementary Table 5.2).

Discussion

Our work develops analytical expressions for the large-scale low-energy deformations of rigidly foldable TBO and demonstrates the validity of our theory through experiment. We identify TBO as an architecture for control of shearing and breathing modes of surfaces through the geometry of the underlying crease pattern. Hence, our results distinguish tessellations with trapezoid faces from those with parallelogram faces and help to establish the classification of crease geometries according to their large-scale response. This classification can be utilized for more efficient inverse design by constraining the design space according to which types of modes are compatible with the target behavior. Interestingly, we find the mountain/valley assignment controls the sign of the slope of the height-radius profile in the same way that the assignment controls the Poisson's ratio of parallelogram-based origami. This helps narrow the design space to β = π − α (Arc-Miura) for applications that require a radius increasing with height, β = α (Arc-eggbox) for a radius decreasing with height, and somewhere in between (Arc-Morph) for a non-monotonic profile. These results showcase new functionality for origami as mechanical metamaterials, either as thin-walled structures with target stiffnesses or tubular coverings for snake-like robots, cables, and other long one-dimensional assemblies. Further development is required for the experimental demonstration of isometries in non-developable TBO, as well as the quantitative validation of the rigid isometry near the flattened state and the nonrigid isometry along the configuration manifold. We note that the nonrigid isometries of parallelogram-based origami still require the development of an experimental apparatus for their quantitative validation. For both trapezoid- and parallelogram-based tessellations, such an experiment requires careful attention to the loading mechanism so that the mode of interest is isolated and to the measurement system so that displacements are accurately tracked through three-dimensional space.

The profile of the insulin secretion rate (ISR) and the indexes of β ‐cell sensitivity to glucose (the dynamic β ‐cell glucose sensitivity, Φ d, the static sensitivity, Φ s, plus the total sensitivity (Φ)) were computed by the C‐peptide minimal model as proposed by Breda et al.

Investigations, suggest that the parameters Φ d and Φ s have a cellular interpretation: Φ d likely relates to exocytosis of insulin from secretory vesicles docked to the membrane and Φ s reflects insulin granule translocation and maturation. We have previously validated the minimal modelling in pigs.

The area under the curve (AUC) of ISR was computed by the trapezoidal rule.

The disposition index (DI) was computed as Φ × S I.

The parameters of the glucose and C‐peptide minimal models were estimated by minimization of a weighted least‐squares index using a constrained Levenberg–Marquardt minimisation routine of the MATLAB library.

In these cases, a problem of parametric estimate occurs, that is, it needs to determine an estimate of the vector θ knowing the measures of glucose z 1, z 2,…, z N and the output of the model y (t).

The goal is to find a way to reduce the prediction error e = Z – Y so that Euclidean norm e (p) is minimum.

This problem is resolved by finding an estimator that minimises the cost function:

where z is the vector with blood samples, is the output of the model (glucose or C‐peptide) in the same times of z and W a diagonal matrix containing weights.

To find the initial values of parameters, a fast‐greedy algorithm was implemented.

The standard errors of the estimates of individual parameters were evaluated by the linearization method, and the coefficients of variation were found to be < 20%.

2.2 Matching the in‐phase echo

A property of the asymmetric readouts, resulting from the dynamic bandwidth, is the non‐uniform k‐space sampling density. We propose to counterbalance this with a matched in‐phase readout to achieve a more balanced total k‐space sampling density in a two‐point RARE sequence. Ideally, the combined fat/water estimates will have an improved SNR transfer function with this approach (described below).

Although constrained to be symmetrical about the k‐space origin, the sampling density of the matched readout can be varied. Instead of a conventional trapezoidal readout with fixed amplitude λ, we investigated a symmetric quadratic readout waveform which matches the CSE readout, illustrated in Figure 2. The constantmatches the asymmetric spline such that the combined effective dwell time at the k‐space center equals that of two trapezoidal in‐phase readouts. That is, the total time spent sampling the k‐space center is the same: The quadratic coefficientis defined by the gradient moment M, the center pointcoinciding with the spin echo, and the constant:

FIGURE 2
Symmetric readout waveforms for in‐phase CSE. A trapezoid and the proposed matched quadratic waveform is shown in (A). The k‐space trajectory over time is shown in (B). The time axis (x) is shared between the plots

A comparison between the sampling densities for trapezoidal and quadratic in‐phase readouts is shown in Figure 3. It is clear that while the density is non‐uniform, the area is consistent between the spline, quadratic, and trapezoidal waveforms because the total readout durations are equal. In contrast, the shifted trapezoidal case shows a uniform distribution but with a smaller area. This is a consequence of less time spent sampling the signal. In Figure 4 D, it is evident that the combined sampling time at the k‐space center is increased and a more uniform density is achieved with the quadratic in‐phase waveform. We hypothesize that the asymmetry of the sampling density can be counterbalanced by using real‐valued k‐space fat/water separation, described below.

### Motion-compensated b-tensor encoding for in vivo cardiac diffusion-weighted imaging [^5d2fb5fd]. NMR in Biomedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3 METHODS

3.1 Generating spherical tensor encoding waveforms

Gradient waveforms for STE with K‐nulling and moment nulling up to the 2nd order were generated according to the principles outlined in the Theory section (see Figure 1). For our proof‐of‐concept experiments, we used trapezoidal gradient waveforms. Such waveforms are known for their high b‐value efficiency, ease of specification, and are routinely employed in both imaging and diffusion‐weighting.

Our STE gradient waveforms with moments nulled up to order n = 0, 1, 2 (shown in Figure 2) were generated based on the following steps:
Two gradient waveforms with n + 1 (waveform 1) and n + 2 (waveform 2) trapezoidal lobes were generated. The duration of these waveforms was chosen to fit on each side of the refocusing pulse while also allowing for gradients to be turned off during the interval surrounding the refocusing pulse (see timing in Figure 2). Ramp times of 1.6 ms were used.
Copies of waveform 1 were used with opposite polarities on each side of the refocusing pulse along the x‐axis (axis 1 in Figure 1). Copies of waveform 2 were used with opposite polarities on each side of the refocusing pulse along the y‐axis (axis 2 in Figure 1) and with equal polarities on each side of the refocusing pulse along the z‐axis (axis 3 in Figure 1).
The resulting waveforms were scaled to yield isotropic b‐tensors.
Finally, the waveforms were rotated to achieve K‐nulling.

Matlab code to generate gradient waveforms for tensor‐valued diffusion encoding with gradient moment nulling up to 2nd order as well as nulling effects of concomitant gradients are available upon request.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^6d1e986c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Among all possible choices of coordinate systems, the proposed projected-elevation spherical coordinate system leads to a natural representation of the hidden scene where almost all parameters of the hidden scene will be information orthogonal. A geometric depiction of the information orthogonality property among the angular parameters, θ and ψ, is provided in Fig. 1 d, e, as well as in Supplementary Movie 1. To achieve information orthogonality, the proposed coordinate system is constructed such that its angular coordinates, (θ, ψ), each pivot about one of the vertical and horizontal occluding edges of the doorway. Much like how polar (or cylindrical) coordinates are natural for the corner cameraand its variants, the projected-elevation spherical coordinate system is natural for TERI. Because single-edge corner cameras exploit a vertical occluding edge for resolution, a point source moving in the hidden scene changes only the observed penumbra shape when it moves only along the azimuth (pivoting about the vertical edge). Conversely, range-only motion produces subtle intensity changes in the penumbra, due to radial falloff effects, while the overall penumbra shape is unchanged. The projected-elevation spherical coordinate system, therefore, represents a combination of two orthogonal corner camera systems resulting from two orthogonal edges of the doorframe. In this two-edge configuration, a hidden scene point source will produce a sharp shadow resembling the top and slanted edges of a right trapezoid (see example observations shown in Fig. 1 d, e). Representing the hidden scene point in the proposed coordinate system, changes in the slope of the slanted edge of the shadow are due exclusively to point source motion along azimuth θ (with pivot at the vertical occluding edge). Conversely, changes in the position of the top edge of the shadow are due exclusively to source motion along the projected-elevation angle ψ (with pivot at the horizontal occluding edge). This apparent decoupling of how changes in θ and ψ affect the measurement ensures that errors in any one of the angular coordinates will not impact our estimation of the other. Because the elevation is defined in the plane containing the azimuth, however, this phenomenon does not occur in a spherical coordinate system.

### Two-edge-resolved three-dimensional non-line-of-sight imaging with an ordinary camera [^de70b1fe]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Two-edge-resolved NLOS imaging scenario and hidden scene representation.

a Depiction of the imaging scenario and proposed projected-elevation spherical coordinate. With the origin at the upper-left corner of the door frame, a hidden scene point is identified by its range ρ, azimuth θ, and projected-elevation ψ. b Shows the projected-elevation ψ in the proposed projected-elevation spherical coordinate system, it is the projection of the conventional elevation angle of spherical coordinates onto the x z -plane and is such that. (For clarity, the z -axis is flipped from (a) to point upward.) c Elemental surface representation resulting from 10 equal divisions of azimuth and projected-elevation axes with fixed range, ρ. Indicated by the red dot is an example surface element whose centre is at (ρ, θ, ψ) = (1, 11 π /40, 13 π /40) and angular extents equal π /20 along azimuth and projected-elevation. d, e Depict the changes in the observed measurement due to a hidden point source (red dot) moving from its position in (d) to a new position in (e) such that its range and projected-elevation angle are fixed and only its azimuthal angle changes. The light from a hidden scene point is occluded by the doorway edges to create an illuminated region of trapezoidal shape on the ceiling. The observation in (d) has an illuminated trapezoidal region whose slanted edge is steeper than that of (e) because the azimuthal angle of the point source increases from (d) to (e); the heights of the illuminated trapezoid portions in (d) and (e) are otherwise equal because the projected-elevation angle is unchanged.

### Grid cell responses in 1D environments assessed as slices through a 2D lattice [^a7975788]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Grid cells, defined by their striking periodic spatial responses in open 2D arenas, appear to respond differently on 1D tracks: the multiple response fields are not periodically arranged, peak amplitudes vary across fields, and the mean spacing between fields is larger than in 2D environments. We ask whether such 1D responses are consistent with the system's 2D dynamics. Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the 1D responses of grid cells with stable 1D fields are consistent with a linear slice through a 2D triangular lattice. Further, the 1D responses of comodular cells are well described by parallel slices, and the offsets in the starting points of the 1D slices can predict the measured 2D relative spatial phase between the cells. From these results, we conclude that the 2D dynamics of these cells is preserved in 1D, suggesting a common computation during both types of navigation behavior.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^136613e3]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Triply-periodic networks are among the most complex and functionally valuable self-assembled morphologies, yet they form in nearly every class of biological and synthetic soft matter building blocks. In contrast to simpler assembly motifs - spheres, cylinders, layers - networks require molecules to occupy variable local environments, confounding attempts to understand their formation. Here, we examine the double-gyroid network phase by using a geometric formulation of the strong stretching theory of block copolymer melts, a prototypical soft self-assembly system. The theory establishes the direct link between molecular packing, assembly thermodynamics and the medial map, a generic measure of the geometric center of complex shapes. We show that "medial packing" is essential for stability of double-gyroid in strongly-segregated melts, reconciling a long-standing contradiction between infinite- and finite-segregation theories. Additionally, we find a previously unrecognized non-monotonic dependence of network stability on the relative entropic elastic stiffness of matrix-forming to tubular-network forming blocks. The composition window of stable double-gyroid widens for both large and small elastic asymmetry, contradicting intuitive notions that packing frustration is localized to the tubular domains. This study demonstrates the utility of optimized medial tessellations for understanding soft-molecular assembly and packing frustration via an approach that is readily generalizable far beyond gyroids in neat block copolymers.

### A soft photopolymer cuboid that computes with binary strings of white light [^998e393d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Output generated by pairs of two-bit strings. a Expected and corresponding b experimental results of the 16 (2 2 × 2 2) patterns generated at the polymer cuboid output (yz plane) by all combinations of a pair of 2-bit binary strings introduced along the y and z axis. Each output pattern comprises different combinations of carrier configurations 0D (red), 1DH (blue), 1DV (green), and 2D (gray), which can be quantified through c corresponding FFT spectra of experimental results. (Bits 0 and 1 are represented by white and black bars, respectively; scale bar in b = 200 μm; in b, c, blue (minimum) to red (maximum) intensity scales are provided.)

Most significantly, its quaternary output enables the system to perform two fundamental operations of binary arithmetic — addition and subtraction (Fig. 5). The scheme in Fig. 5a depicts the addition of two binary strings, 10 and 01, input, respectively, through Beams Y and Z; in all cases, MI of uniform Beam X generates carriers throughout the cuboid. The place value of the binary strings increases from right to left for Beam Y and from top to bottom for Beam Z. The strings divide the cuboid into voxels, each of which contains 0, 1, or 2 encoder populations that operate on carriers and generate a unique output. The sum in binary form is read from the antidiagonal of the output; each element is the result of the operations of encoders with the same place value on the carriers. To interpret results, we assign a value of 0 to configuration 0D, 1 to 1DH and 1DV, and 0 carry 1 (0C1) to 2D. In Fig. 5a, the addition of 01 and 10 generates an antidiagonal of two elements comprising the 1DV and 1DH configurations, respectively. This correctly represents a sum of 11. For the addition of 0 1 and 0 1 shown in Fig. 5b, the first element of the antidiagonal reads "0C1" and the carried value is read from the off-diagonal as 1. Because the second element of the antidiagonal is 0, the sum is 10. Experimental examples of addition in the 2 2 × 2 2 system (Fig. 4) are tabulated in Fig. 5c and classified according to the absolute value of the sum. Because the addition of different pairs of numbers can have the same sum, the 10 tabulated patterns correspond to four unique results. Interestingly, although addition is commutative, our system has the ability to distinguish between the 1DH and 1DV configurations, which both correspond to "1". This allows the identity of the input binary strings to be elucidated from the result.

### Solid-body trajectoids shaped to roll along desired pathways [^14d17a08]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

In everyday life, rolling motion is typically associated with cylindrical (for example, car wheels) or spherical (for example, billiard balls) bodies tracing linear paths. However, mathematicians have, for decades, been interested in more exotically shaped solids such as the famous oloids 1, sphericons 2, polycons 3, platonicons 4 and two-circle rollers 5 that roll downhill in curvilinear paths (in contrast to cylinders or spheres) yet indefinitely (in contrast to cones, Supplementary Video 1). The trajectories traced by such bodies have been studied in detail 6–9, and can be useful in the context of efficient mixing 10,11 and robotics, for example, in magnetically actuated, millimetre-sized sphericon-shaped robots 12,13, or larger sphericon- and oloid-shaped robots translocating by shifting their centre of mass 14,15. However, the rolling paths of these shapes are all sinusoid-like and their diversity ends there. Accordingly, we were intrigued whether a more general problem is solvable: given an infinite periodic trajectory, find the shape that would trace this trajectory when rolling down a slope. Here, we develop an algorithm to design such bodies-which we call 'trajectoids'-and then validate these designs experimentally by three-dimensionally printing the computed shapes and tracking their rolling paths, including those that close onto themselves such that the body's centre of mass moves intermittently uphill (Supplementary Video 2). Our study is motivated largely by fundamental curiosity, but the existence of trajectoids for most paths has unexpected implications for quantum and classical optics, as the dynamics of qubits, spins and light polarization can be exactly mapped to trajectoids and their paths 16.

### ABCDE in clinical encounters: presentations of self in doctor-patient communication [^5d8ee642]. Annals of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Professional discussions about communication in medical settings often ignore the various personal identities that doctors and patients bring to their clinical encounters. From my 26 years as a family physician, and informed by literature from other professional disciplines, I propose an alternate understanding: to think of doctors and patients as a collection of individual identities, each formed by a discrete presentation of self. I describe how at least 5 important presentations of self arise in clinical encounters, including those relating to meaning, community, agency, anxiety, and organism. I frame these presentations of self with the mnemonic ABCDE, briefly review key dimensions of each, and suggest how physicians can reflect on these dimensions in order to find equilibrium in their interactions with patients. Lastly, I submit that finding this balance can reduce relational challenges with patients and enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of doctor-patient communication.

### The spatial complexity of optical computing: toward space-efficient design [^0f1f6839]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

While this block-diagonalization approach is not expected to be applicable to all computational tasks, we find that relevant tasks solvable by neural networks are amenable to block-diagonalization, leading to a substantial reduction in spatial complexity. To optimize the trade-off between n MZI and the ONNs' performance, we propose a two-step pruning method. First, we include in the loss function an extra term, that penalizes all off-block-diagonal entries. No parameter is removed at this stage. Once the weights are trained, they are loaded into specially designed block-diagonal-structured (BDS) linear layers, where only entries in the diagonal blocks are registered as learnable parameters, while all other entries remain zero and are not updatable. The model with BDS linear layers is further trained on the same dataset to fully adapt to the block diagonal structure (see Methods).

### Observation of interaction-induced modulations of a quantum hall liquid's area [^0f8a0dc5]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

According to this description, the area enclosed by the outer edge channel is 'breathing'; on increasing the magnetic field it continuously shrinks and then abruptly inflates, altogether with periodicity Δ B = φ 0 / A. Nonetheless, the breathing in the CD regime has never been experimentally confirmed. The reason is that the measured conductance is simply constant, as the magnetic field is varied. Basically, the area response to increasing the magnetic field fully compensates the effect of the latter. The subsequent abrupt addition of an electron leads to a 2 π jump in the interference phase — clearly an unobservable effect as well. We are thus 'blind' to this phenomenon of area breathing.

Here we report on the realization of a novel device that combines the advantages of AB interferometers with CD response. It operates in an intermediate regime — in which the area response does not fully compensate the variations of the magnetic field, rendering the area 'breathing' observable. In other words, with 0 < ξ < 1, leading to a total phase evolution. Our main findings concerning this 'breathing' are summarized in equations (8, 9, 10) below. Measurements were performed on three different devices showing three distinct behaviours: AB dominated, namely, ξ = 0 with no area breathing; CD, namely, ξ = 1 with invisible breathing of the area; and an intermediate one (ξ = 0.75), with clear area breathing. We present conductance measurements of this novel device that incorporates both AB and CD frequencies (equations (1, 2, 3, 4)), hence contain information regarding both interference and interactions, and the interplay between them. Moreover, employing detailed analysis based on the system's energy, we deduce the device's charge stability diagram, providing an insight to its rich physics being 'hidden' in the previously reported AB and CD devices. Furthermore, we provide proposals for utilizing our device for probing anyonic statistics of quasi-particles in the FQHE regime.

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^588d8957]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 shows the predicted mean step counts and 95% CI for the rest of the day, given the step counts accumulated from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. adjusting for age group, BMI group and sex. Overall, there was little difference in the conditional predicted mean step counts for the rest of the days between the weekdays and the weekends. On weekdays, participants who accumulated 6000 steps by 6 p.m. had a 0.692 probability of achieving 10,000 steps (all the goals) by the end of the day (refer to the Goal 3 diagonal line in Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, participants who had accumulated 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with a probability of 0.910, 0.982, 0.700, and 1, respectively. On weekends, participants who had accumulated 6500 steps by 6 p.m. 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with probability 0.852, 0.583, 0.947, 0.717 and 1, respectively. The step counts required to achieve 5000 and 7500 steps by the end of the day can be found in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Shaping and timing gradient pulses to reduce MRI acoustic noise [^1f631459]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

A method to reduce the acoustic noise generated by gradient systems in MRI has been recently proposed; such a method is based on the linear response theory. Since the physical cause of MRI acoustic noise is the time derivative of the gradient current, a common trapezoid current shape produces an acoustic gradient coil response mainly during the rising and falling edge. In the falling edge, the coil acoustic response presents a 180 degrees phase difference compared to the rising edge. Therefore, by varying the width of the trapezoid and keeping the ramps constant, it is possible to suppress one selected frequency and its higher harmonics. This value is matched to one of the prominent resonance frequencies of the gradient coil system. The idea of cancelling a single frequency is extended to a second frequency, using two successive trapezoid-shaped pulses presented at a selected interval. Overall sound pressure level reduction of 6 and 10 dB is found for the two trapezoid shapes and a single pulse shape, respectively. The acoustically optimized pulse shape proposed is additionally tested in a simulated echo planar imaging readout train, obtaining a sound pressure level reduction of 12 dB for the best case.

### Brain-optimized deep neural network models of human visual areas learn non-hierarchical representations [^27c79d7b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Training and validation of task-optimized and brain-optimized networks.

a An encoding model based on a task-optimized deep neural network (AlexNet; white trapezoid). Multiple convolutional layers (η i) convert the input stimulus on trial t, X t, into feature maps. A read-out head (blue rectangle) transforms network activations into predicted brain activity (r t v, where v indexes a single voxel). The read-out head consists of Gaussian spatial pooling fields (example at lower left) with position and size selected from a fixed grid of candidates (lower right). The pooling field and each feature map are multiplied pixel-wise and then summed, reducing each feature map to a single feature value. The array of feature values across all maps (left vertical rectangle) are weighted by an array of feature weights (w v) and then summed (with a bias term b v) to yield predicted brain activity. Compressive point nonlinearities (f (⋅)) are applied at several processing stages. b A similar architecture is used for the encoding model based on the brain-optimized network (GNet; orange trapezoid depicts a single-branch architecture). The "flexible" spatial pooling fields used in the read-out head may be non-Gaussian (example at lower left). c Training for the AlexNet-based encoding model. For each voxel, only read-out head parameters (g v, w v, b v) are optimized (gears) for visual areas V1–V4 (colored rectangles) in each subjects' brain (S1,…, S8). The "voxelwise loss" (squared difference between predictions and measured activity data) is evaluated independently for each voxel. d Training for the GNet-based encoding model. Both the read-out head and GNet parameters are optimized jointly ("joint loss") for all voxels, subjects and brain areas. e Prediction accuracy is evaluated for each voxel by correlating predicted brain activity with measured brain activity (ρ AlexNet, ρ GNet) across a set of held-out validation trials with natural scenes. We plot the average accuracy (y -axis of central plot) vs. the difference in accuracy (x -axis) for each voxel (dots; color indicates visual area). For this example subject (S1) the GNet-based encoding model predicts responses to natural scenes most accurately for 81.3% of voxels in V1–V4. f In this example, the GNet-based encoding models predicts responses to artificial stimuli more accurately for 88% of voxels in V1–V4.

### Medial packing and elastic asymmetry stabilize the double-gyroid in block copolymers [^8119125e]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Medial strong segregation theory for double gyroid

The medial strong segregation theory calculation optimizes the SST free energy, Supplementary Eq. (11), over the variational family of generating gyroidal surfaces to determine and analyze thermodynamically preferred DG chain packing. Complete details on the construction of tessellating chain configurations and the variational algorithm are given in Supplementary Note 3–4.

We begin with a broad set of generating surfaces G withsymmetry; here we have chosen G as level sets of a three Fourier-mode expansion of the gyroid symmetry. From the medial map of G (for the double network) we generate the terminal boundaries of both domains, T A and T B, referring to the tubular and matrix domains respectively. The induced map between T A and T B approximates the mean trajectories of domain-spanning chains, which occupy local volumes approximated by triangular prismatic wedges, thus providing a complete tessellation of the DG structure. The location of the IMDS is then determined along each trajectory according to the constraints of volume balance and chain composition, resulting in mutually compatible terminal boundaries, IMDS, and trajectories, as shown in Fig. 2 b, from which we compute the geometric contribution to the free energy in Eq. (1). Notably, local volume balance generally requires some measure of tilt between trajectories and the IMDS, such that the terminal surfaces of the ultimate volume-balanced packing deviate at least slightly from the medial surfaces of the final IMDS. As shown in Fig. 2 c, variation of the generating surface leads to variation in compatible IMDS shapes and variable spreading of the terminal boundaries for fixed block composition f, which we then optimize over (see Supplementary Note 4).

Skeletal strong segregation theory ansatz for double gyroid

We employ a variant of the medial SST approach to model the DG assemblies whose terminal sets are constrained to lie along the skeletal graphs of the double network, in a effort to closely recapitulate and compare to prior results from ref. Complete details are provided in Supplementary Note 5. In brief, we construct a variational set of skeletal tessellations via projection of the terminal positions in the tubular domains from the "web-like" medial surfaces of double-gyroids to the nearby positions along the skeletal graph. Finally, we optimize the free energy over the free parameters of the map that takes points on the tubular domain medial surface to points on the skeletal graph.

### Chemical shift encoding using asymmetric readout waveforms [^4fe21793]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe a new method for encoding chemical shift using asymmetric readout waveforms that enables more SNR-efficient fat/water imaging.

Methods

Chemical shift was encoded using asymmetric readout waveforms, rather than conventional shifted trapezoid readouts. Two asymmetric waveforms are described: a triangle and a spline. The concept was applied to a fat/water separated RARE sequence to increase sampling efficiency. The benefits were investigated through comparisons to shifted trapezoid readouts. Using asymmetric readout waveforms, the scan time was either shortened or maintained to increase SNR. A matched in-phase waveform is also described that aims to improve the SNR transfer function of the fat and water estimates. The sequence was demonstrated for cervical spine, musculoskeletal (MSK), and optic nerve applications at 3T and compared with conventional shifted readouts.

Results

By removing sequence dead times, scan times were shortened by 30% with maintained SNR. The shorter echo spacing also reduced T₂ blurring. Maintaining the scan times and using asymmetric readout waveforms achieved an SNR improvement in agreement with the prolonged sampling duration.

Conclusions

Asymmetric readout waveforms offer an additional degree of freedom in pulse sequence designs where chemical shift encoding is desired. This can be used to significantly shorten scan times or to increase SNR with maintained scan time.

### Architecture of the heme-translocating ccmABCD / E complex required for cytochrome C maturation [^93e261a7]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The dataset for Ccm E154Q ABCD (DDM) was processed using CryoSPARC. Patch motion correction and CTF estimation were done before particle picking using blob picker. The selected 2D classes were used as input for template picker. After the second round of 2D classification, selected 2D classes were used for an ab initio reconstruction. Several rounds of heterogenous and non-uniform refinement improved the final map resolution to 3.94 Å with a composition of Ccm(E154Q AB) 2 CD. A second dataset for Ccm E154Q ABCD (GDN) with 2.5 mM ATP added was processed analogously, to a final map resolution was 3.62 Å. The gold standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion was used as a map resolution estimate(Supplementary Fig. 6). Cryo-EM maps were visualized using UCSF ChimeraX.

A starting model for each subunit of CcmABCDE was generated by SWISS-MODEL, and rigid fitted into the density maps using ChimeraX. Model building was performed manually in Coot. After the release of AlphaFold2, a model of CcmE derived by this algorithm was used to fit the Ccm(ABCD) 2 E map. For all calculations, a local installation of AlphaFold 2.1 was used on a GPU Server. Improvements of the initial models were carried out with real-space refinement in PHENIX, the quality of the structure was validated by MolProbity. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Figures were generated with PyMOL (Schrödinger LLC) or UCSF ChimeraX.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Size compatibility and concentration dependent supramolecular host-guest interactions at interfaces [^2923b2ff]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Direct interaction force measurements

We measured the force–distance profiles for two opposing CD-coated surfaces as a function of DAd concentration using the SFA. The successful grafting of CD was further confirmed by the steric wall thickness (D sw, defined as D at F/R = 40 mN m −1). The thickness of β-CD–GPTMS was estimated to be ~2 nm, which approximately corresponds to the sum of the GPTMS (8–10 Å) and β-CD (7.8–15.3 Å) molecular lengths. Under pure distilled water (DI water) conditions, a D sw value of ~4.4 nm was obtained, confirming that β-CD–GPTMS was well grafted to both surfaces.

Figure 4b shows the force–distance profiles for symmetric β-CD-coated surfaces as a function of DAd concentration (C G = 0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mM). Without DAd, a purely repulsive force profile was observed for the β-CD coated surfaces (Fig. 4a). The decay length of the repulsive force (λ −1) was ~15.19 nm (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating the electrostatic repulsion between (vacant) negatively charged mica–mica surfaces upon approach. When D was less than 15 nm, λ −1 was ~2.14 nm, which originated from hydration repulsionand steric repulsion. In addition, no adhesion force (F ad) was observed at low C G (< 0.001 mM), indicating the existence of a critical association concentration (CAC) for DAd. Above the CAC (C G ≥ 0.001 mM), F ad abruptly increased with increasing C G until reaching a maximum (F ad / R = 38.02 mN m −1, W ad = 8.07 mJ m −2) at C G = 0.05 mM, which followed the Langmuir isotherm model (K a = 2.66 × 10 5 M −1) (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 2). When C G was increased further (> 0.05 mM), the adhesion plateaued or slightly decreased (Fig. 4f). This behavior indicates that all β-CD in this system was fully occupied with DAd molecules at a C G of ~0.05 mM (Fig. 4f).

From the measurements above, we see the vagina, not as a "tube", but rather as a "compressed rectangle" (Figure 2). All walls are compressed, unlike the VV, which can be kept partially open by the presence of the cervix (Figure 1). As noted above, the anterior and posterior walls widen more proximally, similar to an inverse trapezoid (Figure 3), as has been described for the shape of the perineum.

Figure 3
Inverse trapezoid

These clinical findings agree with previous MRI findings, that the anterior vaginal wall is trapezoid in shape with the narrow part at the pubis. We suggest the posterior wall is also inverse trapezoid in shape, narrow close to the hymen, and gradually widening up to the border with the VV (Figure 3). We support the theorythat this proximal widening is due, in part, to the influence of the VV supports, the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments (CL and USL), and in part to the bulk of the cervix pre‐hysterectomy.

The vagina comes from the Latin for "sheath", an organ of copulation that receives the penis during sexual intercourse. The MV thus provides a major role in accommodating the penis during copulation. The average length of the erect penis is 13.0–14.0 cm (5.1–5.5 in.)The TVL was reported by Masters and Johnsonto be 7–8 cm (identical to the 7.5 cm TVL above) increasing by around 53% to 11–12 cm in the stimulated state.

### Quiet echo planar imaging for functional and diffusion MRI [^2776fb00]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 5 d–f illustrates the calculated acoustic response spectra, obtained by multiplying the FRF with the simulated gradient spectra. The effects described above translate to much reduced harmonic spectral power for dSE‐QuEPI. In particular, the second harmonic for the read‐out atHz (Fig. 5 d, red arrow) and peaks from the phase encode gradient atHz (Fig. 5 e, green arrows) in dSE‐EPI, which produces the highest peak in the acoustic response, are completely eliminated for dSE‐QuEPI (Fig. 5 d, e). The z‐gradient (slice axis) acoustic response illustrates that the peak of the waveform spectrum around 1500 Hz is reduced (Fig. 5 f, blue arrow), resulting in a more then 5‐fold decrease in the response spectrum at this frequency and the peak around 1800 Hz is avoided (Fig. 5 f, black arrow). The FRFs on the corresponding gradient axes are shown in grey in the background of Figure 5 a–c together with the A‐weighting curve (Fig. 5 a only).

Gradient Waveform Simulations

The simulation results from the various waveforms for trapezoidal and sinusoidal read‐out and phase show decreased deviations from the planned waveforms. This is evident especially in the onsets of the trapezoids and the blips compared to the nearly achieved sinusoidal and constant waveforms. The differences between planned and achieved waveforms illustrate the higher precision of the modified QuEPI gradient waveforms. The simulation results are shown in. The required correction is, nevertheless, included into the gridding process as stated above.

Individualized treatment plan, therapeutic goals, and follow-up — staging of adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD) by obesity-related complications and diseases (ORCD) guides therapy. Determine stage of ABCD based on number and severity of ORCD with Stages of Obesity/ABCD defined as "STAGE 1 – No ORCD", "STAGE 2 – ≥ 1 Mild/moderate* ORCD", and "STAGE 3 – At least one severe* ORCD". Develop an individualized plan based on clinical staging, health goals, patient's values and preferences, and access to care, including to "Select therapeutic modality and intensity based on severity and stage of ABCD and the weight-loss target needed to ameliorate an individual's ORCD", to "Eliminate weight-promoting medications used to treat other comorbidities when possible", to "Consider psychological disorders, internalized weight bias, and social determinants of health in developing an individualized treatment plan", to "Individualize lifestyle and behavioral interventions", and to "Agree on obesity medication and/or surgery via shared decision making with each patient". For follow-up, the algorithm directs to "Optimize long-term health and quality of life", to "Manage the degree of weight loss for optimal health outcomes, and achieve therapeutic targets for amelioration of ORCD", to "Support patient and manage medication side effects", to "Determine long-term treatment via shared decision making to maintain weight loss, safety, and health benefits", and to "Adjust treatment over time as clinically needed", noting that "The optimal dose for maintaining long-term weight loss, balancing efficacy and safety, need not be the maximal clinically approved dose of obesity medications". A footnote clarifies severity grading: "The degree of severity for ORCD is based on clinical judgment, incorporating findings from the physical examination, laboratory testing, and/or other diagnostic procedures, as well as a person's symptomatology, in ways that apply to each individual".

### Size compatibility and concentration dependent supramolecular host-guest interactions at interfaces [^6223449f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Finally, to confirm the size dependency of the host–guest interaction between CD and Ad, force–distance profiles were obtained using surfaces modified with different types of CDs (α-, β-, and γ-CD). α-, β-, and γ-CDs have been used in various host–guest studies to evaluate cavity compatibility. At C G = 0 mM, the measured D sw values confirmed that the α- and γ-CD monolayers had thicknesses of ~5 nm, and the force profiles were purely repulsive, similar to that of β-CD (Fig. 4c). However, for the α- and γ-CD-modified surfaces, significant adhesion forces were not measured in the presence of DAd (C G = 0.05 mM). Thus, the bridging interactions were maximized in the β-CD system (Fig. 4d), as expected from the CD cavity diameters (α-CD: 4.7–5.3 Å, β-CD: 6.0–6.5 Å, and γ-CD: 7.5–8.3 Å)and the size of Ad (~6.5 Å). In the case of α-CD, the DAd molecules are too large to be inserted into α-CD cavities to form bridging interactions (Supplementary Fig. 9). Instead, the DAd molecules seemed to adsorb weakly to the exterior of α-CD, inducing an increase in D sw and a repulsive force upon compression. In contrast, although DAd can easily penetrate the large cavity of γ-CD, the cavity is too large to form stable CD–Ad inclusion complexes (Supplementary Fig. 9). Previous studies have reported that the K a value for Ad binding to β-CD (K a ~10 4–10 5 M −1) is more than 100 times larger than those for Ad binding to α-CD (K a ~10 2 M −1) and γ-CD (K a ~10 2–10 4 M −1).

### Morphometric analysis of the distal femur in total knee arthroplasty and native knees [^3cfec95e]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

Analysis of the morphology of the distal femur, and by extension of the femoral components in total knee arthroplasty (TKA), has largely been related to the aspect ratio, which represents the width of the femur. Little is known about variations in trapezoidicity (i.e. whether the femur is more rectangular or more trapezoidal). This study aimed to quantify additional morphological characteristics of the distal femur and identify anatomical features associated with higher risks of over- or under-sizing of components in TKA.

Methods

We analysed the shape of 114 arthritic knees at the time of primary TKA using the pre-operative CT scans. The aspect ratio and trapezoidicity ratio were quantified, and the post-operative prosthetic overhang was calculated. We compared the morphological characteristics with those of 12 TKA models.

Results

There was significant variation in both the aspect ratio and trapezoidicity ratio between individuals. Femoral trapezoidicity was mostly due to an inward curve of the medial cortex. Overhang was correlated with the aspect ratio (with a greater chance of overhang in narrow femurs), trapezoidicity ratio (with a greater chance in trapezoidal femurs), and the tibio-femoral angle (with a greater chance in valgus knees).

Discussion

This study shows that rectangular/trapezoidal variability of the distal femur cannot be ignored. Most of the femoral components which were tested appeared to be excessively rectangular when compared with the bony contours of the distal femur. These findings suggest that the design of TKA should be more concerned with matching the trapezoidal/rectangular shape of the native femur.

Take Home Message

The distal femur is considerably more trapezoidal than most femoral components, and therefore, care must be taken to avoid anterior prosthetic overhang in TKA

### Disease-specific B cell clones are shared between patients with Crohn's disease [^e080300b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

We further refined the number of CD-associated clones derived from LNs by focusing only on the top 3000 expanded clones per person, hypothesising that expanded clones in the setting of active disease are more likely to be relevant to pathogenesis. Selecting those that were present in two or more individuals and absent in the post-mortem samples reduced the number of CD-associated LN clones to 4698 from 12,108 clones. With this refined clone list, we similarly found greater enrichment of CD-associated LN clones in PBMCs in both the non-switched and switched repertoire (Supplementary Table 1 - cohort 2) (Supplementary Fig. 4e).

Portable fire extinguishers — ratings, placement, and operation are outlined for home use. Fire extinguishers have a number rating for Type A fires in gallons of water: 1 means 1¼ gallons of water; 2 means 2½ gallons of water; 3 means 3¾ gallons of water, and for Type B and Type C fires the number represents square feet, for example 2 equals 2 square feet and 5 equals 5 square feet. For multi-class units, an extinguisher labeled 2A5B is good for Type A fires with a 2½-gallon equivalence and for Type B fires with a 5-square-foot equivalency. A good extinguisher to have in each residential kitchen is a 2A10BC fire extinguisher. An extinguisher should be placed in the kitchen and in the garage or workshop, and each extinguisher should be installed in plain view near an escape route and away from potential fire hazards such as heating appliances. PASS is a simple acronym to remind you how to operate most fire extinguishers — pull, aim, squeeze, and sweep. Pull the pin at the top of the cylinder. Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire. Squeeze or press the handle. Sweep the contents from side to side at the base of the fire until it goes out. Shut off the extinguisher and then watch carefully for any rekindling of the fire.

### Dorsal dislocation of the trapezoid with carpo-metacarpal dislocations: a case report and a description of the "missing carpal sign" on radiographs [^7a3872e3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A case report of dorsal trapezoid dislocation with index and middle carpometacarpal dislocation is described.

Objectives

On review of the literature, this rare injury is often misdiagnosed on presentation, with difficulty in reviewing initial radiographs being a key factor.

Case Report

We present our case report of trapezoid dislocation and describe the "missing carpal sign" on radiographs as an aid to suspicion of diagnosis.

Conclusion

Trapezoid dislocation is an often-overlooked diagnosis; we present a sign to increase suspicion of injury and hence promote further investigation.

Degenerative arthritis at the articulation of the scaphoid, trapezium, and trapezoid (STT or triscaphe joint) is a common degenerative disease of the wrist. Pain and weakness with grip strength reduction and functional limitations when performing routine daily tasks are common complaints of patients with STT arthritis. Initial conservative treatments for STT arthritis include splinting, bracing, activity modification, anti-inflammatory medication, and steroid injections for pain relief. Failure of conservative treatment is the main indication for surgery, which may include distal scaphoid excision, with or without filling of the void after excision, trapeziectomy, STT arthrodesis, or STT implant arthroplasty.

### Trapezoid fractures: report of 11 cases [^b54c4842]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Trapezoid fractures are rare. Mostly single cases reports appear in the literature. The purpose of this study was to review 11 patients treated for trapezoid fractures at our center.

Methods

We reviewed all trapezoid fractures that presented over the past 10 years at our institution. We reviewed case notes regarding mechanism of injury, fracture pattern, mode of diagnosis, and time to diagnosis and treatment.

Results

We treated 11 patients for trapezoid fractures over the 10-year period. A correct diagnosis was made in 5 cases on initial evaluation. Most trapezoid fractures were diagnosed on computed tomographic scan. The fracture plane was predominantly sagittal. Coronal fractures could not be diagnosed on plain radiographs.

Conclusions

Fractures of the trapezoid should be suspected from the mechanism of injury, in particular, axial force, and from local tenderness. These fractures may be underdiagnosed. We recommend computed tomography rather than plain radiography alone in case of clinical suspicion.

### Differential diagnosis of the trapezoid-shaped head [^1a39fb6d]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To recognize several conditions that result in a trapezoid head shape and review and contrast their various physical findings.

Methods

A detailed review of all patients seen in the Craniofacial Clinic at the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, over a 10-year period from 1991 to 2001, with the diagnosis of craniosynostosis and plagiocephaly was performed. During this period, 690 patients had a surgical correction of craniosynostosis, and 1537 patients had posterior plagiocephaly.

Results and Conclusions

The shape of the head when viewed from the vertex position in an axial plane can be a significant diagnostic aid when evaluating a patient with plagiocephaly. Positional molding causes the vast majority of plagiocephaly. This deformational change results in a parallelogram-shaped head. A much more rare cause of plagiocephaly is lambdoid synostosis. With premature fusion of one of the lambdoid sutures, the head takes on a very characteristic trapezoid shape when viewed from the vertex. Unilateral coronal synostosis that occurs on the same side as either posterior positional molding or unilateral lambdoid synostosis will also result in the trapezoid head shape. Furthermore, on the rare occasion when anterior and posterior deformational plagiocephaly occurs on the same side, the trapezoid head shape may be the consequence. The choice of appropriate treatment modality requires systematic evaluation of the patient with a trapezoid-shaped head to determine the etiology of the deformation.

### Balancing data quality and bias: investigating functional connectivity exclusions in the adolescent brain cognitive development ℠ (ABCD study) across quality control pathways [^10018b85]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

3.4 Conclusion

We demonstrated that a wide variety of participant characteristics in the ABCD dataset are systematically related to QC‐related exclusions of rs‐fMRI data, and that this pattern holds at all reasonable levels of motion scrubbing and in two separate QC processing streams, extending previous work on this topic (Cosgrove et al.). Our results suggest that formal handling of missing data is necessary when examining rs‐fMRI data in large datasets such as ABCD. Furthermore, even given such handling, results should be interpreted cautiously given the strong possibility that exclusions are contingent on brain FC and thus biased. Additionally, these findings suggest that efforts to reduce QC related exclusion of rs‐fMRI data are important to ensure the accuracy and generalizability of findings resulting from rs‐fMRI studies in the future, especially including those at high risk of exclusion such as children. Finally, our results underscore the importance of transparency and availability of data quality related information in open datasets such as ABCD.
