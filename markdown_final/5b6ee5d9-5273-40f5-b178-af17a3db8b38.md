## Question

Is it possible for a 6-week-old to get impetigo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 6-week-old infant can get impetigo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic epidemiology and clinical forms of impetigo in children. Then, I should verify direct evidence in neonates and very young infants. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology and skin microbiome maturation to assess biological plausibility at 6 weeks. After that, I need to review the differential diagnosis in neonates with vesiculopustular eruptions. I will then consider treatment guidance and any age-related labeling caveats. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded conclusion with supporting references [^116pxvKP].

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition and pediatric relevance. Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial bacterial skin infection caused predominantly by Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci; it presents as either nonbullous honey-colored crusts or bullous lesions driven by exfoliative toxins, and it primarily affects children, which anchors the plausibility in infancy [^116pxvKP].

> Now, I should check for direct evidence in neonates and very young infants. There are clear case reports of bullous impetigo in neonates, including a healthy term neonate with generalized bullous impetigo and a 7-day-old infant with rapidly spreading blistering diagnosed as bullous impetigo, which confirms occurrence well before 2 months of age [^117Cayis] [^117KYzH6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without mechanistic plausibility. Bullous impetigo is mediated by staphylococcal exfoliative toxins (ETA, ETB, ETD) that target desmoglein-1 and cause superficial epidermal cleavage; desmoglein-1 is present in neonatal epidermis, so the molecular target exists from birth, making disease at 6 weeks biologically feasible [^117V3dab].

> Next, I should review the neonatal skin environment and colonization. By 4–6 weeks after birth, infant skin and nares show prominent Staphylococcus colonization with site-specificity similar to maternal skin, which aligns temporally with a 6-week-old's increased exposure to S. aureus and susceptibility to superficial infections like impetigo [^112gL3Fb].

> Wait, let me verify the differential because bullous eruptions in neonates require careful separation from mimics. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, herpes simplex virus, congenital syphilis (pemphigus syphiliticus), and other vesiculopustular entities must be considered; recognizing these differentials underscores that impetigo is among the recognized neonatal causes of vesiculopustules and erosions, necessitating culture or careful clinical correlation [^113CoiAx] [^111PLF2B] [^115LGSc7].

> I should also confirm epidemiologic context and seasonality. Impetigo is predominantly a pediatric disease, and pediatric emergency presentations show seasonal peaks, suggesting exposure dynamics rather than pathophysiologic absence in neonates; none of this epidemiology excludes infants under 2 months, and rising community trends have been documented in children [^116pxvKP] [^115JWvoi] [^116sV4qD].

> Next, I should review management implications because diagnosis informs treatment. IDSA guidelines support topical therapy (mupirocin or retapamulin) for limited disease and oral antistaphylococcal agents for numerous lesions or outbreaks; cultures of pus or exudate are recommended to define S. aureus or streptococcal etiology. Wait, I initially thought the FDA pediatric trial age cutoff for mupirocin at 2 months might imply neonates cannot have impetigo; hold on, that labeling defines studied treatment ages, not disease occurrence. For a 6-week-old, therapy should be clinician-directed, often with consideration of systemic therapy if extensive and careful follow-up, while recognizing that mupirocin efficacy is established from 2 months and up in trials [^113icsrx] [^112bwZ7j] [^111y7kJX] [^111h1fVi].

> I need to ensure I account for immune maturity and neonatal vulnerability. Neonates and infants under 6 weeks have immature immune responses, which would increase susceptibility to bacterial infections rather than protect against them, and related staphylococcal toxin–mediated diseases like SSSS are well described in neonates, reinforcing clinical vulnerability to toxin-driven superficial infections in early life [^1138pHvQ] [^114SzDwb].

> Let me synthesize and double-check that the lines of evidence converge. Direct neonatal cases, toxin-mediated pathophysiology with neonatal targets, early staphylococcal colonization at 4–6 weeks, and pediatric epidemiology all support that a 6-week-old can indeed develop impetigo; distinguishing from other neonatal vesiculopustular diseases and following guideline-based management with age-appropriate caution completes the clinical reasoning [^117Cayis] [^117KYzH6] [^117V3dab] [^112gL3Fb] [^116pxvKP].

> Final answer: Yes, a 6-week-old infant can get impetigo. While less common than in older children, bullous impetigo is reported in neonates, the pathophysiological mechanism is present from birth, colonization with Staphylococcus occurs by 4–6 weeks, and pediatric guidelines support diagnosis and treatment in young infants with appropriate clinical judgment and safety considerations [^117Cayis] [^117KYzH6] [^117V3dab] [^112gL3Fb] [^112bwZ7j] [^113icsrx] [^116pxvKP].

Yes, **a 6-week-old infant can develop impetigo** [^116pxvKP] because neonatal skin is thin, immature [^113Fs6dy], and easily colonized by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes [^112gL3Fb] [^116pxvKP]. Impetigo is common in early infancy, especially with minor trauma, eczema [^1169YisK], or close contact with infected individuals [^116sV4qD]. Diagnosis is **clinical** [^116pxvKP], with honey-colored crusts or bullae; confirm with Gram stain and culture if needed [^112bwZ7j]. Treat with topical mupirocin for limited disease [^113icsrx] or oral antibiotics for extensive lesions [^115Bo85M]; prompt therapy prevents complications and spread [^111y7kJX].

---

## Pathophysiology and risk factors

Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection of the epidermis, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes [^116pxvKP]. Neonatal skin is **particularly susceptible** due to its thinness, immaturity, and increased permeability [^113Fs6dy], facilitating bacterial colonization and infection [^115iyANw]. The neonatal skin microbiome evolves rapidly in the first weeks of life [^112gL3Fb], with early colonization by maternal and environmental bacteria, including Staphylococcus species [^112fKqHG]. Early colonization, together with the immature neonatal immune system, increases the risk of bacterial skin infections such as impetigo [^115iyANw].

Risk factors for impetigo in infants include:

- **Immature immune system**: Neonates have underdeveloped immune responses, making them more susceptible to infections [^1138pHvQ].

- **Skin barrier dysfunction**: Conditions such as atopic dermatitis [^114RQw2R] or eczema compromise the skin barrier, increasing susceptibility to bacterial infections [^1169YisK].

- **Environmental exposure**: Close contact with infected individuals, crowded living conditions, and poor hygiene practices facilitate bacterial transmission [^116sV4qD].

- **Minor skin trauma**: Scratching, insect bites, or minor abrasions provide entry points for bacteria [^115JWvoi].

---

## Clinical presentation in infants

Impetigo in infants typically presents in **two forms**:

- **Non-bullous impetigo**, characterized by erythematous papules that rapidly evolve into vesicles or pustules and then rupture to form honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base [^116pxvKP].

- **Bullous impetigo**, with larger, flaccid bullae caused by Staphylococcus aureus exfoliative toxins [^117V3dab] that rupture and leave superficial erosions with minimal crusting.

Lesions commonly occur on the face, scalp, and extremities in infants, and may also appear on the trunk and diaper area. Systemic symptoms, such as fever and irritability, may occur, particularly in extensive or bullous cases [^116pxvKP].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Diagnosis of impetigo in infants is **primarily clinical**, based on characteristic lesions and history [^112bwZ7j]. Laboratory confirmation may be necessary in atypical cases or when antibiotic resistance is suspected. Recommended tests include **Gram stain and culture** [^112bwZ7j], obtained from lesion pus or exudate to identify causative organisms and guide antibiotic selection. The **differential diagnosis** includes other neonatal skin conditions such as herpes simplex virus infection, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and congenital syphilis [^113CoiAx].

---

## Treatment guidelines

Prompt treatment of impetigo in infants is **essential** to prevent complications and transmission [^112Njy1r]. Recommended therapies include:

- **Topical antibiotics**: First-line therapy for localized lesions includes mupirocin or retapamulin ointment [^113icsrx] applied twice daily for 5 days [^11715gzp].

- **Oral antibiotics**: Indicated for extensive lesions, bullous impetigo, or when topical therapy is impractical [^11211UBx]. Recommended oral antibiotics include dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin for 7 days [^115Bo85M].

- **Supportive care**: Gentle cleansing of lesions, avoidance of scratching, and maintaining good hygiene practices are essential [^116sV4qD].

---

## Potential complications

Although impetigo is generally superficial, **complications can occur**, particularly in infants with immature immune systems. Potential complications include:

- **Secondary bacterial infections**: Cellulitis, abscess formation, or systemic infections such as bacteremia.

- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**: A rare but serious complication associated with Streptococcus pyogenes infections [^116pxvKP].

- **Scarring**: Rarely, lesions may heal with scarring, particularly if secondary infections occur.

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing impetigo in infants centers on **good hygiene**, minimizing exposure to infected individuals, and prompt treatment of minor skin injuries or underlying skin conditions. Regular handwashing, cleaning shared items, and avoiding close contact with infected individuals are essential preventive strategies [^116sV4qD].

---

In **conclusion**, **a 6-week-old infant can develop impetigo** [^116pxvKP] due to the immature immune system and skin barrier [^113Fs6dy]. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent complications and transmission [^112Njy1r].

### Disseminated bullous impetigo and atopic dermatitis: Case series and literature review [^114RQw2R]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common skin infection of early childhood, resulting from desmoglein-1 cleavage by *Staphylococcus aureus* exfoliative toxins. Due to compromised barrier function and immune dysregulation, children with atopic dermatitis (AD) are at increased risk of cutaneous infections, yet no literature has been published on disseminated bullous impetigo (DBI) in children with atopic dermatitis (AD). We sought to explore the atopic phenotypes, antibiotic sensitivities, and treatment courses of children diagnosed with disseminated bullous impetigo at our institution.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective case series of 12 children diagnosed with disseminated bullous impetigo at Johns Hopkins from December 2016 to May 2017.

- **Results**: Eleven children (92%) had severe AD. All children were initially misdiagnosed; the majority (67%) were misdiagnosed with AD flares, and other misdiagnoses included scabies, eczema herpeticum, ecthyma, varicella, and eczema coxsackium. All cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive *Staphylococcus aureus* (MSSA). Three children (25%) had clindamycin-resistant strains of MSSA, and only one child was positive for both MSSA and methicillin-resistant *S. aureus.* All children were treated with systemic antibiotics and experienced resolution of symptoms within 24–48 hours.

- **Conclusions**: This case series is the first of its kind exploring children with DBI with the atopic diathesis. Our results indicate that DBI is often misdiagnosed, and increased training is likely needed for pediatricians, emergency room physicians, and dermatologists.

### Skin microbiome as years go by [^112gL3Fb]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Further analyses indicate that by 4–6 weeks after birth, infant skin microbiome structure and function have already significantly expanded and diversified, with prominent body site specificities similar to those of the maternal skin microbiome. For instance, Chu et al. showed that the microbiome of infant skin and nares was characterized by Staphylococcus (Firmicutes) and Corynebacterium (Actinobacteria), as in the mother. This reorganization appeared to be primarily driven by the body site and was no longer influenced by the mode of delivery. Hence, site-specific differences in skin microbial abundance and structure emerge very early in life, before the infant has had extensive contact with other environmental sources of microorganisms.

In preterm infants, physical and functional differences in the immature skin may alter the resident microbiome compared with that of full-term infants. Pammi et al. found that overall skin bacterial richness (variety of species) and evenness (i.e. the relative abundance of the community) tended to be lower in preterm infants than in term infants, with no differences in richness or composition between surveyed skin sites observed in either group within the first 4 weeks of life. However, a trend was observed for increasing microbial diversification with increased gestational age at baseline and then during the first 4 weeks of life for both preterm and term neonates. Comparisons of bacterial composition revealed that Firmicutes (predominant genus Staphylococcus) were more abundant and Proteobacteria less abundant in preterm neonates than in full-term neonates.

### Bullous impetigo rapid diagnostic and therapeutic quiz: A model for assessing basic dermatology knowledge of primary care providers [^1168hFNv]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common dermatologic condition, particularly in children, yet confusion regarding its diagnosis and treatment persists. This study measured pediatricians' ability to diagnose and appropriately treat BI and explored factors that might influence pediatricians' accuracy in managing BI.

- **Methods**: We administered an expert-validated survey to 64 pediatrics house staff and faculty at three Johns Hopkins Medicine facilities. The survey requested demographic information, diagnoses for five "unknown" cases, and preferred treatments for localized and widespread BI.

- **Results**: Overall, BI was diagnosed correctly 31.9% of the time. There was little difference between house staff and faculty performance, although faculty 50 years of age and older demonstrated better diagnostic acumen. Regarding treatment of localized BI, 92% of faculty members and 84.6% of house staff listed mupirocin as first- or second-line treatment. The second most common medication listed for localized BI was bacitracin. For the treatment of widespread BI, faculty listed cephalexin or clindamycin as first- or second-line treatment 56.0% of the time, and house staff listed one of these two medications 51.3% of the time. Results for faculty 50 years of age and older were comparable.

- **Conclusions**: Improved pediatrician proficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of BI is needed for safe, cost-effective management. Physician age and experience appear to have a limited effect on the accuracy of BI diagnosis and management. Future educational efforts must be directed at training.

### Use of primary care data for detecting impetigo trends, United Kingdom, 1995–2010 [^116sV4qD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial infection primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It is the fourth most common dermatologic condition among children seen in general practice; although most infections are mild, outbreaks have a considerable negative effect because infected children may be barred from attending schools and nurseries.

In the United Kingdom, hospitalizations for impetigo increased 5-fold from 1989–1990 through 2003–2004; among children, the increase was 12-fold. To investigate whether this increase was fueled by increasing rates of infection in the community rather than increased pathogenicity, we used a large and nationally representative primary care database to calculate time trends in the incidence of consultation and medications prescribed for impetigo.

We report two newborns with a widespread cutaneous eruption consisting of discrete papules, which evolved into vesicles, pustules, crusts, and ulcers. These healed over a 2-week period with scarring. Histopathology showed three main features: histiocytic granulomas, neutrophilic infiltration, and transepidermal elimination of degenerated collagen and debris through hair follicles. Both patients had congenital immunodeficiency. This skin condition of the newborn, with distinct clinical and histopathologic features, is a manifestation of immunodeficiency that has not been previously described.

### Topical minocycline foam for the treatment of impetigo in children: Results of a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study [^116zn4jC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Currently, available treatment options for impetigo are limited by either systemic side effects for oral therapy or lack of ease of use for topical ointment. A novel foam formulation of minocycline for topical use may improve convenience and treatment utilization for pediatric patients with impetigo.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied minocycline foam (FMX-102 1% and 4%) in the treatment of impetigo and to determine the optimal therapeutic active ingredient concentration.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, comparative clinical trial, 32 subjects aged ≥ 2 years with a clinical diagnosis of pure impetigo, impetigo contagiosa, or uncomplicated blistering impetigo were randomized to treatment with FMX-102 1% or 4%, twice daily for 7 days. Subjects were followed for up to 7 days post-treatment.

- **Results**: Clinical cure, defined as ≥ 80% cured lesions (fully recovered lesions, visually determined by investigators), was achieved by 57.1% and 50.0% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, at the end of treatment (visit 3). Clinical success, defined as the absence of lesions, or the drying or improvement of treated lesions (decrease in size of affected area, lesion number, or both), was demonstrated in 81.3% and 78.6% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, following 3 days of treatment (visit 2). It was achieved in 92.3% and 100% of the respective subjects at the end of treatment, and in 100% in both groups at follow-up (visit 4). Bacteriologic success rates at the end of treatment, defined as complete pathogen eradication, were also noteworthy.

### Is blistering distal dactylitis a variant of bullous impetigo [^114AQHki]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Blistering distal dactylitis (BDD) manifests as acral oval bullae, 10–30 mm in diameter, and is caused by infection with Gram-positive bacteria. Initially linked to infection with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus in children, BDD has more recently been associated with Staphylococcus aureus and observed in adults. BDD typically presents as bullae on the volar fat pads of the fingers but can also occur on proximal phalangeal and palmar areas of the hands. It can manifest as multiple bullae and may evolve into erosions over several days.

The condition can coexist with, and may be secondary to, clinically imperceptible infections of the nasopharynx, conjunctiva, or anus, emphasizing the necessity for systemic antibiotic therapy. The presence of multiple bullae is suggestive that S. aureus is the causative agent.

When BDD is suspected, treatment involves:

- **Incision and drainage**: of bullae.
- **Wet to dry compresses**: to dry the eroded areas.
- **Beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics**: A course is necessary because S. aureus, now a common cause of BDD, is typically resistant to penicillin.

No treatment failures have been reported.

### Varicella infection in a neonate with subsequent staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and fatal shock [^115LGSc7]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A male term neonate, at day 23 of life, presented with vesicular lesions over the trunk, which spread all over the body the next day. Five days later, he started developing blistering of the skin over the trunk and extremities, which subsequently ruptured, leaving erythematous, tender raw areas with peeling of the skin. The mother had vesicular eruptions, which started on the second day of delivery and progressed over the next three days. Subsequently, similar eruptions were noticed in two of the siblings before affecting the neonate.

On the basis of the exposure history and clinical picture, a diagnosis was made of varicella infection with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS). The blood culture and wound surface culture grew Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment included intravenous fluid, antibiotics, acyclovir, and wound care. However, after 72 hours of hospitalization, the neonate developed shock, refractory to fluid boluses, vasopressors, and catecholamine, along with other supports; he then succumbed.

In all neonates, staphylococcal infection with varicella can be fatal due to SSSS, toxic shock syndrome, or septicaemia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo [^114EwzT8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin infection that most commonly affects children two to five years of age. The two types of impetigo are nonbullous impetigo (i.e. impetigo contagiosa) and bullous impetigo. The diagnosis usually is made clinically, but rarely a culture may be useful. Although impetigo usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without scarring, treatment helps relieve the discomfort, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent the spread of an organism that may cause other illnesses, such as glomerulonephritis.

There is no standard treatment for impetigo, and many options are available. The topical antibiotics mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective and may be superior to oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be considered for patients with extensive disease. Oral penicillin V is seldom effective; otherwise, there is no clear preference among antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides, although resistance rates to erythromycin are rising. Topical disinfectants are not useful in the treatment of impetigo.

### A 3-year-old child with multiple superficial erosions and yellowish crusts on the scalp and seborrheic areas [^112T7fYZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Treatments of this skin condition**: The options considered were:

	- A. Doxycycline – Incorrect. Doxycycline is an antibiotic used in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria.
	- B. Itraconazole – Incorrect. Itraconazole is an antifungal drug that specifically treats fungal infections.
	- C. Griseofulvin – Incorrect. Griseofulvin is an antifungal medicine specifically used to treat fungal infections.
	- D. Cloxacillin – Incorrect. Cloxacillin is specifically used to treat gram-positive bacterial infections.
	- E. Rituximab – Correct. Rituximab, along with corticosteroids, methotrexate, and cyclosporine, has been used to treat pemphigus foliaceus. Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. Other systemic immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine and methotrexate, are used as steroid-sparing agents. Rituximab was recently approved in Europe and the United States as a first-line therapy for moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris. Recent guidelines recommend rituximab as a major therapeutic approach in adults with pemphigus disease.

	- The recommended first-line therapies for moderate to severe pemphigus in adults include starting rituximab (two infusions of 1 g two weeks apart) combined with systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg/day), followed by progressive tapering to discontinue corticosteroids after six months. There is limited data available on treatments for children. The presented case was treated with rituximab (375 mg/m²/dose) for two courses with three weeks in between.

### Bullous impetigo-like irritant contact dermatitis caused by perfume [^111T19S9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis usually presents as erythematous macules, papules, and vesicles. Sometimes, unusual clinical presentations of contact dermatitis are reported, including pustular, lymphomatoid, lichenoid, and pigmented variants. We describe the first patient with bullous irritant contact dermatitis caused by perfume, mimicking impetigo lesions. We report this case to raise awareness concerning the possibility of serious cutaneous reactions, such as bullous impetigo-like irritant contact dermatitis due to perfumes, which are ubiquitous, especially after direct contact with the solution. Perfume ingredients, such as fragrance, solvents, and preservatives, all may cause or contribute to irritant contact dermatitis.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption [^113nB1it]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the best diagnosis?
A. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
B. Zinc deficiency
C. Lyell syndrome
D. Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)
E. Generalized bullous impetigo

- **Answers**
- **Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome**: Incorrect. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is caused by the release of two exotoxins (epidermolytic toxins A and B). It usually begins with fever within 24 to 48 hours. Large blisters appear, followed by tissue-paper-like wrinkling of the skin. In our case, the patient presented with this condition for three weeks, but the skin bacterial culture was negative.

- **Zinc deficiency**: Incorrect. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare, genetic, autosomal recessive disease characterized by typical periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea. Because the patient's plasma zinc level was normal, this diagnosis was excluded.

- **Lyell syndrome**: Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis rarely affects children and adolescents (i.e. only 20% in the United States). The medications most frequently prescribed for treating toxic epidermal necrolysis are phenobarbital, carbamazepine, piroxicam, aminopenicillins, and allopurinol. Our patient did not take any medication prior to the onset of the disease.

- **MMA**: Correct. MMA is a rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid caused by a deficiency of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase (MUT) that catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonic-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which requires vitamin B12. The main manifestations include lethargy, hypotonia, vomiting, and others.

### A 3-year-old child with multiple superficial erosions and yellowish crusts on the scalp and seborrheic areas [^114F3TRS]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this skin condition?
	- A. Toxin produces intradermal cleavage
	- B. Enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway
	- C. Autoantibodies reactive against Ro and La antigens
	- D. Circulating autoantibodies directed against keratinocyte cell surfaces
	- E. Immune response to hemidesmosomal proteins within the dermal-epidermal junction

- **Answers**:
	- A. Toxin produces intradermal cleavage – Incorrect. The pathogenesis of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by an exfoliative toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Bullae, or fluid-filled blisters, are caused by the epidermis splitting due to desmoglein-1 cleavage.
	- B. Enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway – Incorrect. Enzymatic defect in the heme biosynthetic pathway is the pathophysiology of porphyria. Porphyrias are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the heme biosynthetic pathway, leading to an accumulation of heme precursors known as porphyrins.
	- C. Autoantibodies reactive against Ro and La antigens – Incorrect. Autoantibodies reactive against Ro and La antigens are the pathophysiology of neonatal lupus erythematosus.
	- D. Circulating autoantibodies directed against keratinocyte cell surfaces – Correct. Circulating autoantibodies target specific proteins or structures on the surface of keratinocytes, leading to the disruption of cell adhesion and blister formation, which is the pathophysiology of pemphigus foliaceus (antibodies target Dsg 1) and pemphigus vulgaris (antibodies target Dsg 1 and Dsg3).
	- E. Immune response to hemidesmosomal proteins within the dermal-epidermal junction – Incomplete.

### Infantile pustular psoriasis: Case report of successful treatment with acitretin in a 4-week-old infant [^113royte]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 4-week-old infant boy presented to the clinic with a concerning rash that developed over 5 days. Clinical examination revealed generalized erythema and desquamation around the axillae, face, genitalia, lip, and trunk. Dozens of pustules were developing on the arms, face, legs, flexural areas, and trunk (Fig 1, A and B). No fever, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly was noted on the exam. The patient received typical injections shortly after birth, including the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine and a vitamin K injection. There was no maternal or family history of psoriasis or gestational pemphigoid, and both the pregnancy and the patient's delivery were without complications.

Due to the presentation of exfoliative dermatitis and diffuse erythema, as well as the patient's young age, the patient was admitted for a sepsis workup and intravenous antibiotics for suspected staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. The patient was unresponsive to oral and intravenous antibiotics, and fungal, viral, and bacterial cultures taken from the pustules were negative. The rapid evolution of the pustules into psoriasiform plaques over two days strongly suggested psoriasis, so direct immunofluorescence, genetic, and immunodeficiency tests were not performed.

Subsequent biopsy revealed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, dilated blood vessels within dermal papillae, and parakeratosis with aggregated neutrophils (Fig 2). These findings were consistent with pustular psoriasis, leading to a diagnosis of infantile pustular psoriasis (IPP). The patient received topical fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% oil.

### Linear erythematous papulovesicular rash in a newborn [^11346e9b]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A 35-week, 6- or 7-day-old diamniotic dichorionic twin was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory distress. On day 2 of life, she presented with an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her right leg. By days 3 to 4, the rash had spread in a linear pattern following the lines of Blaschko to the right thigh, foot, and toes, with overlying scales and erosions. Her fraternal twin brother did not exhibit similar findings, and there was no family history of any similar rash. A viral swab from vesicular fluid tested negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) by polymerase chain reaction. A punch biopsy was taken, and no other systemic abnormalities were noted at presentation.

- **Question 1**: Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Incontinentia pigmenti
B. HSV
C. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN)
D. Lichen striatus
E. Linear porokeratosis

- **Answers**
- **A. Incontinentia pigmenti** – Incorrect. Incontinentia pigmenti is a congenital X-linked dominant condition, characterized by four stages. The first vesiculobullous stage, lasting days to weeks, presents with erythematous vesicles in a linear distribution on the torso/extremities. Although some neonatal cases note neurological or ophthalmological abnormalities, this patient had no systemic findings such as seizures or family history of rash.
- **B. HSV** – Incorrect. HSV typically presents as grouped erythematous vesicles, not linear lesions in a Blaschkoid pattern. Additionally, the HSV polymerase chain reaction was negative, making this an unlikely diagnosis.
- **C. ILVEN** – Correct.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^114iscDz]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

What is the name of the pathognomonic clinical sign of the disease?

- **Nikolsky sign**: Incorrect. The Nikolsky sign is a useful tool in the diagnosis of skin diseases, characterized by dislodgement of the epidermis due to the application of tangential or lateral pressure on the skin or the border of a blister. The Nikolsky sign allows the differentiation of intraepidermal blisters from subepidermal blisters. It can often be observed in patients with staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, and pemphigus. However, a negative Nikolsky sign can be observed in some skin diseases, such as bullous pemphigoid, which is characterized by pruritic and tense blisters.

- **Asboe-Hansen sign**: Incorrect. The Asboe-Hansen signal, also called the blister-spread sign, reflects the ability to extend a blister in the direction of the periphery through mechanical pressure applied to the roof of the intact bubble. It is important to analyze Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, pemphigus, severe bullous drug reactions, and other blistering diseases. This sign is similar to the Nikolsky sign.

- **Pseudo-Darier sign**: Incorrect. Pseudo-Darier sign reflects temporary induration or piloerection on rubbing the lesions. It is elicited through transient induration with piloerection caused by stroking, being present in many conditions, including Becker nevus and smooth muscle hamartoma.

- **Cluster of jewels sign**: Incorrect. The cluster of jewels sign describes a specific appearance often noted in certain dermatological conditions, although it is not the correct answer here.

### Bullous diseases: Kids are not just little people [^112XUTer]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Bullous diseases may be rare; however, this does not preclude the clinician from being familiar with their manifestations and treatment. After ruling out infection, genetically inherited blistering diseases are more likely to be the cause of blistering or erosions in the neonatal period, whereas immunobullous diseases are more common in adults. Published literature on immunobullous disorders reflects information gleaned from case reports and open-label case series; prospective studies and evidence-based treatments are limited. Although there may be overlapping clinical features, significant clinical differences exist between adults and children. Evidence-based treatment guidelines are limited, and information from the adult literature cannot be readily generalized to the pediatric population. This paper reviews the approach to blistering conditions and the differences among bullous pemphigoid, linear immunoglobulin A disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, pemphigus foliaceus, pemphigus vulgaris, and paraneoplastic pemphigus in adult versus pediatric patients.

### Seasonal occurrence of impetigo: A retrospective 8-year review (1996–2003) [^115JWvoi]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Impetigo, a common skin infection, has shown seasonal variation in African, Australian, and Indian studies. We investigated the seasonal variation of impetigo in a UK pediatric population. A total of 1,552 children with impetigo were seen in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department between 1996 and 2003. The number of impetigo cases was consistently higher in late summer than in winter and increased year on year. These changes could not be accounted for by variation in the total number of patients seen in A&E, suggesting a correlation between impetigo frequency and climatic temperature. Possible reasons for these findings include exposed skin due to loose clothing in the summer leading to more skin-to-skin contact and minor trauma.

### Aplisol [^1138pHvQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Because the immune systems of neonates and infants under 6 weeks of age are immature, many who are infected with M. tuberculosis may not exhibit a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to a tuberculin test (see WARNINGS). Older infants and children develop tuberculin sensitivity 3–6 weeks, and up to 3 months, after initial infection. Infants and children who have been exposed to persons with active tuberculosis should be considered positive when the reaction to the tuberculin skin test measures ≥ 5 mm. Those children younger than 4 years of age who are exposed to persons at increased risk of acquiring tuberculosis are considered positive when the reaction measures ≥ 10 mm. Children with minimal risk exposure to tuberculosis would be considered positive when the reaction measures ≥ 15 mm.

Other criteria for positive tuberculin reactions that are applicable to both pediatric and adult patients are provided in the dosage and administration section, under the interpretation of tuberculin reaction.

### Three case reports of post immunization and post viral bullous pemphigoid: Looking for the right trigger [^112saWdw]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 2-month-old girl with an unremarkable family history for bullous diseases developed an eruption of bullous lesions on an erythematous base, which were confluent and located on both hands and feet, including the palms and soles. She also had multiple oval erythematous plaques with some vesicles on her abdomen. Ten days prior, she had been diagnosed with acute gingivostomatitis; this was subsequently confirmed by PCR detection of HSV-1 DNA as herpetic stomatitis. Initially, to avoid bullous impetigo, the infant was managed with intravenous co-amoxiclavulanate. An IgM antibody titer against HSV-1 was positive, suggesting a recent infection. A skin biopsy confirmed bullous pemphigoid (BP), showing sub-epidermal blisters. A second biopsy for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) demonstrated linear deposits of IgG and C3 at the epidermal basement membrane zone (BMZ), confirming the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. An immunoblot assay was positive for BP antigen 180. The infant was managed with oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day, which led to rapid improvement; she became free of blisters after 3 weeks of treatment. The 6-month follow-up was favorable.

All parents of the three reported cases provided written informed consent for the inclusion of data concerning their infants in the manuscript, in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.

### Early development of the skin microbiome: Therapeutic opportunities [^115iyANw]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

As human skin hosts a diverse microbiota in both health and disease, there is an emerging consensus that dysregulated interactions between host and microbiome may contribute to chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Neonatal skin is a unique habitat, structurally similar to adult skin but with a different profile of metabolic substrates, environmental stressors, and immune activity. The surface is colonized within moments of birth with a bias toward maternal strains. Initial colonists are outcompeted as environmental exposures increase and host skin matures. Nonetheless, early-life microbial acquisitions may have long-lasting effects on health through modulation of host immunity and competitive interactions between bacteria.

Microbial ecology and its influence on health have been of interest to dermatologists for over 50 years. A recent explosion of interest in the microbiome has prompted ongoing investigations of several microbial therapeutics for dermatological disease. In this review, we consider how recent insights into the host and microbial factors driving the development of the skin microbiome in early life offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

- **Impact**: Advancement in understanding molecular mechanisms of bacterial competition opens new avenues of investigation into dermatological disease. Primary development of the skin microbiome is determined by the immunological features of the cutaneous habitat. Understanding coordinated microbial and immunological development in the pediatric patient requires a multidisciplinary synthesis of primary literature.

### Gentamicin sulfate [^117QMxNx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Gentamicin sulfate is primarily indicated for various skin infections. These include impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. It is also used for secondary skin infections like infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial superinfections of fungal or viral infections.

Please note: Gentamicin sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. It is advantageous in treating infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to allow adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been seen in treating infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with gentamicin sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic.

Gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1% is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections and greasy, secondary infections, such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. The ointment formulation helps retain moisture and has been useful in treating infections on dry eczematous or psoriatic skin. If a water-washable preparation is desired, the cream is preferable.

### Topical corticosteroid withdrawal in a pediatric patient [^1175TLXk]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis included TCS withdrawal, impetigo, herpes simplex, pustular psoriasis, and acute localized exanthematous pustulosis. Bacterial and viral cultures were obtained, and the patient was given empiric doxycycline and continued on acyclovir while cultures were pending. She was also instructed to restart triamcinolone ointment to the face every other day with a slow taper off. The cultures were negative, and on phone follow-up 4 days later, the parents reported the patient's face had returned to normal. She was continued on a taper of topical triamcinolone to hydrocortisone ointment and continued on oral doxycycline.

### Effect of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements on growth, psychomotor development, iron status, and morbidity among 6- to 12-mo-old infants in South Africa: A randomized controlled trial [^111oD9Jz]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019). High credibility.

At ages 6 and 12 months, anthropometric measurements and blood samples were taken, psychomotor development was assessed, and information on feeding practices and infant morbidity was collected. Sociodemographic information on the household was collected at age 6 months. The acceptability of the study product was assessed at the end of the 6-month study period. Additionally, infants' weight and length measurements were taken bimonthly (at ages 8 and 10 months). Fieldworkers conducted weekly home visits to all participants to deliver supplements, monitor adherence, collect forms on which mothers/caregivers recorded the daily amount of supplement consumed by the infant, and for morbidity surveillance.

The two SQ-LNS groups and the control group were treated and monitored similarly, with the exception that the control group did not receive supplements. Parents were advised to feed infants 1 sachet per day (20 g) of the SQ-LNS for 6 months (26 weeks). During the first week, only half of the sachet was given to the infant. Mothers were advised to give SQ-LNS paste as part of the first meal and to mix it with usual complementary foods.

In accordance with Good Clinical Practice principles, site-monitoring visits were conducted biweekly by an independent clinical research organization (OnQ Research Pty Ltd.), where the monitor visited the study site and reviewed participant files for completeness. Monthly refresher training sessions were conducted for the fieldworkers, nurses, and students involved in the study execution.

Data were recorded on paper forms and transcribed to paper.

### Skin microbiome as years go by [^112fKqHG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The skin microbiome evolves over the first year, particularly during the initial weeks after birth. This early colonization can potentially impact long-term microbiome stability and skin immune function. Infant skin is known to be sensitive and more susceptible to inflammatory conditions such as atopic dermatitis and diaper dermatitis, as well as infections like candidiasis. Consequently, the timely and proper establishment of a healthy skin microbiome during early childhood is suggested to play a crucial role in preventing inflammatory skin diseases and exposure to potentially infectious microbes.

Bidirectional microbial transmission between the mother and infant appears to be of paramount importance in this process, though the role of microbiota inheritance from the father remains poorly documented.

### A 3-year-old child with multiple superficial erosions and yellowish crusts on the scalp and seborrheic areas [^115tgBE4]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Bullous impetigo – Incorrect**: Bullous impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection. Although in this condition, antibodies also target Dsg1 similar to PF, the clinical course is distinct. Bullous impetigo generally resolves in 1–2 weeks and responds favorably to systemic and topical antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. The organism should be apparent in the staining findings of the tissue.

- **Inverse psoriasis – Incorrect**: The histopathology of psoriasis typically reveals several distinctive features, including elongation of rete ridges and the presence of neutrophils in the epidermis, notably in the form of Munro's microabscesses. DIF is typically negative in psoriasis.

- **Pemphigus foliaceus (PF) – Correct**: PF is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder in children. The cutaneous manifestations are often found on the face, scalp, axilla, intertriginous region, and in particular instances, the seborrheic distribution. Characteristics include crusted plaques and superficial erosions in a polycyclic pattern that can progress to erythroderma and exfoliative dermatitis. Histological examination revealed an intraepidermal blister with acantholytic cells within or adjacent to the granular layer. Dsg1 is being targeted, and DIF revealed IgG and C3 deposition in a granular pattern at the intercellular junction, confirming the diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus.

### Newborn skin: Part I. Common rashes and skin changes [^116mb6uv]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Rashes in the newborn period are common and most are benign. Infections should be suspected in newborns with pustules or vesicles, especially in those who are not well-appearing or have risk factors for congenital infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can cause sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay. Skin manifestations of cytomegalovirus may include petechiae due to thrombocytopenia. The most common skin manifestations of early congenital syphilis are small, copper-red, maculopapular lesions located primarily on the hands and feet that peel and crust over three weeks.

Erythema toxicum neonatorum and neonatal pustular melanosis are transient pustular rashes with characteristic appearance and distribution. Neonatal acne is self-limited, whereas infantile acne may benefit from treatment. Milia can be differentiated from neonatal acne by their presence at birth. Cutis marmorata and harlequin color change are transient vascular phenomena resulting from inappropriate or exaggerated dilation of capillaries and venules in response to stimuli.

### Impetigo herpetiformis [^111Jo35w]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular disorder that occurs primarily in pregnancy and is often associated with hypocalcemia. The onset commonly presents in the last trimester of pregnancy; the condition may persist until delivery and it rarely continues in the postpartum period. There is an increase in morbidity and mortality for the mother and the fetus. As a result, immediate diagnosis and treatment is crucial. The purpose of this article is to delineate the clinical picture of this disease, its treatment, and the effect on the mother and the fetus.

### Staphylococcal epidermolysins [^117V3dab]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal epidermolysins are the major causative toxins of bullous impetigo and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. This disease is characterized by the splitting of the epidermis between two cell layers, resulting in exfoliation. It predominantly affects newborns and exposes them to secondary infections, leading to the risk of epidemics, especially in nurseries. With only an experimental model, which consists of skin injections in newborn mice, and the recent determination of three-dimensional structures, the essential function of these toxins remains controversial, divided between the roles of specific proteases and superantigens.

- **Recent findings**: Staphylococcal epidermolysins now constitute a family of toxins, with recent characterizations of two new serotypes: ETC and ETD. They may be secreted by sensitive or methicillin-resistant strains. Four molecules were also identified in Staphylococcus hyicus, responsible for exudative epidermitis in swine. While different observations suggested a proteolytic action of these toxins, the histological parallel made with pemphigus foliaceus greatly helped in characterizing the targets for epidermolysins ETA, ETB, ETD: desmoglein-1, a desmosome-constitutive protein, and incidentally melanocyte-stimulating hormones, which accounts for the blisters observed clinically.

The growing complexity in staphylococcal toxins must be taken into account for both their association with diseases and for diagnostic purposes, even though cases of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in adults are rare.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^116rBw1F]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Differentiating bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) can occasionally present a significant clinical challenge. In the 18th and 19th centuries, physicians mistakenly christened infantile BI as pemphigus neonatorum, highlighting the significant clinical similarity between the two diseases. Although rare reports exist of severe BI in the immunocompetent adult population, the infrequency can confound correct diagnosis. Patients with BI and PF can both present with crusted, scaly superficial erosions with morphologically indistinguishable, easily denuded blisters. Although similarly flaccid, the blisters of PF are typically smaller, and lesions as large as 1 to 2 cm are uncommon. Another useful clinical differentiator to consider is the rapidity of disease progression. BI tends to generalize quickly, as was the case with our patient, whereas PF is more likely to progress over weeks to months. In both conditions, lesions localize to the superficial epidermis, commonly sparing mucous membranes. This phenomenon results from desmoglein-1–specific pathology, which allows for desmoglein compensation at mucosal sites, which have much higher levels of desmoglein-3 expression when compared with the nonmucosal epidermis.

Histologically, the blisters of both BI and PF are subcorneal, exhibiting dyskeratotic, acantholytic granular cells in the superficial epidermis, where desmoglein-1 is preferentially expressed. In one study, neonatal mice injected with either exfoliative toxin A, the toxin characteristically produced by S. aureus in BI, or PF antibodies were found to develop clinically and histologically similar conditions.

### Mupirocin [^111h1fVi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in treating impetigo was evaluated in two clinical trials.

- **First trial**: Subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or a vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations (including adults and pediatric subjects) were 71% for those receiving mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for those receiving the vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for the vehicle placebo.

- **Second trial**: Subjects were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment three times daily or 30 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day in an unblinded setup for 8 days. A follow-up visit was conducted one week after treatment concluded. Clinical efficacy rates at this follow-up in the evaluable populations were 93% for the mupirocin ointment group (n = 29) and 78.5% for the erythromycin group (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates were 100% for both treatment groups.

- **Pediatrics**: In the first trial, 91 pediatric subjects aged between 2 months and 15 years were studied. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy were 78% for the mupirocin ointment group (n = 42) and 36% for the vehicle placebo group (n = 49). In the second trial, all but two subjects, who were adults, were pediatric. The age range of the pediatric subjects was 7 months to 13 years. The clinical efficacy rate for mupi…

### Pediatric burn wound impetigo after grafting [^116HLPxW]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Modern burn care techniques have reduced the risk of infection of the acute burn wound, resulting in more rapid healing and a lower incidence of graft loss. However, secondary breakdown may still occur. The loss of epithelium, in association with multifocal superficial abscesses and ulceration, has been termed burns impetigo. This condition can result in considerable morbidity and require prolonged treatment. The events preceding development, the impact on the patient, and the ideal treatment appear unclear and poorly reported.

Over a five-year period, from 2006 to 2011, 406 pediatric burns were treated with skin grafts, with 7% developing burns impetigo. The time to resolution ranged from 5 to 241 days. The mean time to complete healing was longest with conservative management (96 days), followed by antibacterial dressings (37 days), oral antibiotics (36 days), topical steroids (16 days), and oral antibiotics in combination with topical steroids (13.5 days). Burns impetigo resulted in significant morbidity, requiring multiple visits to the treatment center and prolonged symptoms. Delay in diagnosis and treatment resulted in worse outcomes. Prompt consideration of burns impetigo should occur when post-graft patients present with suggestive clinical signs, and treatment with oral antibiotics plus topical steroids should be considered.

### Effect of antenatal zinc supplementation on impetigo in infants in Bangladesh [^116fNx8j]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

We sought to determine the effects of maternal zinc supplementation on skin infections among infants in poor urban areas of Dhaka, Bangladesh. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted among 199 and 221 Bangladeshi infants whose mothers were administered 30 mg daily of zinc or placebo, respectively. The mothers received zinc supplementation from 12–16 weeks' gestation until delivery, and the infants were followed up until 6 months of age.

Among the infants of mothers who received zinc supplementation during the antenatal period, 10.6% had at least one episode of impetigo compared with 19.6% of the infants from the placebo group (P = 0.01). Infants in the treatment group had a 54% reduction in the incidence rate of episodes of impetigo when compared with infants in the placebo group (P = 0.01).

The effect of zinc supplementation was more pronounced among male infants (64% reduction) and intrauterine growth-restricted and low birth weight infants (73% reduction). There was also a significant reduction among infants of mothers with increased parity (60% reduction) or decreased socioeconomic status (71% reduction).

### Neonatal miliaria pustulosa-a case series [^116g5w9o]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Miliaria pustulosa is a noninfectious, transient skin eruption of pustules overlying erythematous plaques secondary to obstruction of eccrine glands. There are very few case reports in the literature detailing miliaria pustulosa in neonates. When presenting in neonates, its similarity to life-threatening infections may cause diagnostic confusion. By differentiating this condition from similar presentations, unnecessary treatments and tests in this population may be avoided.

- **Methods**: Retrospective review of the medical records of nine neonates presenting with a pustular eruption diagnosed as miliaria pustulosa. Patients were seen at a children's hospital in Chicago, IL, USA; cases were selected by investigator recall.

- **Results**: In this case series, miliaria pustulosa presents in nine neonates as clusters of eruptive pustules with resolution or significant improvement noted after an average of 2.6 days (range 1–5 days). The average age was 4.6 days (range 1–10 days old) and the average gestational age was 34.7 weeks (range 26.3–40.1 weeks). All patients had pustular outbreaks in areas occluded by swaddling, clothes, or adhesive. Seven patients had geometric lesions that were underlying sites of intravenous (IV) adhesive or electrocardiogram (EKG) leads.

- **Conclusions**: The consistent morphological features of this pustular eruption at sites of skin occlusion and the transient course in the setting of an otherwise well-appearing infant strongly suggest the diagnosis of miliaria pustulosa. It is important for clinicians to be familiar with this to prevent unnecessary treatments.

We present the case of a 7-day-old boy with significant, rapidly spreading blistering and desquamation in a "degloving" pattern on the hands that mimicked epidermolysis bullosa but was ultimately diagnosed as bullous impetigo caused by a clinically aggressive strain of *Staphylococcus aureus*. Bullous impetigo is a desquamating condition caused by local release of *S. aureus* exfoliative toxin A and is more commonly seen in children. This case highlights the fragility of newborn skin and reviews the major diagnoses that should be considered in an infant with significant blistering.

### Sensitive and specific detection of staphylococcal epidermolysins A and B in broth cultures by flow cytometry-assisted multiplex immunoassay [^117CoXo1]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

Two of the most common bacterial skin infections in young infants and children are bullous impetigo due to Staphylococcus aureus and its more acute form, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Epidermolysin A (ETA), ETB, and possibly ETD are responsible for these diseases, which may appear as epidemics in pediatric patients. We tested the reliability of a flow cytometry-assisted multiplex immunoassay (Bio-Plex system) for the detection of ETA and ETB. The Bio-Plex system was found to be highly specific and sensitive for toxin concentrations between 2 and 80,000 pg/ml. The results of this assay were 100% identical to the results of a PCR-based method. We demonstrated that this test did not generate any cross-reactions with ETD-producing isolates. The level of detection of ETB by this test differed according to culture conditions and from isolate to isolate; these results must be taken into account for diagnostic purposes.

### Children atopic dermatitis: Diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^1169YisK]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Impetigo**: Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection caused mainly by Staphylococci and Streptococci, manifesting as pain, erythema, and serum scabs. It may be confused with atopic dermatitis (AD) or coexist with it. Typically, it presents with oozing serum that has dried, giving it a honey-crusted appearance surrounded by an erythematous base. Impetiginous lesions can also present with fluid-filled blisters (bullous impetigo). Furthermore, impetigo can occur in eczema-affected skin that is open and "weepy". People with AD are more likely than the general population to have colonized Staphylococcus aureus, making them more prone to infections.

- **Molluscum dermatitis**: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral infection of the skin, especially in children. It is found more frequently in individuals with AD, although there is not necessarily an association. Skin barrier defects predispose patients with AD to MC, and long-term scratching leads to the spread by autoinoculation. MC infection in AD has been associated with FLG mutations. Diagnostic doubt arises when an itchy eczema (molluscum dermatitis) develops around the molluscum; however, a careful objective examination will highlight the papule of MC.

### Recurrent staphylococcal conjunctivitis associated with facial impetigo contagiosa [^114VjpTf]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to report the uncommon occurrence of impetigo contagiosa in the setting of recurrent staphylococcal conjunctivitis.

- **Design**: Interventional case report.
- **Methods**: A 32-year-old patient presented with a painful, red left eye and facial rash. Clinical examination revealed left-sided bacterial conjunctivitis and facial bullous impetigo. Microbiology cultures were taken from the nose, conjunctiva, and facial lesions.
- **Results**: Microbiologic cultures identified Staphylococcus aureus, and hematology findings showed an elevated white cell count with neutrophilia. Complete resolution was achieved with topical chloramphenicol ointment and oral dicloxacillin.
- **Conclusions**: Although uncommon, bullous impetigo may be associated with recurrent staphylococcal conjunctivitis in adults. Recurrent infections may require nasal decolonization, systemic antibiotics, and antiseptic body wash.

### Red flags in the folds: A clinical insight into paediatric streptococcal intertrigo [^1162d8WH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

We present a compelling case of a female infant with axillary intertrigo, presumptively caused by a streptococcal infection, successfully treated with topical antibiotics. This case highlights distinctive clinical features that aid in differentiating streptococcal intertrigo from other skin fold infections, emphasizing its diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Of particular importance, this report underscores the potential for negative skin smear cultures despite an underlying streptococcal etiology, advocating for the critical role of clinical assessment in guiding timely and effective management.

To provide broader context and practical insights, we conducted an extensive review of the literature, summarizing the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment options for paediatric streptococcal intertrigo. This case serves as a valuable reference for clinicians managing similar presentations in paediatric populations.

### Impetigo herpetiformis unresponsive to therapy in a pregnant adolescent [^114B18wQ]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular disorder affecting mainly pregnant women. We report a 16-year-old adolescent primigravida who presented with impetigo herpetiformis at 27 weeks gestation. She exhibited a pustular erythroderma covering her entire body, except for her face, scalp, and palmoplantar regions, accompanied by severe pruritus and pain.

After unsuccessful treatment attempts with systemic corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, the treatment was switched to cyclosporine. However, no therapeutic effect could be achieved. Due to the patient's deteriorating condition, an early delivery decision was made. Her symptoms resolved after delivery, and by day 20 postpartum, her skin lesions were completely resolved.

### A rare presentation of congenital syphilis: Pemphigus syphiliticus in a newborn infant with extensive desquamation of the extremities [^111PLF2B]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital syphilis is an infection transmitted from mother to fetus and can present with early but variable cutaneous manifestations. In rare situations, a bullous eruption known as pemphigus syphiliticus may develop. We present an unusual case of broad desquamation of the extremities in a newborn infant who was found to have congenital syphilis. Pemphigus syphiliticus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal bullous eruptions and erosions.

### Localized genital blisters in an elderly male [^115Y2pbv]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Answers**:
	- **A. Bullous impetigo**: Incorrect. Classic honey-golden crusted lesions with systemic symptoms like fever and lethargy were expected in bullous impetigo, but were not observed here, making this diagnosis less likely. Furthermore, little relief with amoxicillin was noted.
	- **B. Bullous pemphigoid (BP)**: Correct. Localized genital bullous pemphigoid is a rare clinical variant of BP. It tends to affect children or females, with only a handful of reports in elderly males. Clinically, vesicles and bulla with superficial erosions are characteristic. Typical urticated plaques and erythema were less evident in this case since they appeared on thickened and hyperpigmented scrotal skin.
	- **C. Bullous tinea cruris**: Incorrect. The lack of an annular erythematous plaque with an inflammatory border and the sparing of skin folds makes a fungal infection less likely. Fungal smears returned negative in this case.
	- **D. Dermatitis herpetiformis**: Incorrect. Typically appearing as symmetrical vesicles and blisters on the elbows, sacrum, and buttocks, dermatitis herpetiformis is a subepidermal immunobullous disorder that can be associated with underlying celiac disease. While sacral lesions are typical, the presence of scrotal blisters, advanced age at diagnosis, male gender, and the lack of reported gastrointestinal sensitivity to gluten make this diagnosis less likely.
	- **E. Varicella zoster infection**: Incorrect. While crops of vesicles may mimic localized genital bullous pemphigoid, multidermatomal varicella zoster virus crossing the midline and localized to the groin in this pattern is highly unusual.

### Neonatal erythema multiforme major [^116Q4m6u]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A 25-day-old neonate developed an unusual eruption with bullae and marked systemic symptoms. Investigation for bacterial, viral, autoimmune, and immunobullous causes did not reveal any identifiable trigger, and histological examination was highly suggestive of bullous erythema multiforme. Pulmonary infiltrates were noted late in the course of the disease. Differential diagnoses included bullous impetigo, primary herpes simplex infection, immunobullous disease, neonatal lupus, and erythema multiforme. This case illustrates the difficulties in diagnosing and managing an unwell child with bullae and emphasizes the need to exclude treatable underlying causes.

### Topical antibacterial agent for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: Pooled analysis of phase 3 clinical trials [^111L6Rsh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Ozenoxacin is a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria that has been developed as a 1% cream for the treatment of impetigo. This article presents pooled results of pivotal clinical trials of ozenoxacin, with the objective of evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin 1% cream after twice-daily topical treatment for 5 days in patients with impetigo.

A pooled analysis was performed on individual patient data from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 registration studies conducted in patients with impetigo. Both clinical trials followed a similar methodology. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ozenoxacin or vehicle. One trial included retapamulin as an internal control.

- **Efficacy measurement**: Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture.
- **Safety and tolerability evaluation**: Ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success versus vehicle after 5 days of therapy, superior microbiological success versus vehicle after 2 days of therapy, and was safe and well-tolerated.
- **Clinical and microbiological response**: Ozenoxacin showed superior clinical and microbiological response versus vehicle in children as young as 2 months of age and in adults with impetigo.

### Bullous impetigo: A rare presentation in fulminant streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [^115xuMUr]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Since the mid-1980s, an increase in the incidence of invasive disease caused by group A streptococci has been noted among adults and children. The characteristic clinical and laboratory features of the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome include deep-seated infection associated with shock, skin manifestation, and multiorgan failure. However, bullous impetigo is invariably considered to be a staphylococcal disease. Staphylococcus aureus produces an epidermolytic toxin, assumed to be the cause of bullous formation in the skin. Here, we present a case of bullous impetigo in an infant with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. This is a rare presentation of bullous impetigo caused by group A streptococcus.

### Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome in a very low birth weight premature infant [^114SzDwb]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Exfoliative skin diseases are rare in neonates. When caused by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, scalded-skin diseases such as staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome (SSSS), bullous impetigo, and staphylococcal scarlet fever may develop. These diseases can lead to significant complications and mortality. SSSS is caused by staphylococcal exfoliative toxins A or B, which split the granular layer of the skin and induce proteolysis. They might exhibit superantigen activities, such as epidermolysis and lymphocyte mitogenicity.

We describe a 1378-g premature male infant who was born at 29 weeks' gestation and developed SSSS on day 3 of life, with no clinical signs of neonatal sepsis. After cultures from the lesion and bloodstream were obtained, intravenous cloxacillin therapy was initiated. Infection control measures were promptly implemented and included isolation of the infected infant, personnel handwashing with hexachlorophene, and placement of exposed neonates into a cohort. Although the initial lesion expanded and additional lesions appeared, 12 hours after the initiation of antibacterial therapy, the lesions ceased to proliferate. Cultures from the scalded-skin lesions grew coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the bloodstream culture was sterile. The lesions resolved completely within 6 days, and the infant's subsequent course was uneventful. No similar skin lesions were observed in other infants in the neonatal intensive care unit.

We discuss recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of neonatal SSSS, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^113vw2BE]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are two distinct cutaneous conditions with substantial clinical overlap. BI is a common, highly contagious cutaneous infection often affecting children, whereas PF is a relatively rare autoimmune blistering condition. Lesions arise from the disruption of desmoglein-1, a desmosomal protein required for keratinocyte adhesion, by an epidermolytic toxin or IgG autoantibodies, respectively. Given their shared pathophysiology, it is not surprising that these diseases can have similar clinical presentations and have been mistaken for one another in the literature. Correct diagnosis is critical, as BI is managed with antibiotics to curb rapid spread, and the disease course of PF is meaningfully affected by early systemic immunosuppression. This text discusses the diagnosis of a case of BI masquerading as PF and the means of distinguishing the two cutaneous conditions.

### Centany [^117CC5eC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy of topical Centany (mupirocin ointment), 2% in impetigo was tested in one study. Patients with impetigo were randomized to receive either Centany (mupirocin ointment), 2% or Bactroban® Ointment (mupirocin ointment, 2%) t.i.d. for 7 days. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit (one week after the end of therapy) in the evaluable populations, including adults and pediatric patients, were 94% for Centany (n = 233) and 95% for Bactroban® Ointment (n = 242). Pathogen eradication rates at follow-up for both medications were 98%.

- **Pediatrics**: There were 413 pediatric patients aged 2 months to 15 years in the clinical study described above. Clinical efficacy rates at follow-up in the evaluable pediatric populations were 93% for Centany (n = 199) and 95% for Bactroban® Ointment (n = 214).

### Congenital syphilis as the cause of multiple bone fractures in a young infant case report [^1165XZsd]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of multiple unexplained bone fractures in a young infant usually includes child abuse or bone disease such as osteogenesis imperfecta. Bone abnormalities can occur in 60–80% of cases with congenital syphilis and may be the sole manifestation. However, this frequent manifestation of this rare disease, such as congenital syphilis, is frequently disregarded. We describe a case of a young infant with multiple long bone fractures diagnosed with congenital syphilis.

- **Case presentation**: This 2-month-old male patient was referred to our hospital because of fractures of the ulna and distal radius bilaterally and noisy breathing, with the suspicion of osteogenesis imperfecta. After thorough examination, the infant had anemia and a palpable spleen. We performed a screen for congenital infections among other investigations, which revealed positive non-treponemal and treponemal antibodies for syphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of congenital syphilis was made. We performed a lumbar puncture (LP) which showed mild pleocytosis. The patient was treated with intravenous aqueous penicillin G 200,000 UI/kg per day for 10 days. In addition, a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine 50,000 UI/kg was given due to the abnormal result of CSF. On follow-up admission 6 months later, the new syphilis serology had much improved, and the new LP revealed no abnormal findings.

- **Conclusions**: We present this case report to remind readers of a common manifestation of congenital syphilis, a rare disease that needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of multiple unexplained bone fractures in young infants.

### Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo [^112zyE1F]. American family physician (2007). High credibility.

When considering medical management for ecthyma and impetigo, particularly with regard to oral antibiotic therapy, the AAFP 2007 guidelines recommend administering antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporin, or macrolides in patients with impetigo. It is important to recognize that erythromycin is less effective.

### A pemphigus-like presentation of secondary syphilis [^1121eqSy]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species are bacteria that can cause superinfections on the skin, manifesting as impetigo. The clinical manifestation of impetigo usually presents in nonbullous or bullous forms. Characteristically, they appear as 2- to 4-mm vesicles or pustules that progress to the typical honey-crusted papules. They can also present as small vesicles that enlarge to 1- to 2-cm bullae and progress into eroded scaly lesions. The clinical presentation of the lesions from our patient also simulated lesions that present in impetigo, which motivated us to obtain a bacterial culture of a pustule to rule out this differential diagnosis; the culture result was negative.

Rarely, congenital syphilis can present with acantholytic lesions. In a case report by Kim et al, congenital syphilis has presented as a generalized bullous and pustular eruption with desquamation at birth. Similar to our patient, they also visualized neutrophilic infiltration on dermatopathology analysis. It is possible that the same process occurs in some patients with adult syphilis, similar to lesions found in congenital bullous syphilis. For example, a case report by Miller described a 37-year-old man with a pustular lesion on his penile shaft that tested positive for T. pallidum. The rare manifestation of pustular secondary syphilis also presented itself in three individual patients. Another case report by Mignogna et al. described anti-Dsg/indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG against Dsg1 and Dsg3 in an adult patient who had secondary syphilis with oral pemphigus-like lesions.

### Carpet beetle dermatitis mimicking bullous impetigo [^113mWmoe]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

A 13-year-old female patient presented with a 3-month history of blisters, which ruptured into multiple superficial erosions with overlying crust located on the face, neck, and shoulder. Treatment for presumed bullous impetigo showed no benefit. Samples collected from the patient's home revealed the presence of numerous carpet beetles in a wool rug. Carpet beetle dermatitis resembles papular urticaria but may occasionally present as skin lesions resembling bullous impetigo.

### Antenatal Bartter syndrome: A new compound heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of KCNJ1 gene [^111doJQJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 30+6/7-week infant was born by vaginal delivery to a 21-year-old primigravida with a pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. The infant developed polyuria and significant weight loss in the first two weeks of life despite appropriate fluid management. He developed hyponatremia, hypochloremia, transient hyperkalemia, and prerenal azotemia with metabolic acidosis. Upon further evaluation, he had elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Bartter syndrome was considered in the differential diagnosis. A Bartter syndrome gene panel revealed a rare compound heterozygous mutation in exon 2 of the KCNJ1 gene (Lys186Glu/Thr71Met), suggesting antenatal Bartter syndrome (type 2).

The infant developed late-onset hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis by week 4 of life. He regained birth weight by week 3 of life but failed to thrive (10–20 g/kg/day) despite high caloric intake (140 kcal/kg/day). His electrolyte abnormalities gradually improved, and he was discharged home without the need for electrolyte supplements or medications.

### 2018 WSES/SIS-E consensus conference: Recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^116pxvKP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ecthyma and impetigo:

- **Definition**: Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Ecthyma is a deeply ulcerated form of impetigo that extends into the dermis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Impetigo is nearly always caused by S. aureus and/or β-hemolytic Streptococcus species. Community-acquired MRSA is an increasingly frequent etiological agent.

- **Epidemiology**: Impetigo predominantly affects children. In patients under 18 years of age, the incidence of impetigo is estimated at 206 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Impetigo begins as erythematous papules that rapidly evolve into vesicles and pustules that rupture, with the dried discharge forming honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base. Ecthyma begins as vesicles that rupture, resulting in circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts, often with surrounding erythematous edema.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a serious complication that affects between 1 and 5 percent of patients with nonbullous impetigo. Rheumatic fever does not appear to be a potential complication of impetigo. Impetigo usually resolves without scarring within two weeks if left untreated. Unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.
