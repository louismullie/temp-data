## Question

necrotizing pneumonia in pediatric

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about necrotizing pneumonia in pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining necrotizing pneumonia and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and microbiology. Next, I will review clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria, including imaging. After that, I need to examine management principles, including antibiotics, pleural procedures, and surgery. I will then consider special populations and long-term outcomes. Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I double-check key claims against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia characterized by progressive parenchymal necrosis, liquefaction, and cavity formation, often with impaired perfusion that limits antibiotic penetration and perpetuates infection, and it sits on a spectrum between uncomplicated consolidation and lung abscess or pulmonary gangrene, which explains the prolonged clinical course and risk of complications such as bronchopleural fistula and empyema [^fbcea883] [^b3768067] [^a3e672c6].

> I need to check the epidemiology carefully. Incidence estimates vary with ascertainment and imaging use; contemporary series suggest necrotizing pneumonia occurs in roughly 0.8–7% of hospitalized pediatric community-acquired pneumonia, with most cases in children under 5 years, and some reports note an apparent rise likely reflecting increased CT utilization rather than a true increase in disease burden, so I should be cautious not to overstate incidence trends without context [^9d6a8ea8] [^0fb4eb04] [^7865d63c].

> Next, I should review microbiology and make sure I align with the best available data. Historically, Streptococcus pneumoniae predominated, but more recent cohorts show Staphylococcus aureus, including Panton-Valentine leukocidin–positive strains, as a leading cause in some series, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa more prominent in children with complex chronic conditions; Mycoplasma pneumoniae can rarely cause necrotizing pneumonitis, and macrolide resistance complicates management in those cases, so I need to ensure empiric coverage accounts for local epidemiology and host risk factors [^5003f95a] [^83a51c16] [^871551ba] [^04d940e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical features without anchoring to guidelines. The presentation mirrors severe pneumonia but with persistent fever, tachypnea, chest pain, and systemic toxicity despite appropriate antibiotics; failure to improve after 48–72 hours of therapy should prompt evaluation for complications such as necrotizing pneumonia, empyema, or abscess, and pleural involvement is common, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in nonresponders [^fbcea883] [^1de045d8] [^362b14fc].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, and I need to double-check the imaging hierarchy. Chest radiography is first-line to screen for complications, but ultrasound excels at detecting and characterizing pleural effusions and guiding interventions, whereas contrast-enhanced CT is the most sensitive modality for detecting necrosis, cavitary change, and bronchopleural fistula; contrast-enhanced ultrasound is an emerging, radiation-sparing adjunct that can identify nonenhancing necrotic foci within consolidations, but it is not yet a replacement for CT when surgical planning is needed [^e7bc637f] [^45d03e9a] [^01b8dbbd] [^44ae8324] [^c963f9bc].

> Let me think about microbiologic diagnosis pragmatically. Blood, sputum, and especially pleural fluid should be sent for culture and susceptibility testing when available; in severe cases, molecular diagnostics and antigen testing can improve yield, and in suspected MRSA, a nasal swab can inform empiric decisions, though I should confirm that local validation supports its use in children without HIV risk factors before relying on it to withhold MRSA coverage [^f31769ec] [^6523d624].

> Now, I should confirm management principles. Prolonged intravenous antibiotics are foundational, with typical total durations ranging from about 2–6 weeks, often 3–4 weeks total, transitioning to oral therapy once the child is afebrile, clinically stable, and inflammatory markers are improving; empiric therapy should cover S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, adding MRSA coverage when risk factors or severity warrant, and in severe S. aureus disease, adding clindamycin to vancomycin or using linezolid alone can mitigate toxin production, though high-quality pediatric data are limited and decisions should be individualized [^fbcea883] [^2c1cc3c6] [^6523d624] [^f92a72dc].

> Wait, let me verify the role of pleural procedures. Most children with necrotizing pneumonia have pleural involvement, and ultrasound-guided chest drainage is frequently required; intrapleural fibrinolysis can reduce the need for surgery in loculated empyema, but I should balance this against potential risks and tailor to response, recognizing that persistent air leak and bronchopleural fistula may still necessitate operative management in select cases [^fbcea883] [^45d03e9a] [^463e1597].

> I should confirm surgical indications and timing. Surgery is reserved for failure of medical therapy, progressive sepsis, respiratory failure, or complications such as bronchopleural fistula, uncontrolled empyema, or large pneumatoceles; both anatomic resection and nonanatomic approaches are described, with contemporary series suggesting most complications are minor and that outcomes do not clearly favor one approach over the other, so operative strategy should be individualized to the extent of parenchymal necrosis and the child's stability [^f31769ec] [^4f447c20] [^55092d99] [^22831d77].

> But wait, what if the child is immunocompromised or has complex chronic disease. In those populations, Pseudomonas and other gram-negative pathogens are more likely, so empiric coverage should be broadened accordingly, and I should maintain a lower threshold for invasive diagnostics and multidisciplinary coordination given higher risks of complications and mortality [^5003f95a] [^fbcea883].

> Next, I should review long-term outcomes and make sure I do not overpromise. Despite prolonged hospitalization and early radiographic abnormalities, most previously healthy children recover fully with normalization of spirometry by 6–9 months; restrictive patterns are common early but typically resolve, and routine serial imaging is not necessary if the child is asymptomatic and improving clinically, which reassures families during convalescence [^edcee07b] [^bed0a91f] [^3b144916].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with guidelines. Suspect necrotizing pneumonia in a child with severe or nonresolving pneumonia after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy; obtain chest radiography to screen for complications, use ultrasound to evaluate pleural disease and guide procedures, and escalate to contrast-enhanced CT if the child deteriorates or if surgical planning is anticipated; initiate prolonged IV antibiotics with pneumococcal and staphylococcal coverage, adding MRSA therapy when indicated and considering toxin-suppressive agents for severe S. aureus disease; involve pediatric surgery early for refractory cases or complications, and arrange close follow-up to document clinical and radiographic resolution over months [^fbcea883] [^e7bc637f] [^1de045d8] [^f31769ec].

> Hold on, I should verify controversies and evidence gaps so counseling is balanced. There is no high-quality pediatric RCT to define optimal antibiotic duration or the incremental benefit of clindamycin for toxin suppression, no consensus on the best surgical approach or timing, and limited data on the role of immunomodulators outside of Mycoplasma-associated disease; these gaps justify shared decision-making, local protocol development, and enrollment in registries or trials when feasible [^fbcea883] [^4d29a68a] [^871551ba].

> In summary, necrotizing pneumonia in children is a severe, complication-prone form of community-acquired pneumonia in which early recognition, judicious imaging, prolonged appropriate antibiotics, and selective surgical intervention drive outcomes; with modern multidisciplinary care, most children recover fully, though the course is longer and more resource-intensive than uncomplicated pneumonia, and clinicians should remain vigilant for deterioration that signals the need to escalate evaluation and treatment [^fbcea883] [^3b144916].

Necrotizing pneumonia in children is a **severe complication** of community-acquired pneumonia, characterized by lung parenchymal necrosis and cavitation [^fbcea883]. It is most often caused by **Streptococcus pneumoniae** or **Staphylococcus aureus** (including MRSA) [^5003f95a], with rising recognition of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in some regions [^871551ba]. Diagnosis relies on **contrast-enhanced chest CT** to identify necrosis and cavitation, with ultrasound useful for pleural assessment and procedural guidance [^e7bc637f] [^45d03e9a]. Management requires prolonged intravenous antibiotics (often 3–4 weeks) [^2c1cc3c6], with early pleural drainage for empyema and surgical resection reserved for refractory cases or complications such as bronchopleural fistula [^fbcea883] [^f31769ec]. Most children recover fully, though prolonged fever and hospitalization are common, and long-term sequelae are usually minimal with appropriate care [^3b144916] [^edcee07b].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

- **Common pathogens**: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent cause, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) [^5003f95a] [^83a51c16]; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is increasingly reported, particularly in older children [^871551ba].

- **Risk factors**: Younger age (< 5 years), immunocompromise, chronic lung disease, and recent viral infections (e.g. influenza) increase risk [^notfound].

- **Pathogenesis**: Rapid bacterial proliferation causes vascular thrombosis, ischemia, and tissue necrosis, impairing antibiotic penetration and promoting cavitation [^9168a80d].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Initial symptoms**: Fever, cough, tachypnea, and respiratory distress are common, often persisting beyond 48–72 hours despite appropriate antibiotics [^fbcea883].

- **Progression**: Clinical deterioration with persistent fever, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, and signs of sepsis may occur [^ce6b5376].

- **Complications**: Empyema, bronchopleural fistula, pneumothorax, and respiratory failure are frequent [^5003f95a] [^ce6b5376].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging

- **Chest radiography**: May show consolidation, cavitation, or pneumatoceles, but sensitivity is limited [^ce6b5376].

- **Ultrasound**: Useful for detecting pleural effusions, loculations, and guiding procedures; contrast-enhanced ultrasound can identify necrotic areas [^44ae8324] [^c963f9bc].

- **Contrast-enhanced CT**: Gold standard for diagnosing necrotizing pneumonia, revealing low-attenuation necrotic foci, cavitation, and loss of normal architecture [^01b8dbbd] [^a3e672c6].

---

### Laboratory tests

Leukocytosis or leukopenia, elevated CRP, and procalcitonin are common; **blood and pleural cultures** should be obtained to guide therapy [^f31769ec].

---

## Management strategies

### Medical management

Empiric intravenous antibiotics should cover **S. pneumoniae** and **S. aureus** (including MRSA if indicated), with adjustments based on cultures [^2c1cc3c6] [^6523d624]. Typical duration is 3–4 weeks, often transitioning to oral therapy once stable [^2c1cc3c6]. Supportive care includes oxygen, analgesia, and close monitoring for complications [^2c1cc3c6].

---

### Surgical management

Indications include failure of medical therapy, persistent sepsis, bronchopleural fistula, or large pneumatoceles [^f31769ec] [^9253f6f5]. Procedures include **video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)** for decortication or resection, with lobectomy or segmentectomy reserved for extensive necrosis [^4f447c20] [^84210007]. Outcomes are generally favorable, though complications such as persistent air leak can occur [^4f447c20].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most children recover fully, though **prolonged fever and hospitalization** are common (median 13–27 days) [^3b144916]. Long-term sequelae are usually minimal, with spirometry normalizing within 6–9 months; persistent radiographic abnormalities may persist but often resolve [^edcee07b] [^3b144916]. Mortality is low (< 5%) but higher in immunocompromised or critically ill patients [^5003f95a].

---

## Preventive measures

Vaccination with **pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)** reduces invasive pneumococcal disease and likely NP risk [^20010fd5]. Influenza vaccination may reduce viral predisposition to bacterial superinfection. Early recognition and treatment of pneumonia complications also help prevent progression to necrosis [^fbcea883].

---

Necrotizing pneumonia in children is a **severe but treatable complication** of pneumonia, requiring early recognition, appropriate imaging, and prolonged antibiotic therapy, with surgery for refractory cases. Most children recover fully, but prolonged morbidity is common, underscoring the need for vigilant follow-up and supportive care.

Antimicrobial treatment is the cornerstone of management, although surgical drainage may be required in some cases. We present the case of a 14-month-old child with fever and cough that persisted despite treatment with typical first-line oral antimicrobial therapy. An initial plain radiograph of the chest demonstrated lobar pneumonia. Ultimately, computed tomography of the chest revealed a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. We review the literature and describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, microbiological etiology, and management of necrotizing pneumonia in children.

### Necrotizing pneumonia in critically ill infants and children: predictive factors for critical care requirement [^83a51c16]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing pneumonia (NP) represents a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of community-acquired pneumonia in children, characterized by progressive lung parenchymal necrosis, cavity formation and significant respiratory compromise. Despite advances in pediatric critical care, NP continue to pose substantial challenges in terms of early recognition, optimal management strategies and prediction of intensive care requirements.

Objectives

This multicenter observational study aimed to comprehensively analyze the clinical characteristics, microbiological patterns, radiological features and management strategies of pediatric NP requiring intensive care admission, with particular focus on identifying predictive factors for disease severity and resource utilization.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of all children admitted with radiologically confirmed NP to Italian pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) between January 2018 and December 2022. Comprehensive data collection included demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, microbiological results, radiological patterns, therapeutic interventions, complications and outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed to identify associations between clinical variables and outcomes.

Results

Among 76 children (median age 45 months, interquartile range: 19–84), Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 38 patients (52.8%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus in 18 (23.7%), including 12 Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive strains (16.7%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 44 patients (57.9%), chest drainage in 58 (76.3%) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery in 11 (14.5%). Comorbidities were present in 23 patients (30.3%). Mean PICU stay was 8.9 ± 8.8 days with zero mortality. Independent predictors of prolonged PICU stay included age < 24 months [odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–6.5], comorbidities (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4–7.3) and bilateral involvement (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5–9.6).

Conclusions

Pediatric NP remains a challenging clinical entity requiring multidisciplinary management and significant intensive care resources. Early recognition of severity predictors, prompt microbiological diagnosis and individualized therapeutic approaches are essential for optimizing outcomes. Our findings support the need for standardized protocols and further prospective studies to refine management strategies for this severe condition.

### Necrotizing pneumonia (aetiology, clinical features and management) [^b3768067]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe form of community-acquired pneumonia characterized by rapid progression of consolidation to necrosis and cavitation which may lead to pulmonary gangrene. Morbidity and mortality are high and chronic sequelae are frequent. The lack of guidance supports the review of the latest recommendations in the management of these pneumonias.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic therapy alone may not be enough to alter the course of the infection, and regimens, adjunctive therapies like intravenous immunoglobulins, surgery may be required to alter the course of the disease especially with pulmonary gangrene.

Summary

The causative agents, clinical features and management of necrotizing pneumonias are discussed.

### Necrotizing pneumonia: a rare complication of pneumonia requiring special consideration [^2d7c0215]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of bacterial lung infection. Its cause is owing to either a virulence factor of the microorganism or a predisposing factor of the host. This disease may cause devastating complications such as diffuse pulmonary inflammation, septic shock, and respiratory failure, making treatment more difficult. In the recent decade, the cause of necrotizing pneumonia and the role of surgical treatment have raised considerable attention, leading to therapeutically specific suggestions.

Recent Findings

Staphylococcus aureus strains that produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin have been reported to cause rapidly progressive necrosis of the lung tissue in young immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, recent studies have showed the risk of disease progression is associated with underlying medical conditions. Although antibiotics are the first choice of treatment for necrotizing pneumonia, it has been emphasized that surgical treatment is a feasible alternative option in patients who fail to respond to antibiotics and develop continued deterioration and complications.

Summary

The current knowledge of cause, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of necrotizing pneumonia are summarized. Antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment. Lung resection can be considered an alternative treatment option in patients who are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy and develop parenchymal complications. Outcome is affected by the degree of disease progression and comorbidities.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, chest imaging, IDSA/PIDS 2011 guidelines recommend to obtain a CXR (posteroanterior and lateral) in patients with suspected or documented hypoxemia or significant respiratory distress and in patients after failed initial antibiotic therapy to exclude or confirm complications of pneumonia, including parapneumonic effusions, necrotizing pneumonia, and pneumothorax.

### Necrotising pneumonia in children [^a0d9cda4]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Necrotising pneumonia remains an uncommon complication of pneumonia in children but its incidence is increasing. Pneumococcal infection is the predominant cause in children but Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) staphylococcal infection are also important causes of severe necrotising pneumonia. Clinical features of necrotic pneumonia are similar to those of an uncomplicated pneumonia except that the patient is clinically much more unwell and has usually failed to respond adequately to what would normally be considered as appropriate antibiotics. Pleural involvement is frequent. Initial management is similar to that for non-complicated pneumonia with careful attention to fluid balance and adequate analgesia required. Some patients will need intensive care support, particularly those with PVL-positive staphylococcal infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given intravenously, with the exact choice of agent informed by local resistance patterns. Pleural drainage is often required. Despite the severity of the illness, outcomes remain excellent with the majority of children making a full recovery.

Discussion and conclusions

The first case of necrotizing pneumonia (NP) in children was reported in 1994, with a gradual increase until now. The most common pathogens implicated in pediatrics with NP are pneumococci and Staphylococcus aureus. NP is an intermediate condition between pulmonary abscess and pulmonary gangrene, where the latter is mostly accompanied by empyema and bronchopleural fistulae (BPF). In 0.8–7% of cases, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may complicate NP. The incidence of complicated pneumonia has risen in the last two decades; however, the condition is still uncommon and occurs in less than 1% of pediatric patients with CAP. Most of the children are under 5 years old, and the clinical manifestations of NP include those of pneumonia, such as fever, cough, tachycardia, chest pain, and localized chest signs, which show dullness by percussion with decreased breath and/or bronchial breathing sounds. Symptoms have long existed before presentation, and the patient looks overly sick with persistent fever, respiratory distress, and non-responding clinical and radiographic signs of ongoing pneumonia. Empyema coexists in 60–100% of cases, and BPF is diagnosed on a chest radiograph. Continuing (> 24 h) gas leakage from chest tubes is considered a common (17–67%) complication.

Children with pneumonia who remain unwell for 72 h despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be suspected for NP, especially if the BPF or loculated empyema is present despite drainage and surgical management without improvement. Extra-pulmonary site infections, such as those of the skin, soft tissue, and musculoskeletal system, should also be sought. Sometimes, following presentation, the condition of children with NP deteriorates to severe sepsis, presenting as septic shock, multi-organ failure, and hypoxic respiratory failure. Reduced peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts are concerning and have been linked to S. aureus infections in the past. CXR will show underlying pneumonia with coexistent parapneumonic effusion (PPE) and shifted mediastinum, and if one or more small lucencies or pneumatoceles are seen in the 4–8-day interval of hospitalization, this imaging modality is diagnostic in 27–41% of pediatric cases of NP. In the late stage of NP, the lesion became more visible when the necrotic fluid drained into the communicating bronchi and was replaced by gas.

### Outcome of anatomical versus non-anatomical lung resection for necrotizing pneumonia in children [^84210007]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Necrotizing pneumonia (NP) is a rare but serious complication of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, characterized by pulmonary inflammation leading to consolidation, peripheral necrosis and the formation of numerous small cavities in the lungs. Damage to the bronchial and pulmonary vascular systems can result in tissue death within the lung parenchyma. This compromised blood supply hampers the delivery of antibiotics to poorly perfused regions, leading to uncontrolled infection and additional destruction of lung tissue. A delay in administering treatment may result in the development of severe sepsis, failure of multiple organ systems and potential death.

While supportive care with appropriate antibiotics is considered the mainstay of treatment, some patients may need surgical intervention. Because refractory NP in children is rare, there are few pediatric studies investigating surgical interventions for this condition. Several studies have documented a small number of patients with NP who required lung resection. The sample sizes in these studies ranged from 3to 36patients. In addition, the risk associated with surgical resection, compared with the risk of developing complications from NP, remains undefined.

Managing patients with NP can be challenging due to the lack of consistent recommendations for transitioning from medical to surgical management. Conversely, surgical management and its outcome depend on several factors, such as the degree of underlying tissue damage, presence of comorbidities, pleural empyema, required extent of pulmonary resection, progression of diffuse pneumonia, septic shock and respiratory failure.

For resection of the lung parenchyma, the following surgical approaches can be selected based on the extent and nature of the disease: pneumonectomy (removal of an entire lung), bilobectomy (removal of two adjacent lobes), lobectomy (removal of a single lobe), segmentectomy (removal of one or more segments) and wedge/partial resection (removal of wedge-shaped parenchyma, irrespective of bronchovascular anatomy).

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^2c1cc3c6]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of NP includes administration of supplemental oxygen to relieve hypoxia, analgesics for reducing pleuritic pain and consequent improvement of ventilation, prolonged antibiotic therapy, and reduction of mass effects or intrathoracic pressure by draining gas and/or intrapleural fluid.

In a healthy and fully immunized child, the treatment option is antibiotics to cover gram-positive organisms, particularly pneumococci, S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, as with empyema. The first-line recommended treatment for children with pneumonia includes intravenous (IV) penicillin or ampicillin and is switched to beta-lactam anti-staphylococcal antibiotics, such as oxacillin or flucloxacillin, in those who are hospitalized due to severe but uncomplicated community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In cases of suspicion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), confirmed by culture, and conditions (e.g. local prevalence > 10%, ethnicity, recent personal or household history of skin infections), appropriate antibiotics should be used. Although, vancomycin penetration in the pulmonary parenchyma is poor, it has a 20% treatment failure rate in the case of MRSA pneumonia if given as monotherapy; hence, until MRSA is confirmed, a beta-lactam anti-staphylococcal antibiotic should be part of the management protocol. However, the addition of linezolid, clindamycin, or rifampicin, which are capable of inhibiting protein synthesis (including toxin production), in cases of infection with S. aureus or S. pyogenes infections, has superior results, but high-level evidence for this regimen is lacking. In cases of suspicion for mycoplasma pneumonia (MP), macrolides such as IV clarithromycin or azithromycin are added but do not replace the antibiotics that are active against pneumococci and S. aureus. More often, in children with NP, the microbiology result is negative, and the resistance of respiratory pathogens against macrolide is high. Finally, if the child is unimmunized against H. influenzae type b (Hib), immunocompromised, or the infection is suspected to be hospital-acquired, the best initial empiric antibiotic therapy includes extensive gram-negative coverage with the addition of a third or fourth generation cephalosporin. The desired course of treatment with antibiotics in NP ranges from 13 to 42 days, with an average duration of 21 days. Following the normalization of the body temperature, inflammatory markers, feeding tolerance, and respiratory distress, the IV antibiotics should be switched to oral antibiotics and followed for 10–14 consecutive days.

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^9168a80d]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is a clinical condition where the lower respiratory tract epithelium below the larynx is invaded through inhalation, or hematogenous spread. The annual estimation of pneumonia reaches 120 million cases worldwide, with the consequent 1.3-million deaths. In developing nations, children under 2-years of age account for nearly 80% of pneumonia related deaths. Necrotizing pneumonia is one of the severe complications of pneumonia and is characterized by continuing pneumonic illness in a previously healthy child despite proper antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis is made by imaging and pathological analysis. Chest radiographs show pulmonary consolidation with one or more small, thin-walled cavities, whereas pathologic examination shows pulmonary inflammation, alveolar consolidation, and thrombosis of intrapulmonary vessels, and consequent necrosis with multiple small cavities. Reduced blood flow due to thrombotic vessels is thought to be the cause of pulmonary tissue destruction.

### Outcome of anatomical versus non-anatomical lung resection for necrotizing pneumonia in children [^22831d77]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, we found that the small group of patients with NP who did not require surgery were less severely ill and had a shorter length of hospital stay compared with those who underwent surgery. Importantly, no data are available in the literature comparing outcomes between medically and surgically managed patients. In fact, interpreting such comparisons may be challenging due to differences in patient selection (PICU vs. non-PICU populations), variations in illness severity, the presence of complex chronic conditions and the lack of a clear consensus on what level of treatment constitutes failure of medical therapy.

The main strength of our study is the utilization of a classification system for monitoring complications. This system has been validated in a large cohort of patients who underwent several surgical procedures and has universal applicability.

Our study has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, which inherently carries certain limitations due to its design. Second, as this was a small single-center study, its findings may not be entirely generalizable. Finally, comparing our results with those of other studies is challenging due to variations in the definitions used to assess complications.

In conclusion, while surgical intervention may lead to complications in one-third of patients, the majority of these complications are minor and do not significantly affect the outcome. Therefore, the timing and type of surgery should be individualized based on the varying degrees of pleural and parenchymal involvement in each patient.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of pediatric lungs [^a83752c3]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management algorithm of pneumonia. Radiography is the first-line imaging modality to evaluate pediatric lungs and is used to confirm a clinical diagnosis of infection and determine whether antibiotics or additional evaluation is needed. In cases of suspected complications, US is very useful to identify parapneumonic effusions and to guide drainage. CT is usually reserved for further evaluation of complicated lung infections if surgical intervention is planned or if preceding imaging examinations are inconclusive.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has emerged as a valuable complementary US technique that can offer additional information to gray-scale and Doppler US. There is limited but growing experience with the use of CEUS for the evaluation of complicated pneumonia. Only one small paediatric case series has been published. This study used intravenous (IV) and intracavitary CEUS to confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia, to improve delineation of a parapneumonic effusion, and to guide decision-making in cases of multi-loculations.

For other lung pathologies, the role of CEUS has been explored in adults: to confirm or exclude pleuropneumonia in patients with clinical signs of pleurisy and indeterminate focal pleural lesions, to differentiate between compressive and obstructive causes of atelectasis, to characterize sub-pleural pulmonary lesions and to assist interventional procedures. There is also some limited experience using CEUS to evaluate peripheral pulmonary lesions in patients with pulmonary embolism. These adult studies described the CEUS method to evaluate the lungs and provide important information about the timing and enhancement pattern of various lung lesions, which can aid the interpretation of imaging findings.

The aim of this review article was to present the current experience with CEUS in pediatric lung applications, with emphasis on the examination technique and interpretation of the imaging findings in pediatric pneumonia. We also discuss the established experience from adult studies to highlight procedural recommendations and to suggest potential future uses in children.

### A review of imaging in the diagnosis and management of complicated paediatric pneumonia [^a0be6fb9]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Paediatric pneumonia and its complications present substantial health and economic challenges. While chest radiographs are commonly used as the initial imaging modality for diagnosing uncomplicated pneumonia, they are less effective for complicated cases. In response, various imaging techniques, such as lung ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and chest MRI, have been integrated into clinical practice to enhance diagnosis and guide management decisions. No definitive gold standard exists for imaging complicated paediatric pneumonia and clinicians may find it challenging to choose the best imaging technique for a given clinical scenario. In this review we describe the available imaging options relevant for the management of paediatric pneumonia and evaluate the strengths and limitations of each modality.

### Necrotizing pneumonia in children: a review [^3b144916]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The objective of the review was to determine the long-term outcomes of necrotising pneumonia (NP). Studies published since 1990 in English, Portuguese, or Spanish, published on PubMed and Scielo were evaluated. Our findings showed ultrasound scanning is the diagnostic modality of choice. Despite prolonged hospitalisation (median 13–27 days) and fever (median 9–16 days), most patients recover completely. Empyema and bronchopleural fistulae are frequent in bacterial NP. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most prevalent cause. Seventeen studies with 497 patients followed for 30 days to 8.75 years showed that most patients were clinically asymptomatic and had normal lung function. X-ray or CT chest imaging demonstrated that almost all lung lesions recovered within 4–6 months. We suggest that it is not necessary to request frequent chest X-rays during the treatment and recovery process. Chest CT scans should be reserved for specific cases not following the expected clinical course.

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^a3e672c6]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Contrast-enhanced chest CT-scan evaluates lung parenchymal changes that are not visible on CXR and detects underlying congenital lung malformations; therefore, this modality is superior to CXR in the diagnosis of NP. The diagnostic highlights are weak or absent vascularity, loss of pulmonary architecture, and cavity formation. Multiple small gas or fluid-filled, thin-walled cavities are usually seen involving only a single lobe. As the lung continued to liquefy, the multiple small cavities may coalesce and form larger cavities, including gas-filled pneumatoceles, which develop in the later stages of NP.

A number of disorders will cause pulmonary cavities, but infection-induced lung cavities and infected congenital lung defects along with traumatic pseudocysts should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of children with NP. Differentiating NP from lung abscess is clinically important since the underlying causes and management can differ. A simple lung abscess has an inactive course of fever and cough that can last for weeks. Investigational delay may lead to complications, which are represented by multiple thin-walled cavities in the NP that may fuse to form one or more contrast-enhancing, thick-walled abscesses containing gaseous fluid levels within the pulmonary consolidated regions.

### Characteristics and outcomes of children with necrotizing pneumonia [^5003f95a]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In this study, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of pediatric necrotizing pneumonia in the United States.

Design and Setting

A retrospective analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2016 Kids Inpatient Database was performed. The Kids Inpatient Database is a large deidentified hospital discharge database of pediatric patients in the United States.

Patients

The database was filtered using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition code J85.0 to identify necrotizing pneumonia in children 28 days to 20 years old.

Interventions

Children with necrotizing pneumonia with and without bacterial isolation and with and without complex chronic conditions were compared. Sample weighting was employed to produce national estimates.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 2,296,220 discharges, 746 patients had necrotizing pneumonia (prevalence: 3.2/10,000 discharges). In patients with necrotizing pneumonia, 46.6% required chest tubes, 6.1% underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and 27.6% were mechanically ventilated. Pneumothorax was identified in 16.7% and pyothorax in 27.4%. The overall mortality rate was 4.1% (n = 31). Bacterial isolation was documented in 40.9%. The leading organisms identified in patients without a complex chronic condition were Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (9.2%) and in patients with a complex chronic condition were S. aureus (13.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.8%). Patients with bacterial isolation were significantly more likely to develop pneumothorax (odds ratio, 2.6; CI, 1.6–4.2) or septic shock (odds ratio, 3.2; CI, 1.9–5.4) and require a chest tube (odds ratio, 2.5; CI, 1.7–3.5) or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 2.3; CI, 1.5–3.3) than patients without bacterial isolation.

Conclusions

Bacterial etiology of necrotizing pneumonia in children varied with the presence or absence of a complex chronic condition. Bacterial isolation is associated with increased invasive procedures and complications. The mortality rate is higher in children with complex chronic conditions. This study provides national data on necrotizing pneumonia among hospitalized children.

### Severe necrotizing pneumonia and persistent bacteremia in a teenager with a history of vaping… [^9571bb5b]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

A 15-year-old previously healthy male with a history of vaping and electronic cigarette use was hospitalized due to worsening breathing difficulty and hypoxemia. He had tested positive for influenza B a few days earlier but his condition acutely worsened despite symptomatic management. During hospitalization, he required intensive care management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to a necrotizing pneumonia with bilevel positive airway pressure support and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Sputum and blood cultures acquired on admission grew oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteremia persisted for 10 days only clearing after escalation of antibiotic therapy. Hospital course was complicated by drug induced acute kidney injury necessitating modification of antibiotic treatment. The patient was discharged following 22 days of hospitalization and completed a total of 46 days of antibiotic treatment.

His physical examination normalized one month after discharge but he continued to experience dyspnea on moderate exertion. On review of his. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments.

### Retrospective study in children with necrotizing pneumonia: nine years of intensive care experience [^3f1fd09d]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although necrotizing pneumonia (NN) is one of the most feared complications of community-acquired pneumonia, data in pediatric patients are scarce. The objective of this article is to describe children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) because of NN.

Methods

Retrospective-prospective observational study in children admitted with NN to PICU (from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2018). The data collected included information on disease epidemiology, PICU management, respiratory assistance and disease evolution.

Results

Fifty-one children were included, 42 of 51 had received 7-valent or 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Median age was 3.2 years (1.9–4.2), 15 of 51 had signs of sepsis at admission. Forty-nine patients presented pleural effusion with drainage in 46. The most common respiratory support modality was high-flow oxygen nasal cannula (17/51). Computed tomography was the gold standard for diagnosis. Etiologic diagnosis was obtained in 34 of 51, and pneumococcus was isolated in 29 of 34. In all of these cases, initial detection was made by capsular antigen in pleural fluid. Children with pneumococcal NN had fewer days of evolution prior to PICU admission (P = 0.041). Cefotaxime with clindamycin was used in 49 of 51. Surgery was necessary in 3 of 51 patients. After PICU discharge, only 5 of 51 were readmitted. There were deaths.

Conclusions

In our study, the NN was mainly observed in children around 3 years old. The main causal agent was pneumococcus. The evolution towards NN appeared to be faster than in case of other etiologies. Surgery management was unusual. All children required prolonged admissions but had a full clinical recovery.

### Long-term outcomes of necrotizing pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion in children [^bed0a91f]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusion

In childhood, NP and PPE do not appear to cause long‐term impairment in spirometry; however, a restrictive pattern is the most common abnormality in the early period. Our findings suggest neither condition results in persistent deterioration of spirometry in the long term, highlighting the potential for pulmonary recovery with appropriate management and follow‐up.

### Outcome of anatomical versus non-anatomical lung resection for necrotizing pneumonia in children [^b2280f62]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this retrospective study evaluated the largest sample of children undergoing surgery for the treatment of NP. We found that AR was necessary for the majority of patients who underwent surgical treatment, accounting for 56.0% of cases. Additionally, we observed that the type of surgical approach did not have an impact on the incidence of complications, blood transfusion requirements and length of hospital stay. Moreover, the majority of complications were graded as minor complications.

Our findings align with previous studies only evaluating surgical resection for necrotizing lung infection, which indicated that patients were typically young, ranging in age from 3 months to 32 months. The overall preoperative morbidities included pleural empyema (75.7%), preoperative endotracheal intubation for respiratory distress (28.7%), pneumothorax (21.0%) and sepsis (42.0%), highlighting the severity of this disease.

While S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children, we found that S. aureus was the most common organism isolated in our study. This finding is consistent with that of other studies. We speculate that the use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for prophylaxis in our population, or even the prior use of antibiotics, may help explain this finding.

Some authors suggest that surgery should be the last option for treating NP. However, others argue that once a necrotic process is diagnosed, the affected segment or lobe should be promptly removed, especially in cases with high-output bronchopleural fistula and respiratory distress. In our study, the main reasons for thoracotomy were therapeutic failure, sepsis, acute respiratory failure and bronchopleural fistula.

Our data regarding the median preoperative length of stay for both approaches (median 12.5 days) are similar to other studies reporting an average time between 10 and 15 days. The optimal timing for surgery remains uncertain. Reimel et al. recommend for postponing surgery until patients are medically stabilized, which has been associated with improved surgical outcomes. Conversely, Chatha et al.express concerns that delaying surgical intervention may lead to deterioration in the patient's condition during the interim period. At our institution, we adopt an early surgical approach, initiating it as soon as there is no improvement in the clinical course and the NP is confirmed by a CT scan.

### Complicated community acquired pneumonia in childhood: different types, clinical course, and outcome [^790f87ed]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2017). Low credibility.

The incidence of pediatric community acquired complicated pneumonia (PCACP) is increasing. Questions addressed: Are different types of PCACP one disease? How do different treatment protocols affect the outcome?

Methods

Retrospective analysis of medical records of PCACP hospitalizations in the three major hospitals in Jerusalem in the years 2001–2010 for demographics, clinical presentation, management, and outcome.

Results

Of the 144 children (51% aged 1–4 years), 91% of Jewish origin; 40% had para-pneumonic effusion (PPE), 40% empyema (EMP), and 20% necrotizing pneumonia (NP). Bacterial origin was identified in 42% (empyema 79%, P = 0.009), most common S. pneumoniae (32%), group A streptococcus (9%). Patients with EMP, compared to PPE and NP, were less likely to receive prior antibiotic treatment (35% vs. 57% and 59%, respectively, P = 0.04). Mean hospitalization was longer in patients with NP followed by EMP and PPE (16.4 ± 10.6, 15.2 ± 7.9, and 12.7 ± 4.7 days, respectively), use of fibrinolysis was not associated with the outcome. All children had recovered to discharge regardless of antibiotic therapy or fibrinolysis.

Answer

NP is a more severe disease with prolonged morbidity and hospitalization in spite of prior antibiotic treatment. All types had favorable outcome regardless of treatment-protocol. Complicated pneumonia has an ethnic predominance. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2017;52:247–254. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Intravenous and intracavitary use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the evaluation and management of complicated pediatric pneumonia [^134b2cd6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric pneumonia can be complicated by necrotizing pneumonia or a parapneumonic effusion either in the form of an empyema or a clear effusion. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography represent well-established modalities for evaluation of complicated pediatric pneumonia. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was recently introduced and is gaining increasing acceptance in pediatric imaging. In this case series, we present our initial experience with both intravenous and intracavitary use of CEUS in children with complicated pneumonia. Intravenous CEUS accurately and confidently showed necrotizing pneumonia and delineated pleural effusions, whereas intracavitary CEUS accurately identified the chest catheter location and patency and showed the presence of loculations, suggesting the use of fibrinolytics.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^0fb4eb04]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

CT diagnosis of the suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia

Expansile pneumonia refers to an increased volume of an involved lobe or segment, with a chest radiograph appearance of dense consolidation causing bulging fissures. Even though expansile pneumonia is not commonly seen in children, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are known to cause this, with Klebsiella pneumoniae mostly affecting the upper lobes (Fig. 1). Aspergillus fumigatus in immunocompromised and neutropenic children as well as Mycobacteriun tuberculosis can also cause expansile pneumonia. When there is expansile pneumonia but no visible cavitation containing air or an air-fluid level, the variety of underlying parenchymal changes cannot be differentiated from each other on chest radiographs. These can range from exudative consolidation with fluid bronchograms to necrotizing pneumonia and eventual lung abscess and may be accompanied by a pleural effusion or empyema. These pathological changes can be distinguished on CT, allowing for different management options to be considered. In addition, CT can suggest tuberculosis as a possible cause by demonstrating typical lymphadenopathy or indicate a missed/unsuspected foreign body. Necrotizing pneumonia is a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia resulting in liquefaction and cavitation of lung tissue. The true incidence of this complication in children with community-acquired pneumonia is unknown, but it is increasingly reported, possibly due to early detection from the increased use of chest CT. Lai et al. reported a frequency as high as 34% using chest CT. Lung necrosis is suspected on chest radiographs, but the diagnosis can only be confirmed by CT. Radiologists are clear that CT yields more detailed information concerning chest anatomy and pathology than chest radiography. In the context of diagnosing necrotizing pneumonia or the other complications of community-acquired pneumonia in children, CT has been shown to be the most sensitive and accurate modality, demonstrating pathology before it becomes evident on chest radiographs. Detection and differentiation of pulmonary parenchymal complications require contrast-enhanced CT. In a study by Donnelly et al. all CT examinations performed in children not responding to treatment for community acquired pneumonia (when a chest radiograph was non-contributory) demonstrated at least one significant finding. The suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia seen on CT can be considered an evolution of events from exudation, followed by necrosis of the lung, to cavitation or abscess formation and possibly the development of a bronchopleural fistula, but since CT is not performed in a sequential, temporal fashion in children (a single CT scan only represents a moment in time) and since interventions may interrupt the process, each of these complications can be considered individually.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^8e0c826c]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

There has been a significant increase in hospital admissions for complicated community-acquired pneumonia both in the developed world and the developing world. Contributing to this is the high incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis in the developing world, resulting in overlapping presentations, treatment failure and difficulty making clinical diagnoses. Children with pneumonia who do not respond appropriately to treatment should be investigated for any suppurative parenchymal complications that may have developed. According to the British Thoracic Society Guidelines, if a child remains feverish or unwell 48 h after the start of treatment, the child must be re-evaluated regarding a possible complication. There is a spectrum of suppurative parenchymal complications of pneumonia. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America list the following complications associated with community-acquired pneumonia in children: pleural effusion or empyema, pneumothorax, lung abscess, bronchopleural fistula and necrotizing pneumonia. Such complications are reported in up to 53% of children hospitalized with pneumonia. Harris et al. [6] indicate that children are predisposed to more severe forms of lung infection resulting in suppuration and lung abscess. Among predisposing factors are underlying congenital abnormalities such as cysts and sequestrations, bronchiectasis, neurological disorders and immune deficiencies. Also noted are organisms responsible for causing necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess more frequently — these include serotypes of pneumococcus and S. aureus. This is due, in part, to a "spectral shift of pneumococcal strains after the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccine and the emergence of methicillin-resistance S. aureus ". In addition, the role played by HIV and tuberculosis as causative agents of necrotizing pneumonia in children living in middle- and low-income countries remains to be described. Identification of patients with suppurative parenchymal and pleural complications of pneumonia is important because prolonged intravenous antibiotic treatment is needed and surgical drainage and decortication must be considered.

### Non-operative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children, why not? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^65bbcb5d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Appendectomy stands as the primary treatment choice for children with acute appendicitis, however the 2020 update of the WSES guidelines report that NOM is safe and feasible as initial treatment, particularly in a population without appendicoliths. However, surgery and the use of general anesthesia unavoidably entail complications, encompassing issues like bleeding, ileus, surgical site infection, and pneumonia. In addition to these short-term complications, there are also potential long-term complications, the extent of which is not yet fully understood, such as bowel obstructions and infertility caused by adhesions. Consequently, NOM has gained preference in some acute appendicitis cases due to these concerns–. The hypothesis is that conditions resembling acute appendicitis, such as uncomplicated diverticulitis, salpingitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis, often respond well to early antibiotic treatment. While NOM and shared decision-making applications are established in the adult population, their use in pediatric patients remains less explored, with limited studies addressing their efficacy in this specific demographic setting.

To our knowledge, this study, including 269 patients from 3 RCTs, is the first meta-analysis of RCTs enrolling only children.

Our meta-analysis reveals comparable rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications between the OM and NOM group, even including the complications related to NOM failure. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, reported similar results, concerning the rate of complications in the OM and NOM managed groups.

Then, our data add further evidence on the safety of conservative management, although we should account for the heterogeneity in the diagnostic assessment, antibiotic regimens, and treatment duration among the various studies, which could affect the results.

There is evidence that the risk of success in the antibiotic group is lower than the one in the group undergoing surgery. Undoubtedly, a clear advantage of appendectomy is the chance to remove the pathogenic entity with a negligible risk of stump appendicitis. Conversely, this is not possible with conservative treatment, which carries a significant risk of lifetime recurrence, estimated between 6.7 and 8.6%. However, considering the group of patients without appendicolith, there is no statistical difference in terms of treatment success between OM and NOM (100% vs 97%).

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^d57a6daf]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing pneumonia is rare in children and is one of the most serious complications of a lung infection caused by antibiotic failure. We present a 12-year-old leukopenic child with a long-lasting lung infection, presenting as having a lung hydatid cyst, but diagnosing with necrotizing pneumonia in the right bilobed lung. Failure to medical treatment and ongoing leukopenia justified surgical intervention with positive results.

Case presentation

The patient was referred to our teaching hospital's pediatric surgery department. He had previously been diagnosed with intestinal tuberculosis (TB) and received anti-TB treatment. On referral to our hospital, the patient was suffering from restlessness, frequent coughing, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Following the completion of the clinical work-up, a blood test revealed leukopenia (white blood cell count of 2100/microliter), a normal platelet count, and a lesion in the right lung. Computerized tomography scanning (CT-Scan) image reported a lung hydatid cyst. In the pediatrics ward, a broad-spectrum antibiotics regimen with triple-antibiotic therapy (linezolid, vancomycin, and metronidazole) was instituted and continued for a week with no response, but worsening of the condition. In the pediatric surgery ward, our decision for surgical intervention was due to the failure of medical treatment because of a pulmonary lesion. Our team performed right lung upper lobe anterior segment wedge resection due to necrotizing pneumonia and followed the patient 45 days post-operation with a reasonable result.

Conclusion

Living in remote rural areas with low resources and inaccessibility to proper and specialized diagnostic and treatment centers will all contribute to an improper diagnosis and treatment of lung infection. In total, all of these will increase the morbidity and mortality due to lung necrosis in the pediatric population, regardless of their age. In low-resource facilities, high-risk patients can benefit from surgical intervention to control the ongoing infection process.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^f31769ec]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing lung infections

High-resolution CT scan is indicated for detailed assessment (LoE strong, GoR strong).
Blood, sputum, and, if accessible, pleural samples should be obtained to identify causative organisms (LoE strong, GoR strong).
Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started as soon as possible and refined based on culture results (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
Surgical debridement is indicated in case of medical management failure, to remove necrotic tissue and to control infection source (LoE moderate, GoR strong).

Initial management: high-resolution CT scans are crucial for diagnosing necrotizing pneumonia, revealing key signs such as pleural effusions, necrosis, and detecting complications like bronchopleural fistulae. Cultures from blood, sputum, and pleural fluid, along with CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsies (PTNBs), identify the causative pathogens in 30–40% of cases, guiding treatment. Despite lung ultrasound's usefulness, CT is indispensable for spotting complex issues PTNBs have a low complication rate and are crucial for diagnosis and treatment, with bronchoscopy used for further clarification in uncertain cases.

Antibiotic therapy: pathogens like Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and multidrug resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are common culprits of post-traumatic necrotizing lung infections. Early administration of adequate antibiotics is generally effective in resolving the disease. Culture-based treatment approaches may match the efficacy of immediate treatments with targeted use of culture results enhancing treatment accuracy and combating antibiotic resistance. Nebulized antibiotics may offer benefits without increased renal toxicity in severe cases.

Surgical management: recent findings highlight that optimal medical management may suffice for severe necrotizing pneumonia, with surgical debridement reserved only for specific cases whenever the infection evolves into abscesses/extended tissue necrosis or empyema not amenable of conservative treatment. Post-surgery antibiotic therapy duration of at least three to seven days is recommended according to clinical, laboratory and radiological evaluation.

### Management of patients with infectious diseases in an emergency department observation unit [^11ece720]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumonia, cellulitis, and pyelonephritis are discussed in this review because they are the most common infections requiring hospital care, and they all have significant death or complication rates and broad differential diagnoses. They also demonstrate many of the considerations that could be applied to other infections appropriate for OU care. Table 11 lists additional infections that are good candidates for OU care. A key to successful OU management of infection is early consultation with the primary care physicians and appropriate specialists when one is setting up the unit, designing its guidelines, and when treating specific patients. Because individual patient outcomes are not predictable, increasing the absolute numbers treated and successfully discharged from observation can necessarily increase the percentage of OU patients that are hospitalized. In essence, a group who would be hospitalized from the ED is transferred to observation status, where most avoid hospital admission. Because some patients fail to respond, develop complications, or demonstrate alternative diagnoses, many troubles can be avoided when the primary care and specialist physicians have collaborated in the observation treatment decisions. These guidelines have been presented as a starting point. It is clear that more research targeted at this group of patients is required to refine current practice. As for everything else in medicine, there is no doubt that many of the specific recommendations made here will become obsolete in no time.

### Outcome of anatomical versus non-anatomical lung resection for necrotizing pneumonia in children [^0f06baa1]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings showed that patients who experienced major complications had a postoperative stay 6 days longer compared with those with minor complications, although this difference was not statistically significant. This result aligns with a study by Seely, which showed that patients with lower grade complications (i.e.g.rades I and II) were less likely to have prolonged hospital stays compared with patients with higher grade (i.e. III and IV) complications. However, a larger study would be needed to validate these findings.

The incidence of persistent air leak after surgery can be as high as 20.0%to 46.0%in some pediatric studies. In our study, we found that 36.0% of all complications were due to persistent air leak, with most cases occurring in patients in the NAR group.

In our study, we did not have any deaths. However, other researchers have reported mortality rates of 4.0%,5.5%,14.0%and 20.0%, respectively. Our findings, consistent with other investigators, suggest that septic shock and respiratory failure should not be considered absolute contraindications for lung resection in individuals with NP. Therefore, for patients who experience septic shock and achieve hemodynamic stability, surgical resection might be considered if complications arise due to necrotic pulmonary parenchyma.

Surgical procedures for treating NP should be tailored to each individual patient based on their specific clinical situation, CT scan assessments and intraoperative findings. While some authors recommend formal lobectomy or pneumonectomy for most cases, others advocate for decortication or LN to preserve lung parenchyma.

We should note that a higher number of patients (54.0%) who received a more extensive surgical management (AR) had sepsis, with or without respiratory distress, compared with those who received a more limited procedure (NAR) (27.0%). Given that the severity of NP is significantly impacted by the extent of necrosis, treatment decisions should be guided by the level of tissue destruction and the presence of any associated complications. Interestingly, we observed that a more extensive surgical management that includes AR was associated with a non-significant difference in postoperative morbidity compared with a lesser resection approach, that is, NAR.

### Prediction model for prolonged fever in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia: a retrospective study of 716 pediatric patients [^c5d4cf08]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) infections are generally mild and self-limiting. However, patients of every age can develop a severe and progressive course during treatment with appropriate antibiotic therapy. The underlying mechanisms are unclear, but a direct microbe effect, macrolide resistance, and excessive immunological response of the host are commonly suggested. Macrolide antibiotics have been generally preferred as the first-choice agents for MP infections because secondary antibiotics such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are not recommended because of the risk of severe adverse events, especially in pediatric patients.

Macrolide resistance rates have risen throughout the world and vary across countries. Although macrolides could be continued in cases of mild to moderate infections irrespective of their resistance, replacement by alternative antibiotics or additional corticosteroids have been shown to improve radiological abnormalities and clinical symptoms. Additionally, the severity of the disease is partially related to the degree to which the host immune response reacts to infection. The concept of immune-mediated lung disease provides a basis for consideration of immunomodulatory therapy in addition to conventional antimicrobial therapies for the management of MP infections.

The appropriate time for alternative treatment is not clarified, but it still depends on the physician's decision. Alternative treatments are delayed on some occasions owing to concerns regarding toxicities and adverse effects of secondary antibiotics or the possibility of blurred diagnosis caused by corticosteroids, leading to aggravation of the clinical course. Protracted courses of fever or worsening respiratory exertion despite treatment with macrolides are reported to complicate atelectasis, parapneumonic effusion, bronchiolitis obliterans, necrotizing pneumonitis, pulmonary abscess, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. At the initiation phase of macrolide therapy, physicians find it difficult to predict patients with a prolonged or severe clinical course. Previous studies have suggested individual cut-off values for inflammatory markers to differentiate between the patients with or without clinical and radiological progression after macrolide therapy for 7 days or longer. Identifying patients who are expected to undergo a prolonged or severe clinical course would help in providing them with timely secondary treatment and mitigating their clinical course.

This study aims to identify the predictive factors for prolonged fever in patients with MP pneumonia with readily accessible clinical, laboratory, and radiological data and to develop a predictive model for these patients in whom timely initiation of secondary treatment options should be considered.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^45d03e9a]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pleural complications of pneumonia

Pneumonia can also be complicated by pleural effusions that do not resolve with antibiotic therapy and may require surgical drainage or thoracoscopy. It is estimated that while 1% of children with community-acquired pneumonia develop pleural effusions, effusions are seen much more frequently in hospitalized children (up to 40%). According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, when there is persisting fever despite adequate antibiotic treatment, clinicians should suspect the development of an empyema. Lai et al. also report an incidence of 12% to 66% of bronchopleural fistula developing as a complication of necrotizing pneumonia.

Even though pleural effusion is visible on chest radiographs, ultrasound (US) is the recommended method for estimating the amount of fluid (Fig. 6). The size of the effusion is significant when deciding on management. Chest US is also considered superior to chest CT in its ability to demonstrate internal components of an effusion such as loculations and fibrin strands (Fig. 7). The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend chest US for detecting pleural effusion and guiding drain placement, but indicate that CT with intravenous contrast "is useful for evaluation of advanced parenchymal disease" associated with effusions (Figs. 8 and 9). The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America note that even though history and physical examination can suggest the possibility of an accompanying effusion in children with community-acquired pneumonia, chest radiographs should be used for confirmation while chest US or CT should only be performed when chest radiography is inconclusive (Fig. 10). Identifying any parenchymal complication such as necrotizing pneumonia or abscess coexisting with an effusion is important because these findings will ensure treatment with a prolonged course of antibiotics.

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^9253f6f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical intervention is rarely recommended to avoid the risk of bronchopleural fistula (BPF). Although loculated empyema can cause mass effects and lead to hemodynamic and ventilation instability, necessitating surgery. A large pyopneumothorax and tension pneumatocele will all necessitate surgery. Furthermore, necrosis of the lung is only detected during surgery. In cases with large parapneumonic effusion (PPE) and pyopneumothorax, chest tube drainage is enough, but some experts recommend the instillation of intrapleural fibrinolysis in cases of loculated empyema. However, chest tube drainage > 7 days and fibrinolysis may increase the risk of BPF and failure in 30% of empyema patients. If fever, signs of sepsis, and/or respiratory distress persist in spite of chest tube insertion with or without fibrinolytic therapy and frequent imaging shows ongoing intrapleural collections, surgical intervention such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or mini-thoracotomy for the debridement of pyogenic material around the lung (decortication), breakdown of loculations, and removal of pus may be indicated. If the symptoms due to the underlying NP are mild, continuing IV antibiotics without surgery is ideal. When progressive lung necrosis is the issue, surgical intervention in the form of segmental or lobar resection or pneumonectomy is the treatment of choice, which is rarely required in children. Poor penetration of antibiotics into pulmonary hypoperfused regions and into cavitating lesions leads to delayed bacterial clearance, tissue necrosis, and ongoing inflammation; therefore, children with NP will have intermittent fever for several days despite proper antimicrobial therapy and chest drainage. Some authors recommend reviewing the child in 2 weeks following discharge from the hospital and then in 6–8 weeks and 6 months at minimum.

The role of intravenous contrast-enhanced ultrasound in pediatric pneumonia

In the setting of pediatric complicated pneumonia, CEUS can play an important role in the diagnostic and management algorithms. Similar to other organ applications, CEUS provides real-time observation of tissue enhancement pattern. Furthermore, it is an ideal modality for children because it obviates the need for sedation or ionizing radiation. Besides its safety advantages, CEUS can improve the diagnostic performance of gray-scale and Doppler US techniques to accurately detect areas of necrotizing pneumonia within lung consolidations, delineate their exact extent, and clearly differentiate them from adjacent complex pleural effusions (Figs. 1 and 2).

Conclusion

Although there is limited literature on pediatric pulmonary CEUS applications, the feasibility of this technique for the evaluation of complicated pneumonia and accurate differentiation of necrotizing pneumonia from complex parapneumonic effusion has been demonstrated in children. In addition to these benefits, direct administration of UCA into the pleural cavity can be used to confirm the position of drainage tubes and help decision-making regarding intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. CEUS can also be used for monitoring response of pleural-based tumors and for procedural guidance and post-procedural monitoring, but these applications must be validated in pediatric patients. The ability of CEUS to distinguish between benign and malignant pleural-based and subpleural lesions remains unclear in adults and has not been studied in children.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pneumonia in the immunocompetent child [^e7bc637f]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common acute infections and the single greatest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. In uncomplicated, community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent patients, the diagnosis is clinical and imaging has no role. The first role of imaging is to identify complications associated with pneumonia such as pleural effusion, pulmonary abscess, and bronchopleural fistula. Radiographs are recommended for screening for these complications and ultrasound and CT are recommended for confirmation. The second role of imaging is to identify underlying anatomic conditions that may predispose patients to recurrent pneumonia. CT with intravenously administered contrast is recommended for this evaluation. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia in children [^d472a048]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This prospective cohort study included children admitted to the Pediatric Pulmonology Unit, Tanta University Hospital, Egypt, between September 2022 and August 2023 with a diagnosis of CAP. This study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the research ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University (approval number 35,694/9/22). Written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all patients.

All children aged between two months and 18 years who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CAP were included in this study. CAP was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia in a previously healthy child who acquired an infection outside the hospital and radiological findings of lung consolidation. Children were diagnosed with parapneumonic effusion based on clinical examination and radiographic findings, whereas NP was diagnosed clinically based on the presence of progressive pneumonia in previously healthy children despite appropriate antibiotic therapy with a protracted course plus CT chest scans that revealed multiple necrotic foci in the consolidated area.

Children with the following criteria were excluded from the study: (1) Other causes of lung cavitation in radiological findings, such as solitary lung cavitation with defined rim of enhancement (lung abscess), congenital lung abnormalities, septic pulmonary embolism, or traumatic pseudocyst. (2) Chronic lung disorders, malignancy, underlying immunodeficiency, or neuromuscular illnesses. (3) Hospital-acquired pneumonia.

Patients were divided into three groups: Group 1 included patients with NP, Group 2 included patients with parapneumonic effusion (PPE), and Group 3 included patients with non-complicated pneumonia (CAP).

Demographic information was collected, including sex, age, characteristics of the initial clinical manifestations, length of hospitalization, duration of fever, occurrence of complications, and requirement for surgical intervention.

The duration of fever, the length of hospitalization, improvement in inflammatory markers, and the continuation of the same empirical antibiotics were objective measures to assess the recovery and the effectiveness of utilized antibiotics.

CT findings in complicated pneumonia

Necrotizing pneumonia is diagnosed on CT when a significant portion of consolidated lung shows diffuse or patchy low attenuation and decreased or no enhancement after intravenous contrast medium administration (Fig. 2). Cavitary necrosis is identified as a dominant area of necrosis with a combination of loss of normal parenchymal lung architecture, decreased parenchymal enhancement and development of multiple thin-walled cavities filled with fluid or air and lacking an enhancing border (Fig. 3). Lung abscess is diagnosed on CT when there is a lung cavity surrounded by a well-defined enhancing wall, no central enhancement and either fluid- or air-filled within (Fig. 4). The distinction between necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess is based on the visualisation of contrast-enhancing walls of an abscess and is important when entertaining aggressive interventional therapy because this can be therapeutic for lung abscess and harmful for necrotizing pneumonia. A bronchopleural fistula can only definitively diagnosed on CT when a communication between the lung and pleural space is visualized directly (Fig. 5). Donnelly et al. reported that of the 56 CT scans performed in children with community-acquired pneumonia failing to respond to treatment, there were 40 with parenchymal complications (28 with decreased parenchymal enhancement or cavitary necrosis, 5 with abscess and 5 with bronchopleural fistula), 37 with pleural complications and 13 with pericardial effusion.

Methods

Patients and study design

This is a retrospective, single-center study conducted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at a tertiary hospital specializing in thoracic surgical services for pediatric patients. We reviewed the data of all consecutive children aged between 1 month and 15 years who underwent LN or lung resection between January 2010 and December 2023. Patients undergoing thoracoscopic decortication alone were excluded from the study. All surgical procedures were performed by the same thoracic surgeon. All patients had a final diagnosis of NP confirmed by pathological analysis.

In all patients, intravenous antibiotics were initiated based on empirical judgment, with coverage for Streptococcus and Staphylococcus. If the response to antibiotics was deemed inadequate, the treatment was broadened to a wider spectrum before proceeding with surgical intervention. In addition, antibiotic management was adjusted according to culture and sensitivity results from blood, tracheal aspirate or pleural fluid, when available. Of note, molecular diagnostic tests were not available to our patients.

Data collection

A predetermined data collection form was utilized to gather the following patient variables: age, sex, presence of comorbidities, culture results, severity of illness score (Pediatric Index of Mortality II)at PICU admission, laboratory results, preoperative details, blood transfusion requirement within 24-hour postsurgery, major complications and postoperative information (length of postoperative stay, major postoperative complications, chest tube days, need for reoperation and mortality). All patients were monitored for a minimum of 1 year after surgery.

Study groups

All patients who underwent dissection and ligation of hilar structures, including pneumonectomy, bilobectomy, lobectomy and segmentectomy, were classified as AR patients. In contrast, those who underwent WR or LN were classified as NAR patients.

Surgical indications and procedures

Surgical intervention for NP was indicated in patients unresponsive to clinical treatment, presenting with pulmonary sepsis, persistent or recurrent fever, respiratory distress (characterized by tachypnea or dyspnea requiring oxygen support), leukocytosis, sustained elevation of C reactive protein, bronchopleural fistula and radiographic evidence of parenchymal necrosis.

The lung surgical procedure is described in online supplemental file 1.

### Variation in management and outcomes of children with complicated pneumonia [^cb9d5f8e]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the characteristics of children hospitalized with complicated pneumonia at US children's hospitals and compare these characteristics with those of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Methods

We identified children hospitalized with complicated pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion, empyema, necrotizing pneumonia, or lung abscess) or CAP across 34 hospitals between 2011 and 2019. We evaluated differences in patient characteristics, antibiotic selection, and outcomes between children with complicated pneumonia and CAP. We, also, assessed seasonal variability in the frequency of these 2 conditions and evaluated the prevalence of complicated pneumonia over the 9-year study period.

Results

Compared with children hospitalized with CAP (n = 75702), children hospitalized with complicated pneumonia (n = 6402) were older (a median age of 6.1 vs 3.4 years; P < .001), with 59.4% and 35.2% of patients ≥ 5 years of age, respectively. Patients with complicated pneumonia had higher rates of antibiotic therapy targeted against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (46.3% vs 12.2%; P < .001) and Pseudomonas (8.6% vs 6.7%; P < .001), whereas differences in rates of coverage against mycoplasma were not clinically significant. Children with complicated pneumonia had a longer median hospital length of stay and higher rates of ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, 30-day readmissions, and costs. Seasonal variation existed in both complicated pneumonia and CAP, with 42.7% and 46.0% of hospitalizations occurring during influenza season. The proportion of pneumonia hospitalizations due to complicated pneumonia increased over the study period (odds ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.06).

Conclusions

Complicated pneumonia more frequently occurs in older children and accounts for higher rates of resource use, compared to CAP.

Special considerations in CAP — the panel was unable to make any statements on the use of corticosteroids in CAP in children based on the lack of randomized controlled trials, and the recommendation for bacterial CAP does not require microbiologic confirmation but refers to patients with high clinical suspicion for bacterial pneumonia treated with empiric antibiotics. Further, globally CAP has variable microbiology, thus it is uncertain if corticosteroid effects are generalizable to other etiologies of CAP.

### Role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting the diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia in children [^ce424dba]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A rare form of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is necrotizing pneumonia (NP), which is marked by severe sickness, a protracted hospital stay, and a protracted course of the disease. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are the most prevalent bacteria that cause NP, which exhibits lung necrosis, liquefaction, and loss of the typical pulmonary parenchymal architecture.

A growing number of NP cases in previously healthy children have been documented over the past 20 years. The risk of complications from NP is also increased, including parapneumonic effusion, pneumothorax, pyopneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula, respiratory failure, septic shock, and death.

The most sensitive form of chest imaging for diagnosing NP is a CT scan, which can reveal multiple thin-walled cavities, decreased parenchymal enhancement, and loss of normal pulmonary architecture. Blood, pleural, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures can also be used for microbiological diagnosis.

Recent studies have shown that various combined ratios of complete blood count parameters, including NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, and SIRI, may serve as helpful diagnostic and prognostic indicators for various inflammatory conditions, including cancer, coronary artery disease, sepsis, and COVID-19 infection.

This study aimed to assess the role of systemic immune-inflammatory index and systemic inflammatory response index in predicting early lung necrotization in children with CAP to improve treatment and prognosis.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in children [^6a593d78]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of childhood mortality globally. In the United States, CAP is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization and antibiotic use and is associated with substantial morbidity. There has been a dramatic shift in microbiological etiologies for CAP in children over time as pneumococcal pneumonia has become less common and viral etiologies have become predominant. There is no commonly agreed on approach to the diagnosis of CAP in children. When indicated, antimicrobial treatment should consist of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. In this article, we will describe the current understanding of the microbiological etiologies, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, risk factors, treatment, and future directions in the diagnosis and management of pediatric CAP.

CHALLENGES IN CURRENT PNEUMONIA ETIOLOGY STUDIES

Case Definitions Defining Different Syndromes

Unlike case definitions for acute gastroenteritis and febrile illness that are based on the presence of a specific symptom (eg, diarrhea) or sign (eg, fever), case definitions for pneumonia define a syndrome that is irreducible to a single, or even a constellation of, signs and/or symptoms. As already mentioned, WHO created a standardized clinical case management definition for children with suspected pneumonia in the 1980s, placing a priority on sensitivity rather than the specificity achieved in earlier radiologically based definitions. Throughout this article, we refer to sensitivity of a case definition (or test) as the percentage of all children with pneumonia who are identified. On the other hand, specificity refers to the percentage of all children without pneumonia who do not meet a case definition (or did not have a positive test result). High sensitivity usually comes at the expense of misdiagnosing some children without pneumonia as having pneumonia (false positives); high specificity usually comes at the expense of missing some children who have pneumonia (false negatives). Although the WHO's sensitive case definition was developed to maximize the likelihood that children with pneumonia would be treated with antibiotics in peripheral health facilities that lack radiologic capacity, it has been co-opted for use in many pneumonia etiology and disease burden studies. Using the WHO case management definitions results in misclassification, an acceptable consequence in the clinical setting, but a problematic one in the research setting. Many children with conditions other than pneumonia (eg, sepsis, malaria, upper respiratory tract infections) will be included as pneumonia cases; the pathogens detected in these children will therefore be falsely ascribed as causing pneumonia. Another problem is the variety of pneumonia case definitions used in etiology studies. In a review of pneumonia etiology studies done since the year 2000, 61% of the 153 studies used WHO clinical case definitions. However, even among these studies, not all chose the same definition, with some including definitions for "very severe pneumonia", some "severe pneumonia", and some "nonsevere pneumonia". Half also required the presence of a chest radiographic abnormality, whereas others required evidence of acute infection (eg, fever, leukocytosis). Just under half of the studies included children with wheezing, which is likely to include more cases with viral infections. Some studies side-stepped all of these rule-based definitions by using a definition of "physician-diagnosed pneumonia". Such heterogeneity in case definitions leads to incomparability of etiology results.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — erosive esophagitis management and acid suppression safety: Based on expert opinion, the working group recommends the use of PPIs as first-line treatment of reflux-related erosive esophagitis in infants and children with GERD (strong recommendation), and based on expert opinion the working group suggests to use H2RAs in the treatment of reflux related erosive esophagitis in infants and children if PPIs are not available or contra-indicated (weak recommendation). Pediatric trials for the healing of erosive and microscopic esophagitis have shown consistently high rates of healing at PPI doses of 1 to 1.7 mg/kg/day. Despite the fact that none of the GRADE evaluated studies reported any serious adverse events in children taking H2RA or PPIs, case control studies have shown increased risk of infection in infants and children taking these medications compared to non-users, including necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, sepsis, urinary tract infections, and Clostridium difficile infections; acid has a protective effect against bacterial gastrointestinal infections, and it is therefore important that widespread unnecessary usage of acid suppressing medications be avoided, and that when these drugs are used, unnecessarily long-term usage be avoided whenever possible. Importantly, the working group also recommends the importance of regular assessment of the ongoing need for long-term acid suppression therapy in infants and children with GERD, and while increased risk of fractures, dementia, myocardial infarction, and renal disease have been reported in PPI users, no pediatric evidence convincingly documents these risks; these medications should be prescribed only when there is a clear diagnosis of GERD and, whenever possible, the lowest doses should be prescribed for the shortest length of time possible.

### Optimizing advanced imaging of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: technical report [^2dcc7502]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — diagnostic cues and imaging role: Necrotizing fasciitis has a high rate of mortality, making early diagnosis critical, yet diagnosis is challenging with no specific criteria and requires a high degree of clinical suspicion. Suggestive findings include severe pain disproportionate to clinical findings, failure to respond to initial antibiotics, a hard wooden feel of subcutaneous tissue, systemic toxicity, and crepitus. Sensitivity and specificity of imaging is ill-defined and findings are not reliably present. The Infectious Diseases Society of North America notes that CT and MRI can demonstrate findings but may delay definitive diagnosis and treatment. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria rate initial evaluation with radiography as "usually appropriate", and radiographs may demonstrate soft tissue gas. CT with or without contrast can detect soft tissue gas with high sensitivity and may be appropriate given test speed and can show fascial thickening, deep fascial fluid collections, and intermuscular septal edema, while MRI with or without contrast can detect these findings but is less sensitive than CT for soft tissue gas.

Introduction

Pediatric community-acquired pneumonia represents a major cause of lung pathology in children, occurring with an approximate annual incidence of 14.4–15.7 per 10,000 in children younger than 16 years. Its incidence is highest among younger children, with a frequency of up to 33.8 per 10,000 in those younger than 5 years and up to 62.2 per 10,000 in those younger than 2 years. Community-acquired pneumonia can be complicated by parapneumonic effusion, empyema, lung parenchymal necrosis and abscess formation.

Several terms are used to describe pleural complications of pneumonia. A pleural effusion is fluid in the pleural space when no pneumonia is present, while a parapneumonic effusion is always associated with an adjacent consolidation. The term simple parapneumonic effusion refers to an exudative collection without internal septations, while a complex parapneumonic effusion contains fibrinous strands and septations. Empyema is used to describe a pus-containing pleural collection. Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare but severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia characterized by necrosis and liquefaction of consolidated lung tissue, and this can be complicated by solitary or multiple thin-wall intrapulmonary cavities. Lung abscess refers to suppuration of lung tissue and formation of a cavity that contains necrotic debris or gas and is usually surrounded by a well-formed thick-wall inflammatory capsule. Lung necrosis and lung abscess represent a continuum in the spectrum of microbial lung infections. Parapneumonic effusions and empyema can affect approximately 12.6 per 10,000 children that are admitted with pneumonia but are more common in infants and young children. The rate of necrotizing pneumonia among all patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require hospital admission is estimated at 0.8–7.0%.

### Contrast-enhanced ultrasound of pediatric lungs [^55d14649]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

In addition to radiography, ultrasound (US) has long proved to be a valuable imaging modality to evaluate the pediatric lung and pleural cavity. Its many inherent advantages, including real-time performance, high spatial resolution, lack of ionizing radiation and lack of need for sedation make it preferable over other imaging modalities such as CT. Since the introduction of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs), contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has become a valuable complementary US technique, with many well-established uses in adults and evolving uses in children. Lung CEUS applications are still not licensed and are performed off-label, although the added value of CEUS in certain clinical scenarios is increasingly reported. The limited evidence of CEUS in the evaluation of pediatric lungs focuses primarily on community-acquired pneumonia and its complications. In this clinical setting, CEUS is used to confidently and accurately diagnose necrotizing pneumonia and to delineate pleural effusions and empyema. In addition to intravenous use, UCAs can be administered directly into the pleural cavity through chest catheters to improve visualization of loculations within a complex pleural effusion, which might necessitate fibrinolytic therapy. The purpose of this paper is to present the current experience on pediatric lung CEUS and to suggest potential additional uses that can be derived from adult studies.

### Long-term outcomes of necrotizing pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion in children [^2b78d83c]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Patients

Our study was designed as a multicenter, retrospective cohort study. The Pediatric Pulmonology departments of eight tertiary care hospitals were included. Files of patients diagnosed with NP or isolated PPE who were hospitalized between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, and who were under 18 years of age were reviewed, and patients with missing data were excluded (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Flow diagram. BPD, bronchopulmonary disease; CF, cystic fibrosis; NMD, neuromuscular diseases; NP, necrotizing pneumonia; PPE, parapneumonic effusion; PCD, primary ciliary dyskinesia.

Demographic information, clinical findings, laboratory and radiological imaging results, treatment modalities, and lengths of hospital stay were collected from the national online health database, the hospital information management system, and patient records. Only cases of community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) were included in the analysis. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases were excluded to prevent measurement bias (Figure 1). All children in the study were previously healthy and immunocompetent. The treatment model was divided into three main groups: antibiotics (AB) alone, AB and chest tube drainage (CTD), and AB, CTD, and fibrinolytic therapy. Post‐discharge follow‐up data of the patients were evaluated by dividing them into periods defined as < 3 months, 3–6 months, and 6–9 months (Figure 1).

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Medeniyet University School of Medicine (approval number: 2023/0763). Written informed consent was obtained from the participants' parents, and appropriate participants received age‐appropriate assent after eligible patients were determined.

### Complicated pneumonia in children [^fbcea883]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Complicated community-acquired pneumonia in a previously well child is a severe illness characterised by combinations of local complications (eg, parapneumonic effusion, empyema, necrotising pneumonia, and lung abscess) and systemic complications (eg, bacteraemia, metastatic infection, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and, rarely, death). Complicated community-acquired pneumonia should be suspected in any child with pneumonia not responding to appropriate antibiotic treatment within 48–72 h. Common causative organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients have initial imaging with chest radiography and ultrasound, which can also be used to assess the lung parenchyma, to identify pleural fluid; CT scanning is not usually indicated. Complicated pneumonia is treated with a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics, and then oral antibiotics. The initial choice of antibiotic is guided by local microbiological knowledge and by subsequent positive cultures and molecular testing, including on pleural fluid if a drainage procedure is done. Information from pleural space imaging and drainage should guide the decision on whether to administer intrapleural fibrinolytics. Most patients are treated by drainage and more extensive surgery is rarely needed; in any event, in low-income and middle-income countries, resources for extensive surgeries are scarce. The clinical course of complicated community-acquired pneumonia can be prolonged, especially when patients have necrotising pneumonia, but complete recovery is the usual outcome.

### A 10-year review of necrotizing fasciitis in the pediatric population: delays to diagnosis and management [^9cb96e5c]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the promptness and appropriateness of management in pediatric cases of necrotizing fasciitis (NF).

Methods

A retrospective chart review examined cases of pediatric NF treated at a pediatric tertiary care center over a 10-year period.

Results

Twelve patients were identified over the 10-year period. The median (25th to 75th centile) times to appropriate antibiotic administration, infectious disease consults, surgical consults and debridement surgeries were 2.6 (2.1–3.2), 7.7 (3.4–24.4), 4.6 (1.7–21.0), and 22.1 (10.3–28.4) hours following assessment at triage. The initial antibiotic(s) administered covered the causative organism in 9 of 12 cases. The median (25th to 75th centile) length of hospital stay was 21 (14.0–35.5) days.

Conclusions

The large variability in the care of these patients speaks to the range of their presenting symptomatology. The lack of a standardized approach to the pediatric patient with suspected NF results in delays in management and suboptimal antibiotic choice.

### Factors associated with pneumonia severity in children: a systematic review [^beef9cd9]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia in children is associated with significant morbidity and mortality; however, data are limited in predicting which children will have negative outcomes, including clinical deterioration, severe disease, or development of complications. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (PIDS/IDSA) pediatric pneumonia guideline includes criteria that were modified from adult criteria and define pneumonia severity to assist with resource allocation and site-of-care decision-making. However, the PIDS/IDSA criteria have not been formally developed or validated in children. Definitions for mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia also vary across the literature, further complicating the development of standardized severity criteria. This systematic review summarizes (1) the current state of the evidence for defining and predicting pneumonia severity in children as well as (2) emerging evidence focused on risk stratification of children with pneumonia.

### Evaluation of the treatment of aspiration pneumonia in hospitalized children [^20262cfa]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Aspiration pneumonia (AP) treatment is variable with limited available guidance on optimal antibiotic choice and duration. This study evaluated the impact of antibiotic regimen and duration on treatment failure for AP in children and correlated the effects of antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) interventions on treatment duration.

Methods

Hospitalized children who received antibiotics for AP were identified through an existing ASP repository. Diagnosis was confirmed through ASP documentation with either an international classification of diseases 9/10 code or physician diagnosis of AP. Incidence of treatment failure (necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, or retreatment) was compared between patients receiving shorter (≤ 7 days) vs longer (> 7 days) course of antibiotics and between various empiric/final antibiotic regimens utilized. Duration of treatment was evaluated in patients with or without an ASP intervention.

Results

Four hundred and nineteen treatment courses for AP were included. Nineteen episodes (4.5%) of treatment failure were identified. No difference in treatment failure was observed between shorter vs longer courses (8 vs 11 episodes). An aminopenicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor was most frequently utilized for both empiric (47.2%) and final treatment (67.5%). Treatment failure rates did not differ with length of intravenous therapy nor empiric/final antibiotic regimen chosen. ASP interventions targeting duration were associated with significantly shorter courses (6.28 vs 7.46 days; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Shorter courses of antibiotics did not result in more treatment failure for AP when compared to longer courses. Neither antibiotic choice nor route impacted treatment failure rates. ASPs may optimize the treatment of pediatric AP.

### A challenging high-risk surgery for necrotizing pneumonia in a right bilobed lung [^61c7e17e]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 12-year-old cachectic child was referred from a south-border province of Kandahar to our pediatric service complaining of fever, restlessness, shortness of breath, anorexia, and diarrhea. The patient was born to a consanguineous couple with unremarkable antenatal history. The patient developed diarrhea and fever at the age of one year, according to his uncle explanation (as attendant). Since then, with the frequent advice of local physicians, no remedy was achieved, but the condition remained unchanged. During this time, food intolerance and undigested food passage in the stool were also noted by his family. His uncle, added that he took the child two times outside the country for better treatment at the ages of 4 and 9 years respectively. The patient also received anti-TB treatment at the age of 11-year. The reason for his referral to the capital, and then to our pediatric service, was ongoing deterioration of his condition.

On physical exam, the patient looked cachectic, with keratoderma on his both palmoplantar surfaces. With auscultation, respiratory sounds decreased on the right side. In reference to the above-mentioned history, the patient was admitted to the pediatrics ward on the suspicion of TB superimposed by a chest infection, with him being put on triple-antibiotic (linezolid, vancomycin, and metronidazole) therapy until the diagnostic report of TB. Appropriate tests for TB were all negative, but WBC was recorded at 2100/microliter and a chest X-ray (CXR) revealed a right lung middle part density. A chest CT scan was ordered to confirm the diagnosis, which reported a right lung hydatid cyst (Fig. 1 A and B). Here, since the leukopenia was worsening with no evident response, the patient was referred to our pediatric surgery ward on the suspicion of ongoing leukopenia, which may be aggravated by an existing lesion, and admitted.

### Childhood necrotising pneumonia, empyema and complicated parapneumonic effusion secondary to community acquired pneumonia: report of 158 cases from a tertiary hospital in Egypt [^20010fd5]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic complications associated with CAP include sepsis, septic shock, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae), Streptococcus pyogens (S pyogens), Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) are the most common pathogens associated with cCAP in children. Introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13) has led to reduction of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) burden in children, with simultaneous rise of cCAP caused by S pyogens and S aureus, this may be influenced by advancements in diagnostic methodologies, warranting careful interpretation of epidemiological trends. In Egypt, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is not included in the childhood mandatory vaccinations, and it is not widely used. This hypothetically poses a greater risk of CAP and its complications in Egyptian children.

Till this date, management of cCAP remains problematic and treatment strategies are often chosen on case-by-case basis. Prolonged systemic antimicrobial therapy and local interventions remain the standard of care. Choice of antibiotics is guided by local microbiological knowledge and culture results. However, data from low and middle-income countries about most common pathogens and antimicrobial resistance with focus on pediatric cCAP is sparse. This contributes to a greater challenge for cCAP management. Therefore, our study aimed at evaluating the incidence, clinical presentation, causative organism, treatment strategies and outcomes of cCAP in children treated at one of the largest tertiary hospitals in Cairo, Egypt.

### Long-term outcomes of necrotizing pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion in children [^edcee07b]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We analyzed the long‐term follow‐up of NP and PPE. We found restrictive patterns were the most common short‐term spirometric abnormalities in both groups, particularly in NP. During follow‐up, the NP group exhibited a more pronounced improvement in spirometric parameters compared to the PPE group. However, spirometric measurements in both groups approached normal values at long‐term follow‐up (6–9 months). The rate of abnormal spirometry decreased from 55% to 13% in the NP group and from 25% to 13% in the PPE group.

Previously healthy children are expected to recover almost completely clinically and radiologically within 6‐9 months following complicated CAP. Still, close follow‐up is necessary after discharge due to the risk of complications such as pneumatocele and NP. Patients with PPE should be monitored until complete recovery and normalization of chest radiographs, which typically occurs within 3‐6 months. It is predicted that this period may take longer in NP. The long‐term follow‐up of patients with PPE has been investigated for many years, while studies on the long‐term outcome of patients with NP have gained momentum in recent years.

### Outcome of anatomical versus non-anatomical lung resection for necrotizing pneumonia in children [^4f447c20]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the characteristics, complications and outcomes of necrotizing pneumonia (NP) requiring surgical intervention.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of all children who underwent surgical therapy for NP from January 2010 to December 2023. Patients were analyzed based on two surgical approaches: anatomic resection (AR) or non-AR (NAR).

Results

A total of 66 patients (median age: 36 months) required a surgical intervention for NP. A total of 37 patients received AR, 29 received NAR. The AR procedures were segmentectomy (n = 29), lobectomy (n = 8), bilobectomy (n = 1) whereas NAR included wedge resection (n = 13) and necrosectomy (n = 16). The most common reasons for surgery were failure to respond to treatment (43.9%) and sepsis/septic shock (42.4%). A significantly greater proportion of patients in the AR group underwent surgery due to sepsis (p = 0.023). There was no difference in the proportion of patients experiencing complications between the AR group (40.5%) and the NAR group (27.5%) (p = 0.266). The majority of complications in both groups (68.0%) were categorized as minor, with 59.0% of cases occurring in patients who underwent AR. Prolonged air leak was the most frequent complication in both groups. There was no difference in the postoperative hospital stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation between the groups. There were no deaths.

Conclusions

Surgical intervention for NP may result in complications in one-third of patients, mostly minor and unlikely to significantly impact outcomes. Surgery should be tailored to the extent of parenchymal involvement.

Pneumonia — Clinical features include fever, chill, productive cough, myalgia, and headache. Relevant factors include varying disease patterns depending on patients' immune status with immunocompetent vs immunocompromised status, positive microbiology culture or polymerase chain reaction test, and improvement with antibiotic treatment. Pathology shows filling of alveolar spaces by exudate of edema fluid and neutrophil (lobar), patchy peribronchiolar inflammation (bronchopneumonia), and mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate in alveolar septa and interstitial tissue (interstitial pneumonia). Radiologic patterns include lobar pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, and interstitial pneumonia patterns, with atypical pneumonia such as septic emboli, abscess, and chronic pneumonia including actinomycosis or chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis.

### 'Less may be best'-pediatric parapneumonic effusion and empyema management: lessons from a UK center [^463e1597]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Children with empyema are managed at our center using a protocol-driven clinical care pathway. Chemical fibrinolysis is deployed as first-line management for significant pleural disease. We therefore examined clinical outcome(s) to benchmark standards of care while analyzing disease severity with introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.

Methods

Medical case-records of children managed at a UK pediatric center were surveyed from Jan 2006 to Dec 2012. Binary logistic regression was utilized to study failure of fibrinolytic therapy. The effects of age, comorbidity, number of days of intravenous antibiotics prior to drainage and whether initial imaging showed evidence of necrotizing disease were also studied.

Results

A total of 239 children were treated [age range 4months-19years; median 4years]. A decreasing number of patients presenting year-on-year since 2006 with complicated pleural infections was observed. The majority of children were successfully managed without surgery using antibiotics alone (27%) or a fine-bore chest-drain and urokinase (71%). Only 2% of cases required primary thoracotomy. 14.7% cases failed fibrinolysis and required a second intervention. The only factor predictive of failure and need for surgery was suspicion of necrotizing disease on initial imaging (P = 0.002, OR 8.69).

Conclusion

Pediatric patients with pleural empyema have good outcomes when clinical care is led by a multidisciplinary team and protocol driven care pathway. Using a 'less is best' approach few children require surgery.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Empiric Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage — risk factors, nasal swab guidance, and agent considerations: A nasal swab for MRSA can help inform whether initial empiric coverage should include MRSA; in studies without HIV, negative test results have a high negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia, and if the swab is negative with non-severe pneumonia and no other S. aureus risk factors, empiric MRSA coverage may be withheld (BII). In patients with risk factors for S. aureus infection, vancomycin or linezolid should be added (AII), and empiric coverage should also be added if a rapid nasal swab is positive for MRSA, with de-escalation if cultures are negative (BIII). Although not routinely recommended, clindamycin may be added to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) or linezolid alone used if severe necrotizing pneumonia is present to minimize toxin production (CII). Telavancin can be used for S. aureus pneumonia (BIII), but neither telavancin nor ceftaroline have been specifically studied in patients with HIV; ceftaroline is FDA approved for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia based on studies without MRSA isolates. Daptomycin should not be used to treat pneumonia as it is not active in the lung (AII).

### Pneumonia in normal and immunocompromised children: an overview and update [^826e3283]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma caused by a wide variety of organisms in pediatric patients. The role of imaging is to detect the presence of pneumonia, and determine its location and extent, exclude other thoracic causes of respiratory symptoms, and show complications such as effusion/empyema and suppurative lung changes. The overarching goal of this article is to review cause, role of imaging, imaging techniques, and the spectrum of acute and chronic pneumonias in children. Pneumonia in the neonate and immunocompromised host is also discussed.

### Computed tomography in children with community-acquired pneumonia [^2c37aa7e]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

CT needs to be performed at acceptable radiation doses in children and is indicated for diagnosing complications associated with pneumonia, when patients fail to respond to treatment, when chest radiographs are suggestive, when empyema is diagnosed on US and in environments where HIV and tuberculosis are likely coinfections. Even though US is adequate for demonstrating and evaluating effusions, CT is important for demonstrating the underlying lung in search of associated necrosis or abscess formation. CT is superior to chest radiographs and the relatively low theoretical cancer risks need to be appropriately considered against the many advantages it affords the clinician, so as not to deny children the benefits of rapid and accurate diagnosis.

Antibiotic course length and outcomes — comparative evidence: Observational studies suggest that longer exposure to antibiotics is associated with risks including necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birthweight infants, candidemia in hospitalized children, development of antimicrobial resistance, and C. difficile infection. Most studies suggest shorter courses have similar clinical outcomes to longer durations for neonatal bacteremia, pyelonephritis, uncomplicated bacterial meningitis, and pneumonia. Notable exceptions include an RCT where 14 days of antibiotic therapy was superior to 7 days for neonates with S. aureus bacteremia, and an observational study in which greater than 10 days was superior to less than or equal to 10 days for gram-negative bacteremia without removal of a preexisting central venous catheter (CVC).

Defining the clinical questions and relevant outcomes

Our task was updating of pediatric national guidelines in a period of 9 months. In a recent report an international guideline development group engaged an extensive network of experts taking into account multidisciplinary expertise, and regional and gender representation to determine policy-relevant questions. Such an elaborate process was not possible in our case. Policy relevant questions were thus based on the scope of prior guidelines, working knowledge of topic areas and observed local clinical practice, discussions with a small number of key-informants in government and a priori considerations of what might be feasible. Similarly, we defined within the 'GRADE-team' predominantly critical outcomes (mortality and morbidity) that spanned all guideline topics under review. This approach was used to help standardize procedures and in anticipation of presentation and discussion with a national recommendations panel likely to have limited experience considering research evidence. PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) formatted questions (Table 2) were thus constrained from the outset by a modest set of opinions from those within the GRADE-team and local observations. This was in large part driven by limited resources and an absence of mechanisms to rapidly gain wider opinions from key sources including patients, caregivers and policy makers. Although this relatively narrow focus has the potential for introducing bias such compromises seem inevitable in the short to medium term in settings like Kenya.

Table 2
Summary of the GRADE system for guideline development

We defined the following clinical questions regarding antibiotic treatment for children aged 2–59 months with non-severe, severe and very severe pneumonia:

1. For children with non-severe pneumonia, should cotrimoxazole be replaced by amoxicillin?

2. For children with severe pneumonia, should benzyl penicillin be replaced by oral amoxicillin?

3. For children with severe pneumonia, should benzyl penicillin monotherapy be replaced by benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin?

4. For children with very severe pneumonia, should chloramphenicol be abandoned as an alternative treatment to benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin?

5. For children with very severe pneumonia, should benzyl penicillin plus gentamicin be replaced by ceftriaxone?

Children exposed to, or infected with HIV and those with severe acute malnutrition were excluded from our population of interest due to the unique treatment considerations among these groups.

Empiric Staphylococcus aureus treatment — MRSA coverage decisions: "A nasal swab for MRSA can help inform decision-making whether initial empiric coverage should include MRSA". "In studies of patients without HIV, negative test results have a high negative predictive value for pneumonia due to MRSA". If the nasal swab is negative and disease is not severe with no MRSA risk features, "empiric coverage for MRSA may be withheld (BII)". If risk factors for S. aureus are present, "vancomycin or linezolid should be added to the antibiotic regimen (AII)". MRSA coverage "should also be added if a rapid nasal swab is positive for MRSA… and therapy should be de-escalated if cultures are negative (BIII)". For severe necrotizing pneumonia, "the addition of clindamycin to vancomycin (but not to linezolid) or the use of linezolid alone, is recommended by many experts… to minimize bacterial toxin production (CII)".
