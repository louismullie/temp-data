## Question

A 23-year-old woman presents to your clinic with a 6-month history of palpitations, lightheadedness, and fatigue that worsen upon standing and improve with recumbency. Her physical examination is notable for a sustained increase in heart rate of 35 beats per minute within 10 minutes of standing, without orthostatic hypotension. You suspect postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). A colleague suggests ordering specialized autonomic function tests to classify her POTS into neuropathic or hyperadrenergic subtypes before making a diagnosis.

Based on current guideline recommendations, how should you proceed regarding pathophysiological subtyping in the initial screening and diagnosis of POTS for this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether specialized autonomic function tests to subtype POTS into neuropathic or hyperadrenergic forms should be ordered in the initial screening and diagnosis of a 23-year-old woman with suspected POTS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical presentation already meets diagnostic criteria for POTS. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about routine autonomic subtyping in the initial workup. Next, I will consider the clinical scenarios where subtyping might be reasonable despite this. Finally, I will outline the appropriate initial evaluation and when to escalate testing, anchoring to CCS 2020 and HRS 2015 consensus statements.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis at the bedside. In adults, POTS is defined by a sustained heart rate increase of at least 30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing without orthostatic hypotension, with compatible symptoms of orthostatic intolerance; in adolescents the threshold is 40 bpm, and the standing heart rate is often ≥ 120 bpm, which fits this 23-year-old with a 35 bpm rise and standing symptoms that improve with recumbency [^630ec9ca] [^7deebd43] [^95ddcfdd]. Wait, let me verify the measurement protocol: supine vitals after 5 minutes, then standing measurements at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes is the standard approach, and the tachycardia should be sustained across consecutive measurements to meet criteria, which supports making the diagnosis clinically without further subtyping tests today [^95ddcfdd] [^7588d5c2].

> Next, I should review guideline positions on pathophysiologic subtyping during initial evaluation. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society explicitly recommends not using pathophysiological subtyping in the initial screening and diagnosis of POTS because there are no validated, clinically actionable tools for such characterization in routine practice, and subtyping does not change initial management decisions [^69003aaf]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: CCS argues that available tests lack standardization and proven impact on outcomes or therapy selection in the majority of patients, so routine subtyping is discouraged at presentation [^69003aaf].

> I will now examine the Heart Rhythm Society consensus, which aligns with a conservative approach. HRS advises that detailed autonomic testing, catecholamine levels, and tilt-table testing should not be performed routinely; instead, a focused initial workup with history, exam, orthostatic vitals, and ECG is sufficient for most patients to establish the diagnosis and begin treatment, reserving advanced testing for selected refractory or atypical cases [^39a6a7fa] [^f6195941]. Let me reconsider whether any exception applies here: the patient is young, female, has a classic presentation, and no red flags, so she falls squarely within the "most patients" category where routine subtyping is not indicated [^39a6a7fa].

> But wait, what if subtyping could guide therapy now? I should double-check whether early subtyping changes management. Current evidence does not show that identifying neuropathic versus hyperadrenergic subtypes at diagnosis improves outcomes or alters first-line therapy, which centers on education, volume expansion, exercise conditioning, and symptom-targeted medications; subtyping may be considered in refractory or research contexts, but not in routine initial care [^39a6a7fa] [^69003aaf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while some centers describe hyperadrenergic features (e.g., upright norepinephrine ≥ 600 pg/mL or a standing systolic BP rise ≥ 10 mmHg), these are not validated for routine clinical decision-making in the initial visit and should not delay standard care [^d6d003c9] [^39a6a7fa].

> Next, I should review the appropriate initial evaluation so I don't miss anything. The standard workup includes a careful history and physical, orthostatic vital signs with supine 5-minute rest and standing measurements at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes, and a 12-lead ECG; targeted labs such as CBC and TSH can be added selectively, while echocardiography is not routine unless there are features suggesting structural heart disease or diagnostic uncertainty [^39a6a7fa] [^95ddcfdd] [^0e63c63a]. I need to ensure we screen for common comorbidities and contributors (e.g., hypermobility, autoimmune features, volume status, deconditioning) because these can shape counseling and adjuncts, even if they do not mandate immediate subtyping tests [^48d67f72] [^44eb1012].

> I should confirm when advanced testing becomes reasonable. If symptoms persist despite optimized nonpharmacologic and first-line pharmacologic therapy, or if the presentation is atypical (older age, male predominance, prominent syncope, abnormal neurologic or cardiac findings, or refractory course), then referral for specialized autonomic testing, tilt-table evaluation, or targeted workups may be appropriate to clarify diagnosis or uncover alternative etiologies; this is consistent with CCS and HRS guidance for selected patients [^998aac53] [^39a6a7fa] [^2258652f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said tilt testing is never indicated — let me correct that: tilt testing can be considered in selected cases, but it is not required to diagnose POTS when active stand testing is diagnostic and should not be used routinely in straightforward cases [^39a6a7fa] [^95ddcfdd].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. For this 23-year-old with classic POTS features, specialized autonomic function tests to subtype as neuropathic or hyperadrenergic are not recommended in the initial evaluation; the diagnosis is established clinically with orthostatic vitals and ECG, and management should proceed with education, volume and salt strategies, exercise conditioning, and symptom-directed medications, reserving advanced autonomic testing for refractory or atypical presentations after an adequate trial of first-line therapy [^69003aaf] [^39a6a7fa] [^95ddcfdd]. I should double-check that this aligns with both CCS and HRS positions, and yes, both guidelines converge on avoiding routine subtyping at diagnosis while emphasizing a focused, stepwise approach to testing and referral only when indicated [^69003aaf] [^39a6a7fa].

Do not order specialized autonomic function tests for initial POTS subtyping in this patient. Current guidelines recommend diagnosing POTS with **history, exam, orthostatic vitals, and ECG** [^39a6a7fa], and advise against routine subtyping because it does not change initial management [^69003aaf]. Reserve autonomic testing for **atypical or refractory cases** [^2258652f] after nonpharmacologic and first-line pharmacologic therapy fail [^998aac53], or when alternative diagnoses are suspected [^39a6a7fa]. Subtyping is not required for diagnosis or initial treatment [^69003aaf].

## Current guideline recommendations

### Canadian cardiovascular society (CCS) 2020 guidelines

- **Initial evaluation**: CCS recommends a detailed history, physical examination, and orthostatic vital signs (supine 5 minutes, then standing up to 10 minutes) [^95ddcfdd] to diagnose POTS based on hemodynamic and symptom criteria [^7deebd43].

- **Routine subtyping**: CCS explicitly advises against routine pathophysiological subtyping in initial screening and diagnosis because of the lack of validated tools and limited clinical utility [^69003aaf].

- **Additional testing**: CCS recommends against routine tilt table testing, autonomic nervous system testing, serum catecholamines, autoimmune work-up, blood volume assessment, neuroimaging, or neurological studies in routine evaluations [^06afb85c].

- **Referral**: Consider referral to specialty clinics for diagnostic uncertainty or poor response to initial treatments [^998aac53].

---

### Heart rhythm society (HRS) 2015 expert consensus

- **Initial evaluation**: HRS recommends a complete history, physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead ECG for initial POTS evaluation [^39a6a7fa].

- **Routine subtyping**: HRS advises against routine autonomic function testing, tilt table testing, or serum catecholamine measurements because they do not improve care or outcomes in most patients [^39a6a7fa].

- **Selective testing**: Advanced testing may be considered in selected patients with diagnostic uncertainty or refractory symptoms, but not routinely [^39a6a7fa].

---

## Clinical utility of pathophysiological subtyping

Pathophysiological subtyping (neuropathic, hyperadrenergic, hypovolemic) is primarily research-oriented and does not currently guide **initial management** [^69003aaf]. There is no evidence that subtyping improves outcomes or alters **initial therapy**, which focuses on nonpharmacologic measures (hydration, salt intake, compression, exercise) and first-line medications (beta-blockers, midodrine, fludrocortisone) [^39a6a7fa] [^2a1548a5].

---

## Situations where autonomic function testing may be considered

Autonomic function testing may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Atypical presentations or uncertainty after initial evaluation [^39a6a7fa].

- **Refractory symptoms**: Poor response to nonpharmacologic and first-line pharmacologic therapy [^998aac53].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: Suspected autonomic neuropathy or other autonomic disorders [^2258652f].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on current guidelines, **specialized autonomic function testing for initial POTS subtyping is not recommended** in this patient. The diagnosis should be made with history, physical examination, orthostatic vitals, and ECG [^39a6a7fa]; initial management should follow established protocols [^2a1548a5]. Reserve autonomic testing for atypical or refractory cases after initial therapy fails, or when alternative diagnoses are suspected [^998aac53].

### The neuromuscular evaluation of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^2258652f]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a diagnosis with a wide spectrum of symptomatology and a variety of clinicopathological associations, including hereditary, autoimmune, and infectious associations. There is little consensus regarding the appropriate diagnostic approach to the condition. The aim of this work was to provide guidance on the initial diagnosis and when and how to expand diagnostic testing. We define the "typical" POTS patient as younger, female, and with a normal examination apart from joint hyperextensibility. Red flags for "atypical" POTS would be older age at onset, male, prominent syncope, review of systems suggestive of specific alternative diagnoses, examination abnormalities other than joint hyperextensibility, or disease refractory to nonpharmacological and other first-line treatments. Although a limited evaluation is appropriate in POTS with typical features, we recommend an expanded and individualized workup in atypical cases, including additional cardiac testing, autonomic testing, neuropathy workup, and/or autoimmune workup (including consideration of Guillain-Barré syndrome), depending on clinical presentation. We emphasize the importance of shared decision-making in this condition for which treatment remains primarily symptomatic regardless of etiology.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

Etiology and differential diagnosis in POTS — scope and initial evaluation — indicate that the orthostatic tachycardia is idiopathic and not due to systemic autonomic or global medical disease, with key teenage differentials and a pragmatic screening approach. Specifically, "POTS, by definition, implies that the orthostatic tachycardia is an idiopathic disorder neither associated with a systemic autonomic neuropathy nor with a global medical condition". In adolescents, "Malnutrition and anorexia nervosa probably represent the most relevant part of this differential diagnosis", and "Rapid weight loss, even while maintaining a reasonable body weight, can exacerbate symptoms". Baseline autonomic testing shows that "baseline baroreflex function is normal in patients with POTS", and an initial clinical screen can be covered by "a general physical examination, hemogram, and serum chemistries and probably thyroid screen" which "give a relatively comprehensive initial screen".

Table 2 — holistic assessment for suspected Long COVID emphasizes symptom characterization, timelines, modifiers, function, and exam. Symptom identification should note features such as symptom flare 12–48 h after minimal activity (PEM/PESE). Timeline features include symptoms lasting at least 3 months (continuously or relapsing–remitting) and being new or worsened after suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (supportive but not diagnostic). Modifiers/triggers include physical and cognitive activities, social and emotional stressors, and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections, vaccines, boosters. Functional impact spans activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) alongside work/school, family, social, and exercise capacity. Physical exam includes a 10-min stand test in which clinicians record heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) after supine for 5 min and then after standing for 3, 5, 7, and 10 min, with observation of signs and symptoms; Table 1 of the autonomic dysfunction consensus guidance statement outlines diagnostic criteria for POTS, NCS, OH, and IST that incorporate results of the 10-min stand test.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): a critical assessment [^76959261]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Although diagnostic criteria have been developed characterizing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), no single set of criteria is universally accepted. Furthermore, there are gaps in the present criteria used to identify individuals who have this condition. The reproducibility of the physiological findings, the relationship of symptoms to physiological findings, the presence of symptoms alone without any physiological findings and the response to various interventions confuse rather than clarify this condition. As many disease entities can be confused with POTS, it becomes critical to identify what this syndrome is. What appears to be POTS may be an underlying condition that requires specific therapy. POTS is not simply orthostatic intolerance and symptoms or intermittent orthostatic tachycardia but the syndrome needs to be characterized over time and with reproducibility. Here we address critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of POTS in an attempt to arrive at a rational approach to categorize the syndrome with the hope that it may help both better identify individuals and better understand approaches to therapy.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance — Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. Most commonly, the symptoms include lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by hemodynamic disturbances, including blood pressure decrease, which may or may not meet criteria for OH, and heart rate increase, which may be inadequate or compensatory. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

Guideline statements

Q1. What key clinical features should lead to the diagnosis of SIH being considered?

SIH should be considered in any patient presenting with orthostatic headache (other than following iatrogenic dural puncture or major trauma); 'end of the day' or 'second half of the day' headache with improvement of the headache on lying flat (as defined below); thunderclap headache which is followed by orthostatic headache; and new daily persistent headache with an initial orthostatic quality. The presence of associated symptoms (see table 3) should increase the suspicion of SIH.

Table 3
Commonly associated symptoms and rare presentations of SIH*

We recommend a working definition of orthostatic headache as headache which meets the following criteria:

Absent or only mild (1–3/10 on verbal rating scale (VRS)) on waking or after prolonged lying flat.
The onset of the headache occurs within 2 hours of becoming upright.
After lying flat, the headache should have a 'good' improvement in severity (> 50% on VRS) within 2 hours.
The timing of headache onset and offset is consistent.

Q2. What differential diagnoses of SIH should be considered and how should the diagnoses be confirmed?

Differential diagnoses of SIH include postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), orthostatic hypotension, cervicogenic headache and migraine.

PoTS and orthostatic hypotension are diagnosed from a detailed autonomic history and haemodynamic autonomic responses to formal standing tests to document objective evidence of postural tachycardia (increase in heart rate by > 30 beats per minute) or orthostatic hypotension (fall of > 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and/or > 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure). A negative standing test does not exclude the diagnosis of PoTS and if clinical suspicion is high consider additional autonomic testing.

Cervicogenic headache (in the presence of cervical pathology) can be diagnosed with a history confirming that the headache is provoked by cervical movement rather than posture, reduced cervical range of motion and associated myofascial tenderness.

Migraine can be diagnosed with a history confirming that the headache is provoked by movement rather than posture, establishing migrainous biology, including history and trajectory of episodes, presence of aura and vertigo (rather than hearing impairment and tinnitus).

Thunderclap headache presentations are most likely to be related to acute subarachnoid haemorrhage and its wider differential, of which SIH should be considered.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^ce662c0a]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Patients with POTS report a broad‐spectrum symptom burden significantly exceeding predefined normality when compared with healthy individuals, posing significant limitations on functional capacity. The newly developed Malmö POTS symptom score may be useful for the structured evaluation of symptom severity in patients with POTS, offering excellent specificity and sensitivity. Future studies are warranted to test the utility of MAPS score in other populations and clinical settings, and also to track symptom progression/regression and to monitor treatment response over time.

### Autonomic function testing: an important diagnostic test for patients with syncope [^109b15bd]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common problem with a large differential diagnosis. The initial history and physical examination often provide initial clues; however, some cases warrant further testing to determine the underlying cause. Autonomic function testing is a safe way to evaluate patients with syncope further, and to assess their parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Autonomic testing can help to diagnose several conditions, including orthostatic hypotension, delayed orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome and neutrally mediated syncope. Thus, when the cause of syncope is unclear, autonomic testing can help to assess the autonomic nervous system, stratify the risk of future episodes and to guide treatment decisions.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Tachycardia and exercise intolerance after COVID-19 — orthostatic testing and monitoring: While other potential causes of tachycardia are considered, initial outpatient testing should include a 10-minute active stand test to assess for dynamic changes in blood pressure and heart rate, with measurements 5 minutes after being supine, immediately upon standing, and at 2, 5, and 10 minutes thereafter. Orthostatic hypotension is defined by a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 3 minutes of standing. In the absence of orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is defined by an increase in heart rate of > 30 beats per minute in those aged ≥ 19 years or > 40 beats per minute in those aged < 19 years and/or a heart rate of > 120 beats per minute during the 10-minute active stand test; tachycardia should last for more than 30 seconds and be accompanied by symptoms. It is also important that the patient stand quietly for the full 10 minutes, tachycardia unrelated to position is likely due to inappropriate sinus tachycardia (especially if the heart rate does not slow at night), and a 6-minute walk test can help to assess functional capacity while monitoring heart rate and oxygen saturation. Ambulatory rhythm monitoring should also be considered to exclude arrhythmia and define the pattern of heart rate elevation; whereas the latter can likely be done with a 24- to 48-hour Holter monitor, longer-duration monitoring should be considered in those with episodic palpitations. Mobile health devices capable of heart rate and ECG monitoring can also help in evaluation and surveillance monitoring during recovery, and resting heart rate may be higher than that reported before COVID-19 yet may be physiologically appropriate and should not automatically invite assumption of autonomic dysregulation.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: expert review [^89b18e71]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to describe key principles in the evaluation and management of patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) with coexisting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and/or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).

Methods

This expert review/commentary was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinicians should be aware of the observed associations between hEDS or HSDs and POTS and/or MCAS and their overlapping gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations; while theoretical explanations exist, experimental evidence of the biological mechanisms that explain relationships is limited and evolving. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Testing for POTS/MCAS should be targeted to patients presenting with clinical manifestations of POTS/MCAS, but universal testing for POTS/MCAS in all patients with hEDS/HSDs is not supported by the current evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Gastroenterologists seeing patients with DGBI should inquire about joint hypermobility and strongly consider incorporating the Beighton score for assessing joint hypermobility into their practice as a screening tool; if the screen is positive, gastroenterologists may consider applying 2017 diagnostic criteria to diagnose hEDS (https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hEDS-Dx-Criteria-checklist-1.pdf) or offer appropriate referral to a specialist where resources are available. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Testing for POTS through postural vital signs (eg, symptomatic increase in heart rate of 30 beats/min or more with 10 minutes of standing during an active stand or head-up tilt table test in the absence of orthostasis) and referral to specialty practices (eg, cardiology or neurology) for autonomic testing should be considered in patients with hEDS/HSDs and refractory GI symptoms who also report orthostatic intolerance after exclusion of medication side effects and appropriate lifestyle or behavioral modifications (eg, adequate hydration and physical exercise) have been attempted but is not required for all patients with hEDS/HSDs who report GI symptoms alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: In patients presenting to gastroenterology providers, testing for mast cell disorders including MCAS should be considered in patients with hEDS/HSDs and DGBI who also present with episodic symptoms that suggest a more generalized mast cell disorder (eg, visceral and somatic pain, pruritus, flushing, sweating, urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, tachycardia, abdominal cramping, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, urogynecological and neurological complaints) involving 2 or more physiological systems (eg, cutaneous, GI, cardiac, respiratory, and neuropsychiatric), but current data do not support the use of these tests for routine evaluation of GI symptoms in all patients with hEDS/HSDs without clinical or laboratory evidence of a primary or secondary mast cell disorder. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: If MCAS is suspected, diagnostic testing with serum tryptase levels collected at baseline and 1–4 hours following symptom flares may be considered by the gastroenterologist; increases of 20% above baseline plus 2 ng/mL are necessary to demonstrate evidence of mast cell activation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: If a diagnosis of MCAS is supported through clinical and/or laboratory features, patients should be referred to an allergy specialist or mast cell disease research center where additional testing (eg, urinary N-methylhistamine, leukotriene E4, 11β-prostaglandin F2) may be performed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic evaluation of GI symptoms consistent with DGBI in patients with hEDS/HSDs and comorbid POTS and/or MCAS should follow a similar approach to the evaluation of DGBI as in the general population including the use of a positive symptom-based diagnostic strategy and limited noninvasive testing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Testing for celiac disease may be considered earlier in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with hEDS/HSDs who report a variety of GI symptoms and not only limited to those with diarrhea. There is insufficient research to support routine testing for disaccharidase deficiencies or other diet-mediated mechanisms as causes of GI symptoms in hEDS/HSDs. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Diagnostic testing for functional defecation disorders with anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion test, or defecography should be considered in patients with hEDS/HSDs and lower GI symptoms such as incomplete evacuation given the high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction, especially rectal hyposensitivity, in this population. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In patients with hEDS/HSDs and comorbid POTS who report chronic upper GI symptoms, timely diagnostic testing of gastric motor functions (eg, measurement of gastric emptying and/or accommodation) should be considered after appropriate exclusion of anatomical and structural diseases, as abnormal gastric emptying may be more common than in the general population. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Medical management of GI symptoms in hEDS/HSDs and POTS/MCAS should focus on treating the most prominent GI symptoms and abnormal GI function test results. In addition to general DGBIs and GI motility disorder treatment, management should also include treating any symptoms attributable to POTS and/or MCAS. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Treatment of POTS may include increasing fluid and salt intake, exercise training, and use of compression garments. Special pharmacological treatments for volume expansion, heart rate control, and vasoconstriction with integrated care from multiple specialties (eg, cardiology, neurology) should be considered in patients who do not respond to conservative lifestyle measures. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: When MCAS is suspected, patients can benefit from treatment with histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers, in addition to avoiding triggers such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, mechanical stimuli (eg, friction), emotional distress (eg, pollen, mold), or specific medications (eg, opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, iodinated contrast). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Besides general nutritional support, special diets including a gastroparesis diet (ie, small particle diet) and various elimination diets (eg, low fermentable carbohydrates, gluten- or dairy-free, low-histamine diets) can be considered for improving GI symptoms. Dietary interventions should be delivered with appropriate nutritional counseling or guidance to avoid the pitfalls of restrictive eating. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 16: Management of chronic GI symptoms in patients with hEDS/HSDs who do not exhibit symptoms consistent with POTS or MCAS should align with existing approaches to management of DGBI and GI motility disorders in the general population, including integrated multidisciplinary care involving multiple specialties, where appropriate (eg, cardiology, rheumatology, dietician, psychology).

### Stirring the POTS: finding symptom patterns in long COVID [^b5aaf3dc]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Although POTS and OH are both classified under orthostatic intolerance, they differ in their clinical profiles — POTS tends to affect younger individuals and is associated with considerable psychological and functional burden, whereas OH is more common among older adults, those with diabetes, or individuals taking diuretics. POTS has also been linked to conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. POTS is typically subtyped into hypovolemic, neuropathic, and hyperadrenergic forms, which often overlap. Understanding these subtypes requires a broader perspective on autonomic dysfunction (dysautonomia). From a cardiology perspective, particularly among electrophysiologists, POTS has garnered interest due to its clinical overlap with inappropriate sinus tachycardia. This resemblance prompted the Heart Rhythm Society to address POTS in its 2015 expert consensus statement, which included a discussion of diagnostic criteria and potential treatment strategies. At that time, invasive interventions such as sinus node modification and sinus node–sparing ablation were not recommended, reflecting concerns regarding safety and efficacy. However, with ongoing advancements in mapping and ablation technologies, these strategies are once again being explored in carefully selected cases.POTS, therefore, offers valuable insights into a range of domains — its symptoms are consistently triggered by a defined physical stimulus (orthostasis), its objective correlates are observable in vital signs, and its pathophysiology straddles autonomic dysfunction and, increasingly, abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system. As such, it serves as a clinically rich and mechanistically complex condition. In recent years, numerous cases of POTS have been reported under the diagnosis of Long COVID, highlighting its growing relevance in this emerging context.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^a09a354a]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Given the preponderance of evidence, and working independently (a few members of each group provided reviews of the other document), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society collaborationarrived at similar and closely coherent recommendations for TT in unexplained syncope after initial clinical assessment [i.e. detailed history and basic examination including electrocardiogram (ECG) and orthostatic blood pressure measurement], agreeing on a class IIA indication. Furthermore, both groups proposed that when an autonomic disturbance was deemed likely, TT (with additional cardiovascular autonomic assessment, if appropriate) should be a preferred component of the diagnostic strategy.

Recent criticisms by Kulkarni et al. suggest that, like any diagnostic test, TT can be inappropriately applied. Nevertheless, extensive experience, as well as evidence-based practice guideline recommendations, provides clear direction for its appropriate application and indicates when so TT is an important, effective diagnostic tool. Use of other orthostatic stressors might be contemplated (e.g. active standing, squat-stand test), but these have not undergone the scrutiny as potential clinical tools to the degree that has TT, excepting evaluation of initial and classical OH and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome where active standing is well recognized, supported by evidence and, thus, by guidelines.

### Validation of monocular pupillometry in healthy controls and patients with autonomic dysfunction: pupillary biomarkers for autonomic failure [^2091d00d]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Autonomic manifestations including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, thermoregulatory, secretomotor, or pupillomotor dysfunction are prevalent and disabling features in various disorders affecting the central and peripheral nervous system. Early autonomic impairment can present the first symptom, for example, in alpha‐synucleinopathies such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and in autonomic neuropathies such as hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv). Cardiovascular autonomic failure is a key cause of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), diabetes mellitus, and Guillain–Barré Syndrome. Evaluation of autonomic dysfunction can assist with early diagnoses in prodromal disease stages such as in prediabetes or asymptomatic TTR variant carriers. It can also be useful in differential diagnoses of alpha‐synucleinopathies.

To date, the search for widely available, noninvasive biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases and disorders amenable to disease‐modifying treatments remains a critical priority. Autonomic dysfunction is commonly assessed using a battery of validated quantitative measures, primarily focused on evaluating cardiovascular and sudomotor function. However, standardized autonomic function testing is still not widely available. Of note, pupillomotor dysfunction is also prevalent in many autonomic disorders, serving as a potential disease signature in conditions such as autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG). Hence, pupillometry may provide a valuable additional tool for assessing autonomic involvement across multiple domains and different entities. In contrast to diseases with autonomic failure which frequently affect pupillary function, intermittent autonomic disorders including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), initial orthostatic hypotension (iOH) or autonomically mediated syncope typically do not present with persistent and widespread autonomic impairment. These conditions would therefore not be expected to show autonomic pupillary impairment.

### Adolescent fatigue, POTS, and recovery: a guide for clinicians [^360691eb]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2014). Low credibility.

Many teenagers who struggle with chronic fatigue have symptoms suggestive of autonomic dysfunction that may include lightheadedness, headaches, palpitations, nausea, and abdominal pain. Inadequate sleep habits and psychological conditions can contribute to fatigue, as can concurrent medical conditions. One type of autonomic dysfunction, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, is increasingly being identified in adolescents with its constellation of fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, and excessive postural tachycardia (more than 40 beats/min). A family-based approach to care with support from a multidisciplinary team can diagnose, treat, educate, and encourage patients. Full recovery is possible with multi-faceted treatment. The daily treatment plan should consist of increased fluid and salt intake, aerobic exercise, and regular sleep and meal schedules; some medications can be helpful. Psychological support is critical and often includes biobehavioral strategies and cognitive-behavioral therapy to help with symptom management. More intensive recovery plans can be implemented when necessary.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management [^42d5f9c6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a variant of cardiovascular autonomic disorder characterized by an excessive heart rate increase on standing and orthostatic intolerance. POTS affects younger individuals 15–45 years old with a distinct female predominance (≈80%). The prevalence ranges between 0.2% and 1.0% in developed countries. The onset of POTS is typically precipitated by immunological stressors such as viral infection, vaccination, trauma, pregnancy, surgery or psychosocial stress. The most common complaints are dizziness, weakness, rapid heartbeat and palpitation on standing. Moreover, patients often report physical deconditioning and reduced exercise capacity as well as headache, 'brain fog', dyspnoea, gastrointestinal disorders and musculoskeletal pain. The aetiology of POTS is largely unknown and three main hypotheses include an autoimmune disorder, abnormally increased sympathetic activity and catecholamine excess, and sympathetic denervation leading to central hypovolaemia and reflex tachycardia. The golden standard for POTS diagnosis is head-up tilt test with a non-invasive beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring. Although long-term prognosis of POTS is poorly explored, around 50% of patients spontaneously recover within 1–3 years. After the diagnosis has been established, patient should be thoroughly educated about non-pharmacological measures alleviating the symptoms. Exercise training may be very effective and counteract deconditioning. In more symptomatic patients, different drugs directed at controlling heart rate, increasing peripheral vasoconstriction and intravascular volume can be tested. However, the overall effects of pharmacological therapy are modest and the most affected patients remain handicapped. Future efforts should focus on better understanding of POTS pathophysiology and designing randomized controlled trials for selection of more effective therapy.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^aeb83d60]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance which may cause syncope — classification with diagnostic tests, timing, pathophysiology, symptoms, and associations — are summarized as follows. Classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) (classical autonomic failure) is evaluated by a lying-to-standing test (active standing) or tilt table with time to symptoms 30 s–3 min and is characterized by impaired increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with blood pooling and/or severe volume depletion; symptoms include dizziness, pre-syncope, fatigue, weakness, palpitations, and visual and hearing disturbances. Delayed (progressive) OH uses a lying-to-standing test (active standing) or tilt table with a 3–30 min delay and shows progressive fall in venous return with low cardiac output (CO), diminished vasoconstriction capacity, and bradycardia; it has a prolonged prodrome frequently followed by rapid syncope and is associated with old age, autonomic failure, and drug induced (any vasoactive drugs and diuretics), co-morbidities. Delayed (progressive) OH + reflex syncope is identified on tilt table with 3–45 min latency and involves progressive fall in venous return followed by a vasovagal reaction; the prolonged prodrome is always followed by rapid syncope. Reflex syncope (vasovagal syncope [VVS]) triggered by standing is assessed by tilt table with 3–45 min timing and features an initial normal adaptation reflex followed by rapid fall in venous return and vasovagal reaction; it has a clear prodrome ('classic') and triggers always followed by syncope, with young healthy, female dominance noted. Abbreviations: CO = cardiac output; CSS = carotid sinus syndrome; OH = orthostatic hypotension; POTS = postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; SBP = systolic blood pressure; SVR = systemic vascular resistance; VVS = vasovagal syncope.

GI motility testing approach in hEDS/HSDs: Based on the available data, there is no clear evidence to warrant an alternative approach to motility testing in hEDS/HSDs; however, it may be reasonable to consider earlier testing of gastric motor functions with investigations to assess gastric emptying or accommodation in patients with coexisting POTS because underlying autonomic dysfunction may predispose to gastroparesis or perturbations in gastrointestinal motility.

ACC/AHA/HRS orthostatic tachycardia and hypotension definitions — orthostatic tachycardia is "A sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)". Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "A drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture". Initial (immediate) OH is "A transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope". Classic OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture". Delayed OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop", and "The fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold". Neurogenic OH is "A subtype of OH that is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and not solely due to environmental triggers (such as dehydration or drugs)".

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical autonomic practice in Europe A survey of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) and the European federation of autonomic societies (EFAS) [^bb88c6c6]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the impact of the coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on European clinical autonomic practice.

Methods

Eighty-four neurology-driven or interdisciplinary autonomic centers in 22 European countries were invited to fill in a web-based survey between September and November 2021.

Results

Forty-six centers completed the survey (55%). During the first pandemic year, the number of performed tilt-table tests, autonomic outpatient and inpatient visits decreased respectively by 50%, 45% and 53%, and every-third center reported major adverse events due to postponed examinations or visits. The most frequent newly-diagnosed or worsened cardiovascular autonomic disorders after COVID-19 infection included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), orthostatic hypotension, and recurrent vasovagal syncope, deemed likely related to the infection by ≥ 50% of the responders. Forty-seven percent of the responders also reported about people with new-onset of orthostatic intolerance, but negative tilt-table findings, and 16% about people with psychogenic pseudosyncope after COVID-19. Most patients were treated non-pharmacologically and symptomatic recovery at follow-up was observed in ≥ 45% of cases. By contrast, low frequencies of newly-diagnosed cardiovascular autonomic disorders following COVID-19 vaccination were reported, most frequently POTS and recurrent vasovagal syncope, and most of the responders judged a causal association unlikely. Non-pharmacological measures were the preferred treatment choice, with 50–100% recovery rates at follow-up.

Conclusions

Cardiovascular autonomic disorders may develop or worsen following a COVID-19 infection, while the association with COVID-19 vaccines remains controversial. Despite the severe pandemic impact on European clinical autonomic practice, a specialized diagnostic work-up was pivotal to identify non-autonomic disorders in people with post-COVID-19 orthostatic complaints.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^bbb25865]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — a variant of neurally mediated syncope — is recognized by a marked heart rate rise during orthostatic testing, and the syndrome features prominent somatic and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms with characteristic circulatory findings. POTS is recognized by a marked "(30–40 bpm) increase in heart rate either during a formal head-up tilt test (HUTT) or during 3- to 10-min stand tests in the office", and "the clinical syndrome is characterized by multiple somatic symptoms", with "nearly 50% of patients" having "significant gastrointestinal symptoms". Adolescent evaluations describe "excessive venous pooling" in legs, pelvic and splanchnic beds with a "marked decrease in the thoracic blood pool", and "at least transient declines in cerebral blood flow velocity" despite preserved mean arterial pressure; nevertheless, "cerebral autoregulation remains intact" and "most measures of baroreflex integrity are normal". Many patients have "decreased blood volume" with "normal plasma renin and low serum aldosterone", and a subset shows "increased angiotensin II and decreased cutaneous nitric oxide" consistent with endothelial dysfunction.

### Comparison of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring among patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, autonomic dysfunction, and controls [^f76a70cf]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Autonomic dysfunction (AD) refers to a range of conditions that impair the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, leading to clinical manifestations such as orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal motility disorders. AD can arise from primary disorders of the autonomic nervous system or as a secondary response to systemic diseases. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of AD and characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate upon standing, often accompanied by symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness. POTS results from a failure to adequately maintain vascular tone, causing blood pooling in the lower extremities and may contribute to blood pressure (BP) fluctuations.

The American Autonomic Society and European Federation of Autonomic Societies recommend ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to evaluate nocturnal hypertension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, particularly those suspected of having neurogenic supine hypertension and those undergoing treatment with anti-hypotensive agents. However, there are currently no established guidelines advocating for, or against, the use of ABPM in patients diagnosed with POTS. The clinical role and potential utility of ABPM in this population remain undefined and warrants further investigation.

Recommendations — POTS and vasovagal syncope in the young — Pediatric patients presenting with suspected vasovagal syncope or postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should undergo a detailed medical history review and physical examination and undergo a 12-lead ECG. Pediatric patients with suspected POTS should undergo orthostatic testing. Tilt-table testing is reasonable for highly selected pediatric patients with suspected vasovagal syncope. It seems reasonable to treat selected pediatric patients with vasovagal syncope with midodrine. It seems reasonable to treat pediatric patients with vasovagal syncope or POTS with interventions that are recommended for adults with these disorders.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS]) — defined by daily symptoms of chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with tachycardia but without hypotension when standing; symptoms can worsen in the premenstrual period or during menses and include fatigue, nausea, and dizziness that can limit school and sports participation; Ninety percent of cases occur in female patients with symptoms usually within 1–2 years after puberty and often improving in late adolescence, and the reported prevalence is 0.2%; prolonged bed rest (greater than 23 hours) can induce symptoms; diagnosis is clinical but can be confirmed by tilt table testing; management combines hydration and exercise with pharmacologic methods to support volume (eg, fludrocortisone) and mitigate autonomic dysfunction (eg, beta blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).

### Long-term POTS outcomes survey: diagnosis, therapy, and clinical outcomes [^de886c65]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes of patients with POTS have been reported in at least 6 prior studies. The study in 1999 by Sandroni et al from the Mayo Clinic was the first to look at long‐term outcomes. This was a survey study of 40 patients, in which 60% of patients were "functionally back to normal" after a follow‐up period of at least 18 months. However, 73% of patients continued to require fluid supplementation or medications, and up to 77% of patients had worsening orthostatic symptoms when exposed to a stressor, such as ambient heat, exercise, or meals. This study emphasized that previously symptomatic patients clinically improved in their functional levels over time, although most required supplemental therapy. Another long‐term study, a Portuguese study by Sousa et al, used a 40‐minute tilt table test in the diagnosis of POTS, which they acknowledge may have reduced the specificity of the diagnosis. It was unclear in that study at what time of day follow‐up tilt table testing was performed, which is important to consider as significant diurnal variability of heart rate response to upright posture may occur. In their relatively small follow‐up portion of the study, 5 out of 16 patients (31%) were reported to be asymptomatic after a follow‐up period up to 123 months, with 10/16 continuing to require medications to help suppress symptoms; it was unclear whether asymptomatic patients were asymptomatic as a result of continued medication use. Kimpinski and his team at the Mayo Clinic performed a prospective study in 58 adults with POTS after 12 months of follow‐up, including tilt table testing and autonomic survey. As many as 38% of patients no longer met the heart rate criteria for POTS in follow‐up during tilt testing. The specificity of these test results remain unclear, also due to diurnal variability of heart rate response to upright posture and uncertainty regarding how many total patients remained on medication therapy at the 1‐year follow‐up period. Further, although that study specifically looked at objective testing metrics, such as autonomic testing and autonomic scoring tests, it did not query patients about their functionality or their perceived symptom persistence. The study by Bhatia et al, also performed by the Mayo Clinic, specifically looked at patients whose POTS symptoms began in adolescence and included a survey similar to the one used in the current LT‐POTS study. The follow‐up period ranged from 2 to almost 10 years, with 172, or 34%, of the invited patients responding. In that study, 19% of patients reported "resolution of symptoms", although 33% of those patients reported experiencing at least 1 persistent symptom.

### Improving referrals for tilt table testing in patients with transient loss of consciousness [^6eb10c42]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Tilt table testing has been used for over twenty years in the investigation of patients with TLOC. The key aim is to ensure patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed responses are diagnosed early since they might benefit from permanent pacemaker implantation. Furthermore, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) can also be diagnosed by tilt testing.

The ESC recently recommended new guidance regarding indications for tilt table testing:

Class I indication – one episode of unexplained syncope in high risk setting OR recurrent episodes in the absence of heart disease or in the presence of organic heart disease, after cardiac causes of syncope have been excluded OR to demonstrate susceptibility to reflex syncope to the patient.

Class IIa – to discriminate between reflex and orthostatic syncope.

Class IIb – to discriminate between syncope and epilepsy OR a patient with recurrent unexplained falls OR frequent syncope in patients with psychiatric disease. These indications correlate with the level of evidence base: class I indication has evidence that a given treatment or procedure is beneficial, while evidence for class IIb indication is less well established.

Specialty testing

If standard orthostatic blood pressure testing does not reveal OH in an at-risk individual with unexplained postural symptoms, falls, or syncope, then any of the following are appropriate as next steps: (1) conducting extended at-home blood pressure monitoring with results recorded by the patient or caregiver, (2) implementing 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring where the patient can annotate times when supine or standing (to determine a typical range of blood pressures during the day and, with patient annotation of position, help to understand fluctuations), or (3) use of autonomic function tests. Some individuals may develop delayed OH later than 3 min of standing, which can be identified with prolonged standing blood pressures, or prolonged tilt table testing (HUT).

The specialized tests described below are considered by the panel to be beyond the scope of many primary care clinicians and usually require referral to a center specializing in autonomic disorders. Specialized tests for a definitive diagnosis of nOH include autonomic reflex testing (including heart rate variability to paced breathing, heart rate and blood pressure response to a Valsalva maneuver, and continuous blood pressure response to a prolonged HUT). Other tests used to help diagnose nOH may include plasma fractionated catecholamine levels and/or sudomotor function testing.

These specialized tests may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of nOH by demonstrating baroreflex dysfunction based on HUT testing with beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement, and/or the beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate response to the Valsalva maneuver. In addition, cardiovascular reflex testing, tilt table testing, and the Valsalva maneuver may help discriminate multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) from PD. Supine and standing plasma fractionated catecholamine levels can aid in making a diagnosis, but have somewhat low sensitivity. At-home, 24-h blood pressure monitoring may be helpful not only to discern hypotensive episodes throughout the day (as long as patients are strongly encouraged to keep a diary of posture/activity), but also to identify supine hypertension, which is commonly seen in patients suffering autonomic dysfunction, whether or not they are experiencing OH.

### Is postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) a central nervous system disorder? [^79b1705f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), a disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by a rise in heart rate of at least 30 bpm from supine to standing position, has been traditionally viewed as a dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system. However, recent studies and evidence from overlapping conditions suggest that in addition to being considered a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, POTS should be viewed also as a central nervous system (CNS) disorder given (1) significant CNS symptom burden in patients with POTS; (2) structural and functional differences found on neuroimaging in patients with POTS and other forms of orthostatic intolerance; (3) evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion and possible alteration in cerebrospinal fluid volume, and (4) positive response to medications targeting the CNS and non-pharmacologic CNS therapies. This review outlines existing evidence of POTS as a CNS disorder and proposes a hypothetical model combining key mechanisms in the pathophysiology of POTS. Redefining POTS as a CNS disorder can lead to new possibilities in pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions in patents affected by this disabling syndrome.

Orthostatic Vital Signs

The Phase 1 pathway recommended sitting heart rate and blood pressure with formal orthostatic vital signs using the American Autonomic Society guidelines of supine values at 1 and 3 minutes followed by standing values at 1 and 3 minutes. 16 Each specific value was recorded in 40% to 76% of patients with typical syncope and in 75% to 94% of patients diagnosed with POTS. For the initial SDF, a change in HR between supine and standing of ≥ 30 bpm combined with plausible symptoms permitted a diagnosis of POTS.

For the overall cohort, the baseline supine HR was 73 ± 13 with blood pressure of 111/60 (± 11 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure [SBP] and ± 9 for diastolic blood pressure [DBP]). There was no clinically meaningful change between the 2 supine measurements. There was a mean 22 (± 14) bpm increase in HR by 3 minutes of standing (P < 0.0001). SBP did not change with standing, while DBP increased a mean of 5 mm Hg (95% CI 3.9–5.8, P < 0.0001).

Supine SBP and DBP were statistically slightly lower compared to sitting (SBP 111 ± 12; DPB 63 ± 9, P < 0.01) but the magnitude of that change was sufficiently small (95% CI 0.4–2.1 mm Hg for SBP and 2.0–3.5 for DBP) that these distinctions were judged insignificant in a practical sense. With continued standing between the first and third minutes, there were minimal changes in paired systolic BP measurements (an ≈2 mm Hg decline between 1 and 3 minutes) with no change in mean measurements.

A summary of orthostatic HR changes is presented in Figure 4. Overall, 79% of typical syncope patients had < 30 bpm and 94% had < 40 bpm increase from supine heart rate at 1 minute to standing heart rate at 3 minutes compared to 36% of patients classified as POTS who had < 30 bpm and 64% < 40 bpm increase, respectively.

### Pediatric postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: where we stand [^693acd6a]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), first described in 1992, remains an enigmatic, yet severely and variably debilitating, disorder. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not understood, and there remains no biomarker indicating the presence of POTS. Although research interest has increased in recent years, there are relatively fewer clinical and research studies addressing POTS in children and adolescents compared with adults. Yet, adolescence is when a large number of cases of POTS begin, even among adult patients who are subsequently studied. This article summarizes reported research in POTS, specifically in pediatric patients, including discussion of aspects of diagnostic criteria, risk factors and outcomes, neurohormonal and hemodynamic abnormalities, clinical assessment, and treatment. The goals of this review are increased recognition and acknowledgment of POTS among pediatric and adolescent providers, as well as to provide an understanding of reported abnormalities of homeostasis, such that symptomatic patients will be able to be recognized and appropriately managed, enabling them to return to their activities of daily living.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^da8bf060]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and vasovagal syncope in the young — although the cornerstone for the diagnosis of pediatric POTS is the medical history, an orthostatic test is required to confirm the diagnosis, and the diagnostic standard for tilt-table testing for POTS in young people requires symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and an orthostatic increase in heart rate of at least 40 bpm; the 10-minute standing tests for POTS provided reasonable accuracy in a small study on adults, but these tests have not been validated for pediatric populations. Given that the medical history usually provides a clear diagnosis and that tilt testing has imperfect sensitivity and specificity in pediatric patients, such testing is usually not indicated, while an ECG is a simple and well-tolerated test to screen for relatively uncommon but dangerous causes. Prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring (external loop event monitor or an ILR) is reasonable if the clinical history suggests an inheritable arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy or severe bradycardia or if the patient is refractory to medical therapy, and a 24-hour Holter monitor can be performed to distinguish POTS from IST. Syncope during exercise usually raises concern about a rare cardiac electrical or structural cause, but the most common cause of exercise-related syncope in pediatric populations is still vasovagal syncope, and pseudosyncope should be suspected when patients present with very frequent (at least daily) or prolonged syncope.

Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and risk stratification — syncope: The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with T-LOC consists of "careful history, physical examination, including orthostatic BP measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG)". Based on these findings, additional examinations "may be performed", including "CSM in patients > 40 years", echocardiogram "when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause", "Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope", and "Orthostatic challenge (lying-to-standing orthostatic test and/or head-up tilt testing) when syncope is related to the standing position or there is a suspicion of a reflex mechanism"; "Other less specific tests such as neurological evaluation or blood tests are only indicated when there is suspicion of non-syncopal T-LOC". The initial evaluation "should answer three key questions" about whether the event is a syncopal episode, whether "the aetiological diagnosis" is determined, and whether "there are data suggestive of a high risk of cardiovascular events or death". For diagnosis of syncope, the following "should be answered": "Was LOC complete? Was LOC transient with rapid onset and short duration? Did the patient recover spontaneously, completely and without sequelae? Did the patient lose postural tone?" If all are positive there is a "high likelihood of being syncope"; if any are negative, "exclude other forms of LOC before proceeding with syncope evaluation". Initial evaluation "is able to define the cause of syncope in 23–50% of patients".

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) [^0ec41809]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterised by autonomic dysfunction and an exaggerated sympathetic response to assuming an upright position. Up till recently, it was largely under-recognised as a clinical entity. There is now consensus about the definition of POTS as a greater than 30/min heart rate increase on standing from a supine position (greater than 40/min increase in 12-19-year-old patients) or an absolute heart rate of greater than 120/min within 10 min of standing from a supine position and in the absence of hypotension, arrhythmias, sympathomimetic drugs or other conditions that cause tachycardia. We present two cases of POTS, followed by a discussion of its pathogenesis, pathophysiology, epidemiology and management.

### Vagal and sympathetic function in neuropathic postural tachycardia syndrome [^2c80a26a]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of neuropathic postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) requires research techniques not available clinically. We hypothesized that these patients will have impaired vagal and sympathetic cardiovascular control that can be characterized with clinical autonomic tests. We included 12 POTS patients with possible neuropathic subtype because of normal plasma norepinephrine and no increase in upright blood pressure. We compared them to 10 healthy subjects. We assessed hemodynamics, heart rate and blood pressure variability, baroreflex sensitivity, raw and integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity, and blood volume. To understand the vagal/sympathetic control, we dissected the phase 2 of Valsalva maneuver (VM) into early (VM2e) and late (VM2l). POTS' upright heart rate increased 43 ± 3 bpm. Patients had normal plasma volume but reduced red blood cell volume (1.29 L versus predicted normal values 1.58 L; P = 0.02). Vagal indices of heart rate variability, HF RRI (430 ± 130 versus 1680 ± 900; P = 0.04), PNN50, and root mean squared of successive differences were lower in POTS. Patients showed a decrease in vagal baroreflex sensitivity (VM2e; P = 0.04). In POTS, integrated muscle sympathetic nerve activity was lower at rest (12 ± 1.5 versus 20 ± 2 burst/min; P = 0.004) and raw muscle sympathetic nerve activity spike analysis showed blunted responses during VM2e, despite a greater drop in systolic blood pressure (34 ± 5 in POTS and 14 ± 6 mmHg in controls; P = 0.01). This cohort of POTS patients enriched for possible neuropathic subtype had lower resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity, impaired vagal cardiac control, and exaggerated drop in blood pressure in response to VM and a delay in the sympathetic cardiovascular responsiveness during hypotensive challenge.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^bf8236a8]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia — definitions and haemodynamic patterns — are detailed as follows: Classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 20 mmHg and in diastolic BP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing; initial OH is a BP decrease immediately on standing of > 40 mmHg with rapid recovery such that the period of hypotension is short (< 30 s), and tracings show the nadir at 7–10 s followed by recovery; in autonomic failure (ANF), BP may fall immediately after standing to very low levels after 1 min upright with little heart rate (HR) increase; delayed (progressive) OH is not uncommon in elderly persons, is attributed to age-related impairment of compensatory reflexes and stiffer hearts, is characterized by a slow progressive decrease in systolic BP on assuming erect posture, is differentiated by the absence of a bradycardic reflex but may be followed by reflex bradycardia with a less steep fall in BP in the elderly than in the young; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) occurs in some patients, mostly young women, with severe orthostatic intolerance but not syncope and very marked HR increases [> 30 beats per minute (b.p.m.) or to > 120 b.p.m.], is frequently associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, and its underlying pathophysiology remains to be determined.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^682570e9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The generalized autonomic dysfunction together with fatigue and concentration difficulties observed in POTS cannot be explained by single organ dysfunction but is likely a result of multiple mechanisms. In this study, we have particularly noted the association between two main symptoms, palpitations, concentration difficulties and haemodynamic parameters on standing. HR increase seems to be the only parameter that is associated with both concentration difficulties and palpitations, although blood pressure also seems to play an important part in symptom generation. We hypothesized that if vasoactive medications were added as a treatment strategy in patients showing signs of lower blood pressure during head‐up tilt, compensatory tachycardia could possibly decrease and concentration difficulties improve. Thus, future studies assessing serial assessments using the MAPS symptom score in relation to treatment of POTS would be of interest.

Strengths and limitations

To date, no objective tool exists to gauge symptom burden, assess disease progression and response to treatment in POTS. This is the first study to derive a questionnaire‐based scoring system to assess severity of symptom in POTS. Further, MAPS score yields excellent specificity and sensitivity for classifying POTS. Moreover, the self‐administered nature of the MAPS questionnaire eliminates possible interviewer bias associated with physician‐assisted or health worker‐assisted administration. This study is limited by its single‐centre, observational nature and selection and referral biases. The score warrants external validation and replication in a larger multicentre setting. The group of POTS patients was highly selected, meaning that the results may not represent symptoms presented by POTS patients with less pronounced disease.

Perspectives

POTS is a complex syndrome with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance significantly impacting and limiting the functional capacity. The newly developed MAPS score may be useful for the structured evaluation of symptom severity in patients with POTS. The observed increase in individuals reporting POTS‐like symptoms following COVID‐19 emphasizes the urgent need for an easily self‐administered questionnaire, such as MAPS, to assess the severity of the syndrome. Future prospective studies should aim to test the utility of MAPS score to evaluate pre‐test likelihood of disease, to assess health‐related quality of life, to track symptom progression/regression over time, to monitor the outcome of patients and to measure the effect of the therapies either for clinical purposes or for research. Additional studies are also necessary to validate the score in other populations and clinical settings. Finally, comparative studies using validated autonomic symptom scores such as COMPASS‐31 and non‐disease‐specific questionnaires assessing the total functional capacity are warranted.

### Functional abdominal pain: time to get together and move forward [^8eac9d41]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Medium credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — diagnostic thresholds and tilt testing: An exaggerated orthostatic heart rate increase defines POTS, with "typically 30bpm during orthostatic vital signs, and 30 to 40bpm or heart rate ≥ 120bpm 6 min into a 60° to 70° HUTT". In adolescents, "changes of < 30bpm during either of these evaluations are likely physiological". Screening can use orthostatic vitals with "supine heart rate and blood pressure and 3 minutes after standing". For head-up tilt testing, patients are "tilted up to 60° to 70° and observed for 6 to 30 minutes", and "Prolonged (longer than 16 minutes) and steep (> 70°) tilts may have up to a 40% incidence of physiologically positive faints in adolescents".

### Pain management in pediatric patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: current insights [^7588d5c2]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Challenge I: Complexities And Misunderstandings

The diagnosis of POTS is based on some fundamental tenets. Those include the documentation of a sustained heart rate elevation in upright versus supine heart rate, the absence of orthostatic hypotension, the presence of symptoms for a prolonged period of time, and the absence of other potential causes for the symptoms. The diagnostic criteria vary slightly for adults (> 19 years old) and adolescents (12–19 years old).

To properly document the elevated heart rate, blood pressure measurements should be taken once the patient has been supine for 5 mins. The patient should then stand upright, and heart rate and blood pressure measurements should be taken at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-mins intervals. Adolescents (aged 12–19 years) with a heart rate increase greater than or equal to 40 beats per minute at 10 mins, or absolute upright heart rate of greater than 120 beats per minute, fulfill the initial diagnostic criterion (> 30 bpm for patients > 19 years old). Postural tachycardia may also be diagnosed using a head-up tilt table test. The postural tachycardia as noted above must also be diagnosed in the absence of orthostatic hypotension (drop in blood pressure of > 20/10 mm Hg). These criteria are the same across age groups.

Diagnostic evaluation of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS)/hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and/or MCAS should largely follow general-population guidance using a positive symptom-based strategy, limited noninvasive testing, and attention to individual factors and drugs such as opioids; for celiac disease, testing with serology followed by endoscopic biopsies could be considered earlier in individuals with hEDS/HSDs; with the exception of vascular EDS, endoscopy-related complications such as perforation do not appear to be increased and age- and indication-appropriate endoscopic evaluation should be performed; for chronic pain, opioid medications should be avoided and, if already prescribed, managed through a careful multidisciplinary approach with facilitation of opioid cessation; there is insufficient research to support the routine testing for carbohydrate maldigestion or malabsorption, validated clinical tests for mast cell–mediated mechanisms of abdominal pain are lacking, and there is limited evidence to guide MCAS-specific tests such as serum tryptase levels or mast cell staining on endoscopic biopsies for isolated GI symptoms without evidence of a generalized mast cell disorder.

Autonomic evaluation in syncope — recommendation and context: Referral for autonomic evaluation can be useful to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy in selected patients with syncope and known or suspected neurodegenerative disease (IIa, C-LD). Syncope due to neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) is common in patients with central or peripheral autonomic nervous system damage or dysfunction, and confirmation of specific neurogenic OH conditions causing syncope often requires additional autonomic evaluation.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome – current experience and concepts [^88df2072]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. PoTS is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young (aged between 15 years and 40 years) and predominantly female. The symptoms — palpitations, dizziness and occasionally syncope — mainly occur when the patient is standing upright, and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, such as modest exertion, food ingestion and heat, are now recognized to be capable of exacerbating the symptoms. Onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery or stress. PoTS can be associated with various other disorders; in particular, joint hypermobility syndrome (also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This Review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS, and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, as well as current and investigational treatments.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) definition — POTS is "a clinical syndrome usually characterized by (1) frequent symptoms that occur with standing", with physiologic criteria including "an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats per minute (bpm) when moving from a recumbent to a standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12 to 19 years of age)" and "the absence of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure)". The standing heart rate in POTS "is often ≥ 120 bpm, and undergoes greater increases in the morning than in the evening", and orthostatic heart rate increases "gradually decrease with age and not abruptly at age 20". The document also notes that "the diagnoses of POTS and vasovagal syncope are not mutually exclusive".

### High incidence of autonomic dysfunction and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID: implications for management and health care planning [^1a818265]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Autonomic dysfunction, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), has been reported in individuals with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). However, the degree of dysautonomia in PASC has not been compared to those with POTS and healthy controls.

Methods

All participants were prospectively enrolled between August 5, 2021 and October 31, 2022. Autonomic testing included beat-to-beat hemodynamic monitoring to assess respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Valsalva ratio, and orthostatic changes during a 10-minute active standing test, as well as sudomotor assessment. The Composite Autonomic Symptom Score (COMPASS-31) was used to assess symptoms and the EuroQuol 5-Dimension survey (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess health-related quality of life (HrQoL) measures.

Results

A total of 99 participants (n = 33 PASC, n = 33 POTS, and n = 33 healthy controls; median age 32 years, 85.9% females) were included. Compared with healthy controls, the PASC and POTS cohorts demonstrated significantly reduced respiratory sinus arrhythmia (P < .001), greater heart rate increase during 10-minute active standing test (P < .001), greater burden of autonomic dysfunction evidenced by higher COMPASS-31 scores across all subdomains (all P < .001), and poor HrQoL across all EQ-5D-5L domains (all P < .001), lower median EuroQol-visual analogue scale (P < .001), and lower utility scores (P < .001). The majority (79%) of those with PASC met the internationally established criteria for POTS.

Conclusion

The prevalence of autonomic symptomology for POTS was high in those with PASC, leading to poor HrQoL and high health disutility. Autonomic testing should be routinely undertaken in those with PASC to aid diagnosis and direct appropriate management to improve health outcomes.

### Long-term POTS outcomes survey: diagnosis, therapy, and clinical outcomes [^c47e06cd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

POTS is estimated to affect 1 to 3 million adults and children in the United States. It is typically diagnosed in adolescence, and causes significant disability that interferes with school, social activities, sports, and maturation. Improved understanding of POTS symptom presentation and historical features can inform provider education, improve diagnostic outcomes, and help patients self‐advocate when their health care providers are failing them.

Our LT‐POTS survey, with > 225 patients and a mean duration of 9.6 years since symptom onset, is one of the largest and longest studies evaluating outcomes in patients with POTS. It is also one of the most wide‐ranging in scope, with its review of multiple aspects of evaluation, care, and downstream effects. Our data revealed numerous points of interest in pediatric patients with POTS, some of which confirm findings from prior studies, and some of which are novel. Female patients are significantly overrepresented in this sample, similar to the demographic overrepresentation seen in the Big POTS Study reportas well as in our 2018 demographics assessment within our pediatric POTS program. In reviewing the symptomatology of the patients, a wide range of symptoms was seen, as has been shown previously (Figure 3). Female patients were more likely to have a higher symptom burden. These symptoms were felt to be quite severe at their worst, yet the large majority of symptoms either disappeared or was quite mild at their least noticeable. The worst symptom reported was fatigue, which also had one of the higher relative scores when symptoms were reported at their least severe, indicating that neither it nor heat intolerance ever fully improved, even when other symptoms may have resolved. Importantly, only 0.9% (2/215 of patients) reported that they had had no symptoms in the prior month. This is in sharp contrast to the prior studies that have described a high rate of spontaneous resolution of symptoms in patients. This drastic difference between our findings and the historical documentation warrants further exploration. It may be related to the framing of the questions, how many questions and follow‐up questions were asked, or possibility a product of confirmation bias of previous research, where researchers sought evidence confirming the theory that POTS was a nonpermanent condition and completely self‐resolving. However, the median number of symptoms reported in the month before completing the survey was 13, suggesting that although severity of symptoms could be improved, multiple varied symptoms are still experienced by these patients. Although symptom severity was worse for female patients as compared with male patients when symptoms were at their worst, there was no significant difference between sexes when symptom severity was at its least. This indicates that both sexes had the potential to have equal reduction of the severity in their various symptoms, although in a month‐by‐month basis, overall symptom severity was worse in female patients. Diseases that have disparate manifestation between sexes has previously been reported, in which certain disorders demonstrate more severity in female patients, whereas others are worse in male patients. Overall, POTS appears to be a medical condition that is worse in female patients. It is important to recognize that the severity totals when symptoms were at their worst or when they were at their least only indicate individual severity scores at any time over a patient's clinical course. In contrast, the severity from the previous month is more of an accurate indicator of the combination of and the severity of the patents' symptoms at one time.

### MalmöPOTS symptom score: assessing symptom burden in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^483984f0]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we used the newly developed 12‐item score Malmö Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) score (MAPS) as a potential tool to assess the symptom severity in POTS patients by comparing the difference in symptom burden between POTS patients and healthy controls.

Notably, we observed a fivefold increase in symptom severity reported by patients with POTS compared with healthy controls in all symptom categories, which agrees with earlier studies confirming a decreased quality of life in POTS. Currently, there are no clinical self‐administered instruments specifically dedicated to evaluation of symptom burden in POTS. Those applied in the clinic and research are usually based on previous score systems created for other conditions such as autonomic failure or orthostatic hypotension and are inevitably associated with lesser precision.

In our study, patients with POTS were predominantly younger females, which is in line with previous studies. Also, all baseline haemodynamic parameters obtained during head‐up tilt were significantly higher in POTS patients. Interestingly, we found that elevated HR and lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 10 min of head‐up tilt were associated with more pronounced palpitations experienced by patients with POTS, whereas concentration difficulties were associated with elevated HR on standing. These findings in accordance with sympathetic overactivity in POTS patients and may be partly explained by increased circulating norepinephrine levels in these patients as shown by previous studies.

Considering the pathophysiology of POTS, we know that some subtypes of POTS are suggested to be related to hypovolemia and peripheral autonomic neuropathy. The observed increase in HR can be seen both as a compensatory mechanism but also as a pathophysiological pathway where catecholamine release is a priori exaggerated. Moreover, reported symptoms may reflect a reduction in the capacity to autoregulate cerebral blood flow and the metabolic sequalae of persistent tachycardia.

A previous study in 32 POTS patients used the Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale 31 (COMPASS‐31) questionnaire, which is a validated tool assessing autonomic symptoms across six domains, initially established to assess symptoms of neurogenic autonomic disorders, found that the COMPASS‐31 did not fully ascertain key symptoms relevant for assessment of POTS, and important differences occurred when applying COMPASS‐31 to POTS with domain weighting deemphasizing certain significant symptoms relevant to POTS.
