## Question

Tone and power difference in case of central and peripheral cases of hypotonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differences in tone and power in central versus peripheral hypotonia, including definitions, pathophysiology, bedside discriminators, diagnostic testing, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of tone versus power. Then, I should localize the neuroanatomy that distinguishes central from peripheral hypotonia. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that explains why tone and power behave differently in each category. After that, I will extract bedside discriminators from the literature and verify their reliability. Then, I should review diagnostic testing strategies, including when to prioritize rapid genome or exome sequencing. Finally, I will consider management implications, including hip surveillance and rehabilitation principles, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't conflate terms. Tone refers to the passive resistance to stretch and is assessed by moving a joint through its range while the patient is relaxed, whereas power refers to the maximal force a muscle can generate during active contraction, essentially strength, and in infants we infer power from antigravity movements and resistance to examiner-provoked movement rather than formal MRC grading, which is not appropriate in neonates [^111STdve] [^113RRai7].

> I need to localize the neuroanatomy next. Central hypotonia arises from supraspinal or suprasegmental pathways, including corticospinal, reticulospinal, and cerebellar circuits, whereas peripheral hypotonia reflects disorders of the lower motor neuron unit, encompassing anterior horn cells, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and muscle itself, which explains why tone and power are affected differently in each category [^114e9ta4] [^115cvmdK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I verify them. In central hypotonia, the net effect is reduced baseline muscle tone due to impaired descending facilitatory drive, yet strength may be relatively preserved early because the final common pathway is intact; in contrast, peripheral hypotonia reflects a primary inability of the motor unit to generate force, so weakness accompanies hypotonia, and reduced or absent reflexes are common when the reflex arc is interrupted, which aligns with the classic teaching that central hypotonia often shows normal or hyperactive reflexes while peripheral hypotonia shows hyporeflexia or areflexia [^111STdve] [^115cvmdK].

> Wait, let me verify the bedside discriminators that separate these entities in practice. Central hypotonia typically presents with low tone but preserved or hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, possible primitive reflex persistence, and antigravity movements that are present though perhaps clumsy, whereas peripheral hypotonia more often shows marked weakness with limited antigravity movement, hyporeflexia or areflexia, muscle atrophy or fasciculations, and sometimes contractures; importantly, severe weakness with absent antigravity movement is highly suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder, and contractures at birth point toward a prenatal-onset peripheral process [^111STdve] [^114L3A7g].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "absent antigravity movement" had a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 75% for neuromuscular disease, but I should double-check the exact figures. Let me reconsider and correct that. The study actually found that absent or extremely reduced antigravity movements had a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 75% for neuromuscular disorders, whereas partial-range antigravity movements were more frequent in non-neuromuscular diagnoses, reinforcing that the degree of weakness helps separate peripheral from central causes at the bedside [^114L3A7g].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure I align with contemporary guidance. In neonates with unexplained hypotonia, a staged workup anchored in history and examination is appropriate, but rapid genome or exome sequencing has emerged as a first-line test in NICU settings because it yields a diagnosis in more than half of cases and frequently changes management; targeted tests such as Prader-Willi methylation, SMA deletion testing, and myotonic dystrophy repeat analysis remain high-yield in selected phenotypes, and neuroimaging supports central versus peripheral localization when the exam is indeterminate [^113e3fdp] [^1134ncgk].

> I will now examine management implications, and I need to ensure I don't overlook musculoskeletal complications. Children with developmental central hypotonia are at increased risk for hip dysplasia, subluxation, and dislocation, and emerging consensus supports proactive hip surveillance with early ultrasound between 6 weeks and 6 months and longitudinal orthopedic follow-up, because instability can emerge or worsen with weight-bearing. This risk appears comparable to or even greater than in some CP cohorts, and surveillance should extend into adolescence when hypotonia persists [^114isBjx] [^115Paz4J].

> But wait, what if the hypotonia is peripheral and progressive? I should confirm the role of electrodiagnostics. Electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction studies and electromyography, help localize to nerve, neuromuscular junction, or muscle, clarify severity and chronicity, and inform prognosis and management; in congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy due to CNTNAP1, for example, severely reduced conduction velocities and hypomyelination are characteristic and correlate with poor outcomes, underscoring the value of early testing when peripheral hypotonia is suspected [^116brxo6] [^112AvzcB].

> Let me think about rehabilitation principles and whether they differ by etiology. Regardless of cause, early developmental intervention and family education are essential, but in central hypotonia the emphasis often includes postural management, balance and trunk control training, and facilitation of developmental milestones, whereas in peripheral hypotonia, strengthening within safe limits, orthotic support for weak limbs, and respiratory support when indicated are priorities. I should confirm that these distinctions are consistent with consensus care pathways and contemporary CP rehabilitation frameworks that integrate tone-specific goals and functional outcomes [^112ySwNk] [^114e9ta4].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overstated the reflex dichotomy. While normal or brisk reflexes favor central hypotonia and absent or diminished reflexes favor peripheral hypotonia, mixed patterns occur, particularly in combined central and peripheral processes or in disorders with both upper and lower motor neuron features; thus, the totality of tone, power, reflexes, and ancillary findings must be integrated rather than relying on a single sign in isolation [^115cvmdK] [^115hcZ17].

> In summary, I need to ensure the synthesis is clinically actionable. Tone and power are distinct constructs: tone is passive resistance to stretch, and power is active force generation. Central hypotonia reflects impaired descending control with relatively preserved strength early and normal or hyperactive reflexes, whereas peripheral hypotonia reflects primary motor unit failure with weakness, hyporeflexia, and often atrophy or contractures. Careful bedside differentiation guides targeted testing, with rapid genome or exome sequencing increasingly central in neonates, and management must anticipate etiology-specific risks such as hip instability in central hypotonia and respiratory or feeding complications in peripheral hypotonia, all within a coordinated multidisciplinary framework [^111STdve] [^113e3fdp] [^114isBjx].

Central hypotonia reflects **reduced muscle tone** due to brain or spinal cord lesions, with **preserved or increased reflexes** and often normal or near-normal strength, whereas peripheral hypotonia reflects **lower motor neuron or muscle disorders**, with **reduced reflexes** and clear weakness. Central hypotonia shows **normal or brisk reflexes**, poor antigravity control, and delayed motor milestones, while peripheral hypotonia shows **hypo- or areflexia**, marked weakness, and low muscle bulk. Accurate differentiation guides **targeted testing** and management [^117WmP65] [^113e3fdp].

## Clinical features and tone differences

| **Feature** | **Central hypotonia** | **Peripheral hypotonia** |
|-|-|-|
| Reflexes | Normal or brisk | Reduced or absent |
| Muscle bulk | Normal or increased | Decreased |
| Antigravity control | Poor | Severely impaired |
| Primitive reflexes | Persistent or exaggerated | Absent or weak |
| Joint hypermobility | Common | Less common |

---

Central hypotonia presents with **normal or brisk reflexes**, normal or increased muscle bulk, poor antigravity control, persistent or exaggerated primitive reflexes, and joint hypermobility. In contrast, peripheral hypotonia shows **reduced or absent reflexes**, decreased muscle bulk, severely impaired antigravity control, absent or weak primitive reflexes, and less joint hypermobility.

---

## Power differences

Central hypotonia shows **normal or near-normal strength** with weakness mainly affecting posture and movement control, whereas peripheral hypotonia shows **marked weakness** with difficulty achieving antigravity movements and reduced muscle bulk.

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential to distinguish central from peripheral hypotonia:

- **History and examination**: Detailed perinatal history, family history, and neurologic examination [^1154H8Qu].
- **Neuroimaging**: Brain MRI for central hypotonia; spine MRI if indicated [^111STdve].
- **Electrodiagnostics**: EMG and nerve conduction studies for peripheral hypotonia [^116brxo6].
- **Genetic testing**: Rapid exome or genome sequencing for unexplained neonatal hypotonia [^113e3fdp].

---

## Clinical implications

Accurate differentiation guides **management**:

- **Central hypotonia**: Focus on developmental therapies, orthotic devices, and management of associated neurologic conditions [^notfound].
- **Peripheral hypotonia**: Emphasize strength training, respiratory support, and targeted treatments for specific neuromuscular disorders [^112AvzcB].

---

Central hypotonia reflects **reduced tone** from brain or spinal cord lesions with preserved or increased reflexes, whereas peripheral hypotonia reflects lower motor neuron or muscle disorders with reduced reflexes and clear weakness. Accurate differentiation is essential for **targeted testing** and management.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^114isBjx]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Children and adults with developmental central hypotonia are at increased risk of hip dysplasia, subluxation, and dislocation compared with the general population. This review included a range of genetic diagnoses, where hypotonia is a prominent feature in almost all infants, and continues for a significant proportion into adulthood. Early recognition and conservative intervention may be effective for some of these infants, although genetic diagnoses may not be confirmed until older ages. Proactive screening and hip ultrasound between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months should therefore be considered for all infants with significant hypotonia, with or without a confirmed genetic diagnosis. Although children with developmental central hypotonia appear to have a higher incidence of acetabular dysplasia in infancy than children with CP, they also present with increasing instability over time. These individuals warrant inclusion in hip surveillance programmes, although there are some differences between the presentation, timing, and progression of hip problems in children with hypotonia compared with the typical protocols for children with CP. For individuals with significant hypotonia, hip surveillance may need to continue through the adolescent years into adulthood, as there are reports of late‐onset hip instability in some diagnoses. There is a need for consistent definition and reporting of hip problems in the literature to adequately map the natural history, intervention, and outcomes of children and adults with developmental central hypotonia.

### Clinical outcome assessments for spasticity: review, critique, and recommendations [^117WQ4By]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Spasticity is seen in patients with subacute or chronic disruption of the central execution of motor command involving corticospinal pathways. However, the use of the term spasticity is equivocal in the vast amount of literature on this topicranging from an understanding of spasticity simply as a phenomenon of increased resistance to passive stretch, whichever the mechanisms of the resistance, that is, muscle tone, to a specific type of muscle overactivity related to hyperexcitability of the velocity‐dependent stretch reflexes, which characterizes the syndrome of spastic paresis. In parallel, an expansion of the concept of spasticity has been proposed, defining it as a disorder of sensorimotor control manifesting as any intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles of neurogenic origin. Following Lanceand, more recently, Gracies, Li, and the recent viewpoint by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Spasticity Study Group, the definition of spasticity used in this review is an enhancement of velocity‐dependent stretch reflexes. From the phenomenological perspective relevant to clinicians, this particular definition distinguishes spasticity from other types of muscle overactivity present in patients with deforming spastic paresis (eg, spastic dystonia and spastic cocontraction) or from types of muscle overactivity encountered in other neurological conditions (eg, tremors or rigidity classifiable as "spasticity" based on less specific definitions). This definition integrates spasticity into the broader concept of deforming spastic paresis involving spastic myopathy, a term used to describe the muscle disorder present in these patients, and a neurologic disorder comprising stretch‐sensitive paresis (ie, decreased access of the central command to the agonist motoneuron, aggravated by antagonist stretch) and three main types of muscle overactivity (defined as increased involuntary motor unit recruitment): spastic dystonia (chronic tonic muscle activation at rest), spastic cocontraction (involuntary antagonist muscle activation during an agonist‐directed voluntary effort), and spasticity (Table 1). Such framing clears the way for a balanced evaluation of spasticity: per se, its disabling level is low (with the possible exception of fast, ballistic movements), and it has no deforming capacity, but it can serve as a useful clinical parameter quantifiable at the bedside, which may be correlated with more disabling forms of spastic muscle overactivity because they may all partially reflect both enhanced motoneuronal excitability and spindle responsiveness. Of course, such an evaluation requires a valid, reliable, and easy‐to‐use clinical assessment outcome (COA).

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^116o1tsW]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

What this paper adds
Incidence of hip problems is significantly increased for individuals with hypotonia associated with multiple rare genetic diagnoses.
Regular hip surveillance for children and adults with significant and persistent hypotonia is recommended.
Individuals with developmental central hypotonia should be included in databases to follow the natural history of hip problems.

The terminology of paediatric hip problems can be confusing and has changed over time because of better understanding. Congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) was the original term for infants who had unstable hips at birth and developed fixed dislocations if they were not treated at a young age. However, because there is no congenital malformation with this diagnosis, the terminology has been changed to developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), to recognize that the problem develops late in pregnancy or at birth or in early infancy because of multiple related factors.DDH describes a range of hip problems including hip instability, acetabular dysplasia, femoral dysplasia, hip subluxation (femoral head is partly displaced), and complete hip dislocation (femoral head is fully displaced from the acetabulum), and is generally used with children who do not have developmental neuromotor disabilities. Teratological dislocation of the hip indicates severe changes to the hip and a fixed dislocation apparent at the time of birth. This term is outdated and should be described more specifically, such as hip dislocation in a child with arthrogryposis. Neuromuscular hip dysplasia is the term used for children with cerebral palsy (CP) and other neurodevelopmental conditions.

### Cranial and spinal nerve enhancement in SURF1-associated Leigh syndrome [^114af4bf]. Pediatric Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 23-month-old non-dysmorphic boy was under investigation for developmental delay, hypotonia, and feeding difficulties. Born at term via emergency Caesarean section for fetal distress, to non-consanguineous parents, there had been no perinatal issues. Following sudden onset of ataxia, fatigue, and myoclonus, the child was admitted to hospital and found to be alert with no visual or hearing deficits, but had gross and fine motor delay, central and peripheral hypotonia, and involuntary truncal/peripheral choreiform movements. Despite absent lower limb reflexes, the patient had normal nerve conduction studies.

CSF showed elevated lactate of 3.1 mmol/L (normal range < 2.0 mmol/L) and elevated protein of 0.79 g/L (normal range 0.10–0.35 g/L), but no micro-organisms were cultured. Inflammatory markers were mildly elevated with C-reactive protein 16 mg/L, neutrophils 9.7 x10^9/L. Family history was non-contributory, and previous creatinine kinase measurements, electroencephalogram, and hearing test were normal.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^115fsECd]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the accuracy of phenotypic early-onset ataxia (EOA) recognition among developmental conditions, including developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and hypotonia of central nervous system origin, and the effect of scientifically validated EOA features on changing phenotypic consensus.

Method

We included 32 children (4–17y) diagnosed with EOA (n = 11), DCD (n = 10), and central hypotonia (n = 11). Three paediatric neurologists independently assessed videotaped motor behaviour phenotypically and quantitatively (using the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia [SARA]). We determined: (1) phenotypic interobserver agreement and phenotypic homogeneity (percentage of phenotypes with full consensus by all three observers according to the underlying diagnosis); (2) SARA (sub)score profiles; and (3) the effect of three scientifically validated EOA features on phenotypic consensus.

Results

Phenotypic homogeneity occurred in 8 out of 11, 2 out of 10, and 1 out of 11 patients with EOA, DCD, and central hypotonia respectively. Homogeneous phenotypic discrimination of EOA from DCD and central hypotonia occurred in 16 out of 21 and 22 out of 22 patients respectively. Inhomogeneously discriminated EOA and DCD phenotypes (5 out of 21) revealed overlapping SARA scores with different SARA subscore profiles. After phenotypic reassessment with scientifically validated EOA features, phenotypic homogeneity changed from 16 to 18 patients.

Interpretation

In contrast to complete distinction between EOA and central hypotonia, the paediatric motor phenotype did not reliably distinguish between EOA and DCD. Reassessment with scientifically validated EOA features could contribute to a higher phenotypic consensus. Early-onset ataxia (EOA) and central hypotonia motor phenotypes were reliably distinguished. EOA and developmental coordination disorder (DCD) motor phenotypes were not reliably distinguished. The EOA and DCD phenotypes have different profiles of the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia.

### Spasticity and dystonia are underidentified in young children at high risk for cerebral palsy [^114rMRFp]. Journal of Child Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Early spasticity and dystonia identification in cerebral palsy is critical for guiding diagnostic workup and prompting targeted treatment early when it is most efficacious. However, differentiating spasticity from dystonia is difficult in young children with cerebral palsy.

Methods

We sought to determine spasticity and dystonia underidentification rates in children at high risk for cerebral palsy (following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) by assessing how often child neurologists identified hypertonia alone versus specifying the hypertonia type as spasticity and/or dystonia by age 5 years.

Results

Of 168 children, 63 developed cerebral palsy and hypertonia but only 19 (30%) had their hypertonia type specified as spasticity and/or dystonia by age 5 years.

Conclusions

Child neurologists did not specify the type of hypertonia in a majority of children at high risk of cerebral palsy. Because early tone identification critically guides diagnostic workup and treatment of cerebral palsy, these results highlight an important gap in current cerebral palsy care.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants: executive summary [^111TYSo5]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) diagnosis — A patient presents for initial medical assessment after a brief, resolved event observed by a caregiver in a child < 1 year of age; the clinician characterizes the event as a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of one or more of: cyanosis or pallor, absent/decreased/irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered responsiveness, then performs appropriate history and physical examination (PE); if event criteria are absent the event is Not a BRUE, if an explanation is identified (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux [GER], feeding difficulties, or airway abnormality) it is out of guideline scope and should be managed accordingly, and if no explanation for the event is identified a diagnosis of Brief Resolved Unexplained Event is made; use event characteristics, rather than the term "ALTE", to describe the event.

### Hypotonia: is It a clear term and an objective diagnosis? An exploratory systematic review [^112N1RvD]. Pediatric Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypotonia is considered a determinant factor in multiple developmental disorders and is associated with various characteristics and morbidities. It is necessary to perform a systematic review to know which characteristics are described as associated with hypotonia in children and which methods are used for its diagnosis.

Methods

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to develop the systematic review protocol. A search of databases (Pubmed, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, among others) was performed in May 2021 to identify relevant studies. Those describing characteristics or tests of hypotonia assessment were included, excluding those that exclusively addressed peripheral hypotonia. Two reviewers evaluated the articles and collected the data in a table, noting the authors, date of publication, type of study, and characteristics or tests described in relation to hypotonia. The quality of the studies was also assessed, and data were extracted.

Results

A total of 8778 studies were identified and analyzed, of which 45 met the inclusion criteria. Fifty-three characteristics associated with hypotonia and tests used for its evaluation were located, with pull to sit and vertical suspension being the most frequently referenced.

Conclusions

The characteristics associated with hypotonia, more highly debated by authors are muscle strength, hypermobility, or the maintenance of antigravity postures. The most used test in the diagnosis of hypotonia is observation, followed by the pull-to-sit test, and adoption of frog posture. A unanimous understanding of the term hypotonia would favor further research.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^115FhgQh]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

DCD

All included DCD phenotypes fulfilled the official motor criteria for DCD. 2, 8 Before inclusion, all patients with DCD had received an independent neurological examination at the outpatient clinic, including radiological, metabolic, and/or genetic workup. After exclusion of an underlying neurological cause, patients were referred to the rehabilitation centre. Independent rehabilitation specialists diagnosed the DCD motor criteria according to DSM‐5 criteria, including Movement Assessment Battery for Children scores under the 15th centile. DCD comorbidity concerned impaired concentration, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder or mild learning problems (6 out of 10), social and emotional problems (5 out of 10), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (1 out of 10). After the study was finalized, one patient with DCD was identified by next‐generation sequencing as having a KLF7 gene mutation. For further patient information, see Appendix S1.

Central hypotonia

All children from the central and/or mixed peripheral hypotonia 3, 4 group were clinically described with isolated features of hypotonia and hyperlaxity (in the absence of comorbid movement disorder features). 3, 4 Neurological disorders were excluded at the outpatient clinic, before enrolment in the study group. However, after the study was completed, one child supposedly diagnosed with 'central' hypotonia was eventually diagnosed with limb‐girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I. Post hoc analysis revealed that retrospective exclusion of this child from the central hypotonia study group would not have changed the study outcomes.

Exclusion criteria

The three study groups were clinically investigated for exclusion criteria concerning underlying acquired disorders, such as infection, trauma, tumour, intoxication, inflammation, ischaemia, haemorrhage, and/or para‐infectious causes. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were available for all 11 children with EOA, 8 out of 10 children with DCD, and 5 out of 11 children with central hypotonia. We also excluded children with cognitive and/or behavioural problems that could potentially interfere with the performance of the SARA and PBS motor tasks.

Assessments

For the procedures followed in the study, see Figure S1 (online supporting information).

### PRUNE is crucial for normal brain development and mutated in microcephaly with neurodevelopmental impairment [^112jX7CW]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Prune syndrome phenotype

Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the core phenotypic features of 13 individuals, not previously reported, aged between 3 months and 21 years. Additional clinical details are provided on two Turkish patients (Patients BAB3500 and BAB3737) previously described. Supplementary Fig. 1 illustrates the clinical features and MRI scans of affected individuals from each family.

Reduced foetal movements compared to healthy siblings was a prenatal sign reported by some mothers of Prune syndrome children. Microcephaly was progressive and psychomotor development was severely delayed in all domains. Affected individuals did not communicate, and none achieved purposeful hand movements or independent ambulation. Central hypotonia and in some cases bilateral talipes were present at birth. Peripheral spasticity, clonus, muscle wasting and multiple joint contractures developed with advancing age. Slowing of the peripheral nerve conduction velocity at the neurophysiological investigations performed at 2 years of age was seen in the Italian boy. A history of generalized tonic clonic seizures from early infancy was reported in four of the affected children. The oldest of the two Italian children developed infantile spasms at 4 months of age and the younger myoclonic seizures at a similar age. Neuroimaging revealed focal white matter changes, delayed myelination, cortical atrophy, thin or hypoplastic corpus callosum, and cerebellar atrophy. Serial MRI scans in the Italian boy showed severe progression of the disease with increasing age, with delayed myelination reported at 6 months of life and follow-up MRI at the age of 18 months showing diffuse abnormalities of the white matter, progressive brain atrophy involving the cerebral cortex and most strikingly the cerebellum. Craniofacial features included a sloping forehead and large prominent ears and eyes consistent with microcephaly. The Italian girl was reported to have intermittent facial swelling and pedal oedema. Plagiocephaly, a narrow palate, scoliosis and a narrow chest were frequently observed across the studied families and most likely attributable to the severe central hypotonia. The two Italian children were both found to have optic atrophy, documented in both by the age of 2 years. Congenital cataract was an additional feature seen in one of the Iranian children and both of the affected Indian siblings. More detailed ocular phenotyping in a larger series of Prune syndrome patients is required to evaluate if these are real associations with the condition or coincidental and the result of a second autosomal recessive condition in these families. The cause of death in the affected children was respiratory failure, presumed secondary to aspiration.

### Alpha-2 adrenergic transmission and human baroreflex regulation [^117GtQxM]. Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

We observed earlier that central alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation in mice greatly augments parasympathetic tone. To test the effects in humans, we assessed autonomic vasomotor tone and baroreflex regulation in 9 normal young adults on 2 occasions, once with and once without clonidine. We determined heart rate (HR), beat-by-beat blood pressure (BP), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity. HR variability was analyzed in the time and frequency domain. Pharmacological baroreflex slopes were determined using incremental phenylephrine and nitroprusside infusions. Clonidine lowered resting BP (122 ± 4/73 ± 3 versus 100 ± 7/55 ± 3 mm Hg, P < 0.01), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (18 ± 3 versus 4 ± 2 bursts/min, P < 0.01), and HR (62 ± 3 versus 56 ± 3 bpm, P < 0.05). The baroreflex heart rate curve was reset to much lower HR values and showed no saturation at low HR. HR variability profoundly increased during clonidine plus phenylephrine (total power: 3224 ± 843 versus 8943 ± 2329 ms2, P < 0.05). High-frequency power was 1451 ± 520 at baseline and 6720 ± 2475 ms2 during baroreceptor loading (P < 0.05). The low-frequency/high-frequency ratio decreased (1.94 ± 0.41 versus 0.69 ± 0.10, P < 0.05). In contrast, clonidine reduced resting sympathetic vasomotor tone and shifted the operating point of the sympathetic baroreflex to a flat part of the sympathetic baroreflex curve. The shift decreased the ability of the baroreflex to withdraw sympathetic vasomotor tone during baroreflex loading. These baroreflex changes were associated with a moderate increase in phenylephrine responsiveness. We conclude that alpha-2 adrenoceptor stimulation has a differential effect on baroreflex HR and vasomotor regulation. alpha-2 Adrenoceptor stimulation greatly augments baroreflex-mediated bradycardia, most likely by parasympathetic activation.

### The American Association for Thoracic Surgery congenital cardiac surgery working group 2021 consensus document on a comprehensive perioperative approach to enhanced recovery after pediatric cardiac surgery [^111Ub4FL]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Risk factors for prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation — pediatric cardiac surgery are organized across clinical domains and include hemodynamic and infectious factors (hemodynamic instability, bleeding, low cardiac output syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, unbalanced circulation, residual lesions, severe pulmonary hypertension, onset of sepsis, bloodstream infection), respiratory dysfunction causes (respiratory depression secondary to anesthesia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, mucous plugging, aspiration, atelectasis, intrinsic lung disease, viral infection, diaphragm paralysis/phrenic nerve palsy, tracheomalacia/bronchomalacia, tracheal stenosis, weak cough/hypotonia, central apnea, genetic/chromosomal disorder), and upper airway obstruction etiologies (excessive secretions, airway edema, airway anomalies [eg, complete tracheal rings, tracheal web], airway compression by cardiac chambers or blood vessels, vocal cord paralysis/paresis, glossoptosis).

### PPREMO: a prospective cohort study of preterm infant brain structure and function to predict neurodevelopmental outcome [^11617ZgW]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Medical assessment

A paediatrician experienced in infant development and diagnosis of CP will independently assess infants in this study at 12 months CA. The purpose of this assessment is to discriminate which infants are developing typically from those who are not, and to confirm diagnoses of CP or not CP. It is acknowledged that 12 months CA is early to confirm a diagnosis of CP, especially in less severe cases. For this reason a structured neurological examination of posture, reflexes, muscle tone and movement will be conducted with participants classified as 'normal' (entirely normal neurological examination), 'unspecified signs' (e.g. hypotonia, asymmetric reflexes) or 'abnormal' (definite neurological abnormality, likely CP). In cases where CP can be confirmed, motor type and distribution will be recorded as per the SCPE guidelines, and functional severity established through classification with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). The assessment will be videoed and a second blinded assessor will perform this classification for reliability purposes.

### A case of anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein polyneuropathy and multiple sclerosis: one disease instead of two? [^113H6erp]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A male patient diagnosed elsewhere as having multiple sclerosis (MS) was recently referred to our MS centre. Despite the presence of scattered T2-hyperintense MS-like lesions on MRI and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands, his MS diagnosis was unpersuasive. Distal symmetric hypotonia, tendon areflexia and distal muscle weakness were present. A mostly demyelinating sensory polyneuropathy was disclosed at electroneurography. Serum IgM band, free monoclonal light chains and increased anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein IgM were detected. At 18 months later, and after three intravenous Ig treatments, a clinical electroneurographic improvement was evident along with the disappearance of some brain MRI lesions, reduction of serum anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) IgM level and of the number of CSF oligoclonal bands. Although the cause/effect relation cannot be proven, we hypothesise that not only peripheral but also central demyelination may be related to the presence of anti-MAG antibodies with central nervous system (CNS) patterns on MRI resembling those seen in MS.

### Clinical factors associated with genetic diagnosis in suspected neurogenetic disorders in a tertiary care clinic [^117NyYYR]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our CART analysis suggests the potential utility of motor delay and hypotonia as phenotypic screens to identify patients most likely to benefit from genetic testing, with an overall accuracy rate of 76%. However, we acknowledge that our sample reflects high-complexity patients and that our data are cross-sectional; therefore, we are unable to establish temporal ordering between patient and clinical characteristics and our outcome. Additionally, the model's classification accuracy may have been limited by missing milestone data and unstandardized clinician notes, indicating the need for higher-powered, prospective studies with more complete phenotyping.

In summary, our findings confirm and expand previous work identifying motor delay and hypotonia as key phenotypic differences between individuals with NDDs with and without a genetic diagnosis from ES or other tests more broadly. The decision tree represents a preliminary, exploratory step toward the development of accurate, validated algorithms to guide genetic testing decisions. Future large-scale studies integrating high-quality phenotypic data could enable the creation of clinically useful decision support tools to help stratify patients with NDDs for genetic testing.

### Acute hypotonia in an infant [^113xWSMb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is increasing in incidence in the United States and presenting to emergency departments (EDs) across the country. This clinical entity presents as acute paralysis, with magnetic resonance imaging changes in the gray matter only in children younger than 21 years of age. The etiology is unknown, although preceding viral illnesses are common. There are no consensus guidelines regarding treatment.

Case Report

A 4-month-old girl presented with decreased bilateral arm movement. The history consisted of a recent upper respiratory illness and abrupt decline in movement. She was found to have truncal and peripheral hypotonia, while maintaining her airway. Magnetic resonance imaging found gray matter hyperintensity at C2-C6, with no white matter changes. The patient was positive for enterovirus. Intravenous steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin were given, with slight improvement prior to discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation center. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? AFM was largely nonexistent in the United States after implementation of the polio vaccine, but the incidence has recently increased. Pediatric patients are now presenting to EDs with acute hypotonia, and emergency physicians must recognize how to differentiate this emerging diagnosis from other causes of acute flaccid paralysis. The clinical course of AFM does not seem to change acutely, in stark contrast to disease entities like botulism, which can change in hours. Patients with AFM do not need aggressive ED diagnostic evaluation, but rather transfer to a pediatric hospital for further care. Therefore, discerning the etiology of pediatric hypotonia with history and physical examination alone is important.

### Inter-rater reliability of the modified sarnat examination in preterm infants at 32–36 weeks' gestation [^115jpFgi]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Inter-rater reliability

Table 3a, b demonstrates the severity of the neonatal encephalopathy (normal/mild, moderate, severe) as designated by two independent examiners for each category of the neurologic examination. Among 86 newborns, the reliability of the neurologic exam was determined first between GS study investigator and the wider group of attending neonatologists and showed that the inter-rater score, or kappa, was good to excellent (k > 0.72) in most categories except for Moro and tone, which showed fair agreement (k = 0.51, Table 3a). Disagreement occurred predominantly in assigning a moderate stage when describing incomplete adduction for the Moro and upper extremity hypotonia when assessing for tone.

Table 3
Inter-rater agreement of the modified Sarnat neurologic examination performed between (a) gold standard study investigator and neonatology attending physicians and (b) two gold standard examiners in infants of 32–36 weeks' gestation

CI confidence interval, LOC level of consciousness

In a subset of 20 newborns who were examined by two GS examiners, the inter-rater reliability demonstrates near perfect agreement (k > 0.78) except for the Moro category (k = 0.49; Table 3b).

In secondary analysis of infants born at 32–34 weeks' gestation, agreement was poor/fair irrespective of the examiners' experience for both tone and Moro categories, with kappa ranging from 0.20 to 0.60 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0–1.0). In contrast, at 35–36 weeks' gestation, GS examiners showed perfect agreement (k = 1.0) even in the tone and Moro categories. However, when the GS examiner was compared to a wider group of attending examiners, the agreement in the Moro and tone categories was fair, k = 0.46 (95% CI, 0.0–0.9).

Histopathology, Clinical Features, and Genetic Considerations

Central Core Disease

Histopathologic features: On oxidative histological staining, CCD presents with clearly demarcated central cores (regions of pale staining) that can span the length of the muscle fiber. The amorphous central cores predominate within type 1 fibers and result from the absence or depletion of mitochondria. These patterns show variability ranging from more than 1 core per muscle fiber, variable core diameters, to typical or eccentric cores and centrally or peripherally located cores. Sarcomeric filamentous disorganization (Z line streaming) and proliferation of sarcotubular membranes are typical on electron microscopy.

Clinical features: As one of the most frequent CM, the CCD phenotype of dominant RYR1 causative variations is usually mild and nonprogressive. Clinical features include hypotonia in infancy, delayed motor milestones, axial muscle involvement, proximal weakness, myalgia, muscle stiffness, hip dislocation, spinal deformities, and exertional weakness with or without rhabdomyolysis. Extraocular muscle weakness and bulbar and respiratory involvement are not typical; however, strabismus has been reported in dominant cases. Recessively inherited or de novo dominant RYR1 -related CCD present with more severe features such as fetal akinesia syndrome (severe hypotonia, multiple arthrogryposis, respiratory failure). Serum creatinine kinase (CK) may be mildly elevated or normal, and muscle MRI imaging shows selective involvement and sparing of certain muscle groups in dominant RYR1 -related cases. MRI findings in recessively inherited cases are not as consistent. There is an overlap between CCD and MH susceptibility, with RYR1 -related CCD patients with causative variants in the N-terminal region having a higher probability of MH susceptibility than CCD patients with variations in the C-terminal region.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^116CvMWe]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The three assessors phenotypically recognized the diagnostic groups as 90% (80–100%) for EOA, 70% (40–90%) for DCD, and 40% (10–50%) for central hypotonia. In 13 out of 32 children, at least one assessor had scored an alternative primary phenotype instead of the clinical phenotype EOA, DCD, or central hypotonia, including: normal and/or delayed (DCD, n = 3; central hypotonia, n = 8 by one to three assessors); upper motor neuron dysfunction/spasticity (central hypotonia, n = 1 by one assessor); dystonia (DCD, n = 1 by one assessor); and chorea (EOA, n = 1 by one assessor) (Fig. 1; for the phenotypic assessment form see Fig. S2). Individual phenotypic assessments are shown in Table S2.

Figure 1
Phenotypic outcomes of children with early‐onset ataxia (EOA), developmental coordination disorder (DCD), and central hypotonia. The circles (EOA, orange; DCD, blue; central hypotonia, green) indicate the underlying diagnosis. The percentages indicate the perceived primary feature of the motor behaviour by the three observers.

Homogeneous phenotypic discrimination of EOA and interobserver agreement

Complete homogeneous phenotypic agreement (by all three assessors), in accordance with the clinical diagnosis, occurred in eight, two, and one patients in the clinical EOA, DCD, and central hypotonia phenotypes respectively (Table S3). The phenotypic interobserver agreements for the EOA, DCD, and central hypotonia (sub)groups (Gwet's agreement coefficient) were: EOA = 0.801 (p < 0.001; substantial); DCD = 0.327 (p = 0.037; fair); central hypotonia = 0.415 (p = 0.005; moderate). Analysis of EOA and central hypotonia separation revealed complete phenotypic discrimination in all the patients. Analysis of EOA and DCD separation revealed complete phenotypic discrimination in 16 patients. In 5 out of 21 patients, one of the observers had assigned a patient to the other group (2 out of 11 patients with EOA as DCD and 3 out of 10 patients with DCD as EOA).

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^116GDJuq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

BRUE diagnosis — Patient presents for initial medical assessment after a brief, resolved event that was observed by caregiver in a child < 1 year of age, and the patient may be well-appearing or have additional symptoms or abnormal vital signs; use event characteristics, rather than the term "ALTE", to describe the event. The clinician characterizes the event as a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of one or more of the following, including cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered responsiveness. If event criteria are present, perform appropriate history and physical examination (PE); if no explanation for the event is identified, diagnosis of Brief Resolved Unexplained Event is made, whereas if an explanation for the event is identified (eg, GER, feeding difficulties, or airway abnormality) it is out of guideline scope and should be managed accordingly.

### CRISPR-cas9-generated PTCHD1 2489T > G stem cells recapitulate patient phenotype when undergoing neural induction [^11557TvT]. HGG Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, when comparing the changes observed in PTCHD1 _SNV and PTCHD1_ trunc cells to those seen in PTCHD1 _WT cells, the gene set "abnormal long-term potentiation" is upregulated. LTP and long-term depression (LTD) are both involved in synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is believed to play a role in learning and memory.LTP results in the strengthening of a synapse, increasing signal transmission, whereas LTD reduces synaptic strength, thereby decreasing signal transmission. Abnormal LTP can cause hyper- and hypoplasticity, which have both been observed in people with ASD. –

Abnormal hippocampal layer morphology was upregulated when comparing PTCHD1_ SNV and PTCHD1_ trunc cells to PTCHD1_ WT during differentiation. In PTCHD1 knockout mouse models, structural and functional alterations were found in excitatory synapses of the hippocampus and hippocampal activity was impaired. Interestingly, the upregulation of potassium channels and abnormal afterhyperpolarization was a gene signature unique to the comparison of PTCHD1 _SNV to PTCHD1 _WT during differentiation. Afterhyperpolarization is the phase of a neuron's action potential in which the cell's membrane potential is lower than the normal resting potential and is governed by ion channels. Ion channel defects, or channelopathies, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including ID and ASD. Furthermore, gain- and loss-of-function mutations can cause potassium channelopathies, and several potassium channels have functions involving muscle contraction and controlling smooth muscle tone.

Upregulation of the gene sets above, implicating the dysregulation of genes associated with synaptic transmission, is also a possible explanation for the dysregulation of genes associated with muscle contraction observed as being downregulated in PTCHD1 _SNV and PTCHD1 _trunc cells. Furthermore, this downregulation of muscle contraction–related gene sets represents another gene signature relevant to the patient phenotype, which includes central and muscular hypotonia. Muscle tone, or the amount of resistance to passive movement of a muscle, is related to the ability of a muscle to contract. If a muscle is unable to properly contract, then this can lead to hypotonia. Hypotonia is defined as a state of low muscle tone resulting in floppiness, with a key feature of central hypotonia being abnormal brain function. Muscular hypotonia typically presents with weakness, joint contractures, and decreased tendon reflexes. These data indicate that PTCHD1 mutations can modulate genes in these pathways.

Motor Development and Function:

Gross motor milestones were mildly to markedly delayed in all subjects and all of ambulatory age have required use of Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFOs). Of the nine subjects over age 5, four learned to walk unassisted and five learned to walk with assistive devices; motor function has generally worsened by adolescence. Subjects VI and X are the least motorically impaired and learned to walk independently without AFOs at 18 months of age. Both are currently able to walk and play sports, but VI cannot walk long distances and X has frequent falls and is now using AFOs. Subject VII learned to walk with AFOs and a walker at age 3; he continues to require support when walking. Subject XI walked with support at age 3 and unassisted at age 6, but motor function worsened with age; he now requires AFOs and a walker for community ambulation. Subject XII is the most motorically impaired; he learned to stand independently at age 3, but has had significant decline in functional mobility and now needs a walker or wheelchair at all times. Subject XIII walked with AFOs at age 3; she is now able to ambulate short distances unsupported, but has frequent falls and prefers a wheelchair in many settings. Subject XIV was able to walk with support until 8 years of age when he underwent foot surgery. Following surgery, he never regained the ability to walk.

Motor Tone and Strength:

Although all 14 subjects were reported at some point to have hypotonia, the five subjects evaluated at NIH were found to have normal axial and appendicular tone with upper limb hypermobility. Subject VII displayed full muscle strength throughout. Subject X had moderate hip girdle weakness. Subjects XI and XII could not cooperate with strength testing; both seemed to have proximal weakness greater in the lower compared to upper limbs, and XII had decreased muscle bulk. Subject XIII had significant hip girdle and lower extremity flexor and extensor weakness, with extensor hallucis longus strength of only 1/5 bilaterally.

Reflexes:

In the four subjects tested, deep tendon reflexes were decreased (XI), increased (XIII) or normal (VII, XII), and the Babinski reflex was positive/extensor with ankle clonus (X, XII, XIII) or negative/flexor (VII). These findings are consistent with the combination of spasticity and peripheral neuropathy.

### European consensus on the concepts and measurement of the pathophysiological neuromuscular responses to passive muscle stretch [^111PxrrX]. European Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To support clinical decision-making in central neurological disorders, a physical examination is used to assess responses to passive muscle stretch. However, what exactly is being assessed is expressed and interpreted in different ways. A clear diagnostic framework is lacking. Therefore, the aim was to arrive at unambiguous terminology about the concepts and measurement around pathophysiological neuromuscular response to passive muscle stretch.

Methods

During two consensus meetings, 37 experts from 12 European countries filled online questionnaires based on a Delphi approach, followed by plenary discussion after rounds. Consensus was reached for agreement ≥ 75%.

Results

The term hyper-resistance should be used to describe the phenomenon of impaired neuromuscular response during passive stretch, instead of for example 'spasticity' or 'hypertonia'. From there, it is essential to distinguish non-neural (tissue-related) from neural (central nervous system related) contributions to hyper-resistance. Tissue contributions are elasticity, viscosity and muscle shortening. Neural contributions are velocity dependent stretch hyperreflexia and non-velocity dependent involuntary background activation. The term 'spasticity' should only be used next to stretch hyperreflexia, and 'stiffness' next to passive tissue contributions. When joint angle, moment and electromyography are recorded, components of hyper-resistance within the framework can be quantitatively assessed.

Conclusions

A conceptual framework of pathophysiological responses to passive muscle stretch is defined. This framework can be used in clinical assessment of hyper-resistance and will improve communication between clinicians. Components within the framework are defined by objective parameters from instrumented assessment. These parameters need experimental validation in order to develop treatment algorithms based on the aetiology of the clinical phenomena.

### The clinical, biochemical and genetic features associated with-related mitochondrial disease [^1165h45m]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Global neurodevelopmental delay affects more than two-thirds of the patients. The delay in gross motor development frequently occurs with the presence of hypotonia, which is most likely mediated centrally. This is supported by the identification of white-matter abnormalities in MR imaging, which is suggestive of delayed myelination. In addition, five patients with initial hypotonia subsequently developed peripheral hypertonia and spasticity. Some of these clinical pictures and radiological findings are similar to the congenitally acquired TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Other (Syphilis), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes Simplex Virus) infection, but this can be rapidly excluded with serological testing. The language developmental delay is, in part, confounded by severe sensorineural deafness and correction with hearing aids or cochlear implants results in some improvement. The degree of learning disability is variable among the older patients, ranging from those with mild-to-moderate disability and attending special school (P2, P6, P7.1, P7.2, P18.1 and P18.2) to verbalisation of only a few words at age 9 (P5).

### X-linked MCT8 gene mutations: characterization of the pediatric neurologic phenotype [^112k7Pb6]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

We report a family with X-linked mental retardation that has a novel mutation in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene associated with a characteristic neurodevelopmental phenotype with early childhood hypotonia that progresses to spasticity and global developmental delays. Affected patients experience moderate to severe psychomotor delays and congenital hypotonia, develop a myopathic facies, have diminished muscle bulk and generalized muscle weakness, develop progressive spasticity and movement disorders, and have limited speech but alert, affable personalities. Acquired microcephaly and abnormal myelination on brain magnetic resonance imaging can be present. Normal monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene functioning appears to be necessary for normal thyroid-associated metabolism in neurons. Abnormal thyroid function tests appear to be a consistent finding in the absence of typical signs of thyroid dysfunction. Although the phenotype appears to be consistent, and although the neurotoxic effects of abnormal central and peripheral neuromuscular system thyroid metabolism might be partly or wholly responsible for the neurologic phenotype reported, the exact mechanism remains unclear.

### Diagnostic profile of neonatal hypotonia: an 11-year study [^1134ncgk]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The profile of disorders presenting with neonatal hypotonia to the neonatal intensive care unit has not been studied previously. An 11-year retrospective cohort study of neonates, who were identified through computer database records and were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from January 1989 to December 1999 at the Montreal Children's Hospital (Montreal, Québec), is presented. The final diagnoses, tests obtained, and outcome were determined from a structured review of the subject's hospital record. The database search generated 95 records, of which 50 neonates met the inclusion criteria. The hypotonia was classified as central in 33 patients (66%) and peripheral in 17 (34%). Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (n = 13), Prader-Willi syndrome (n = 6), myotonic dystrophy (n = 6), other muscle disorders (n = 6), chromosomal disorders (n = 4), and peripheral nerve disorders (n = 3) were the most common diagnoses. The genetic tests of highest yield were fluorescent in situ hybridization for Prader-Willi syndrome, DNA methylation studies for Prader-Willi syndrome, trinucleotide repeat testing for myotonic dystrophy, and karyotype analysis. A diagnostic approach is proposed based on the results.

Likely, the gross obesity of PWS patients has multiple mechanisms that culminate in the disease phenotype. Among those factors, it is possible to highlight the disruption of satiety control, endocrine dysregulation (central and peripheral), reduced energy expenditure due to hypotonia and behavioural features of the syndrome. Indeed, studies with post‐mortem hypothalamic tissue specimens have shown that in PWS patients, neurons in a variety of hypothalamic areas are affected, including the INF, PVN and LH.

American Academy of Pediatrics brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) guideline — scope, definition, and risk stratification are summarized as follows: The guideline has 3 objectives and "recommends the replacement of the term ALTE with a new term, brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)", provides a risk-based evaluation approach, and "provides management recommendations, or key action statements, for lower-risk infants". A BRUE is "defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥ 1 of the following: (1) cyanosis or pallor; (2) absent, decreased, or irregular breathing; (3) marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia); and (4) altered level of responsiveness", and it is diagnosed "only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination". Using this framework, "infants younger than 1 year with a BRUE are categorized either as (1) a lower-risk patient… for whom evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management are offered or (2) a higher-risk patient… but for whom recommendations are not offered", and "Each key action statement indicates a level of evidence, the benefit-harm relationship, and the strength of recommendation".

### Genetic evaluation of the pediatric patient with hypotonia: perspective from a hypotonia specialty clinic and review of the literature [^115cvmdK]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Hypotonia is a symptom of diminished tone of skeletal muscle associated with decreased resistance of muscles to passive stretching, which can be caused by abnormalities of the central nervous system, any element of the lower motoneuron, or both. Hypotonia is not a specific diagnosis, but can be part of over 500 different genetic disorders, with many other conditions waiting to be identified. This review proposes a pragmatic approach to evaluating hypotonia in neonatal and pediatric populations by using a diagnostic algorithm.

Method

We use a dedicated literature review combined with clinical experience in a newly established multidisciplinary center for hypotonia to establish a diagnostic algorithm.

Results

Hypotonia can be a symptom of over 500 different genetic disorders. It can present as peripheral, central, or combined hypotonia, providing necessity for rational and systematic diagnostic testing.

Interpretation

Our analyses demonstrate that a staged diagnostic approach categorizing patients as having peripheral, central, or combined hypotonia is the most efficient to providing a rational work-up. Establishing a diagnosis is crucial for prognosis, management, and treatment strategies, and for ascertaining an accurate recurrence risk for future offspring in a family.

### Atypical presentation of congenital muscular dystrophy: a LAMA2 related muscular dystrophy [^111RZBdD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The congenital muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited disorders that present in infancy or early childhood with generalized weakness and hypotonia as well as a wide range of other clinical manifestations. Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, also referred to as LAMA2 -related muscular dystrophy, is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene and can present with both an early-onset infantile and late-onset childhood form. Patients with the most severe phenotype typically present within the first few months of life with severe weakness and hypotonia and can develop contractures, scoliosis, dysphagia, as well as peripheral nerve and central nervous system abnormalities. We report a case of an infant that presented with focal weakness of his upper extremities that was initially thought to be due to cervical spinal abnormality or brachial plexus injury but was ultimately found to have Merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy. This case highlights an atypical presentation of congenital muscular dystrophy and demonstrates the importance of having a low threshold for testing for congenital muscular dystrophies in infants with abnormalities in strength or tone.

### Congenital hypotonia: clinical and developmental assessment [^1154H8Qu]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Identifying the underlying cause of congenital hypotonia remains difficult, despite advances in diagnostic laboratory and imaging techniques. Clinical evaluation strategies and standardized developmental tests can assist in differentiating hypotonia resulting from primary involvement of the upper motoneuron (central hypotonia) versus that involving the lower motoneuron and motor unit (peripheral hypotonia). This is especially important in infants with idiopathic hypotonia. This review outlines and describes the components of the clinical assessment: detailed infant and family history, clinical techniques and characteristics for differentiating hypotonia of central versus peripheral origin, and clinical evaluation (muscle tone, primitive reflexes, deep tendon reflexes, etc). Recent research that has contributed to the differential diagnosis of congenital hypotonia is reviewed and directions for future research are provided. Ideally, the assessment of infants with congenital hypotonia is best accomplished by an interdisciplinary team of developmental specialists including pediatricians, medical geneticists, child neurologists, and physical or occupational therapists.

### Shaky hands are a part of motor neuron disease phenotype: clinical and electrophysiological study of 77 patients [^112uMExS]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In the sharp contrast with the existing literature, we frequently observe minipolymyoclonus, tremor and pseudodystonic thumb posturing in patients with motor neuron disease. We conducted a clinical and electrophysiological study to describe phenomenology, prevalence and pathophysiology of involuntary movements in motor neuron disease.

Methods

We included 77 consecutive patients. Involuntary movements were assessed at rest and on action. Patients were videotaped. Arm muscle tone, power and deep tendon reflexes were evaluated. Accelerometry with electromyography was recorded in a subset of patients.

Results

Involuntary movements were observed in 68.9% of patients and could be separated into rest minipolymyoclonus, thumb tremor, pseudodystonic thumb posture, action minipolymyoclonus, and action tremor. One-third of patients reported negative impact of involuntary movements on hand use. Logistic regression showed that rest minipolymyoclonus and thumb tremor were more likely to occur in patients with more prominent distal muscle weakness and less spasticity. Similarly, action involuntary movements were more likely to appear in weaker patients. Patients with brisk tendon reflexes were more likely to display action tremor than action minipolymyoclonus. Action tremor was characterized by accelerometer and corresponding electromyography peak frequency, which decreased with mass loading, suggesting a mechanical-reflex tremor.

Conclusions

Involuntary movements are common, but poorly recognized feature of motor neuron disease that may add to functional impairment. Results of our study suggest that involuntary movements are likely of peripheral origin, with a non-fused contraction of enlarged motor units being a common driving mechanism. Minipolymyoclonus appears if no synchronization of motor units occurs. When synchronization occurs via stretch reflex, mechanical-reflex tremor is generated.

### American academy of audiology clinical consensus statement: assessment of vestibular function in the pediatric population [^116UbS9c]. Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (2025). High credibility.

Significance of vestibular testing in pediatrics — diagnostic roles and common findings: Vestibular testing serves to differentiate peripheral from central vestibular disorders, assess severity, and clarify functional effects, and even normal results can aid diagnosis by ruling out other issues. In suspected vestibular migraine, laboratory findings are varied, with the majority of children showing normal tests, followed by abnormal eye movements, abnormal ocular motor findings, and abnormal vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs). For congenital bilateral vestibular loss, the most common manifestation is gross motor delay with often accompanying muscle hypotonia; early intervention with qualified vestibular rehabilitation specialists is needed to aid milestones, and emerging studies are showing improvements in balance deficits with targeted vestibular rehabilitation in children.

### A 10-month-old with intermittent hypotonia and paralysis [^115z8hfU]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

A 10-month-old boy presented with a 1-day history of flaccid quadriplegia and dysconjugate gaze. His history was remarkable for stereotyped episodes of flaccid quadriplegia or hemiplegia, oculomotor abnormalities, and limb or neck posturing, beginning in the first days of life and becoming more frequent and more prolonged over time. The patient was healthy and developmentally normal between episodes. Results of extensive laboratory evaluations, including EEG and brain imaging studies, were negative. The patient's history, diagnostic evaluation, and final diagnosis are reviewed. This case illustrates the importance of a fundamental understanding of neurologic localization in pediatric care and a focused diagnostic approach to an infant with paroxysmal neurologic signs.

### Multicenter consensus approach to evaluation of neonatal hypotonia in the genomic era: a review [^113e3fdp]. JAMA Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Infants with hypotonia can present with a variety of potentially severe clinical signs and symptoms and often require invasive testing and multiple procedures. The wide range of clinical presentations and potential etiologies leaves diagnosis and prognosis uncertain, underscoring the need for rapid elucidation of the underlying genetic cause of disease.

Observations

The clinical application of exome sequencing or genome sequencing has dramatically improved the timely yield of diagnostic testing for neonatal hypotonia, with diagnostic rates of greater than 50% in academic neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across Australia, Canada, the UK, and the US, which compose the International Precision Child Health Partnership (IPCHiP). A total of 74% (17 of 23) of patients had a change in clinical care in response to genetic diagnosis, including 2 patients who received targeted therapy. This narrative review discusses the common causes of neonatal hypotonia, the relative benefits and limitations of available testing modalities used in NICUs, and hypotonia management recommendations.

Conclusions and Relevance

This narrative review summarizes the causes of neonatal hypotonia and the benefits of prompt genetic diagnosis, including improved prognostication and identification of targeted treatments which can improve the short-term and long-term outcomes. Institutional resources can vary among different NICUs; as a result, consideration should be given to rule out a small number of relatively unique conditions for which rapid targeted genetic testing is available. Nevertheless, the consensus recommendation is to use rapid genome or exome sequencing as a first-line testing option for NICU patients with unexplained hypotonia. As part of the IPCHiP, this diagnostic experience will be collected in a central database with the goal of advancing knowledge of neonatal hypotonia and improving evidence-based practice.

### Development of ventilatory control in infants [^1175LBJk]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Most abnormalities of ventilatory control in infants are due to immaturity or abnormal development of ventilatory control. This includes a broad range, from rare disorders like congenital central hypoventilation syndrome to common problems such as apnoea of prematurity. Development of the ventilatory control system, including central respiratory rhythmogenesis and central and peripheral chemoreception, begins early in gestation and continues for weeks or months after birth. Development of the neural components of central rhythmogenesis and their highly complex interconnectivity results from complex, timing-sensitive interactions between patterning and other genes, transcription factors and neurotrophic factors. At birth, nearly all aspects of ventilatory control remain immature, especially in preterm infants; and postnatal maturation can be altered by hypoxia, toxins and other stressors. Clinical care may be greatly enhanced by increased awareness of ventilatory control maturation and related disorders.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^115wd5Dn]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

Nonselective ventral dorsal rhizotomy — another surgical option for spasticity — is noted for children with GMFCS IV or V and significant hypertonia, accessed via a 1–2 level laminectomy at the conus medullaris or a multilevel laminectomy at the cauda equina; sensory/dorsal and motor/ventral rootlets are typically cut from L1 to S2, with the percentage of rootlets cut averaging 50% to 80%, which reduces spasticity and dystonia though some dyskinesia can persist after 1 to 2 years and procedures can overly weaken legs and decrease standing ability; additional surgical options include correction of bony deformity or soft tissue contracture, tendon transfer, and selective peripheral neurotomy/neurectomy.

### Pharmacological and neurosurgical management of cerebral palsy and dystonia: clinical practice guideline update [^112S5nYL]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Dystonia is defined as 'a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonic movements are typically patterned, twisting, and may be tremulous. Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation'. When muscle contractions are sustained, individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) and dystonia present with stiff postures and hypertonia. In dystonia, the hypertonia (sometimes referred to as dystonic hypertonia) is characterized by resistance to passive stretch of a muscle across a joint, which is present at low speeds, fluctuates with repeated stretches, and where tactile stimulus (e.g. light touching) or purposeful movement of another body part triggers increased tone or increased involuntary postures. When muscle contractions are intermittent, dystonia typically presents with slow repetitive involuntary movements.

Dystonia is frequently present in individuals with CP. CP refers to 'a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations, that are attributed to non‐progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain'. Dystonia exists among individuals with the dystonic subtype of dyskinetic CP, defined by the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe network as being dominated by abnormal postures and hypertonia. Dystonia is also frequently present in individuals with predominantly spastic CP, up to 75% of whom have mixed hypertonia patterns. Dystonia can affect function (including speech), participation, ease of caregiving, well‐being, and is associated with pain and musculoskeletal deformity.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^115WPUQA]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

CP is an umbrella description for disorders of movement and posture caused by non‐progressive brain injuries before, during, or shortly after birth, and includes genetic, environmental, and other causes. In the 1990s, multiple studies demonstrated that hip dysplasia develops primarily between the ages of 2 to 5 years in children with CP who had normal hips at birth. This neuromuscular hip dysplasia occurs with a higher risk in children with the most severe neurological impairment, as described using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), regardless of whether they have increased muscle tone (hypertonia) or low muscle tone (hypotonia). However, beyond finding that the incidence was not different, there are no published data showing the natural history comparison between high‐tone hips and low‐tone hips.

The past decade has seen an explosion in interest, evidence, and application of hip surveillance programmes for children with CP. The publication of the first 10‐year follow‐up programme from the Cerebral Palsy Follow‐Up Program in Swedendemonstrated how regular radiographs, clinical assessments, timely surgical intervention, and a total postural management programme could eradicate hip dislocation, decrease contractures, deformity, and associated pain, and decrease the need for additional surgeries. These findings were supported in the 20‐year follow‐up, and hip surveillance programmes have now been implemented around the world, although they are still limited in the USA.

### Systematic clinical approach for diagnosing upper limb tremor [^114id34R]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Tremor is the most common movement disorder worldwide, but diagnosis is challenging. In 2018, the task force on tremor of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published a consensus statement that proposes a tremor classification along two independent axes: a clinical tremor syndrome and its underlying aetiology. In line with this statement, we here propose a stepwise diagnostic approach that leads to the correct clinical and aetiological classification of upper limb tremor. We also describe the typical clinical signs of each clinical tremor syndrome. A key feature of our algorithm is the distinction between isolated and combined tremor syndromes, in which tremor is accompanied by bradykinesia, cerebellar signs, dystonia, peripheral neuropathy or brainstem signs. This distinction subsequently informs the selection of appropriate diagnostic tests, such as neurophysiology, laboratory testing, structural and dopaminergic imaging and genetic testing. We highlight treatable metabolic causes of tremor, as well as drugs and toxins that can provoke tremor. The stepwise approach facilitates appropriate diagnostic testing and avoids unnecessary investigations. We expect that the approach offered in this article will reduce diagnostic uncertainty and increase the diagnostic yield in patients with tremor.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^114e9ta4]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypotonia or low muscle tone is not well defined or understood. It includes the ability to maintain position against gravity (active postural tone), as well as reduced resistance to passive movement. Hypotonia may result from central (supraspinal/suprasegmental) or peripheral (segmental or motor unit) causes. Peripheral origins include damage to the peripheral nerves (e.g. neuropathies), muscle (e.g. myopathies or muscular dystrophies), anterior horn cell (e.g. spinal muscular atrophy), or neuromuscular junction (e.g. myasthenias).

Developmental central hypotonia describes children with non‐progressive hypotonia, originating in the central nervous system. This includes CP‐like conditions (where hypotonia is the sole motor type), congenital hypotonia of unknown origin, and genetic disorders where hypotonia is a prominent feature. Children who present with non‐degenerative central hypotonia from genetic, metabolic, or unknown causes are included under the umbrella of CP in some locations. However, a survey of CP registries indicates that fewer than half include children presenting with the sole motor type of hypotonia. As a result, many children with developmental central hypotonia may be excluded from hip surveillance programmes, particularly if a formal CP diagnosis is a requirement.

Central hypotonia with hypermobile joints is a feature of many genetic disorders including Down, Prader–Willi, and other syndromes. The American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine Central Hypotonia Care Pathway recommends hip surveillance for this population. However, the present methods for hip surveillance, surgical intervention, and postural management for hip health are all based on established best practices for children with CP, who more typically present with spasticity or dystonia. In contrast, it has been proposed that hip problems occur in children with hypotonia because of lack of muscle force keeping the hip in joint, and that the resulting lack of pressure contributes to insufficient depth growth of the acetabulum. Since little is known about hip health for individuals with hypotonia, we set out to complete a scoping review of the literature.

### Arterial stiffness is associated with cardiovascular, renal, retinal, and autonomic disease in type 1 diabetes [^115wd79S]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Others have shown PWV to predict outcome in various populations, and we now demonstrate an association between PWV and baseline characteristics in type 1 diabetes. Prospective follow-up studies on this current cohort potentially could prove interesting, with regard to PWV as predictor of outcome.

Because arterial stiffness is involved in the development of diabetes complications, debating if PWV reduction may prevent or even counteract progression of diabetes complications is warranted. Reversal of arterial stiffness is achieved by altering arterial morphology, endothelial activity, and/or smooth muscle tone. The impact of AHT on arterial stiffness is by reduction of smooth muscle tone and HR. However, few studies have shown AHT to reduce adverse outcome by reduction in arterial stiffness. The REASON trial found different effects of calcium blockers and beta blockers on central and peripheral PP, suggesting differences in the AHT impact on arterial stiffness. The CAFÉ study, a substudy of the ASCOT trial, also found calcium blockers versus beta blockers to have different effects on central and peripheral PP, without similar differences in brachial BP. Furthermore, central and peripheral PP did predict outcome, suggesting an outcome benefit from iatrogenic reduction in arterial stiffness. However, PWV measured in a subgroup of the patients (n = 114 [5%]) was not different in patients with compared with without adverse outcome, which makes conclusions on outcome benefits from reduction in arterial stiffness in this cohort ambiguous, although this merely could be related to statistical power. However, recently Guerin et al. supported the theory of outcome benefits from reversal of arterial stiffness by showing a mortality benefit from PWV reduction by AHT in patients with end-stage renal disease.

The association between autonomic dysfunction and arterial stiffness in patients with type 1 diabetes has been demonstrated by others in smaller studies and is confirmed by our findings of PWV being associated with autonomic neuropathy. It is possible that autonomic dysfunction impacts arterial stiffness, whereas preservation of normal autonomic function may prevent an increase in arterial stiffness. Autonomic dysfunction is frequent in diabetes and may camouflage the cause of arterial stiffness (atherosclerosis, advanced glycation end products [AGEs], neurogenic vasoconstriction, and others) and reduce the effect of treatment of arterial stiffness.

Other causes of arterial stiffness and potential sites of intervention are reduction of cholesterol levels, vascular calcification, inflammation, AGEs, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and increased exercise. However, as mentioned, outcome studies investigating the benefit of intervention are still lacking.

### Assessment and treatment of movement disorders in children with cerebral palsy [^113Mm69p]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cerebral palsy is the most common motor disability in childhood. Orthopedic care depends on the appreciation and the identification of muscle tone abnormalities and how they affect growth and development of the child. Abnormal muscle tone is a common diagnostic feature of cerebral palsy and can include hypotonia or hypertonia. Hypertonia is the most frequent tone abnormality in children with cerebral palsy. This article reviews hypertonia and provides information on discriminating between spasticity, dystonia, and rigidity. Medication and neurosurgical options for the management of hypertonia are presented and compared.

### Methadone (methadone hydrochloride) [^111w1zFm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methadone hydrochloride is a mu-agonist; a synthetic opioid with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine, the most prominent of which involves the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal therapeutic uses for methadone are for analgesia and for detoxification or maintenance in opioid addiction. The methadone withdrawal syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.

Some data also indicate that methadone acts as an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The contribution of NMDA receptor antagonism to methadone's efficacy is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Effects on the Central Nervous System

Methadone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation.

Methadone causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g., pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.

Some NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to produce neurotoxic effects in animals.

Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle

Methadone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone is increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.

Effects on the Cardiovascular System

Methadone produces peripheral vasodilation, which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope. Manifestations of histamine release and/or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus, flushing, red eyes, sweating, and/or orthostatic hypotension.

### CNTNAP1-related congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy [^112AvzcB]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy is a rare form of hereditary peripheral neuropathy characterized by nonprogressive weakness, areflexia, hypotonia, severely reduced nerve conduction velocities, and hypomyelination. Mutations in contactin-associated protein 1 (CNTNAP1) were recently described as a cause of congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. CNTNAP1-associated congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy is characterized by severe hypotonia, multiple distal joint contractures, and high mortality in the first few months of life.

Methods

Whole-exome sequencing was performed in two siblings with congenital hypotonia. Detailed phenotyping data were compared with previously reported cases.

Results

A novel, heterozygous compound mutation of CNTNAP1 was identified in both siblings. We also reviewed 17 patients harboring 10 distinct mutations from previously published studies. All patients presented with severe hypotonia, respiratory distress, and multiple cranial nerve palsies at birth. Six of 19 patients survived beyond infancy and required chronic mechanical ventilation. Seizures were common in the surviving patients.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that CNTNAP1-related congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy is a distinct form of hereditary neuropathy that affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems with no clear phenotype-genotype correlation. Our findings also indicate that arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and early lethality are not universal outcomes for patients with congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy.

### Congenital hypotonia: is there an algorithm? [^112mPoMc]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was performed with the aim of determining the diagnostic profile of newborns with hypotonia and of analyzing the usefulness of different procedures in the diagnostic process. One hundred thirty-eight hypotonic newborns were identified through the search of hospital records in a 10-year period: 121 (88%) had central hypotonia and 13 (9%) had peripheral hypotonia, whereas 4 (3%) remained unclassified. Analysis of the contribution of clinical data and results of investigations led to the construction of an algorithm, by which all cases in the group were diagnosed. Step 1, which included clinical data and results of examinations, solved 50% of all diagnosed cases. Neuroimaging techniques made up step 2 and contributed to the diagnosis in 13%. Step 3 was accomplished by a search through Oxford Medical Databases, which yielded the final diagnosis in 9%, whereas karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization for Prader-Willi syndrome comprised step 4 and contributed to the diagnosis in 6.5%. Biochemical tests formed step 5 and contributed to the diagnosis in 6%. Step 6, which included specific investigations of muscle and nerve, was diagnostic in 6%. The remaining cases (6.5%) were diagnosed only after several follow-up examinations. These results could assist the neonatologist when deciding the diagnostic approach to floppy newborns.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^113vYkjh]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Central hypotonia is characterized by a subgroup of children with negative motor signs due to lack of muscle tone and/or joint hyperlaxity. 3, 4 In general, lack of muscle tone can be associated with kinetic inaccuracy (sloppiness) and balance problems, which may mimic cerebellar dysfunction. 16, 17

In the absence of criterion standards 18 and in the context of ambiguous clinical descriptions, an insight into the reliability of phenotypic differentiation between EOA and other disorders with impaired coordination (DCD and central hypotonia) is important. In the present study, we aimed to: (1) investigate interobserver agreement on phenotypic assessment of EOA, DCD, and central hypotonia; (2) compare Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) 19 and Paediatric Balance Scale (PBS) 20 scores between phenotypic assignments; and (3) explore the effect of three scientifically validated, standardized EOA features on phenotypic consensus.

### Hypotonic male infant and MCT8 deficiency-a diagnosis to think about… [^111x95J8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This phenotype of severe X-linked psychomotor delay was first described in 1944 and was eponymously named Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome. Afterwards, in 2004, the first mutations in MCT8 gene (SLC16A2) were discovered by two distinct investigation groups (Dumitrescu et al. and Friesema et al.), and neurological findings of AHDS were explained by the resistance of T 3 on entering the neuronal target cells, that leads to a classical thyroid profile found in all affected patients. Currently, MCT8 mutations have been reported in about 50 families worldwide.

Diagnosis of AHDS in our patient is supported by: the presence of an X-linked inheritance; the characteristic thyroid hormonal pattern; the marked delay of myelination of the central nervous system (CNS) found in the MRI and the presence of the pathogenic mutation in the MCT8 gene. AHDS shows a broad and heterogeneous clinical spectrum according to the type of mutation and its impact on the protein synthesis stage. Our patient fits well with the most severe phenotype.

One of the main features of AHDS, also known as MCT8 deficiency, is the marked global hypotonia and difficulties maintaining the head up right, recognized as "limber neck" (Figure 1), evident since the first months of life. In the presence of a floppy infant, evaluation of signs of CNS involvement is essential but not always easy during the first year of life. In this case, normal eye contact and social interaction by the age of 12 months, in addition to the lack of deep tendon ankle reflexes, made peripheral neuromuscular involvement an important hypothesis to exclude. The absence of signs of CNS involvement during the first year of life could have resulted in a muscle biopsy in order to exclude a congenital myopathy or other muscle disorder. However, the presence of spasticity and abnormal movements during the second year of life make it clear that this investigation was not warranted.

### Identification of pain indicators for infants at risk for neurological impairment: a Delphi consensus study [^113M7dUW]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Generally, infants with NI may show fewer and less clear emotional responses. For example, infants with Down's syndrome or asphyxia exhibited cries that were less frequent, less variable in intensity and fundamental frequency (pitch) and of longer latency from the painful stimulus than cries in infants with no disabilities. Furthermore, there is speculation that differences in facial musculature, hypotonia, and aberrant neural information programming may affect facial pain responses. The multidimensional pain response in infants at risk for NI has not been consistently or comprehensively described, and no measure to assess pain in this population has been validated.

Using the Delphi method, the aim of this study was to establish consensus amongst infant pain research experts about which behavioural, physiologic and contextual indicators characterized pain in infants at high, moderate and low risk for NI. The ultimate goal is the development of a new measure or validation of an existing measure for acute pain assessment in this population.

### Classifying neurogenic dysphagia as a movement disorder [^112AzqX7]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

Disruptions in muscle tone: hypotonia, spasticity, rigidity

Muscle tone is assessed by passively moving a joint and judging the resistance, which is regulated by local reflexes and reticulospinal fibres. Assessing tone in swallowing muscles is particularly challenging due to their small size, overlapping positions, relative inaccessibility and difficulty assessing resistance to movement throughout the range of motionFurthermore, the distribution of muscle spindles and agonist/antagonist relationships are not as clear cut in the cranial motor system as they are in the limbs.

Dietsch and colleaguestested three commercially-available muscle tone assessment devices in the lips, cheeks and tongue muscles of individuals with different dysarthria subtypes. Not only did they note discrepancies in perceptual assessments of tone, but there was no clear relationship between dysarthria subtype and measured orofacial muscle stiffness. Furthermore, instrumented stiffness measures were influenced by the thickness of the tissues and did not differ between relaxed and contracted orofacial muscles. There are no known studies directly linking orofacial or oropharyngeal tone and swallowing physiology, although they are discussed as being related. Further work is needed to quantify muscle tone in swallowing-related musculature, and physiologic assessments should not be linked to changes in muscle tone unless it can be directly measured.

Hypo- and hyperreflexia

The relevance of hypo- and hyperreflexia to swallowing function is not abundantly clear. Weak or absent gag reflex has been reported in individuals with lower motor neuron symptomatology and dysphagia, and hyperactive gag reflex has been reported in motor neuron disease. However, up to 43% of healthy individuals with no neurologic dysfunction can present with a bilaterally absent gag reflex. The laryngeal adduction reflex can be assessed by stimulating the laryngeal surface with a puff of air or a physical touch from an endoscope and visually assessing vocal fold adduction. The relationship between laryngeal adduction reflex and airway protection during swallowing is not borne out by the data, and there can be considerable inter-rater reliability issues with determining patient performance.

Intact reflex or motor response to stimulation requires intact sensory pathways to the brainstem or spinal cord, intact interneuronal circuits and intact motor pathways. A delayed, incomplete or absent reflex response is an indication of dysfunction in one or more limbs of the reflex arc, and careful consideration must be given to determine where in that arc the dysfunction lies.

### AAPM&R consensus guidance on spasticity assessment and management [^112WERiL]. PM & R (2024). High credibility.

AAPM&R spasticity assessment and management — key findings guiding recommendations emphasize holistic and patient-centered evaluations, treatment, and reassessments, with assessment of the impact of spasticity management not limited to the reduction of objective measures of tone but also including the impact on function and quality of life. The guidance highlights the importance of multimodal therapies, stating that spasticity interventions should often be used in combination for maximal benefit and that coordination of care between physiatrists, physical and/or occupational therapists, caregivers, and surgeons, when appropriate, is key to achieving optimal outcomes. It also notes a lack of studies that explore effectiveness across conditions and that although there have been marked gains and improvements in management of spasticity, more work needs to be done to differentiate pathologic mechanisms and to achieve more targeted treatment; furthermore, access to care is an obstacle and numerous socioeconomic factors affect access to care and need to be addressed at both an individual patient and societal level.

### Practice parameter: pharmacologic treatment of spasticity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (an evidence-based review): report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the practice committee of the Child Neurology Society [^114UM39Z]. Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Cerebral palsy epidemiology and spasticity definition: The prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) was recently reported to be 3.6 cases per 1,000 in 8-year-old children, with very little variation among Western nations. More than 10,000 babies born in the United States each year will be affected by CP. CP is the most common cause of spasticity in children, and the majority of children with CP are affected by spasticity. The Taskforce on Childhood Motor Disorders defines spasticity as "hypertonia in which one of the following signs are present: 1) resistance to externally imposed movement increases with increasing speed of stretch and varies with the direction of joint movement; 2) resistance to externally imposed movement rises rapidly above a threshold speed of joint angle".

### Towards functional improvement of motor disorders associated with cerebral palsy [^112ySwNk]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Cerebral palsy is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition arising from non-progressive disorders occurring in the fetal or infant brain. Cerebral palsy has long been categorised into discrete motor types based on the predominance of spasticity, dyskinesia, or ataxia. However, these motor disorders, muscle weakness, hypotonia, and impaired selective movements should also be discriminated across the range of presentations and along the lifespan. Although cerebral palsy is permanent, function changes across the lifespan, indicating the importance of interventions to improve outcomes in motor disorders associated with the condition. Mounting evidence exists for the inclusion of several interventions, including active surveillance, adapted physical activity, and nutrition, to prevent secondary and tertiary complications. Avenues for future research include the development of evidence-based recommendations, low-cost and high-quality alternatives to existing therapies to ensure universal access, standardised cerebral palsy registers to harmonise epidemiological and clinical information, improved adult screening and check-up programmes to facilitate positive lived experiences, and phase 3 trials for new interventions.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^1133eoDk]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of phenotypic EOA recognition among DCD and central hypotonia phenotypes.

Phenotypic EOA recognition was reliable. EOA and central hypotonia phenotypes were homogeneously discerned, but phenotypic consensus on the separation between mildly affected EOA and severely affected DCD phenotypes was incomplete. In about a quarter of EOA and DCD phenotypes, one of three observers incorrectly assigned a patient to the opposite group. The inhomogeneously phenotyped children consisted of mildly affected EOA and severely affected DCD phenotypes with overlapping SARA TOTAL scores. These findings suggest that signs and symptoms may overlap between the two phenotypes. For instance, patients with EOA who are diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 29 (ITPR1 gene mutation), may present with a broad clinical spectrum, including subtle phenotypes with mild, non‐progressive coordination impairment and cognitive disabilities. 29 Furthermore, some patients with Joubert syndrome may present with mild developmental abnormalities, whereas others are severely ataxic. 30 Conversely, features of ataxia are sometimes recognizable in patients with DCD. Furthermore, at the outpatient clinic, parents cannot always tell whether their child's motor incoordination is progressive or not. From a conceptual point of view, DCD motor impairment affects daily tasks requiring sensorimotor integration, coordination, balance, motor learning, strategic planning, timing, sequencing, and visuospatial processing. 11 Although often more severely affected, patients with EOA may face similar limitations during daily tasks. Previous investigations have attributed DCD motor impairment to dysfunctional signalling within the network connecting the cerebellum, basal ganglia, parietal lobe, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, corpus callosum, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, 14, 15, 31 which (at least partly) overlaps with that of EOA. Altogether, these findings suggest that one cannot always distinguish patients with EOA and DCD by the motor phenotype alone. In children with severely affected DCD motor phenotypes, these findings have consequences for diagnostic testing, since one may consider testing with an EOA algorithm (including magnetic resonance imaging and next‐generation sequencing with EOA, and perhaps even with dystonia or developmental disability gene panels). Since a DCD diagnosis depends on the exclusion of an underlying neurological disorder, further diagnostic testing could provide a different diagnosis in a proportion of DCD phenotypes.

### Classification and definition of disorders causing hypertonia in childhood [^1127RoRb]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This report describes the consensus outcome of an interdisciplinary workshop that was held at the National Institutes of Health in April 2001. The purpose of the workshop and this article are to define the terms "spasticity", "dystonia", and "rigidity" as they are used to describe clinical features of hypertonia in children. The definitions presented here are designed to allow differentiation of clinical features even when more than 1 is present simultaneously.

Methods

A consensus agreement was obtained on the best current definitions and their application in clinical situations.

Results

"Spasticity" is defined as hypertonia in which 1 or both of the following signs are present: 1) resistance to externally imposed movement increases with increasing speed of stretch and varies with the direction of joint movement, and/or 2) resistance to externally imposed movement rises rapidly above a threshold speed or joint angle. "Dystonia" is defined as a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. "Rigidity" is defined as hypertonia in which all of the following are true: 1) the resistance to externally imposed joint movement is present at very low speeds of movement, does not depend on imposed speed, and does not exhibit a speed or angle threshold; 2) simultaneous co-contraction of agonists and antagonists may occur, and this is reflected in an immediate resistance to a reversal of the direction of movement about a joint; 3) the limb does not tend to return toward a particular fixed posture or extreme joint angle; and 4) voluntary activity in distant muscle groups does not lead to involuntary movements about the rigid joints, although rigidity may worsen.

Conclusion

We have provided a set of definitions for the purpose of identifying different components of childhood hypertonia. We encourage the development of clinical rating scales that are based on these definitions, and we encourage research to relate the degree of hypertonia to the degree of functional ability, change over time, and societal participation in children with motor disorders.

### Surgical management of intractable spasticity [^114xzMUn]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Spasticity is motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyper-excitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome.

Purpose

This study aimed at comparing between spinally based (dorsal rhizotomy) versus peripherally based (selective neurotomy) surgical procedures in management of hypertonia in the lower limbs of pediatrics.

Methods

Over a 3-year period, 50 children with intractable, lower limb spasticity were prospectively treated by selective neurotomy (group A, 35 patients) and dorsal rhizotomy (group B, 15 patients) with 6 months' follow-up period.

Results

The operative duration was longer with dorsal rhizotomy with mean of 292.2 min versus 76.8 min with neurotomy (P = 0.001) and the hospital stay of dorsal rhizotomy was longer with mean of 6.2 days versus 1.7 days with neurotomy (P = 0.001). Muscles power exhibited significant improvement in 53.3% of the total rhizotomies (P = 0.001). Following neurotomies; muscle tone showed marked improvement in 69.3% muscles which had normal tone and 31.9% of muscles had mild spasticity (P = 0.001). The H/M ratio following dorsal rhizotomies showed marked reduction of the ratio, and the mean was 0.11 versus 0.58 preoperatively.

Conclusion

Both neurotomies and dorsal rhizotomies were safe surgical procedures and were provided with good improvement in respect of: muscle power, severity of spasticity, patient's ambulation, gait, range of joint movement, associated pain, functional disability, and nerve excitability with no significant difference between both procedures.

### Neonatal hypertonia: II. differential diagnosis and proposed neuroprotection [^116253YV]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

More accurate documentation of a neonate's specific hypertonic state could be helpful as part of serial neurologic examinations. The clinician would then be in a more advantageous position to choose the appropriate neuroprotective drug or the procedure that best fits with the etiology, localization, and timing of injury. Ideally, choices for neuroprotection will integrate history, examination, and diagnostic findings before considering options for prophylaxis, neurorescue, or neurorepair. Measuring the efficacy of a neuroprotection protocol should include a complete list of life-course challenges, including motor, epileptic, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes as expressed at successively older ages.

### Electrodiagnostic studies in the management and prognosis of neuromuscular disorders [^116brxo6]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Prognosis remains a neglected aspect of modern medical care and research, behind diagnosis and treatment. The very term "electrodiagnosis" implies as much. Despite this, much has been published regarding the use and benefit of electrodiagnostic techniques in assessing prognosis and assisting in management of patients after the diagnosis has been established. This information is often hidden or otherwise not emphasized. This review summarizes the literature regarding the use of such techniques for prognosis and management of disorders of lower motor neurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular transmission, and muscle.

### Medical updates in management of hypertonia [^116qg1GU]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Identifying the subtypes of hypertonia is becoming increasingly important. Treatment strategies, including tone-modulating surgical interventions, medication type and dosing, and chemodenervation, may differ depending on the type of hypertonia present. It is important to delineate how hypertonia interferes with function and quality of life so that the appropriate intervention can be selected at the right time. Outcomes of treatment depend heavily on clear communication of goals. Botulinum toxin should not be used in isolation but as an adjunct to rehabilitation modalities.

### Comprehensive examination of upper-extremity spasticity [^112aGWHC]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Spasticity is characterized by heightened muscle tone with exaggerated stretch reflexes and represents a prominent feature of upper motor neuron syndrome. This condition leads to a spectrum of upper limb deformities based on underlying pathology, location and severity of the causative lesion, presence of concomitant contracture, and prior treatment. Because of the heterogeneous presentation of the spastic upper limb, a uniform approach to assessment is a critical component of caring for patients with upper motor neuron syndrome. Unfortunately, existing scientific literature lacks consistent diagnostic standards, thereby preventing effective comparison of outcomes. A minimum set of evaluation criteria should be employed to both clarify clinical communication and improve postoperative outcomes reporting. This review outlines a stepwise approach to evaluation, a guide for standardizing measurements, and explores how diagnostic findings influence surgical decision-making in upper limb spasticity.

### Biallelic mutations in neurofascin cause neurodevelopmental impairment and peripheral demyelination [^111nk5dY]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Recently, a homozygous splice-site variant in NFASC was identified in an individual with neurodevelopmental impairment, hypotonia and areflexia. Another family was found within a large genetic study carrying a homozygous NFASC variant associated spinal muscular atrophy and a homozygous missense mutation leads to significant loss of NFASC protein in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from affected subjects.

Despite these reports, the implication of NFASC mutations in the development of human diseases remains to be fully elucidated and warrants further investigations on a larger scale. Our results strongly establish the association of biallelic NFASC variants in the complex central and peripheral nervous system involvement presented by the 10 affected individuals described in this study. The notion of a genetic NFASC disease further delineates an emerging spectrum of human neurological disorders caused by variants in cell adhesion and ankyrin-binding genes involved in neurite extension, axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, myelination and neuron-glial cell interactions.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^1133SKC9]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

When considering the incomplete phenotypic separation between EOA and DCD phenotypes, we explored the effect of previously proven, 18, 23, 24 standardized phenotypic EOA features on phenotypic homogeneity. One validated standardized phenotypic EOA feature is that patients with EOA are likely to reveal assembled SARA motor (sub)scores from different SARA domains, reflecting global cerebellar involvement. 18 In patients with EOA, this feature is understandable by the exclusion of acquired cerebellar lesions from the group. The remaining underlying genetic and metabolic disorders are likely to induce global cerebellar dysfunction. The other validated standardized phenotypic EOA features are derived from previous machine learning research. 23, 24 To distinguish between EOA, DCD, and physiologically delayed motor behaviour, Martinez‐Manzanera et al. used automatic random‐forest classifiers on quantitative inertial measurement unit data. 24 Results indicated that EOA kinetic trajectories are more irregular, both within and between intentional movement trajectories, such as the finger‐to‐nose test. 24 The third validated standardized phenotypic EOA feature concerns the presence of a bow‐shaped intentional movement trajectory in any spatial plane. 25, 26 Application of these three features resulted in a higher phenotypic consensus regarding the separation of EOA and DCD phenotypes. However, despite the modestly increased phenotypic homogeneity (from 16 to 18 out of 21 patients) full phenotypic consensus was not obtained. In addition to a real overlap between EOA and DCD phenotypes, this may also reflect the fact that the motor phenotype alone is insufficient to make a phenotypic decision since other diagnostic clues (such as family history, oculomotor findings, neurological examination findings, and data from radiological or laboratory investigations) are not taken into account.

### Enzymology of the branched-chain amino acid oxidation disorders: the valine pathway [^113WcHLP]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

The second patient, described by us, was the first child of healthy non-consanguineous Caucasian parents and was born at term, following an uneventful pregnancy. Initially, he fed poorly, but otherwise appeared well until 4 months of age when his parents noted head bobbing. This was followed by a delay in motor milestones, then ataxia and a loss of skills. He was able to roll over at 5 months but lost this ability at 10 months. He was reaching out and grasping objects at 4 months, but gradually lost this skill at 13 months. From the age of 9 months, he started to have transient absences and episodes of eye rolling. At the age of 10 months, he had a febrile illness during which he became irritable and more wobbly. He lost the ability to finger feed. Examination at 11 months revealed an alert interactive child with no nystagmus but constant titubation of the head. He had marked truncal ataxia and was unable to sit unsupported. Tone, power and reflexes were normal in the upper limbs. Tone was reduced, particularly distally in the lower limbs. He had marked dysmetria and tremor on reaching out. At the age of 14 months, following 2 days of coryza and lethargy, he became acutely unwell with a reduced level of consciousness and metabolic acidosis, which required intubation and ventilatory support. Blood pH was 7.29 with a base deficit of 15.8 mmol/L. Blood lactate and ammonia were normal. Echocardiography demonstrated no abnormalities. Examination following recovery from this illness showed drowsiness, variable nystagmus, sluggish papillary responses, pooling of secretions in the mouth, fasciculation of the tongue, titubation of the head, and upper and lower limb hypotonia with preservation of reflexes. He showed no improvement on treatment with thiamine or a combination of vitamin C, vitamin E and ubiquinone. As he recovered from this episode of acute encephalopathy he developed dystonia predominantly affecting the right arm and leg. A CT scan, performed during the episode of acute encephalopathy, revealed generalized edema of the brain with loss of gray/white differentiation in the basal ganglia. In addition, an MRI scan revealed signal abnormalities in the globus pallidus and the midbrain with asymmetrical involvement of the cerebral peduncles (right greater than left). No structural abnormalities of the brain were observed. As the neuroimaging was reminiscent of Leigh's disease, initial investigations were performed focused on pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase, and the respiratory chain, which revealed no abnormalities, except for a marked reduction of complex I and a borderline reduction in complex IV. Remarkably, elevated levels of hydroxy-C 4 carnitine were found in blood spots of the patient, ranging between 0.45 and 1.73 μmol/L (controls < 0.4 μmol/L). Based on the elevation of hydroxy-C 4 carnitine the activity of short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase was measured, which was normal. Subsequently, the activity of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase was measured which revealed a full deficiency (see Loupatty et al)). Molecular studies in the two patients described by Brown et al and Loupatty et al, respectively, revealed clear-cut mutations in the gene coding for 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase.

### Neonatal hypertonia-a diagnostic challenge [^114cVvMq]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

In comparison to hypotonia, hypertonia is less commonly expressed in the neonatal period. The scientific literature on the causes of neonatal hypertonia is scant, with no suggested diagnostic algorithm easily available to clinicians. Aetiologies include conditions affecting the central nervous system and spine, and rare peripheral neuromuscular disorders leading to hypertonia. Aetiology onset may be antepartum, peripartum with either transient hypertonia or persistent hypertonia which may appear later, or from a postnatal event/disease. This review discusses neonatal hypertonia and a diagnostic approach to neonatal hypertonia is suggested.

### A 7-year-old female with hypotonia and scoliosis [^113fW2YB]. Brain Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

The patient was referred to our hospital at age 7. She was delivered normally at 40 weeks of gestation and had no family history of neuromuscular disease. No abnormal findings were reported during regular antenatal care. Her height and weight at birth were 48 cm and 2696 g, respectively. The patient was found to have scoliosis and hip dislocation at the age of 2 months. She held her head up at 4 months and became ambulatory at 3 years. Though she had contractures of the proximal joints, hyperlaxity of the distal joints was not observed. There was no delay in intellectual development. At presentation, her height and weight were 86.5 cm (−7.0 SD) and 10 kg (−3.2 SD), respectively. Blood chemistry testing revealed that the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase levels were within the normal range. No abnormalities were observed in nerve conduction studies. On muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremities, high intensity on T1‐weighted imaging was observed in the peripheral area of the vastus lateralis (white arrow), soleus, and gastrocnemius muscles (white arrowhead), in addition to the central area of the rectus femoris muscle (black arrowhead) (Box 1; Figure 1A, B).

### The floppy infant: evaluation of hypotonia [^111STdve]. Pediatrics in Review (2009). Low credibility.

Hypotonia is characterized by reduced resistance to passive range of motion in joints versus weakness, which is a reduction in the maximum muscle power that can be generated. (Dubowitz, 1985; Crawford, 1992; Martin, 2005) Based on strong research evidence, central hypotonia accounts for 60% to 80% of cases of hypotonia, whereas peripheral hypotonia is the cause in about 15% to 30% of cases. Disorders causing hypotonia often are associated with a depressed level of consciousness, predominantly axial weakness, normal strength accompanying the hypotonia, and hyperactive or normal reflexes. (Martin, 2005; Igarashi, 2004; Richer, 2001; Miller, 1992; Crawford, 1992; Bergen, 1985; Dubowitz, 1985) Based on some research evidence, 50% of patients who have hypotonia are diagnosed by history and physical examination alone. (Paro-Panjan, 2004) Based on some research evidence, an appropriate medical and genetic evaluation of hypotonia in infants includes a karyotype, DNA-based diagnostic tests, and cranial imaging. (Battaglia, 2008; Laugel, 2008; Birdi, 2005; Paro-Panjan, 2004; Prasad, 2003; Richer, 2001; Dimario, 1989) Based on strong research evidence, infant botulism should be suspected in an acute or subacute presentation of hypotonia in an infant younger than 6 months of age who has signs and symptoms such as constipation, listlessness, poor feeding, weak cry, and a decreased gag reflex.

Over time, he developed severe global developmental delay with signs of slow progress but no obvious evidence of regression. At 3 years 2 months, head circumference plotted on the 0.4th centile. A few subtle dysmorphic features were evident, including mild prominence of his forehead with long eyelashes, tented mouth appearance, high‐arched palate, and bilateral undescended testes. There was also marked axial hypotonia and severe head lag. An overall paucity of limb movements was observed, although some antigravity movements were evident. Peripheral tone was low/normal, deep tendon reflexes were brisk throughout, and plantar responses up‐going bilaterally. There was no evidence of ankle clonus. He could make some vocalizations and was feeding orally with only occasional drooling, and no episodes of choking or swallowing difficulties. Extensive neurometabolic investigations were essentially unremarkable (Table SI, online supporting information), including a normal MRI brain (age 14 mo) and comparative genomic hybridization microarray analysis for genomic copy number variants.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^115XTFtX]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The study has several limitations. First, it was observational in nature and the sample size was small. Second, videotaped scoring of the motor phenotype is an incomplete approach. On the other hand, a positive family history alone, or isolated cerebellar oculomotor features, cannot automatically be taken as pathognomonic for EOA either. 32 Third, due to the study design, all patients had been clinically diagnosed before their inclusion in the study. Although the assessors were technically blinded to the clinical data, previous professional encounters at the outpatient clinic may have reduced the complexity of the phenotypic tasks. This suggests that the actual phenotypic consensus might be worse than already indicated. If so, the implications would remain the same and underline the need for: (1) supportive EOA features; and (2) an adequate diagnostic strategy for severe DCD phenotypes, especially when some ataxic features are present. Fourth, we reassessed the effect of EOA features on phenotypic homogeneity within the same assessor group. However, since: (1) the interval between the first and second phenotypic assessment was more than 6 months; (2) the assessors were not informed about the accuracy of their previous assessments; and (3) the assessors were allowed to select their phenotype among a large variety of possibilities (Fig. S2), we would not anticipate a large effect from this limitation. Finally, the reassessments with the EOA features were only performed in the inhomogeneously separated EOA and DCD phenotypes. However, since the EOA and central hypotonia phenotypes had been completely separated during the first assessment (in all patients by all three assessors), we did not anticipate a significant effect from reassessment. Future studies will hopefully make these points clearer.

In conclusion, the paediatric motor phenotype is not sufficient to distinguish between EOA and DCD. We hope that future standardized phenotypic EOA features, based on scientifically validated data, may help to improve the phenotypic consensus on EOA recognition.

### Congenital hypotonia with favorable outcome [^113B8pFT]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Congenital hypotonia with favorable outcome is characterized by an early neonatal onset and a benign clinical course. The old term, proposed by Walton, was benign congenital hypotonia, denoting the presence of muscle weakness and hypotonia, with the exception of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. It has been clear that this term includes congenital myopathies with definite changes in the muscle fiber. However, many cases remain unclarified. The term congenital hypotonia with favorable outcome includes only these last cases. A long-term follow-up study of children with congenital hypotonia with favorable outcome is presented, and a hypothetical mechanism underlying muscle shortening is discussed. The study was carried out at the Department of Child Neuropsychiatric Sciences, University "La Sapienza" of Rome, during the period 1985–2000, and included 41 patients with congenital hypotonia. Our study confirms the good prognosis of congenital hypotonia with favorable outcome and suggests a correlation with joint hyperlaxity, which is observed in many parents of our children, as if the latter developed from the former. On the basis of experimental changes occurring in the muscles, we believe that in our cohort the main cause of shortening is caused by an increase in joint mobility, which keeps muscles shortened in both the passive and active states for a long time. If this view is confirmed by other studies, we suggest continuous muscle exercise as a preventive treatment.

### Can clinical signs identify newborns with neuromuscular disorders? [^114L3A7g]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate retrospectively the prevalence of neuromuscular disorders in 83 newborns referred to a tertiary care center because of hypotonia and weakness and/or contractures, with a possible diagnosis of neuromuscular disorder. We also aimed to establish whether clinical signs could help to identify infants with neuromuscular disorders.

Study Design

Sixty-six of the 83 infants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (79.5%) had an identifiable disorder, which was a neuromuscular disorder in 39 (46.9%).

Results

Absent or extremely reduced antigravity movements were mainly found in infants with neuromuscular disorders (sensitivity and specificity 97.4% and 75%), whereas partial range antigravity movements were more frequent in infants with other diagnosis. Contractures were mainly found in infants with peripheral nerve or muscle involvement but also were relatively frequent in infants with genetic or metabolic syndromes (sensitivity 69.2%, specificity 61.3%). Reduced fetal movements and abnormal liquor were frequent but not present consistently in infants with neuromuscular disorders (sensitivity 46.1% and 38.4%) and were found rarely in infants with other disorders (specificity 88.6% and 75.0%).

Conclusions

Severe muscle weakness and contractures are the most reliable indicators of a neuromuscular disorder and should be carefully assessed in an infant with neonatal hypotonia.

### Hypotonia in the newborn infant [^117WmP65]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypotonia, defined as hypotonia present from birth to 4 w of age, has a plethora of causes. Distinguishing between central and peripheral causes is the key to arriving at a timely diagnosis. A thorough history, general and neurologic examination, and systematic utilization of laboratory and ancillary studies allow for rapid diagnosis in most cases. Strategic use of genetic testing yields a definitive diagnosis in some cases. Arriving at a diagnosis may afford rapid treatment initiation, with the potential to change prognosis.

### Hypotonia and lethargy in a two-day-old male infant [^115aL6Fx]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

A 2-day old term male infant was found to be hypotonic and minimally reactive during routine nursing care in the newborn nursery. At 40 hours of life, he was hypoglycemic and had intermittent desaturations to 70%. His mother had an unremarkable pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother's prenatal serology results were negative for infectious risk factors. Apgar scores were 9 at 1 and 5 minutes of life. On day 1 of life, he fed, stooled, and voided well. Our expert panel discusses the differential diagnosis of hypotonia in a neonate, offers diagnostic and management recommendations, and discusses the final diagnosis.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^115Paz4J]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Children with developmental central hypotonia, with or without a confirmed genetic diagnosis, are at increased risk of hip problems, which may be missed with standard neonatal screening. Some countries (such as Austria and Germany) have universal screening for DDH with ultrasound, while many others use clinical screening, with selective hip ultrasound for those with risk factors between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months. There remains debate about which is the best and most effective approach, which risk factors merit early ultrasound, and the varied protocols for timing of clinical screening and ultrasound. Since infants with significant hypotonia, regardless of diagnosis, have increased risk of hip problems, we would suggest that hypotonia in an infant should be an indication for hip ultrasound between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months, and referral to orthopaedics for evaluation of any concerns. Annual orthopaedic review with regular radiographs should be started from 12 months for children with hypotonia, and continue for as long as risk factors such as hypotonia, delayed motor development, or non‐weightbearing/non‐ambulant status are present.

Studies report that many children with developmental central hypotonia and hip dysplasia who were thought to be treated successfully using conservative methods, re‐dislocated or developed increasing hip instability once they began to walk. This reinforces the need for ongoing hip surveillance during the first few years of life. For older children and adults with significant and persistent hypotonia, annual surveillance should be continued, and X‐rays and orthopaedic review should be triggered for other individuals with these 'at‐risk' diagnoses who demonstrate changes in gait pattern, range of motion, or leg length.

Longitudinal research is needed to understand the natural history of hip dysplasia and subluxation in individuals with developmental central hypotonia. Migration percentages greater than 30% or 33% are the cut‐off scores commonly used in hip surveillance programmes for referral to orthopaedics for consideration of preventive intervention. The cohort study of 53 children with developmental central hypotonia identified that a migration percentage greater than 33% was most common in children older than 8 years of age, in contrast to children with CP and spasticity where a migration percentage greater than 30% or 33% is more common between 3 years and 5 years of age. However, there are insufficient longitudinal data at this time to determine whether a migration percentage above 30% predicts future displacement in children with hypotonia.

### Neonatal hypertonia: I. classification and structural-functional correlates [^1111UEid]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Neonatal hypertonic states can be encountered as expressions of abnormal tone and posture. It would be useful for the neonatal neurointensivist to more precisely describe the various presentations of neonatal hypertonia, taking into consideration a classification scheme adopted for hypertonia in children at older ages. An understanding of the ontogeny of muscle tone and posture during fetal and postnatal preterm time periods with maturation to full-term ages will help conceptualize the developmental structural-functional correlates that subserve the evolving expression of this abnormal clinical sign. In the future, a more accurate description of neonatal hypertonic states should be part of the complete clinical examination to help integrate etiology, timing of injury, and neurologic localization before choosing the appropriate therapeutic intervention.

### Beyond the retrotrapezoid nucleus in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome [^11224P5G]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Second, although sufficient evidence is still weak, there are several published reports suggesting that some neurocognitive functions in individuals with CCHS are lower than the general norm.

To shed light on the origins of brain injury and impaired neurocognitive outcomes in individuals with CCHS, Vu and colleagues examined one aspect of cerebrovascular reactivity that involves vascular tone changes in response to fluctuations in arterial blood pressure. Cerebrovascular reactivity is the ability of vascular smooth muscle to change basal tone in response to variations of physiologic parameters, such as arterial blood pressure, and metabolic factors, such as cerebral carbon dioxide and oxygen levels. When cerebrovascular reactivity is exhausted, cerebral blood flow becomes dependent on systemic arterial blood pressure. Hence, there is a positive correlation between surrogate measure of cerebral blood flow (cerebral oximetry index) and mean arterial blood pressure. In Vu's study, cerebral autoregulation at rest in individuals with CCHS did not differ from that in normal control subjects. However, during orthostatic stress, a positive correlation between mean arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow emerged in individuals with CCHS. The clinical importance of this observation is that the large swings of blood pressure in individuals with CCHS may push the limit of the physiologic parameters to effectively regulate vascular smooth muscle tone and, therefore, cerebral blood flow depends essentially on blood pressure–driven mechanisms. Under these conditions, extremes of low or high blood pressure may lead to transient hypo- or hyperperfusion of the brain, respectively. Differences in cerebral autoregulation during orthostatic testing between individuals with CCHS and normal control subjects have to be discussed in the context of blood pressure response to HUT in the two groups as the authors attempted to do. Not surprisingly, individuals with CCHS exhibited a larger drop in blood pressure during HUT than control subjects. This is explained by the known deficit in sympathetic and parasympathetic baroreflex in CCHS. The control group did not have the same magnitude of blood pressure drop and therefore had shorter time with elevated cerebral oximetry index. The overall conclusion from the data presented in this study is that the disturbed cerebral autoregulation in CCHS is due to autonomic failure of blood pressure control and not to inherent failure of other mechanisms that regulate cerebral blood flow. Recognizing that this study examined only one aspect of autoregulation, specific studies of other mechanisms of cerebral reactivity may provide different conclusions in the future. An important limitation of this study that the authors had little control over is the heterogeneity of the study population. Fifty-four percent of subjects had diaphragm pacing, 81% had a tracheostomy, and 48% were mechanically ventilated during HUT testing. It is likely that the interactions between breathing and the autonomic control of the cardiovascular system in individuals who are breathing spontaneously differ from those requiring ventilatory assistance. A standardized clinical management of individuals with CCHS and data collection across centers may be the only approach to overcome the limitations imposed by retrospective single-center studies.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^114RhUJt]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Higher GMFCS levels are associated with increased hip problems in children with CP. Some preliminary data in this review suggest that non‐ambulant children with developmental central hypotonia may experience more severe hip problems, requiring intervention. However, ambulatory status was only reported for a very few children in this review, making it difficult to draw any strong conclusions. Most children with developmental central hypotonia appear to be ambulant but some develop hip instability after they begin walking. Most included studies provided insufficient functional details on the natural history and spectrum of motor abilities associated with these rare syndromes. Consistent terminology and functional descriptors are needed to be able to provide an analysis of differences in hip status between children who are functional ambulators and those who are primarily wheelchair users.

There is debate in the literature about the use of GMFCS levels to classify children not diagnosed with CP. However, many children with developmental central hypotonia do meet clinical criteria for a CP diagnosis, and there are insufficient numbers to develop separate diagnosis‐specific classifications. The benefits of expanding the definition of CP to include all who have neurodevelopmental disorders and motor disability is increasingly proposed, to enhance access to appropriate care and intervention. While many children with developmental central hypotonia may be considered 'CP‐like' (rather than CP), and timing and presentation of hip issues may differ somewhat from children with AHD‐CP, we would advocate that they should not be excluded from hip surveillance programmes because of lack of a CP diagnosis. Future research should include consistent functional descriptors such as the GMFCS to confirm or refute any association between hip problems and ambulatory status or GMFCS/functional motor abilities.

### Paediatric motor phenotypes in early-onset ataxia, developmental coordination disorder, and central hypotonia [^115GxxGN]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Phenotypic reassessment

After a time interval of 6 months, we redetermined the phenotypic homogeneity between incompletely differentiated patients with EOA and DCD. For this purpose, the same assessors were provided with three scientifically validated features for EOA recognition. These features were derived from previous phenotypic 18 and quantitative 'machine learning' data using inertial measurement units. 23, 24 The features used to identify EOA were: (1) marked irregularity of finger‐to‐nose movements, both between and within the kinetic trajectory of the finger‐to‐nose movement; 24, 25, 26 (2) bow‐shaped trajectories in kinetic movement performances (in any spatial plane); 24, 25, 26 and (3) ataxia features in more than one SARA domain, implicating more generalized cerebellar dysfunction. 18 Before rescoring, assessors were not allowed to review, compare, or discuss previous assessments. Assessors did not receive clinical information and they were not informed about any interobserver agreement on their previous scores.

In 1980, Lance and colleagues defined spasticity as a motor disorder with a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes and exaggerated tendon jerks due to stretch reflex hyperexcitability within the upper motor neuron syndrome; it was later redefined as disordered sensorimotor control from an upper motor neuron lesion with intermittent or sustained involuntary muscle activation. A more recent definition describes spasticity as a velocity- and muscle length–dependent increase in resistance to externally imposed muscle stretch that results from hyperexcitable descending excitatory brainstem pathways, with related motor impairments that coexist with spasticity. The page emphasizes that abnormal stretch reflex excitability is the central mechanism and notes spasticity may also be defined as a type of hypertonia within the upper motor neuron syndrome with manifestations including hyperreflexia, clonus, co-contractions, spreading of reflexes, spastic dystonia, associated reactions, motor overflow, and muscle spasms.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^1161BK5g]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This review identified at least eight genetic diagnoses or syndromes, in addition to single reports on several other rare diagnoses underlying the clinical presentation of developmental central hypotonia. Significantly increased incidence of hip problems was identified in all these diagnoses as well as in a cohort of largely undiagnosed children with developmental central hypotonia. This suggests that attention to hip status should be paid for all infants presenting with hypotonia, regardless of specific diagnosis, and that periodic follow‐up or hip surveillance over time is warranted. Some differences in the profile and progression of hip problems compared with children with CP have been identified in this review, and the link with ambulatory status is unclear. More research is required to establish the most appropriate hip surveillance protocols for children and adults with developmental central hypotonia.

Owing to the exploratory and descriptive nature of this review, no strong conclusions can be drawn. The included studies are highly heterogenous, and for many conditions only a few articles, or reports of a small number of cases, were identified. In addition, it is unclear how many unique reported cases were included, as various articles included or reported on other cases or cohorts from the literature. It is not clear how these studies overlapped in their inclusion, therefore influencing results and conclusions. The search was broad ranging, and librarian assistance was sought to ensure a thorough search; however, despite this, many irrelevant citations were retrieved, while some relevant citations were retrieved through simple keyword searches. As with any review, it is possible that we missed relevant citations in grey literature or in other languages. This is the first review to attempt to comprehensively map the literature in this area, and we retrieved a wider range of articles on these rare conditions than anticipated. The search was not restricted in terms of design, age range, or languages and with the iterative and exploratory searching process we are confident that our search is relatively complete.

### Attitudes towards the neurological examination in an unwell neonate: a mixed methods approach [^113RRai7]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Determination of limb muscle tone was considered both achievable and important. The assessment of power was also thought important, although participants noted trainees experienced difficulties in differentiating tone from power and the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle grading system was inappropriate for neonates. Power was generally assessed instead by observing the presence or absence of antigravity movements and resistance to procedures and examinations. One participant discussed the relationship between conscious level and assessment of power, noting a neonate had to be alert to assess power. Participants felt the assessment of the fontanelle was achievable, but a small number questioned what useful information it gave; it was generally used to diagnose raised intracranial pressure and one participant objected to a "sunken" fontanelle being assumed to correlate with dehydration. Logistically, the fontanelle examination was difficult to perform where apparatus or hats were attached to the neonate's head. Posture, quantity, and quality of spontaneous movements were also considered important, but assessing quality of movements was felt to require considerable experience. Head circumference, rooting, grasp, and plantar reflexes were also considered possible and important.

Features of the neurological examination that fell within the impossible or unimportant category included head lag and ventral suspension, primitive reflexes, such as the parachute reflex, the assessment of cry, which was either impossible in a ventilated neonate or too subjective, and examination of sensation outside the context of a spinal lesion. There was a strong culture that the Moro reflex was a vital component of the standard neonatal neurological examination, although no participant clarified what useful clinical information it gave. It was considered dangerous in an unwell / ventilated neonate. Participants' opinions on deep tendon reflexes were divided. Some thought they were important, but examination was hampered by the lack of available tendon hammers and the practice of using a stethoscope instead, whilst others thought they were too hard to obtain and did not offer useful information. Participants' answers about the cranial nerve examination were interesting: non-neurologist participants were resistant to performing the cranial nerve examination and thought it was too hard or did not provide useful information. However, when faced with individual components, such as pupillary responses, eye movements, facial expression, suck and gag, the same participants reported these aspects were important and easy to perform. Neurology participants saw the cranial nerve examination as both possible and important.

### Incidence of hip problems in developmental central hypotonia: a scoping review [^1122ssTj]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study sought to explore what is known about hip problems in individuals with developmental central hypotonia. Down syndrome is most prominently reported, while the literature on hip health for other diagnostic groups, meeting criteria for developmental central hypotonia, is sparse and tends to be more descriptive. To adequately map the literature on these less commonly reported conditions, studies including individuals with Down syndrome were excluded following the literature search and will be addressed in a separate paper.

The specific questions guiding this review were as follows. (1) What diagnoses are associated with developmental central hypotonia and hip problems? (2) What is the natural history, prevalence, and incidence of hip problems in reported diagnoses? (3) What specific hip problems have been reported? (4) At what ages do hip problems occur? (5) What are the risk factors for these hip problems? (6) What surgical and other interventions have been reported to prevent or treat hip problems? (7) What outcomes have been reported for these interventions?

### Managing the combined consequences of COVID-19 infection and lock-down policies on athletes: narrative review and guidelines proposal for a safe return to sport [^114QFWJC]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Moreover, extra attention should be given to the possible post-viral fatigue syndrome, which may also generate neuromuscular fatigue. The use of CMJ and DJ in isolation as a global indicator of muscle power of the lower limb muscles does not inform about the specific effect of neuromuscular fatigue on sports performance. Neuromuscular fatigue arises not only because of peripheral changes at the level of the muscle but also because the central nervous system fails to drive the motoneurons adequately. Appropriate screening methods, combining stimulation methods, dynamometry and electromyography may be used to identify and evaluate the relative contributions of central and peripheral factors to peripheral fatigue. That could help to prescribe exercise modalities adapted to the level of fatigue and propose countermeasures, such as nutritional and/or specific training regimens, to help athlete to regain performance faster.

Finally, the fatigue reported by patients with COVID-19 may have affected their flexibility. Indeed, fatigue leads to inactivity, which in turn may decrease flexibility. Inactivity affects different muscles and muscle chains depending on whether they are tonic or phasic, causing muscle shortening and/or hypertonia or laxity and/or hypotonia depending on the muscle type. The 'Y Balance Test' is an easy and reproducible method to assess the flexibility of hip and leg muscles. Including flexibility evaluation in the PPE would give insight into the flexibility status of athletes with COVID-19 and may ensure a safe return to activity. Managing the combined consequences of COVID-19 infection and lock-down policies on athletes is represented in figure 1. This combined approach based on the physical performance determinant and medical assessment has a dual interest for the sports medicine community, ensuring a return to practice without risk and advising athletes to accelerate their return to performance.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^111mPXmi]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) definition — Clinicians should use the term BRUE to describe an event occurring in an infant < 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief, and now resolved episode of ≥ 1 of cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered level of responsiveness. Moreover, clinicians should diagnose a BRUE only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.

### Development and preliminary validation of a parkinsonism-dystonia scale for infants and young children [^111XP2Xv]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Bradykinesia is not exclusive to parkinsonism and can be seen in patients with dystoniaand with diseases primarily involving the corticospinal system and the cerebellum, as well as those with cognitive disturbances and psychiatric disorders. As stated earlier in the Subjects and Methods section, the main inclusion criterion for our study was the presence of a hypokinetic movement disorder in the absence of muscle weakness attributable to a neuromuscular disorder, regardless of whether the patient met the criteria of parkinsonism according to the MDS. This enabled us to assess a wide array of different conditions ranging from mitochondrial disorders with basal ganglia lesions to acquired ischemic lesions in early life. Notably, all patients in our cohort exhibited varying degrees of dystonia, whereas only two patients exhibited prominent corticospinal tract dysfunction (scoring > 3 on the Modified Tardieu Scale), which was identified as the main cause of their reduced motor activity.

The manifestation of tremor in infancy and early childhood parkinsonism diverges from that seen in adults with Parkinson's disease and varies depending on the underlying disease. In infants with monoamine neurotransmitter disorders, tremor is observed in 75% of cases, although only around a quarter of them exhibit rest tremor. Moreover, within this group of disorders, tremor can emerge in the first months of life as a paroxysmal or continuous rest and action coarse tremor with high amplitude and low frequency that involves the upper limbs and eventually generalizes. The tremor vanishes after 2–6 months either spontaneously or promptly with‐dopa treatment. In this group of diseases, tremor can also be dystonic in nature (personal observations R.P.). Consequently, in the IPDRS, the presence, severity, and distribution of all types of tremor are included.

In infantile degenerative parkinsonism, rigidity is a predominant feature. Conversely, in developmental parkinsonism related to monoamine neurotransmitter disorders, patients typically exhibit axial hypotonia, whereas appendicular tone varies widely, including hypotonia, hypertonia, fluctuating tone, rigidity, and even spasticity. It is thought that the presence of dystonia could explain some of these tone abnormalities, because dystonia may cause hypertonia when it is present at rest (dystonic hypertonia), and also because dystonia fluctuates in presence and severity depending on factors such as body position, emotional state, or level of consciousness. Assessment of axial tone has been incorporated into the IPDRS, given its clinical relevance in developmental parkinsonism. Some authors have proposed that this prevalent feature may represent the earliest expression of postural derangement in early life.

### Biallelic NDC1 variants that interfere with ALADIN binding are associated with neuropathy and triple A-like syndrome [^117WyJp7]. HGG Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical description

All described individuals were born after uncomplicated pregnancies with growth measurements within the normal range. In all, symptoms started in the first year of life, characterized by delayed motor development in most individuals. The individuals from family 3 initially presented with vomiting and recurrent aspiration, but also experienced delayed motor development in early childhood. All individuals had intellectual disability, with variable severity. Speech development was affected and ranged between normal and non-verbal. Nasal speech was frequently described (4/7), and often associated with facial weakness (Figure 1 B). Feeding difficulties were described for 5/7 affected individuals, and were characterized by dysphagia and near chocking. In one individual achalasia was radiologically confirmed and treated with surgery.

Physical examination showed the involvement of the peripheral, central, and autonomic nervous system. Clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy were observed in all but one individual, and were confirmed with EMG in three individuals. EMG recordings showed a motor demyelinating polyneuropathy with secondary axonal injury. The most frequently reported peripheral neurological features were hypotonia, muscle atrophy, decreased muscle strength, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Other lower motor neuron signs included facial weakness (5/7), tongue atrophy, and tongue fasciculations (4/7). Exceptionally, individual 4-I presented with increased muscle tone, contractures of the knees, elbows, and ankles. He also developed epilepsy in the first year of life, characterized by atonic/tonic episodes or head drops. Epilepsy was also reported for individual 3-II. Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system was seen in 5/7 individuals. Alacrima or hypolacrima was the most frequent autonomic feature and present in 5/7 individuals. In addition, limited heart rate variability was observed in two individuals.
