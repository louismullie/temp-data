## Question

Are maternal hypertension and preeclampsia common causes of neonatal hypoxia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether maternal hypertension and preeclampsia are common causes of neonatal hypoxia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how neonatal hypoxia is defined clinically and what outcomes it produces. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to fetal hypoxia. Next, I will quantify the epidemiology of hypertensive disorders and their neonatal consequences. After that, I should review direct evidence for fetal hypoxia in preeclampsia and related conditions. Finally, I will synthesize whether this constitutes a "common cause" and outline clinical implications and caveats, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct of neonatal hypoxia. Neonatal hypoxia, or perinatal asphyxia, reflects impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis; clinically it spans from low Apgar scores and need for resuscitation to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, with severity linked to the degree of acidosis and multiorgan involvement, so I need to ensure I anchor outcomes to accepted definitions and staging systems when I interpret data [^112bXPxo].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology linking maternal hypertension and preeclampsia to fetal hypoxia. The two-stage model is well supported: stage 1 involves shallow trophoblast invasion and failed spiral artery remodeling, causing placental malperfusion and chronic placental hypoxia; stage 2 involves release of antiangiogenic and proinflammatory factors into maternal circulation, producing systemic endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction that further compromise uteroplacental perfusion, directly reducing fetal oxygen delivery and nutrient supply, which is exactly the substrate for fetal hypoxia and growth restriction [^1163uBFY] [^113SWXu1] [^111jUr35].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify that this isn't just theoretical. Multiple lines of evidence show fetal hypoxia in preeclampsia: umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities indicating increased resistance and compromised perfusion, elevated cord erythropoietin as a fetal hypoxia marker, and increased nucleated red blood cells reflecting chronic hypoxia; in high-altitude cohorts, preeclampsia augments fetal hypoxia and correlates with neonatal pulmonary hypertension, reinforcing a causal link between placental disease and fetal oxygen deficit [^112zJzJR] [^114eHiyv] [^114mCLDF].

> Next, I should review epidemiology to see how "common" this problem is. Preeclampsia complicates about 3–8% of pregnancies globally, and hypertensive disorders overall affect roughly 5–10% of pregnancies; importantly, hypertensive disease is a leading maternal cause of preterm neonatal death in South Asia, and intrauterine hypoxia is the most common final pathway in preterm neonatal mortality, which supports the notion that maternal hypertension and preeclampsia are frequent upstream drivers of neonatal hypoxia at a population level [^115TYifc] [^111jjH6b] [^115qGE7L].

> I will now examine neonatal outcomes that reflect hypoxia to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia are associated with markedly increased odds of preterm delivery, low birthweight, NICU admission, and respiratory distress, and hypertensive disorders are linked to higher rates of neonatal thrombocytopenia and polycythemia, both of which are consistent with chronic fetal hypoxia and its hematologic adaptations; moreover, maternal hypertensive disorders are associated with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and antenatal magnesium sulfate in this high-risk population reduces HIE risk, which indirectly validates hypoxia as a key mechanism to target [^116JCrST] [^111LMT4n] [^114mCLDF] [^117R83wK].

> But wait, what if I'm conflating preeclampsia with milder gestational hypertension — does the latter still cause hypoxia? Let me consider the spectrum. Gestational hypertension shares pathophysiologic features with preeclampsia, including angiogenic imbalance and placental hypoperfusion, albeit typically less severe; still, gestational hypertension increases risk of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia and is associated with adverse neonatal outcomes, and up to 30% of gestational hypertension progresses to preeclampsia, which strengthens the case that even nonproteinuric hypertension can precipitate fetal hypoxia in a meaningful subset [^111LMT4n] [^111Nim32].

> I should double-check whether timing modifies risk, because early-onset disease might carry a heavier hypoxic burden. Early-onset preeclampsia is more tightly linked to defective placentation and placental hypoxia, and is associated with higher rates of fetal growth restriction and adverse perinatal outcomes, whereas late-onset disease often reflects maternal vascular susceptibility; this distinction helps explain variability in neonatal hypoxia risk across phenotypes, but both can impair fetal oxygenation depending on severity and uteroplacental involvement [^113SWXu1] [^115bkHR1].

> Let me synthesize and answer the question directly. Yes, maternal hypertension and preeclampsia are common causes of neonatal hypoxia: they are prevalent in 5–10% of pregnancies, the pathophysiology directly produces placental hypoperfusion and fetal hypoxia, and population-level data show hypertensive disease as a leading maternal cause of preterm neonatal death with intrauterine hypoxia as the dominant final pathway; clinically, we see downstream markers of hypoxia such as HIE, thrombocytopenia, and polycythemia, and interventions that mitigate maternal disease or provide neuroprotection reduce HIE risk, corroborating causality [^111jjH6b] [^115TYifc] [^117R83wK] [^114mCLDF].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are clear. Recognition of maternal hypertensive disorders as common causes of neonatal hypoxia mandates vigilant antepartum surveillance with maternal blood pressure control, fetal growth and Doppler assessment, and timely delivery planning; antenatal corticosteroids for preterm gestations, magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection in appropriate contexts, and neonatal readiness for resuscitation and therapeutic hypothermia are key mitigation strategies, and these align with contemporary guidelines emphasizing risk stratification and coordinated maternal–neonatal care in hypertensive pregnancies [^114m7YVf] [^112641ko] [^117R83wK].

Maternal hypertension and preeclampsia are **major causes of neonatal hypoxia** due to placental hypoperfusion and uteroplacental insufficiency [^113SWXu1] [^111jUr35]. This hypoxia increases the risk of neonatal complications, including HIE, RDS, and neurodevelopmental impairment [^112bXPxo] [^115Gx1Ln] [^117QMNpM]. The risk is highest with **early-onset preeclampsia** and severe hypertension, and is further amplified by placental abruption and FGR [^113SWXu1] [^111jjH6b]. Early recognition, close monitoring, and timely delivery are essential to reduce neonatal hypoxic injury [^111jjH6b].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking maternal hypertension and preeclampsia to neonatal hypoxia

Maternal hypertension and preeclampsia cause neonatal hypoxia primarily through **placental hypoperfusion and uteroplacental insufficiency** [^114mCLDF]:

- **Placental hypoperfusion**: Inadequate trophoblast invasion and failed spiral artery remodeling restrict maternal blood flow to the placenta, causing chronic hypoxia and nutrient deprivation for the fetus [^1163uBFY] [^115kYdbX].

- **Uteroplacental insufficiency**: Reduced perfusion leads to fetal growth restriction (FGR), increased umbilical artery resistance, and compromised oxygen delivery [^112zJzJR].

- **Placental abruption**: Hypertension increases the risk of abruption, causing acute placental separation and sudden fetal hypoxia [^1118bgse].

- **Angiogenic imbalance**: Elevated sFlt-1 and reduced PlGF drive maternal endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and further placental hypoperfusion [^112A3cyH] [^112SjG4Z].

## Clinical evidence of neonatal hypoxia associated with maternal hypertension and preeclampsia

Multiple studies document increased neonatal hypoxia with maternal hypertension and preeclampsia:

| **Study** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| High-altitude cohort (Bolivia) | Preeclampsia augmented fetal hypoxia (higher cord EPO, lower pH) and increased neonatal pulmonary hypertension risk [^114eHiyv] |
| California cohort (≥ 36 weeks) | Hypertensive disorders increased HIE risk (aOR 1.26); antenatal magnesium sulfate reduced HIE by 29% [^117R83wK] |
| PURPOSe study (South Asia) | Intrauterine hypoxia was the most common pathway to preterm neonatal death; hypertension was a leading maternal cause [^111jjH6b] |
| Preterm cohort study | HDP exposure linked to adverse cognitive/language outcomes at 2 years, mediated by brain abnormalities on MRI [^117QMNpM] |

---

## Neonatal complications associated with hypoxia due to maternal hypertension and preeclampsia

Neonatal hypoxia from maternal hypertension or preeclampsia leads to **significant morbidity**:

- **Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)**: Brain injury from oxygen deprivation, with risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment [^112bXPxo].

- **Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)**: Common in preterm infants exposed to maternal hypertension [^115Gx1Ln].

- **Neonatal thrombocytopenia**: Linked to chronic fetal hypoxia from pregnancy-induced hypertension [^111LMT4n].

- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Higher risks of cognitive and language deficits in exposed preterm infants [^117QMNpM].

---

## Risk factors and severity indicators

Certain factors heighten the risk and severity of neonatal hypoxia in the setting of maternal hypertension or preeclampsia:

- **Early-onset preeclampsia**: Strongly associated with placental insufficiency and severe neonatal outcomes [^115bkHR1].

- **Severity of hypertension**: Higher blood pressures correlate with greater placental hypoperfusion and fetal compromise [^1118bgse].

- **Presence of FGR**: Indicates chronic hypoxia and increases neonatal risk [^114eHiyv].

- **Placental abruption**: Acute hypoxia from placental separation [^112bXPxo].

---

## Clinical management and prevention strategies

Effective management centers on **close maternal-fetal monitoring**, strict blood pressure control, and timely delivery when indicated [^114m7YVf]. Antenatal magnesium sulfate provides fetal neuroprotection and reduces HIE risk in hypertensive pregnancies [^117R83wK]. Low-dose aspirin is recommended for preeclampsia prevention in high-risk women to reduce preterm birth and related hypoxic complications [^116YvFFn].

---

Maternal hypertension and preeclampsia are **major causes of neonatal hypoxia** through placental hypoperfusion and uteroplacental insufficiency, leading to significant neonatal morbidity. Early detection, careful monitoring, and timely intervention are critical to mitigating hypoxic injury.

Purpose

One of the most common, and most vexing, obstetric complications is preeclampsia-a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity. Hallmarked by new-onset hypertension and a myriad of other symptoms, the underlying cause of the disorder remains obscure despite intensive research into its etiology. Although the initiating events are not clear, one common finding in preeclamptic patients is failure to remodel the maternal arteries that supply the placenta, with resulting hypoxia/ischemia. Intensive research over the past 2 decades has identified several categories of molecular dysfunction resulting from placental hypoxia, which, when released into the maternal circulation, are involved in the spectrum of symptoms seen in these patients-in particular, angiogenic imbalance and the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Despite these new insights, little in the way of new treatments for the management of these patients has been advanced into clinical practice. Indeed, few therapeutic options exist for the obstetrician treating a case of preeclampsia. Pharmacologic management is typically seizure prophylaxis, and, in severe cases, antihypertensive agents for controlling worsening hypertension. Ultimately, the induction of labor is indicated, making preeclampsia a leading cause of premature birth. Here, the molecular mechanisms linking placental ischemia to the maternal symptoms of preeclampsia are reviewed, and several areas of recent research suggesting new potential therapeutic approaches to the management of preeclampsia are identified.

### Preeclampsia: short-term and long-term implications [^116DUzVh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder that affects 4% of pregnancies and has a high risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term cardiovascular risk. Recent updates in the definition, diagnosis, and management guidelines for preeclampsia warrant review by general obstetrician-gynecologists. Screening and prevention algorithms for preeclampsia are available, but ultimately the cure remains delivery of the fetus and placenta. Close monitoring for the development and worsening of preeclampsia during pregnancy is essential to optimize both maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^111j4suw]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The condition presents heterogeneously at varying gestational ages. Primary prevention for preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin is recommended for patients with clinical risk factors. Despite extensive research, there is no clearly defined pathophysiology for preeclampsia or treatment for preeclampsia besides delivery of the placenta. Delivery of patients with preeclampsia without severe features is indicated in the early term period at 37 weeks' gestation and sooner if the patient develops severe preeclampsia. Management of preterm preeclampsia is guided by close assessment of the status of the pregnant woman and fetus, blood pressure control, and surveillance for any clinical progression to a more severe form of preeclampsia that may require preterm delivery. In a preterm gestation affected by preeclampsia, expectant management is intended to provide neonatal benefit though it does assume some maternal risk. Future research will hopefully further delineate the pathophysiology of the condition with the ultimate goal of finding a treatment to avoid associated morbidity and preterm delivery.

### Effects of pregnancy-induced hypertension on early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia [^111LMT4n]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thrombocytopenia is linked to an increased risk of bleeding, including life-threatening bleeding in vital organs, in neonates. The incidence of thrombocytopenia in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can range from 22–35%.

Chronic fetal hypoxia resulting from pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is the primary cause of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia within 72 h after birth. PIH comprises gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia, which can cause an imbalance in the blood systems of mothers and neonates. Approximately 10–50% of gestational hypertension cases progress to preeclampsia after 1–5 weeks, and progression to preeclampsia may be faster when diagnosed before 32 weeks of gestation.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia may have similar pathophysiological processes. The incidence of early-onset thrombocytopenia in neonates born to mothers with preeclampsia is approximately 9.2–36%, which is significantly higher than that in newborns of normotensive mothers. Therefore, we hypothesized that maternal gestational hypertension impacts the incidence of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia.

Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the data of neonates born to mothers with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, as well as healthy mothers, who were admitted to our hospital within 72 h of birth to compare the incidence of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia among the three groups. Furthermore, we assessed whether maternal gestational hypertension may increase the incidence of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia.

### Vascular disorders of pregnancy increase susceptibility to neonatal pulmonary hypertension in high-altitude populations [^114eHiyv]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction increase cardiopulmonary disease risk for affected offspring and occur more frequently at high-altitude (≥ 2500 m). Retrospective studies indicate that birth to a preeclampsia woman at high altitude increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in later life. This prospective study asked whether preeclampsia with or without fetal growth restriction exaggerated fetal hypoxia and impaired angiogenesis in the fetal lung, leading to neonatal cardiopulmonary circulation abnormalities and neonatal or infantile PH.

Methods and Results

We studied 79 maternal-infant pairs (39 preeclampsia, 40 controls) in Bolivia (3600–4100 m). Cord blood erythropoietin, hemoglobin, and umbilical artery and venous blood gases were measured as indices of fetal hypoxia. Maternal and cord plasma levels of angiogenic (VEGF [vascular endothelial growth factor]) and antiangiogenic (sFlt1 [soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase]) factors were determined. Postnatal echocardiography (1 week and 6–9 months) assessed pulmonary hemodynamics and PH. Preeclampsia augmented fetal hypoxia and increased the risk of PH in the neonate but not later in infancy. Pulmonary abnormalities were confined to preeclampsia cases with fetal growth restriction. Maternal and fetal plasma sFlt1 levels were higher in preeclampsia than controls and positively associated with PH.

Conclusions

The effect of preeclampsia with fetal growth restriction to increase fetal hypoxia and sFlt1 levels may impede normal development of the pulmonary circulation at high altitude, leading to adverse neonatal pulmonary vascular outcomes. Our observations highlight important temporal windows for the prevention of pulmonary vascular disease among babies born to highland residents or those with exaggerated hypoxia in utero or newborn life.

### Multi-omic insights of preeclampsia and cardiovascular health outcomes [^115kYdbX]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia (PE) is a multisystem pregnancy disorder, complicating 3–5% of all pregnancies. It is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal morbidity, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Manifesting after the 20th week of gestation, PE is characterised by the emergence of new-onset hypertension, defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater and a diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg, accompanied by proteinuria, which refers to high levels of protein in the urine, or other indicators of end-organ dysfunction. Consequently, careful monitoring and management are essential to mitigate risk to both maternal and foetal health. Accordingly, PE is commonly classified by onset timing into early- (< 34 weeks of gestation; EO-PE) and late- (> 34 weeks of gestation; LO-PE) onset PE to estimate outcomes and associated risk factors. While this distinction captures key clinical features, it fails to reflect the underlying biological complexity. In EO-PE, the placenta seems to play a critical role since disrupted remodelling of the spiral arteries causes placental hypoperfusion and hypoxia, which induces oxidative stress, triggering a heightened systemic inflammatory response. Subsequently, endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction develop, contributing to the onset of systemic hypertension and end-organ hypoperfusion. As a consequence, there's a release of a variety of anti-angiogenic factors, substances that inhibit the formation of new blood vessels, including soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin and other cytokines and oxidants. Despite its relevance, this model does not fully capture the full spectrum of PE, particularly in LO-PE cases where maternal factors are considered to be the primary drivers of the disease. Apart from impaired placental function, various mechanisms such as angiogenic imbalance, oxidative stress, immunological causes, maternal metabolic statusand inadequate cardiovascular adaptation, underlie its pathogenesis. Its heterogeneous nature additionally complicates both diagnosis and management. PE can persist after the delivery of the placenta, including the development of de novo postpartum PE, further highlighting the inadequacy of a timing-based framework.

### Sildenafil for the treatment of preeclampsia, an update: should we still be enthusiastic? [^112A3cyH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and the clinical manifestation of severe endothelial dysfunction associated with maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality. The primum movens of the disease is the defect of invasion of the uterine arteries by foetal syncytiotrophoblasts, which causes a maladaptive placental response to chronic hypoxia and the secretion of the soluble form of type 1 vascular growth endothelial factor receptor, also called soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), the major player in the pathophysiology of the disease. Among its different effects, sFlt-1 induces abnormal sensitivity of the maternal vessels to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. This leads to the hypertensive phenotype, recently shown to be abrogated by the administration of sildenafil citrate, which can potentiate the vasodilatory mediator nitrite oxide. This review focuses on the mechanisms of maternal endothelial dysfunction in preeclampsia and discusses the therapeutic window of sildenafil use in the context of preeclampsia, based on the results from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Safety issues recently reported in neonates have considerably narrowed this window.

### Preeclampsia as a cause of preterm and late preterm (near-term) births [^116dHA4K]. Seminars in Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Gestational hypertension-preeclampsia is the most common medical disorder of pregnancy. It is also a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidities. The majority of adverse pregnancy outcomes occur in patients who develop severe hypertension or severe preeclampsia, and in those who develop the clinical manifestations before 34 weeks' gestation. There is some concern regarding neonatal morbidity in the late preterm (near term) infant (34 0/7 through 36 6/7 weeks' gestation) as a result of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. A review of the available data suggests that most deliveries of the late preterm infant in such women are justified because of the concerns about maternal and fetal safety with continued gestation. In addition, the rate of preterm delivery at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation in women with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia is low. Indeed, most admissions to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in such pregnancies occur in those at ≥ 37 weeks' gestation. There is urgent need for research to assess the reasons behind preterm delivery at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation in women with hypertension and preeclampsia. In addition, there is need for research to assess the reasons for admission to the NICU in term infants born of mothers with varying severities of hypertension and preeclampsia. In this paper, the phrase "late-preterm" has been used instead of "near term", as the former was considered more appropriate to reflect this subgroup of preterm infants in a workshop on this topic held in July 2005, organized by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

### Diagnosis and management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia [^113AtNRe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are common disorders during pregnancy, with the majority of cases developing at or near term. The development of mild hypertension or preeclampsia at or near term is associated with minimal maternal and neonatal morbidities. In contrast, the onset of severe gestational hypertension and/or severe preeclampsia before 35 weeks' gestation is associated with significant maternal and perinatal complications. Women with diagnosed gestational hypertension-preeclampsia require close evaluation of maternal and fetal conditions for the duration of pregnancy, and those with severe disease should be managed in-hospital. The decision between delivery and expectant management depends on fetal gestational age, fetal status, and severity of maternal condition at time of evaluation. Expectant management is possible in a select group of women with severe preeclampsia before 32 weeks' gestation. Steroids are effective in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity when administered to those with severe disease between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation. Magnesium sulfate should be used during labor and for at least 24 hours postpartum to prevent seizures in all women with severe disease. There is an urgent need to conduct randomized trials to determine the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive drugs in women with mild hypertension-preeclampsia. There is also a need to conduct a randomized trial to determine the benefits and risks of magnesium sulfate during labor and postpartum in women with mild preeclampsia.

### Hypertensive emergencies of pregnancy [^1118bgse]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Hypertension is commonly encountered in pregnancy and has both maternal and fetal effects. Acute hypertensive crisis most commonly occurs in severe preeclampsia and is associated with maternal stroke, cardiopulmonary decompensation, fetal decompensation due to decreased uterine perfusion, abruption, and stillbirth. Immediate stabilization of the mother including the use of intervenous antihypertensives is required and often delivery is indicated. With appropriate management, maternal and fetal outcomes can be excellent.

### Effects of pregnancy-induced hypertension on early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia [^111zApjJ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings revealed a significantly higher incidence of early-onset thrombocytopenia in neonates born to mothers with PIH than those born to healthy mothers. Notably, neonates born to mothers with preeclampsia were at a significantly higher risk of thrombocytopenia than those born to mothers with gestational hypertension and normotensive mothers. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal gestational hypertension is associated with an increased incidence of early-onset neonatal thrombocytopenia.

The incidence of thrombocytopenia in neonates born to mothers with gestational hypertension was 13.3%, which is similar to that reported in previous studies (6.7–11.1%). However, the precise mechanism by which maternal gestational hypertension increases neonatal thrombocytopenia remains unclear. However, an association between neonatal thrombocytopenia and placental lesions is linked to poor maternal perfusion or affects fetal vasculature.

Angiogenic imbalance is the main pathological feature in mothers with hypertension. Although this condition is less severe in gestational hypertension than in preeclampsia, gestational hypertension is still associated with placental hypoperfusion. Based on the limited literature, we inferred that fetal hypoxia caused by maternal gestational hypertension affects megakaryocyte and platelet production; however, further studies are required to elucidate this mechanism.

### Maternal and neonatal outcomes in gestational hypertension for delivery at 37 versus 38 to 40 weeks [^112hQmo1]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare neonatal and maternal outcomes for mothers with gestational hypertension delivered at 37 weeks' gestation compared with 38 to 40 weeks. Single-center, retrospective chart review of women with gestational hypertension delivered between 37 0/7 and 40 6/7 weeks' gestation over a 29-month period. A total of 337 mother-infant dyads with gestational hypertension were included: 194 delivered at 37 weeks' gestation (cohort 1) and 143 delivered at 38 to 40 weeks' gestation (cohort 2). Preeclampsia developed in 12% of cohort 1 and 8% of cohort 2 (p = 0.242). No significant differences in severe hypertensive-related complications were found between the cohorts. Neonatal outcomes including neonatal intensive care unit admission, respiratory support, phototherapy, and length of stay were all more frequent in cohort 1. For women with gestational hypertension, delivery at 38 to 40 weeks was not associated with increased maternal complications but was associated with fewer neonatal complications when compared with delivery at 37 weeks. · Gestational hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy. · Mothers with gestational hypertension are often induced early. · Neonatal adverse outcomes increase with early delivery. · Optimal timing of delivery for pregnancies complicated by gestational hypertension is unknown.

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^114J6jbA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition and classification of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

During pregnancy, hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg. Severe hypertension is defined as systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mmHg. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have endorsed a lower threshold for diagnosing hypertension in non‐pregnant patients (systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg). Some have suggested that this definition may also be appropriate for pregnant patients. However, use of the lower threshold has not been widely studied, would increase the incidence of hypertension in pregnancy by about 10%, and could increase potentially unnecessary testing, hospitalization, and intervention in the absence of a proven benefit. The clinical importance of distinguishing preeclampsia from other HDP, namely, chronic and gestational hypertension, relates to its greater risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Traditional and revised definition of preeclampsia

The traditional definition of preeclampsia refers to the new onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation or postpartum. However, it is well recognized that many women with chronic or gestational hypertension still suffer from complications associated with preeclampsia such as pulmonary oedema, placental abruption, preterm delivery, perinatal death, small‐for‐gestational‐age infants, and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.

To better reflect the risk of adverse pregnancy complications among women with a HDP, the definition of preeclampsia has been revised to include cases without proteinuria but with evidence of maternal end‐organ or uteroplacental dysfunction. This 'broad' definition has now been adopted by most national and international clinical practice guidelines. Several subtypes of preeclampsia exist (Table 1), with a variety of pathophysiological pathways leading to maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity. The clinical features overlap, but the spectrum of disease and outcomes differ: early‐onset disease has been associated with poorer severe placental and maternal/foetal outcomes.

### Genome-scale hypomethylation in the cord blood DNAs associated with early onset preeclampsia [^115bkHR1]. Clinical Epigenetics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg) and proteinuria (> 0.3 g/day). It affects 5% to 8% of all pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of fetal/neonatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia may develop at any time after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and depending on the time of the onset of symptoms (earlier or later than 34 weeks), it can be categorized as early onset preeclampsia (EOPE) or late onset preeclampsia (LOPE). Although EOPE and LOPE share some clinical symptoms, they have distinct etiologies, biochemical markers, and maternal and fetal outcomes. EOPE is considered a more severe, mostly fetal disorder, and it is typically associated with inadequate placental implantation and subsequent placental dysfunction, intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight, and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including perinatal death. By contrast, LOPE is considered a maternal disorder often associated with a normal placenta, larger placental volume, normal fetal growth, and favorable maternal and fetal outcomes. In this study, we focus on EOPE given its severity.

The etiology of EOPE is unknown. It is hypothesized that the process is initiated by the shallow implantation of the placenta into the uterine wall. During normal pregnancy, extravillous trophoblasts remodel the spiral arteries in the decidua lining during the formation of the maternal placenta. However, in EOPE, such remodeling is incomplete, leading to poor placental development and function. The incompletely transformed spiral arteries are unable to provide an adequate blood supply to the placenta, resulting in ischemia and hypoxic conditions, which further lead to inflammatory stress, apoptosis, and other phenomena in the trophoblasts. In mothers, the pathological manifestations of these conditions include hypertension, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, seizures, acute atherosis, renal failure, and proteinuria. Whereas in the fetus, the consequences include intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery with associated issues such as neurodevelopmental disorders and long-term adult onset disorders including diabetes, congestive heart failure, and hypertension.

### Preeclampsia: pathophysiology, old and new strategies for management [^11349VUF]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia continues to be a leading cause of maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is defined as hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks' gestation, which resolves after delivery. It is complicated by intracerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary oedema and respiratory and hepatic failure, which form the commonest causes of death. There is a genetic and immunological element to the pathophysiology of the disease, which is still not completely understood, but the underlying cause is an abnormality of placentation and placental hypoxia. This is thought to result in an imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins that leads to systemic endothelial disruption and multiorgan involvement. Successful treatment requires delivery of the placenta and management should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team, aiming primarily to stabilise the condition of the mother before delivery is contemplated. Guidelines and protocols all have common management goals which are to treat hypertension, prevent seizures, control fluid intake and optimise the timing of delivery. Hypertension can be treated with a range of antihypertensive drugs, but labetalol is regarded as first-line therapy. Magnesium sulphate is the treatment of choice for eclampsia because it reduces the risk of seizures by more than 50%. A fluid restriction policy should be used to prevent iatrogenic pulmonary oedema. Effective anaesthetic management relies on neuraxial techniques. Epidural, combined spinal-epidural and single-shot spinal anaesthetic techniques are all perfectly acceptable and should be actively promoted to the mother unless contraindications such as thrombocytopaenia exist.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 202: gestational hypertension and preeclampsia [^115qGE7L]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. It has been estimated that preeclampsia complicates 2–8% of pregnancies globally (). In Latin America and the Caribbean, hypertensive disorders are responsible for almost 26% of maternal deaths, whereas in Africa and Asia they contribute to 9% of deaths. Although maternal mortality is much lower in high-income countries than in developing countries, 16% of maternal deaths can be attributed to hypertensive disorders (). In the United States, the rate of preeclampsia increased by 25% between 1987 and 2004 (). Moreover, in comparison with women giving birth in 1980, those giving birth in 2003 were at 6.7-fold increased risk of severe preeclampsia (). This complication is costly: one study reported that in 2012 in the United States, the estimated cost of preeclampsia within the first 12 months of delivery was $2.18 billion ($1.03 billion for women and $1.15 billion for infants), which was disproportionately borne by premature births (). This Practice Bulletin will provide guidelines for the diagnosis and management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder that affects 3% to 8% of pregnancies and remains a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. In the United States, it is the third leading cause of maternal death, and worldwide > 70 thousand pregnant individuals die from preeclampsia-related causes each year. Recent data suggest that preeclampsia contributes to racial and ethnic disparities, with Black pregnant individuals 2 to 3× more likely to die from preeclampsia compared with White individuals. –

Preeclampsia is traditionally diagnosed using the criteria of hypertension along with proteinuria, or in the absence of the latter, clinical symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, or evidence of end-organ injury. Although hypertension is a hallmark of preeclampsia, other hypertensive diseases also can occur during pregnancy and must be differentiated in order for appropriate management to occur. Relying on clinical criteria is suboptimal mainly because obtaining blood pressure and proteinuria is subject to errors during collection (cuff size, position, activity) and can fluctuate during the observation period, and relying on maternal symptoms may be problematic in clinical practice because of their subjective nature. Because the specificity of these criteria is poor, pregnant individuals in whom there is a suspicion for preeclampsia — but who may not actually have it — may be admitted for monitoring and delivered prematurely.

While the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is not completely understood, it is thought to be related to impaired early placental development, – with associated abnormalities in angiogenesis, endothelial and hypoxic injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation.– These derangements ultimately lead to the clinical manifestations of the disease. Based on these pathophysiologic pathways, a molecular assay was developed by Progenity, Inc, intended to be used as an aid to rule-out preeclampsia. It includes 8 markers associated with angiogenic imbalance (free and total placental growth factor, soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1, soluble endoglin), placental and trophoblast dysfunction (fibroblast growth factor-21 and decorin), hypoxia (kidney injury molecule-1), and inflammation and immune regulation (cluster of differentiation-274, or PD-L1 [programmed death-ligand 1]).

The objective of this study was to validate the assay and characterize its performance, when intended for use as an aid to rule-out preeclampsia in pregnant individuals presenting with preeclampsia-associated signs and symptoms between 28 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks.

### Preeclampsia: recent insights [^116473s5]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication with serious consequences for mother and infant. The disorder is diagnosed by gestational hypertension and proteinuria but is far more than pregnancy induced hypertension. Preeclampsia is proposed to occur in 2 stages. Stage 1 reduced placental perfusion is postulated as the root cause and to lead to the maternal syndrome, Stage 2. Why perfusion is reduced, how this translates to a maternal disease in some but not all women and what is the linkage of the 2 stages are topics of intense study. In the last decade such studies have provided valuable insights into pathophysiology that now guide ongoing clinical trials.

### Knowledge of preeclampsia and its associated factors among pregnant women: a possible link to reduce related adverse outcomes [^112TD8zB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-associated multisystem disorder with no definite aetiology. The primary cause of PE is still under investigation. However, it is thought to occur in two stages. The first stage encompass the impairment of fetal trophoblastic invasion of the decidua and local placental hypoxia. The second stage is the release of placental blood-related factors into the maternal circulation and aberrant expression of pro-inflammatory, antiangiogenic and angiogenic factors.

PE is usually characterized by elevated blood pressure and proteinuria, with the clinical manifestation usually occurring during the 20th week of gestation or late in pregnancy and regressing post-delivery. It is grouped into two main types: early-onset PE (occurring before 34 weeks of gestation) and late-onset PE (occurring after 34 weeks of gestation). Although the presenting features of early- and late-onset PE may overlap, early-onset PE is associated with increased odds of complications, particularly preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and maternal morbidity and mortality compared to late onset PE. Women with PE also present with diverse signs and symptoms associated with multiple organ systems. Headaches, visual disturbances, abnormal kidney function, severe hypertension, chest pain, pulmonary oedema and low oxygen saturation, nausea and abnormal liver function are among the common outcomes of the multi-organ system dysfunction in PE. Risk factors of PE include first pregnancy, age (pregnancy at an advanced age or under 18 years of age), family history of PE, personal history of PE, obesity, gestational diabetes, multifetal gestation and preexisting medical conditions such as chronic hypertension.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and neonatal outcomes among women with chronic hypertension [^11146yeL]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with chronic hypertension by maternal race and ethnicity.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of women with chronic hypertension was performed from the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002–2008). Maternal self-reported race and ethnicity were analyzed as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic. Maternal outcomes included cesarean birth, postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, placental abruption, eclampsia, maternal intensive care unit admission, and death. Neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA), 5-minute Apgar < 7, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intraventricular hemorrhage, neonatal intensive care unit admission, sepsis, and death. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to examine the association between maternal race and ethnicity and perinatal outcomes.

Results

A total of 2,729 women were included. In unadjusted analysis, non-Hispanic White women had higher rates of placental abruption and Hispanic women had higher rates of placental abruption and eclampsia. In multivariable analysis, non-Hispanic Black continued to have higher odds of placental abruption (adjusted odds ratio 4.16, 95% confidence interval 1.29–18.70), but the rest of the maternal outcomes did not differ between the groups. When comparing neonatal outcomes, PTB, SGA, and LBW were more frequent in, 5-minute Apgar < 7 non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women compared with non-Hispanic White women. In addition, 5-minute Apgar < 7 and neonatal sepsis were more frequent in non-Hispanic Black neonates and neonatal death was more frequent in Hispanic neonates compared with non-Hispanic White women. In multivariable regression, neonates of non-Hispanic Black women had higher odds of PTB, SGA, LBW, 5-minute Apgar < 7, and sepsis compared with non-Hispanic White women. Similarly, neonates of Hispanic women had higher odds of SGA, LBW, and death.

Conclusion

Significant racial and ethnic disparities were identified mainly in neonatal outcomes of women with chronic hypertension.

Key Points

· Non-Hispanic Black women with chronic hypertension had higher rates of placental abruption. · Neonates of non-Hispanic Black women with chronic hypertension had higher odds of PTB, SGA, and LBW. · Neonates of Hispanic women with chronic hypertension had higher odds of SGA, LBW, and neonatal death.

### Association between late pregnancy prehypertension and adverse outcomes among newborns of women delivered at a tertiary hospital in Eastern Uganda: a prospective cohort study [^114JMM6U]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), affecting about 5–10% of all pregnancies worldwide significantly lead to unacceptable mortality and morbidity for the mother, fetus, and the newborn, and despite multiple advances in obstetric care, HDP are second only to obstetric hemorrhage in causing maternal mortality, accounting for upto 16% of mothers dying due to pregnancy-related complications in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Prehypertension in pregnancy, referred to as elevated blood pressure (BP) 120–139/80–89 mmHg affects about 11% of all pregnancies but its prevalence varies across regions (Japan – 14.98%, United States – 23.75–61.27%, Sweden – 11.89%) and is currently not included in the HDP. Emerging evidence over the last decade has however shown that it significantly leads to adverse neonatal outcomes. The Joint National Committee 8 (JNC 8) clearly states that identifying prehypertension cases enables starting of preventive measures earlier as these cases are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. No published studies on the Ugandan burden of pregnancy prehypertension exists currently.

The exact mechanism for development of pregnancy prehypertension and its associated adverse outcomes is not clearly studied but some studies suggest a similar mechanism to pathophysiology of currently described HDP, that is, endothelial cell injury with vasospasm following a myriad of factors ranging from abnormal placentation, nutrient deficiencies, imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, genetic influence, and hypoxic states in the mother due to various medical and immunological conditions leading to maladaptation to pregnancy physiology and reduced placental function, hence adverse outcomes to both the mother, the fetus, and the newborn child.

Late pregnancy prehypertension is significantly linked with adverse neonatal outcomes including a 59% increase in Small-for-Gestational (SGA), a 70% rise in stillbirths, increased risks for NICU admission, low birth weight, neonatal morbidity and mortality, as well as adverse maternal outcomes like a 4.4 fold risk for developing preeclampsia/eclampsia syndrome in the current pregnancy.

### A cross sectional study to assess the sFlt-1: PlGF ratio in pregnant women with and without preeclampsia [^11119YVx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by the new onset of hypertension (above 140/ 90 mmHg) and proteinuria (0.3 g in a 24 h urine sample) occurring after 20 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both the mother and fetus. The maternal complications that can occur during pregnancy are oliguric renal failure, oligohydramnios, placental disruption, eclampsia, HELLP (Hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme and low platelet syndrome) and preterm labour. Similarly, postpartum hemorrhage and puerperal sepsis can occur as complications after labour. Complications in the fetus and neonate are related to severity and duration of preeclampsia and include prematurity, fetal growth restriction, intrauterine fetal death and asphyxia. Maternal symptoms of preeclampsia subside after delivery.

The underlying pathophysiology of preeclampsia involves endothelial dysfunction and vasospasm originating primarily in the placenta. The abnormal development of blood vessels in placenta results in its under perfusion. This relative hypoxic condition in placenta causes release of antiangiogenic factors into the maternal blood circulation which leads to the alteration of maternal systemic endothelial function and causes hypertension.

### Understanding preeclampsia from cutting edge knowledge-protecting maternal and fetal health [^111fxxBR]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia (PE) is conventionally been defined clinically by new-onset or aggravating hypertension during pregnancy > 20 weeks associated with proteinuria or other organ damages. PE is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality globally and expected to increase even more. Nevertheless, there are still much to be established regarding pathophysiology, prediction, prevention, and management of PE and thus, research concerning PE is being actively conducted. This mini-review discusses on latest knowledge on PE.

### Multi-organ phenotypes of offspring born following hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: a systematic review [^117Pyzt8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy represent a spectrum of pregnancy complications, including chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, and the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. These disorders affect 5.2% to 8.2% of all pregnancies globally. Hypertensive pregnancies are associated with multi‐organ changesand increased risks of cardiac and cerebrovascular disease later in life in the mother. Recent evidence suggests their offspring also have a 26% increased risk for all‐cause mortality. Adult offspring of hypertensive pregnancies have both an increased cardiovascular riskin later life and higher risk for neurological diseases. Events in utero, including hypertensive pregnancies, influence fetal development with long‐term health consequences that may persist after birth.

Hypertensive pregnancies are multifactorial diseases, caused by genetic and environmental factors and the interplay of these factors between the mother, placenta, and fetus. Transcriptomic studies have revealed that the placenta has specific molecular subtypes: (1) a "canonical" subtype in typical preeclamptic pathways, involving altered secretion and hypoxia, (2) an "immune" subtype representing immune response genes related to poor placental immune tolerance and infectious pathology, and (3) a "maternal" subtype with normal placental gene expression that might be related to maternal cardiovascular dysfunction. This placental insufficiency contributes to the adverse intrauterine environment and affects fetal developmental programming, though the unique impact on fetal physiology of the placental molecular subtypes remains unknown.

Developmental programming in fetuses of hypertensive pregnancies is also affected by the modification of enzymes, transcription factors, oxidative stress markers, methylation, and DNA histone modification. Alterations specific to the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) may play an important role in fetal programming of cardiovascular diseases and hypertension in offspring from hypertensive pregnancies, with evidence that epigenetic changes to RAAS genes contribute to hypertension in the offspring later in life. An exaggerated inflammatory response leading to endothelial dysfunction is also a known pathophysiologic mechanism in hypertensive pregnancies, particularly in preeclampsia, that may affect fetal developmental programmingand influence the offspring's future health.

A narrative review of preclinical studies revealed that offspring of hypertensive pregnancies have cardiac structural and functional changes compared with offspring of normotensive pregnancies. In 5‐month‐old rodent models, corresponding to adult age rats, in utero exposure to hypoxia resulted in cardiac hypertrophy and higher expression of collagen I and II in the offspring's left ventricle (LV) with a normal size of cardiomyocytes. Hypertensive pregnancies are also associated with altered endothelial functionand systemic microvasculature changesthat may impact LV afterload and contribute to increased LV mass (LVM).

### Hypertension in pregnancy: taking cues from pathophysiology for clinical practice [^111boRLF]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pregnancy-related hypertension (PHTN) syndromes are a frequent and potentially deadly complication of pregnancy, while also negatively impacting the lifelong health of the mother and child. PHTN appears in women likely to develop hypertension later in life, with the stress of pregnancy unmasking a subclinical hypertensive phenotype. However, distinguishing between PHTN and chronic hypertension is essential for optimal management. Preeclampsia (PE) is linked to potentially severe outcomes and lacks effective treatments due to poorly understood mechanisms. Inadequate remodeling of spiral uterine arteries (SUAs), the cornerstone of PE pathophysiology, leads to hypoperfusion of the developing placenta. In normal pregnancies, extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells assume an invasive phenotype and invade SUAs, transforming them into large conduits. Decidual natural killer cells play an essential role, mediating materno-fetal immune tolerance, inducing early SUA remodeling and regulating EVT invasiveness. Notch signaling is important in EVT phenotypic switch and is dysregulated in PE. The hypoxic placenta releases antiangiogenic and proinflammatory factors that converge upon maternal endothelium, inducing endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and organ damage. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α is upstream of such molecules, whereas endothelin-1 is a major effector. We also describe important genetic links and evidence of incomplete materno-fetal immune tolerance, with PE patients presenting with autoantibodies, lower T reg, and higher T h 17 cells. Thus, PE manifestations arise as a consequence of mal-placentation or/and because of a predisposition of the maternal vascular bed to excessively react to pathogenic molecules. From this pathophysiological basis, we provide current and propose future therapeutic directions for PE.

### Evaluating the maternal and perinatal sequelae of severe gestational hypertension [^114yHPyW]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are widespread and have long-standing implications for women's health. Historically, the management of "severe gestational hypertension", or the presence of severely elevated blood pressures without any other signs or symptoms of end-organ damage meeting the criteria for preeclampsia, has been unclear. The new American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines based on expert opinion recommend that severe gestational hypertension be treated similarly to preeclampsia with severe features, but data regarding outcomes for women with this diagnosis have been limited.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the maternal and perinatal sequelae of severe gestational hypertension with that of other types of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

Study Design

This is a retrospective cohort study of women with hypertensive disease of pregnancy who delivered at a single tertiary care center between February and December 2018. Women with chronic hypertension; hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; preexisting kidney, liver, rheumatologic, or hematologic disorders; or multifetal pregnancies were excluded. Women were categorized as having severe gestational hypertension if they had a sustained systolic blood pressure of > 160 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of > 110 mm Hg without other criteria for preeclampsia. The primary comparison was between women with severe gestational hypertension and women with preeclampsia without severe features. Secondary comparisons included women with severe gestational hypertension vs women with other types of hypertensive disease of pregnancy. The primary outcome for this analysis was small-for-gestational-age birth. We also evaluated other maternal and neonatal morbidities including but not limited to pulmonary embolism, stroke, eclampsia, blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, death, 5-minute Apgar score of ≤ 4, umbilical cord pH, neonatal intensive care unit admission of > 2 days, respiratory distress syndrome, and neonatal death. Bivariate analyses using chi-square tests and logistic regressions adjusting for race, ethnicity, age, body mass index, parity, and insurance status were performed to compare frequencies of outcomes for each type of hypertensive disease of pregnancy with those of severe gestational hypertension.

Results

Of 2076 women eligible for inclusion, 12.2% (n = 254) had severe gestational hypertension and 379 (18.2%) had preeclampsia without severe features. Although there was no difference in the odds of small-for-gestational-age birth between women with severe gestational hypertension and women with preeclampsia without severe features (14.7% vs 9.8%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.44–1.21), the latter were significantly less likely to receive a prescription for antihypertensive medication at discharge (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.06–0.22) or to be readmitted postpartum (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04–0.50).

Conclusion

There was no difference in the primary outcome, that is, rate of small-for-gestational-age birth, between women with severe gestational hypertension and women with preeclampsia without severe features. However, women with severe gestational hypertension had greater odds of other maternal and neonatal morbidities than women with preeclampsia without severe features or mild gestational hypertension. These findings support recent recommendations regarding the management of women with severe gestational hypertension.

### The REVAMP study: research exploring various aspects and mechanisms in preeclampsia: study protocol [^113D2ADT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia, the most common hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria in pregnancy. The global incidence, ranges between 2 and 10% and is reported to be 8–10% in India. In developing countries, around 40–60% of maternal deaths occur due to preeclampsia. It has therefore been identified as a priority area in developing countries as per the Millennium Development Goal to reduce maternal mortality. There is considerable evidence that women with preeclampsia are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life. Furthermore, children born to mothers with preeclampsia are at an increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease and impaired cognitive function. In view of the enormity of the consequences associated with preeclampsia it is vital to understand its risk factors and underlying mechanisms that would enable appropriate intervention at specific gestational stage or earlier.

Preeclampsia is known to be associated with abnormal placentation, characterized by shallow trophoblast invasion and narrow spiral arteries, which lead to hypoxia and endothelial dysfunction. It is known that good maternal nutrition is essential for normal placental development. Any disruption during the course of implantation and development of the placenta affects its functioning and adversely influences fetal growth.

Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and their metabolites play a role in implantation and are required at various stages of placental development and function. They are involved in processes associated with placental growth and development, notably angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. LCPUFA regulate the expression of growth factors involved in placental development by modulating the activity of transcription factors like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).

### Hematological profiles of newborns of mothers with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy delivered at the university of gondar comprehensive specialized hospital: a comparative cross-sectional study [^114mCLDF]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive Disorder of Pregnancy (HDP) is a hypertensive disorder that occurs before or during the pregnancy period. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists classified HDP into chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and superimposed preeclampsia/eclampsia.

Globally, HDP is the main cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is responsible for a 10% prenatal and neonatal death rate, as well as 40–50% of low birth weight babies. According to the World Health Organization study, HDP accounts for 14% of maternal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and is the second leading cause of maternal death after hemorrhage, which accounts for 16.0% of maternal mortality. Approximately 6.07% of pregnant women in Ethiopia develop HDP.

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy result in a decline in prenatal placental perfusion with insufficient blood supply to the fetus, resulting in fetal exposure to hypoxia or oxidative stress in the placenta. In response to this stress, the hypoxic placenta releases certain vasoactive substances into the mother's blood, which alters the endothelium layer's permeability and alters the vascular response to this stress. Reduced oxygen tension triggers compensatory mechanisms that increase erythrocytes as well as an increase in erythroblasts and nucleated red blood cell (nRBC) numbers. Previous studies showed that newborns from hypertensive mothers had a higher rate of polycythemia than newborns from normotensive mothers.

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy cause neonatal neutropenia as a result, increasing the risk of nosocomial and other infections, and it has also been shown to predict sepsis independently. The possible mechanism of the HDP causing neutropenia is that the resulting uteroplacental insufficiency inhibits fetal myeloid bone marrow production, resulting in a decrease in neutrophil count.

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and their fetal hypoxia are thought to have a direct depressant effect on fetal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Newborns born to hypertensive mothers are more susceptible to bleeding disorders than newborns delivered to normotensive mothers. Neonatal thrombocytopenia affects 36% of babies born to mothers who have hypertension, which is particularly common in premature and low birth weight babies.

Maternal hypertension has a direct impact on the development of hematological abnormalities in newborns, whereas premature delivery and weight of the newborns are additional aggravating factors that affect the hematological profiles of newborns. Other factors that affect the hematological profiles of newborns are increased blood pressure, and increasing the fetus's exposure to hypertension for a long time has a great impact on the hematological profiles of newborns.

### Expectant management of mild preeclampsia versus superimposed preeclampsia up to 37 weeks [^113KPfjj]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes of expectantly managed pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia vs mild preeclampsia up to 37 weeks of gestation.

Study Design

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia or mild preeclampsia expectantly managed in the hospital from January 2008 through December 2011. The primary outcomes, adverse maternal and neonatal composite morbidities, were compared between these 2 groups. Frequency differences of maternal adverse outcomes were stratified by gestational age at delivery of < 34 and 34–36(6/7) weeks of gestation.

Results

We found no significant differences in rates of neonatal composite morbidity or latency periods between women with superimposed preeclampsia and mild preeclampsia. Adverse neonatal outcomes were significantly higher at < 34 compared to 34–36(6/7) weeks of gestation (97–98% vs 48–50%) in both cohorts. Maternal adverse composite outcome occurred more frequently in women with superimposed preeclampsia compared to mild preeclampsia (15% vs 5%; p = 0.003; relative risk, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.45–6.29).

Conclusion

Women with superimposed preeclampsia have similar neonatal outcomes but more maternal complications than women with preeclampsia without severe features who are expectantly managed < 37 weeks.

### Analysis of risk factors of preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^112zJzJR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, it has been shown that family history of preeclampsia, history of preeclampsia, pregnancy interval ≥ 10 years, and primiparity are all risk factors for developing preeclampsia. This study also found that a history of preeclampsia is a risk factor for developing preeclampsia after pregnancy in patients with primary chronic hypertension, which is consistent with previous research findings.

During a normal pregnancy, umbilical artery blood flow resistance gradually decreases with increasing gestational age, reflecting an increase in maternal-fetal blood exchange and normal fetal growth and development. Studies have shown that the umbilical artery resistance index (S/D) should be ≤ 3 after 30 weeks of gestation. This index is also a major parameter reflecting the fetal-placental circulation status and plays a role in predicting pregnancy outcomes. If this value shows no downward trend or even increases in the third trimester of pregnancy, it indicates increased blood flow resistance and increased placental perfusion pressure. This may manifest as reversed or absent umbilical artery blood flow signals, and in severe cases, it can lead to fetal hypoxia and distress.

### Analysis of risk factors of preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension and its impact on pregnancy outcomes [^114w1KZ6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic hypertension complicated by pregnancy refers to the occurrence of elevated blood pressure before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation, with no significant aggravation during pregnancy, or diagnosed as hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation while blood pressure remains elevated for 12 weeks after delivery. Studies have shown that about 6% of pregnant women in China suffer from chronic hypertension, and the number of patients is increasing worldwide. Meanwhile, the incidence of chronic hypertension complicated by pregnancy has increased by 67% in recent years according to foreign reports. Chronic hypertension complicated by pregnancy not only affects the organ function of pregnant women but also increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. A study showed that pregnant women with a history of chronic hypertension have at least a nearly 5-fold to 6-fold increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and multi-organ dysfunction than those with normal blood pressure. More studies also indicate that women with primary hypertension experience earlier and more severe maternal and fetal complications once complicated by preeclampsia after pregnancy. The previous research conducted by Bramham K et al. in the United States on 822 pregnant women with chronic hypertension already demonstrated that the potential risk of severe intrauterine hypoxia, fetal growth restriction, and even stillbirth was significantly increased in pregnant women with preeclampsia. The incidence of preeclampsia in the general Chinese pregnant population is about 3 − 5%, while the incidence of preeclampsia in pregnant women with chronic hypertension can reach 17 − 25%. In contrast, foreign studies have indicated an incidence of 13 − 40% for preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension.

### The role of statins in the prevention of preeclampsia [^115JrmXY]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a common hypertensive disorder of pregnancy associated with considerable neonatal and maternal morbidities and mortalities. However, the exact cause of preeclampsia remains unknown; it is generally accepted that abnormal placentation resulting in the release of soluble antiangiogenic factors, coupled with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, leads to systemic endothelial dysfunction and the clinical manifestations of the disease. Statins have been found to correct similar pathophysiological pathways that underlie the development of preeclampsia. Pravastatin, specifically, has been reported in various preclinical and clinical studies to reverse the pregnancy-specific angiogenic imbalance associated with preeclampsia, to restore global endothelial health, and to prevent oxidative and inflammatory injury. Human studies have found a favorable safety profile for pravastatin, and more recent evidence does not support the previous teratogenic concerns surrounding statins in pregnancy. With reassuring and positive findings from pilot studies and strong biological plausibility, statins should be investigated in large clinical randomized-controlled trials for the prevention of preeclampsia.

### Magnesium sulfate and risk of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in a high-risk cohort [^117R83wK]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy contributes to morbidity and mortality among neonates ≥ 36 weeks of gestation. Evidence of preventative antenatal treatment is limited. Magnesium sulfate has neuroprotective properties among preterm fetuses. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a risk factor for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and magnesium sulfate is recommended for maternal seizure prophylaxis among patients with preeclampsia with severe features.

Objective

(1) Determine trends in the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, antenatal magnesium sulfate, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; (2) evaluate the association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; and (3) evaluate if, among patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, the odds of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is mitigated by receipt of antenatal magnesium sulfate.

Study Design

We analyzed a prospective cohort of live births ≥ 36 weeks of gestation between 2012 and 2018 within the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative registry, linked with the California Department of Health Care Access and Information files. We used Cochran-Armitage tests to assess trends in hypertensive disorders, encephalopathy diagnoses, and magnesium sulfate utilization and compared demographic factors between patients with or without hypertensive disorders of pregnancy or treatment with magnesium sulfate. Hierarchical logistic regression models were built to explore if hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were associated with any severity and moderate/severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Separate hierarchical logistic regression models were built among those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to evaluate the association of magnesium sulfate with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

Results

Among 44,314 unique infants, the diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and the use of magnesium sulfate increased over time. Compared with patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alone, patients with hypertensive disorders treated with magnesium sulfate represented a high-risk population. They were more likely to be publicly insured, born between 36 and 38 weeks of gestation, be small for gestational age, have lower Apgar scores, require a higher level of resuscitation at delivery, have prolonged rupture of membranes, experience preterm labor and fetal distress, and undergo operative delivery (all P < .002). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26 [95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.40]; P < .001) and specifically moderate/severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (adjusted odds ratio, 1.26 [95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.42]; P < .001). Among patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, treatment with magnesium sulfate was associated with 29% reduction in the odds of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.97]; p = 0.03) and a 37% reduction in the odds of moderate/severe neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.63 [95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.94]; p = 0.03).

Conclusion

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and, specifically, moderate/severe disease. Among people with hypertensive disorders, receipt of antenatal magnesium sulfate is associated with a significant reduction in the odds of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and moderate/severe disease in a neonatal cohort admitted to neonatal intensive care unit at ≥ 36 weeks of gestation. The findings of this observational study cannot prove causality and are intended to generate hypotheses for future clinical trials on magnesium sulfate in term infants.

### Maternal gut microbiota influences immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface affecting pregnancy outcome [^1163uBFY]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, affecting 5–8% of gestations worldwide. It is clinically manifested with hypertension, proteinuria, and multi-organ dysfunction, and is associated with pregnancy-related death, spontaneous abortion, and preterm delivery. Fetal complications include fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and placental abruption, leading to significant developmental issues and even neonatal death. Despite this dramatic social and individual burden, preeclampsia can neither be reliably predicted nor effectively prevented, with preterm delivery of the baby and placenta being the only cure. The etiology of preeclampsia is complex and not completely understood.

The two-stage model of preeclampsia, as updated by Redman et al.proposes that preeclampsia develops in two distinct stages. The first stage involves poor placentation, leading to placental malperfusion, hypoxia, and oxidative stress. This stage is characterized by inadequate remodeling of the spiral arteries, restricting blood flow to the placenta. The second stage is the maternal response to placental dysfunction, manifesting as the clinical symptoms of preeclampsia, including hypertension and proteinuria. This model emphasizes that the maternal syndrome is a consequence of factors released by the stressed placenta, interacting with maternal constitutional factors such as genetic predisposition and pre-existing conditions, including abnormalities in maternal immunity, metabolic disorders, and gut microbial alterations –.

Abnormalities in maternal immunity and gestational immune tolerance play a critical role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, presumably during the first stage. NK cells are the most abundant immune cell population at the maternal-fetal interface and play a major role in promoting placental vascular remodeling. It has been shown that IFN-γ of uterine NK (uNK) cell origin is essential for spiral arterial remodeling in mouse pregnancy. In humans, first-time pregnancies are at a higher risk for miscarriages and preeclampsia. Studies on uteruses and placenta of women with repeated pregnancy have identified a subset of pregnancy-trained uNK cells able to produce higher levels of vascularization and angiogenic factors compared to first-time pregnancies. These data suggest that uNK cells may provide memory to promote placental vascular remodeling during subsequent pregnancies.

Metabolic disorders such as obesity have also been postulated as putative factors related to preeclampsia. Obese women have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia that ranges between 10–15%. The interconnection between the two diseases is still unknown, but clinical and experimental data suggest that obesity may affect placental function and perfusion through hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperleptinemia.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111Nim32]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Gestational hypertension — risk and treatment evidence: It is the de novo development of hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation in the absence of new proteinuria or target organ damage and is associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal adverse events, with up to 30% of women ultimately developing preeclampsia. Following delivery, affected individuals have an increased risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The highest-quality randomized trial of nonproteinuric hypertension compared tight versus less-tight DBP targets (85 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, respectively) and showed a reduction in severe maternal hypertension with tight control, with no other significant differences in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications or pregnancy loss between groups. Post-hoc analyses associated development of severe hypertension with increased risks of pregnancy loss, neonatal intensive care unit admission, preterm delivery, and low birthweight.

### Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy [^115rHSYN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a heterogeneous group of conditions that include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. These disorders account for a significant proportion of perinatal morbidity and mortality nearly 10% of all maternal deaths in the United States. Given the substantial health burden of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, there is increasing interest in optimizing management of these conditions. This article summarizes the diagnosis and management of each of the disorders in the spectrum of hypertension in pregnancy and highlights recent updates in the field.

Hypertensive disease occurs in approximately 12–22% of pregnancies, and it is directly responsible for 17.6% of maternal deaths in the United States (1,2). However, there is confusion about the terminology and classification of these disorders. This bulletin will provide guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders unique to pregnancy (ie, preeclampsia and eclampsia), as well as the various associated complications. Chronic hypertension has been discussed elsewhere (3).

### Severe maternal morbidity associated with chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension [^115SbZnN]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

This study fills an important evidence gap in showing that the absolute SMM risk for individuals with chronic hypertension who avoided preeclampsia was only modestly higher compared with individuals who remained normotensive. It also adds to the evidence to advance precision medicine to improve risk stratification for preeclampsia that is called for by professional organizations. Lastly, preeclampsia is the major driver of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. These findings underscore the urgency of prevention and control of chronic hypertension before and during pregnancy as an important strategy to mitigate morbidity due to preeclampsia in pregnancy.

### Fibrinogen-like protein 2-associated transcriptional and histopathological features of immunological preeclampsia [^113ckoar]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder affecting 3% to 8% of pregnancies, diagnosed in the mother following new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, when accompanied by signs of end-organ damage. – The onset and severity of maternal symptoms and fetal health outcomes are highly variable across all preeclampsia cases. To date, there remains no effective therapeutic intervention to prevent or cure preeclampsia, aside from delivery of the placenta.

Decades of research have led to a widely accepted mechanism concerning the underlying placental pathology of preeclampsia. Early during placentation, an impairment in trophoblast differentiation and function causes deficient invasion, leading to poorly remodeled uterine spiral arteries and insufficient blood flow to the placenta. The resulting placental hypoxia, oxidative stress, and mechanical damage leads to the release of anti-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors into maternal circulation, causing a systemic, symptomatic maternal response. – Based on this paradigm, numerous factors, including sFLT-1 (soluble fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 1) and sENG (soluble endoglin), have been investigated as potential biomarkers of the disease. While this mechanism is representative of a large number of cases, there is increasing evidence that no one paradigm or predictive biomarker can accurately describe all cases of preeclampsia.

### Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis, blood pressure goals, and pharmacotherapy: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115R5oq6]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) remain one of the major causes of pregnancy-related maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Affected women are also at increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life, independently of traditional cardiovascular disease risks. Despite the immediate and long-term cardiovascular disease risks, recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of HDP in the United States have changed little, if at all, over past decades, unlike hypertension guidelines for the general population. The reasons for this approach include the question of benefit from normalization of blood pressure treatment for pregnant women, coupled with theoretical concerns for fetal well-being from a reduction in utero-placental perfusion and in utero exposure to antihypertensive medication. This report is based on a review of current literature and includes normal physiological changes in pregnancy that may affect clinical presentation of HDP; HDP epidemiology and the immediate and long-term sequelae of HDP; the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, an HDP commonly associated with proteinuria and increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes and likely distinct pathological mechanisms; a critical overview of current national and international HDP guidelines; emerging evidence that reducing blood pressure treatment goals in pregnancy may reduce maternal severe hypertension without increasing the risk of pregnancy loss, high-level neonatal care, or overall maternal complications; and the increasingly recognized morbidity associated with postpartum hypertension/preeclampsia. Finally, we discuss the future of research in the field and the pressing need to study socioeconomic and biological factors that may contribute to racial and ethnic maternal health care disparities.

### Pre-eclampsia [^113SWXu1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Pre-eclampsia is a life-threatening disease of pregnancy unique to humans and a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women who survive pre-eclampsia have reduced life expectancy, with increased risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while babies from a pre-eclamptic pregnancy have increased risks of preterm birth, perinatal death and neurodevelopmental disability and cardiovascular and metabolic disease later in life. Pre-eclampsia is a complex multisystem disease, diagnosed by sudden-onset hypertension (> 20 weeks of gestation) and at least one other associated complication, including proteinuria, maternal organ dysfunction or uteroplacental dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is found only when a placenta is or was recently present and is classified as preterm (delivery < 37 weeks of gestation), term (delivery ≥ 37 weeks of gestation) and postpartum pre-eclampsia. The maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is driven by a dysfunctional placenta, which releases factors into maternal blood causing systemic inflammation and widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Available treatments target maternal hypertension and seizures, but the only 'cure' for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the dysfunctional placenta and baby, often prematurely. Despite decades of research, the aetiology of pre-eclampsia, particularly of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, remains poorly defined. Significant advances have been made in the prediction and prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia, which is predicted in early pregnancy through combined screening and is prevented with daily low-dose aspirin, starting before 16 weeks of gestation. By contrast, the prediction of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia is limited and there are no preventive treatments. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, in particular of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, and evaluate new prognostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

### Prevalence of hypertension among pregnant women when using the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines and association with maternal and fetal outcomes [^1122TWrZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. The impact of applying recent guideline definitions for nonpregnant adults to pregnant women is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether reclassification of hypertensive status using the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline definition better identifies women at risk for preeclampsia or eclampsia and adverse fetal/neonatal events compared with the current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) definition of hypertension.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used electronic medical record data of women who delivered singleton infants between 2009 and 2014 at a large US regional health system. Data analysis was performed from July 2020 to September 2020.

Exposure

Application of ACC/AHA and ACOG guidelines for the definition of chronic and gestational hypertension.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary maternal end point was the development of preeclampsia or eclampsia, and the primary fetal/neonatal end point was a composite of preterm birth, small for gestational age, and neonatal intensive care unit admission within 28 days of delivery. Net reclassification indices were calculated to examine how well the lower ACC/AHA diagnostic threshold reclassifies outcomes of pregnancy compared with the current ACOG definition of hypertension.

Results

Applying the ACC/AHA criteria to 137 389 pregnancies of women (mean [SD] age at time of delivery, 30.1 [5.8] years) resulted in a 14.3% prevalence of chronic hypertension (19 621 pregnancies) and a 13.8% prevalence of gestational hypertension (18 998 pregnancies). A 17.8% absolute increase was found in the overall prevalence of hypertension from 10.3% to 28.1%. The 2.1% of women who were reclassified with chronic rather than gestational hypertension had the highest risk of developing preeclampsia compared with women without hypertension by either criterion (adjusted risk ratio, 13.58; 95% CI, 12.49–14.77). Overall, the use of the ACC/AHA criteria to diagnose hypertension resulted in a 20.8% improvement in the appropriate identification of future preeclampsia, but only a 3.8% improvement of appropriate fetal/neonatal risk classification.

Conclusions and Relevance

Using the lower diagnostic threshold for hypertension recommended in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline increased the prevalence of chronic and gestational hypertension, markedly improved the appropriate identification of women who would go on to develop preeclampsia, and was associated with the identification of adverse fetal/neonatal risk.

### Risk factors for refractory respiratory distress syndrome among very-low-birth-weight infants [^115Gx1Ln]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Maternal hypertensive disorder was identified as a risk factor for refractory RDS in this study. Furthermore, the incidence of maternal hypertensive disorder increased as the number of SRT courses increased, with the highest incidence occurring in infants who received SRT three or more times (Supplemental Table 1). Maternal hypertensive disorder, including preeclampsia, is one of the major causes of preterm delivery, along with intrauterine infection and/or inflammation. The impacts of maternal hypertensive disorders on neonatal outcomes after preterm birth are not clear. Immunologic and vascular dysregulation caused by maternal hypertension are thought to be major mechanisms of abnormal spiral artery development and placentation. Poor placentation leads to placental insufficiency and results in fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preterm delivery. Maternal hypertensive disorders can be divided into several subcategories: chronic hypertension, preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia. These subgroups share common pathophysiologies and have similar fetal and neonatal consequences. However, the interaction between maternal hypertensive disorders and neonatal RDS is not yet known. According to previous studies conducted between the 1980s and the 1990s, maternal hypertension has been thought to be associated with a reduced risk of RDS. The idea of the acceleration of organ maturation caused by chronic intrauterine stress is the theoretical background of this association. On the other hand, several recent studies with large cohorts have reported that maternal hypertension may increase the risk of RDS. Wen et al. reported that maternal hypertensive disorder is a risk factor for RDS requiring surfactant treatment. This study was conducted with a VLBW infant cohort registered with the Premature Baby Foundation in Taiwan. These inconsistent results on the association between maternal hypertensive disorders and neonatal respiratory morbidities might originate from changes in the obstetric care of hypertensive mothers, accessibility to SRT, progression of neonatal care and ultimately the improvement in the survival rates of preterm infants. Cohort studies conducted in the Netherlands and China have demonstrated an uncertain correlation between maternal hypertensive disorders and RDS. The timing and severity of maternal hypertensive disorders influence the duration of pregnancy and the timing of delivery. In studies on late preterm infants, as well as earlier studies conducted prior to the 1990s when the survival rates of preterm infants were lower and research focused on moderate preterm infants or older, maternal hypertensive disorders were often reported as a protective factor or as having no association with RDS. In contrast, more recent large-scale studies focusing on VLBWIs frequently consider maternal hypertensive disorders as a risk factor for RDS. This suggests that the impact of maternal hypertensive disorders on neonatal respiratory morbidity may vary depending on the timing of onset and severity of the condition. Therefore, large-scale studies based on pathophysiology are needed to further investigate the effects of maternal hypertensive disorders at different stages of fetal development.

### Induction of labour versus expectant monitoring in women with pregnancy induced hypertension or mild preeclampsia at term: the HYPITAT trial [^114ZzvjQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnancy induced hypertension and preeclampsia are common complications of pregnancy. In many cases, the clinical presentation is mild, consisting only of mild hypertension and/or mild proteinuria at term. In other cases however, severe maternal and fetal complications such as eclampsia, abruptio placentae, preterm delivery, the Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count syndrome (HELLP), fetal growth restriction or even intra-uterine fetal death may occur. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy make a major contribution to maternal and neonatal mortality. In the Netherlands, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are the largest single cause of maternal mortality.

Approximately 10% to 15% of all pregnancies are complicated by hypertensive disorders. The vast majority of these cases occur after 32 weeks. The only causal treatment of the disease is delivery. In case of preterm pregnancies (28–34 weeks gestational age) complicated by preeclampsia expectant monitoring is advocated to increase the chance of fetal maturity, as long as the risks for the mother remain acceptable. Expectant management reduces neonatal complications and duration of neonatal stay in the intensive care unit in preterm pregnancies and is not associated with an increase in maternal complications.

In case of pregnancy induced hypertension or preeclampsia at term, the situation is different from preterm disease. In women with mild preeclampsia complications such as abruptio placenta and small for gestational age are similar to normotensive pregnancies. It is unclear whether in this situation expectant management is beneficial for the mother and her baby, since evidence is lacking. Despite this lack of evidence delivery is often recommended because of the unpredictability of the disease. Recent observational studies indicate that the onset of mild gestational hypertension or mild preeclampsia at or near term is associated with minimal to low maternal and neonatal morbidity. Despite the lack of evidence that would justify intervention, many obstetricians induce labour in women at term with pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia. Such a policy may increase the risk of assisted vaginal delivery and caesarean section, thus generating additional morbidity and costs. On the other hand, expectant management might lead to severe pregnancy complications like eclampsia, severe hypertension, HELLP syndrome, organ failure or an adverse neonatal outcome.

### Diagnosis and management of preeclampsia [^111x5dfN]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific multisystem disorder of unknown etiology. The disorder affects approximately 5 to 7 percent of pregnancies and is a significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia is defined by the new onset of elevated blood pressure and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. It is considered severe if blood pressure and proteinuria are increased substantially or symptoms of end-organ damage (including fetal growth restriction) occur. There is no single reliable, cost-effective screening test for preeclampsia, and there are no well-established measures for primary prevention. Management before the onset of labor includes close monitoring of maternal and fetal status. Management during delivery includes seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate and, if necessary, medical management of hypertension. Delivery remains the ultimate treatment. Access to prenatal care, early detection of the disorder, careful monitoring, and appropriate management are crucial elements in the prevention of preeclampsia-related deaths.

### Endothelin: key mediator of hypertension in preeclampsia [^115PHdhK]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorder characterized by proteinuria and widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. It remains one of the most common disorders in pregnancy and remains one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity. Recent research has revealed that placental insufficiency, resulting in hypoxia and ischemia, is a central causative pathway in the development of the disorder. In response, the placenta secretes soluble substances into the maternal circulation which are responsible for the symptomatic phase of the disease. Among the most well characterized factors in the disease pathology are the anti-angiogenic protein soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), inflammatory cytokines, and agonistic angiotensin II type-1 receptor autoantibodies. Each of these factors has been shown to induce hypertension experimentally through the production of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a powerful vasoconstrictor. Antagonism of the endothelin-A receptor has proved beneficial in numerous animal models of gestational hypertension, and it remains an intriguing target for pharmacological intervention in preeclampsia.

### Guidelines-similarities and dissimilarities: a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines for pregnancy hypertension [^112641ko]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to review pregnancy hypertension clinical practice guidelines to inform international clinical practice and research priorities.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Relevant national and international clinical practice guidelines, 2009–19, published in English, French, Dutch or German.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Following published methods and prospective registration (CRD42019123787), a literature search was updated. CPGs were identified by 2 authors independently who scored quality and usefulness for practice (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument), abstracted data, and resolved any disagreement by consensus.

Results

Of note, 15 of 17 identified clinical practice guidelines (4 international) were deemed "clinically useful" and had recommendations abstracted. The highest Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II scores were from government organizations, and scores have improved over time. The following were consistently recommended: (1) automated blood pressure measurement with devices validated for pregnancy and preeclampsia, reflecting increasing recognition of the prevalence of white-coat hypertension and the potential usefulness of home blood pressure monitoring; (2) use of dipstick proteinuria testing for screening followed by quantitative testing by urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine collection; (3) key definitions and most aspects of classification, including a broad definition of preeclampsia (which includes proteinuria and maternal end-organ dysfunction, including headache and visual symptoms and laboratory abnormalities of platelets, creatinine, or liver enzymes) and a recognition that it can worsen after delivery; (4) preeclampsia prevention with aspirin; (5) treatment of severe hypertension, most commonly with intravenous labetalol, oral nifedipine, or intravenous hydralazine; (6) treatment for nonsevere hypertension when undertaken, with oral labetalol (in particular), methyldopa, or nifedipine, with recommendations against the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors; (7) magnesium sulfate for eclampsia treatment and prevention among women with "severe" preeclampsia; (8) antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth but not hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; (9) delivery at term for preeclampsia; (10) a focus on usual labor and delivery care but avoidance of ergometrine; and (11) an appreciation that long-term health complications are increased in incidence, mandating lifestyle change and risk factor modification. Lack of uniformity was seen in the following areas: (1) the components of a broad preeclampsia definition (specifically respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, fetal manifestations, and biomarkers), what constitutes severe preeclampsia, and whether the definition has utility because at present what constitutes severe preeclampsia by some guidelines that mandate proteinuria now defines any preeclampsia for most other clinical practice guidelines; (2) how preeclampsia risk should be identified early in pregnancy, and aspirin administered for preeclampsia prevention, because multivariable models (with biomarkers and ultrasonography added to clinical risk markers) used in this way to guide aspirin therapy can substantially reduce the incidence of preterm preeclampsia; (3) the value of calcium added to aspirin for preeclampsia prevention, particularly for women with low intake and at increased risk of preeclampsia; (4) emerging recommendations to normalize blood pressure with antihypertensive agents even in the absence of comorbidities; (5) fetal neuroprotection as an indication for magnesium sulfate in the absence of "severe" preeclampsia; and (6) timing of birth for chronic and gestational hypertension and preterm preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Consistent recommendations should be implemented and audited. Inconsistencies should be the focus of research.

### Preeclampsia and eclampsia: the conceptual evolution of a syndrome [^115YAcCP]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia, one of the most enigmatic complications of pregnancy, is considered a pregnancy-specific disorder caused by the placenta and cured only by delivery. This article traces the condition from its origins-once thought to be a disease of the central nervous system, recognized by the occurrence of seizures (ie, eclampsia)-to the present time when preeclampsia is conceptualized primarily as a vascular disorder. We review the epidemiologic data that led to the recommendation to use diastolic hypertension and proteinuria as diagnostic criteria, as their combined presence was associated with an increased risk of fetal death and the birth of small-for-gestational-age neonates. However, preeclampsia is a multisystemic disorder with protean manifestations, and the condition can be present even in the absence of hypertension and proteinuria. Toxins gaining access to the maternal circulation have been proposed to mediate the clinical manifestations-hence, the term "toxemia of pregnancy", which was used for several decades. The search for putative toxins has challenged investigators for more than a century, and a growing body of evidence suggests that products of an ischemic or a stressed placenta are responsible for the vascular changes that characterize this syndrome. The discovery that the placenta can produce antiangiogenic factors, which regulate endothelial cell function and induce intravascular inflammation, has been a major step forward in the understanding of preeclampsia. We view the release of antiangiogenic factors by the placenta as an adaptive response to improve uterine perfusion by modulating endothelial function and maternal cardiovascular performance. However, this homeostatic response can become maladaptive and lead to damage of target organs during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Early-onset preeclampsia has many features in common with atherosclerosis, whereas late-onset preeclampsia seems to result from a mismatch of fetal demands and maternal supply, that is, a metabolic crisis. Preeclampsia, as it is understood today, is essentially vascular dysfunction unmasked or caused by pregnancy. A subset of patients diagnosed with preeclampsia are at greater risk of the subsequent development of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, vascular dementia, and end-stage renal disease. However, these adverse events may be the result of a preexisting vascular pathologic process; it is not known if the occurrence of preeclampsia increases the baseline risk. Therefore, the understanding, prediction, prevention, and treatment of preeclampsia are healthcare priorities.

### The association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and maternal and neonatal outcomes: a retrospective claims analysis [^116JCrST]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy continue to increase in prevalence and are associated with several adverse outcomes and future cardiovascular risk for mothers. This study evaluated the association of hypertensive disorders compared to no hypertension during pregnancy with neonatal and maternal outcomes. We then evaluated risk factors associated with progression from a less to more severe hypertensive disorder during pregnancy.

Methods

We conducted a propensity-matched retrospective cohort study utilizing Medicaid claims data from a national insurer. The study population consisted of mothers with and without hypertensive disorders who delivered between 7/1/2016–12/31/2018 and their infants. Hypertensive disorders included gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, and superimposed preeclampsia. Propensity score matching was used to match mothers without to those with hypertensive disorders. Regression models were used to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes. Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine characteristics associated with the progression of gestational hypertension to preeclampsia or chronic hypertension to superimposed preeclampsia.

Results

We observed the highest risk of cesarean delivery (odds ratio [OR]:1.61 and 1.99) in mothers and preterm delivery (OR:2.22 and 5.37), respiratory distress syndrome (OR:2.39 and 4.19), and low birthweight (OR:3.64 and 9.61) in babies born to mothers with preeclampsia or superimposed preeclampsia compared to no hypertension, respectively (p < 0.05 for all outcomes). These outcomes were slightly higher among chronic or gestational hypertension compared to no hypertension, however, most were not statistically significant. Risk of neonatal intensive care unit utilization was higher among more severe hypertensive disorders (OR:2.41 for preeclampsia, OR:4.87 for superimposed preeclampsia). Obesity/overweight and having a history of preeclampsia during a prior pregnancy were most likely to predict progression from gestational/chronic hypertension to preeclampsia/superimposed preeclampsia.

Conclusion

Mothers and neonates born to mothers with preeclampsia or superimposed preeclampsia experienced more adverse outcomes compared to those without hypertension. Mothers and neonates born to mothers with gestational hypertension had outcomes similar to those without hypertension. Outcomes for those with chronic hypertension fell in between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Obesity/overweight and having a history of preeclampsia during a prior pregnancy were strong risk factors for hypertension progression.

### Pregnancy outcomes and risk factors for thrombocytopenia in pregnant patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^116ytdCk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of maternal and fetal outcomes

Adverse maternal outcomes included: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance or diabetes first identified during pregnancy. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, classified into four categories, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia-eclampsia, and chronic hypertension with preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension: blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg at least twice after 20 weeks of gestation with ≥ 6 h between readings. Preeclampsia: hypertension with proteinuria > 0.3 g/L/day or sudden onset of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Eclampsia requires seizures. Severe preeclampsia: systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg after 20 weeks of gestation with multi-organ involvement; Antepartum hemorrhage, defined as vaginal bleeding occurring after 28 weeks of gestation; Postpartum hemorrhage, defined as blood loss exceeding 500 mL within 24 h after delivery.

Live birth was defined as the delivery of a live infant at ≥ 20 weeks of gestation, with the newborn surviving for at least 6 days. The primary outcome of pregnancy loss was defined as any pregnancy that did not result in a live birth. This includes spontaneous abortion (loss of pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation), therapeutic abortion (induced termination due to lupus or other life-threatening obstetric complications), and stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation). Adverse fetal outcomes included preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), fetal distress (pathological conditions due to hypoxia or acidosis that compromise fetal well-being), premature rupture of membranes (PROM) (spontaneous rupture of membranes before the onset of labor), IUGR (defined as a fetus with an estimated fetal weight (EFW) below the 10th percentile for gestational age, accompanied by at least one additional indicator of compromised growth, such as abnormal Doppler findings or reduced amniotic fluid), small for gestational age (SGA) (birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age and sex, regardless of whether the fetus had a history of growth restriction), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), neonatal asphyxia, low birth weight (< 2500 g), and extremely low birth weight (< 1500 g).

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Gestational hypertension — defined as the de novo development of hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation in the absence of new proteinuria or target organ damage — is associated with increased adverse outcomes, and up to 30% of women with gestational hypertension ultimately develop preeclampsia. Most RCTs of BP targets in this population have been small and of poor to moderate quality; the highest-quality randomized trial in nonproteinuric hypertension compared tight versus less-tight DBP targets (85 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, respectively) and demonstrated a reduction in severe maternal hypertension with tight DBP control, with no other significant differences in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications or pregnancy loss. In post-hoc analyses, development of severe hypertension was associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss, neonatal intensive care unit admission, preterm delivery, and low birthweight.

### Impact of new definitions of preeclampsia at term on identification of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes [^112SjG4Z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Any definition of preeclampsia should identify women and babies at greatest risk of adverse outcomes.

Objective

This study aimed to investigate the ability of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy definitions of preeclampsia at term gestational age (≥ 37 0/7 weeks) to identify adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Study Design

In this prospective cohort study at 2 maternity hospitals in England, women attending a routine hospital visit at 35 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks' gestation underwent assessment that included history; ultrasonographic estimated fetal weight; Doppler measurements of the pulsatility index in the uterine, umbilical, and fetal middle cerebral arteries; and serum placental growth factor-to-soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 ratio. Obstetrical records were examined for all women with chronic hypertension and those who developed new-onset hypertension, with preeclampsia (de novo or superimposed on chronic hypertension) defined in 5 ways: traditional, based on new-onset proteinuria; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013 definition; International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors definition; International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors plus fetal death or fetal growth restriction definition, defined according to the 35 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks' gestation scan as either estimated fetal weight < 3rd percentile or estimated fetal weight at the 3rd to 10th percentile with any of uterine artery pulsatility index > 95th percentile, umbilical artery pulsatility index > 95th percentile, or middle cerebral artery pulsatility index < 5th percentile; and International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance definition, defined as placental growth factor < 5th percentile or soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1-to-serum placental growth factor > 95th percentile. Detection rates for outcomes of interest (ie, severe maternal hypertension, major maternal morbidity, perinatal mortality or major neonatal morbidity, neonatal unit admission ≥ 48 hours, and birthweight < 10th percentile) were compared using the chi-square test, and P < .05 was considered significant.

Results

Among 15,248 singleton pregnancies, the identification of women with preeclampsia varied by definition: traditional, 15 of 281 (1.8%; 248); American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 15 of 326 (2.1%; 248); International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors, 15 of 400 (2.6%; 248); International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors, 15 of 434 (2.8%; 248); and International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance, 15 of 500 (3.3%; 248). Compared with the traditional definition of preeclampsia, the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance best identified the adverse outcomes: severe hypertension (40.6% [traditional] vs 66.9% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance, P < .0001], 59.2% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors, P = 0.004], 56.2% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors, P = 0.013], 46.1% [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, P = 0.449]); P < .0001); composite maternal severe adverse event (72.2% [traditional] vs 100% for all others; p = 0.046); composite of perinatal mortality and morbidity (46.9% [traditional] vs 71.1% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance, P = 0.002], 62.2% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors, P = 0.06], 59.8% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors, P = 0.117], 49.4% [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, P = 0.875]); neonatal unit admission for ≥ 48 hours (51.4% [traditional] vs 73.4% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance, P = 0.001], 64.5% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors, P = 0.070], 60.7% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors, P = 0.213], 53.3% [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, P = 0.890]); birthweight < 10th percentile (40.5% [traditional] vs 78.7% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factors plus angiogenic imbalance, P < .0001], 70.1% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal, P < .0001], 51.3% [International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factors, P = 0.064], 46.3% [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, P = 0.349]).

Conclusion

Our findings present an evidence base for the broad definition of preeclampsia. Our data suggest that compared with a traditional definition, a broad definition of preeclampsia can better identify women and babies at risk of adverse outcomes. Compared with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists definition, the more inclusive International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy definition of maternal end-organ dysfunction seems to be more sensitive. The addition of uteroplacental dysfunction to the broad definition optimizes the identification of women and babies at risk, particularly when angiogenic factors are included.

### Hypertension in pregnancy [^1172jK87]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000). Low credibility.

Hypertension arising during pregnancy remains one of the two most frequently-cited causes of maternal death in the UK. In some cases, pregnancy is unmasking underlying hypertension, which manifests itself in later life. Pregnant women who develop de novo proteinuric hypertension (pre-eclampsia, PE) can share many risk factors with patients with the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance. However, more than half the women who develop PE remain normotensive thereafter. There is a genetic component(s) to the disease, but it is most improbable that there is a 'PE gene'. Rather, there are factors such as genetically-determined thrombophilias which are predisposers but not prerequisites. Impaired placentation is a feature, with inadequate invasion of the spiral arteries by syncytiotrophoblast and poor remodelling. However, similar features are found in association with non-hypertensive fetal growth restriction. Prospective studies have suggested a hyperdynamic circulation in early pregnancy, with cardiac output only falling in established disease. Baroreflex sensitivity is decreased in normal pregnancy, and still further decreased in established PE. Activation of endothelial cell function antedates the clinical diagnosis, and has features in common with atherosclerosis. Dyslipidaemia is common in PE and, via oxidation of susceptible lipids, may contribute to endothelial activation. Oxidative 'stress' is increased in PE, perhaps through a variant of the hypoxia-reperfusion phenomenon in the developing intervillous spaces. Such early changes might then lead to the clinically-evident syndrome in susceptible women. PE is a protean, multisystem, multifactorial disease, the causes of which are only slightly less enigmatic than a decade ago.

### Induction of labour versus expectant monitoring in women with pregnancy induced hypertension or mild preeclampsia at term: the HYPITAT trial [^115o9LXh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertensive disorders, i.e. pregnancy induced hypertension and preeclampsia, complicate 10 to 15% of all pregnancies at term and are a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The only causal treatment is delivery. In case of preterm pregnancies conservative management is advocated if the risks for mother and child remain acceptable. In contrast, there is no consensus on how to manage mild hypertensive disease in pregnancies at term. Induction of labour might prevent maternal and neonatal complications at the expense of increased instrumental vaginal delivery rates and caesarean section rates.

Methods/Design

Women with a pregnancy complicated by pregnancy induced hypertension or mild preeclampsia at a gestational age between 36+0 and 41+0 weeks will be asked to participate in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Women will be randomised to either induction of labour or expectant management for spontaneous delivery. The primary outcome of this study is severe maternal morbidity, which can be complicated by maternal mortality in rare cases. Secondary outcome measures are neonatal mortality and morbidity, caesarean and vaginal instrumental delivery rates, maternal quality of life and costs. Analysis will be by intention to treat. In total, 720 pregnant women have to be randomised to show a reduction in severe maternal complications of hypertensive disease from 12 to 6%.

Discussion

This trial will provide evidence as to whether or not induction of labour in women with pregnancy induced hypertension or mild preeclampsia (nearly) at term is an effective treatment to prevent severe maternal complications.

Trial Registration

The protocol is registered in the clinical trial register number ISRCTN08132825.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112G3KYw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia — including superimposed preeclampsia — clinical features and prevention/treatment: Preeclampsia, a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome, is an HDP characterized by hypertension plus proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and it develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (termed superimposed preeclampsia). Severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia is the occurrence of convulsive seizures, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk, while pravastatin has been investigated only in small studies and larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

### Summary of the NHLBI working group on research on hypertension during pregnancy [^1155EPqF]. Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

A Working Group on Research in Hypertension in Pregnancy was recently convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to determine the state of knowledge in this area and suggest appropriate directions for research. Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially preeclampsia, are a leading cause of maternal death worldwide and even in developed countries increase perinatal mortality rates 5-fold. Much has been learned about preeclampsia, but gaps in the knowledge necessary to direct therapeutic strategies remain. Oxidative stress is a biologically plausible contributor to the disorder that may be amenable to intervention. Hypertension that antedates pregnancy (chronic hypertension) bears many similarities to hypertension in nonpregnant women, but the special setting of pregnancy demands information to guide evidence-based therapy. The recommendations of the Working Group are to attempt a clinical trial of antioxidant therapy to prevent preeclampsia that is be complemented by mechanistic research to increase understanding of the genetics and pathogenesis of the disorder. For chronic hypertension, clinical trials are recommended to direct choice of drugs, evaluate degree of control, and assess implications to the mother and fetus. Recommendations to increase participation in this research are also presented.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Vgamg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Nonsevere-range hypertension in pregnancy — treatment effects and CHAP trial — was assessed in a Cochrane review of 58 trials of nonsevere-range hypertension (SBP < 160 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg), which found antihypertensive medications reduced severe hypertension (risk ratio: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.40–0.60) but did not significantly reduce preeclampsia. The CHAP (Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy) trial randomized 2408 women with chronic hypertension to receive antihypertensive medications to reach target BP < 140/90 mm Hg compared with no treatment unless SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 105 mm Hg and demonstrated an 18% absolute risk reduction in a composite of preeclampsia with severe features, preterm birth, placental abruption, or fetal/neonatal death without evidence of increased risk of fetal growth restriction.

### The causes of preterm neonatal deaths in India and Pakistan (PURPOSe): a prospective cohort study [^111jjH6b]. The Lancet: Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The PURPOSe study represents one of the largest prospective studies so far on the causes of preterm neonatal death from south Asia. Hypertensive disease was the primary maternal cause of nearly a third of the deaths. Placental and umbilical cord conditions were an important primary or contributing factor, mostly involving maternal and fetal placental malperfusion and chorioamnionitis, funisitis, or both. Among neonatal causes of death, about half were non-infectious, whereas about 40% were infectious.

The most common primary neonatal cause of death determined by the panel was intrauterine hypoxia, followed by congenital and neonatal infections, and finally respiratory distress syndrome. We observed that respiratory distress syndrome was designated as the primary cause of death less frequently than is generally reported. We believe that preterm infants with respiratory distress are often diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome, but often without a confirmatory chest x-ray or presence of hyaline membranes on lung histology. If those findings are absent, other reasons for respiratory distress, including birth asphyxia and sepsis, are likely and can often be elucidated with more information, as was seen in the PURPOSe study. Because intrauterine hypoxia is the most common final pathway leading to preterm neonatal death, prevention and treatment of this condition should be a major focus of efforts to reduce preterm neonatal mortality. Improvements in both obstetric care and neonatal resuscitation will probably be required to reduce mortality from this condition.

### The role of statins during pregnancy on maternal risk of preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113G6kim]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia is a critical complication of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, affecting approximately 2–8% of pregnant women worldwide. It significantly contributes to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by the onset of hypertension (≥ 140 mmHg systolic or ≥ 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure) and proteinuria (≥ 300 mg/24 hours) after the 20 week of gestation. The condition can progress to multisystem involvement, including thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, pulmonary edema, or neurological disturbances such as visual and cognitive impairments. If left unmanaged, preeclampsia may lead to severe complications, including eclampsia (which involves seizures), renal failure, stroke, and Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, and Low Platelet count (HELLP) syndrome.

Preeclampsia remains one of the leading causes of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preterm birth, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission. Its global burden is particularly pronounced in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited access to advanced obstetric care exacerbates risks of maternal death, neonatal prematurity, and long-term neonatal sequelae such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birthweight. These challenges highlight the urgent need for early detection, vigilant monitoring, and timely management to mitigate feto-maternal risks. Despite considerable research into its pathogenesis, this multisystemic disorder's etiology, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. An imbalance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is widely considered a central mechanism.

Statins are widely used lipid-lowering agents with established cardiovascular benefits. Beyond the lipid-lowering effects, statins possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and endothelial-protective properties. These properties have prompted interest in their potential role in preeclampsia prevention. Among available statins, pravastatin has garnered the most attention due to its hydrophilic nature and limited placental transfer, making it potentially safer for use in pregnancy. The emerging evidence underscored the need for pooled research to determine the safety and efficacy of different statins in preventing preeclampsia.

Some observational studies and small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown promising results regarding the potential benefits of statins in reducing the incidence or severity of preeclampsia. However, there has no definitive conclusion. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the impact of statin therapy during pregnancy on the maternal risk of preeclampsia. We systematically reviewed observational and randomized controlled trials to comprehensively assess the efficacy and safety of statins in pregnancy.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^111akAT7]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy has defined four categories of hypertension in pregnancy: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. A maternal blood pressure measurement of 140/90 mm Hg or greater on two occasions before 20 weeks of gestation indicates chronic hypertension. Pharmacologic treatment is needed to prevent maternal end-organ damage from severely elevated blood pressure (150 to 180/100 to 110 mm Hg); treatment of mild to moderate chronic hypertension does not improve neonatal outcomes or prevent superimposed preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension is a provisional diagnosis for women with new-onset, nonproteinuric hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation; many of these women are eventually diagnosed with preeclampsia or chronic hypertension. Preeclampsia is the development of new-onset hypertension with proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Adverse pregnancy outcomes related to severe preeclampsia are caused primarily by the need for preterm delivery. HELLP (i.e., hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome is a form of severe preeclampsia with high rates of neonatal and maternal morbidity. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice to prevent and treat eclampsia. The use of magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis in women with mild preeclampsia is controversial because of the low incidence of seizures in this population.

### Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and offspring cardiac structure and function in adolescence [^113GzHuB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Preeclampsia is diagnosed in 2% to 5% of pregnancies, with the incidence for other forms of hypertension in pregnancy being about twice as high. 1 Whereas "gestational hypertension" describes new hypertension that manifests in previously normotensive women following the 20th week of pregnancy, in preeclampsia the hypertension is typically complicated by concomitant proteinuria. A complex syndrome of suboptimal placentation, increased levels of antiangiogenic factors, and fetal hypoxia, preeclampsia is associated with significant mortality and morbidity in mothers and offspring. 2, 3 No definite cure other than delivery is known. 4

Offspring exposed to maternal preeclampsia have higher blood pressure and body mass index (BMI) during childhood and early adolescence. 5, 6 Exposure to maternal preeclampsia has also been reported to be associated with a greater risk of stroke in adulthood. 7 Thus, the worse cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile observed in exposed offspring in adolescence might translate into CVD events later in life. To facilitate risk stratification and preventive efforts, it is important to identify potential CVD risk factors and pathways to disease. Noticeably, both preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are associated with greater long‐term CVD risk in exposed mothers. 8, 9 Shared genetic risk between the mother and offspring may thus be a contributor of increased offspring risk. However, offspring exposed to maternal preeclampsia have decreased flow‐mediated dilation, which was not observed in their unexposed siblings, suggesting a direct intrauterine effect. 10 Furthermore, a direct influence of exposure to preeclampsia on fetal cardiac development is plausible, 11 given that altered pressure loads and hypoxia during development of the myocardium might have a long‐lasting effect on its structure and function. 12, 13 The increase in number of myocytes in the human myocardium plateaus during early life, and subsequent cardiac growth is mostly mediated through hypertrophy of previously formed myocytes. 14

Our aim was to investigate whether maternal preeclampsia and gestational hypertension were associated with offspring cardiac structure and function in adolescence. As recently demonstrated using data from the same cohort, 15 patterns of maternal blood pressure (BP) change in pregnancy are associated with birth weight and gestational length. Therefore, we also examined associations between rate of maternal BP change in pregnancy and offspring cardiac outcomes. We hypothesized that (1) cardiac outcomes would be less favorable in offspring exposed to maternal preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, compared to offspring of normotensive mothers, and (2) adverse maternal BP change during pregnancy would be associated with poorer offspring cardiac structure and function.

### Using ultrasound and angiogenic markers from a 19-to 23-week assessment to inform the subsequent diagnosis of preeclampsia [^114r4VNW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A definition of preeclampsia that incorporates the assessment of maternal, fetal, and uteroplacental status would optimize the identification of pregnancies at risk of complications at term gestational age. This definition would include "carrying forward" angiogenic test results from 35 to 36 weeks of gestation to term gestational age. Would this approach still be useful if testing is performed earlier or at a routine midgestation scan and the result is used to inform the diagnosis of preeclampsia that developed thereafter?

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate whether fetoplacental assessment at a 19- to 23-week scan could be "carried forward" to contribute to the classification of preeclampsia and improve the detection of women and fetuses at risk of adverse outcomes associated with hypertension.

Study Design

In this prospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies at 2 maternity hospitals in England (October 2011 to March 2020), women attending a routine hospital visit at 19 to 23 weeks of gestation underwent an assessment that included history, ultrasonographic estimated fetal weight, Doppler measurements of the pulsatility index in uterine arteries, and serum placental growth factor. Preeclampsia was defined according to various definitions: (1) traditional, based on new-onset proteinuria at ≥ 20 weeks of gestation; (2) 2013 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; (3) 2018 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal factor; (4) 2018 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor (death or growth restriction), based on ultrasound scans at the 19 0/7 to 23 6/7 week of gestation (an estimated fetal weight of < 3rd percentile or estimated fetal weight between the 3rd and 10th percentiles with a uterine artery pulsatility index of > 95th percentile); and (5) 2021 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor plus placental growth factor (with abnormal placental growth factor defined as an estimated fetal weight of < 5th percentile for gestational age). The detection rates for outcomes of interest (ie, severe maternal hypertension, major maternal morbidity, perinatal mortality or major neonatal morbidity, neonatal intensive care unit admission ≥ 48 hours, and birthweight of < 3rd percentile) ascertained by health record review were compared using the chi-square test. A P value of < .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Among 40,241 singleton pregnancies, preeclampsia incidence varied by definition, from lows of 2.6% (traditional) and 3.0% (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) to a high of 3.8% (International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor plus placental growth factor). The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor plus placental growth factor definition (vs the traditional) best identified women who developed adverse outcomes: severe hypertension (detection rate: 70.6% vs 52.8%; P < .001), major maternal morbidity (detection rate: 100% vs 87.5%; p = 0.027), perinatal mortality or major morbidity (detection rate: 84.6% vs 69.5%; p = 0.004), neonatal intensive care unit admission ≥ 48 hours (detection rate: 76.6% vs 63.2%;, P = 0.0002), and birthweight of < 3rd percentile (detection rate: 81.3% vs 61.9%; P < .0001]. The detection rates improved, going from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists definition to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor plus placental growth factor definition, for severe hypertension (11.4%; p = 0.003), perinatal mortality or major morbidity (10.6%; p = 0.03), neonatal intensive care unit admission ≥ 48 hours (8.6%; p = 0.01), and birthweight of < 3rd percentile (16.2%; P < .001). However, going from the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor definition to the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy maternal-fetal factor plus placental growth factor definition, the detection of fetuses with a birthweight of < 3rd percentile improved by 7.0% (P = 0.01), but no other improvement was seen for severe hypertension (1.7%; p = 0.33), major maternal morbidity (0%), perinatal mortality or major morbidity (4.0%; p = 0.20), and neonatal intensive care unit admission ≥ 48 hours (3.2%; p = 0.17).

Conclusion

The criteria for uteroplacental dysfunction (including placental growth factor) from the 19- to 23-week assessment can be used in the assessment of women who are later suspected of having PE, to best identify pregnancies at risk of adverse outcomes.

### Does developing interpregnancy hypertension affect the recurrence risk of preeclampsia? A population-based cohort study [^111ipjB5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia complicates 3%–5% of pregnancies worldwide and is among the leading causes of maternal and neonatal morbidity, accounting for over 50,000 maternal deaths annually. Preeclampsia is generally defined as new-onset hypertension after 20 gestational weeks, accompanied by signs of end-organ damage. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia is a complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. There are several well-known risk factors for preeclampsia, such as nulliparity, high body mass index (BMI), high maternal age, and certain chronic diseases, for example, chronic hypertension. Women with previous preeclampsia have an increased risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and are predisposed to chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases later in life. The association between increased risk of long-term chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease is stronger for preterm (< 37 gestational weeks) than term (≥ 37 gestational weeks) preeclampsia.

In early pregnancy, women are risk assessed for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia. Women identified as high risk for preeclampsia may be offered aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and increased surveillance during pregnancy for early detection of preeclampsia. Most international guidelines recognize previous preeclampsia and chronic hypertension as major risk factors for preeclampsia. Several studies have explored the relationship between various hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in consecutive pregnancies. However, a limited number of studies have focused on the risk of superimposed preeclampsia, that is, preeclampsia occurring in women with chronic hypertension, in women with previous preeclampsia. Not much is known about the interaction between previous preeclampsia and interpregnancy development of chronic hypertension on the risk of overall preeclampsia, as well as preterm and term subtypes. The recurrence risk of preeclampsia is around 14%–21%. The prevalence of chronic hypertension in pregnancy has been increasing in recent years, and up to 30%–50% of women with previous preeclampsia may develop chronic hypertension within a decade. Thus, an increasing number of women with preeclampsia in their first pregnancy may develop chronic hypertension before their second pregnancy. Investigating the interaction between preeclampsia in a first pregnancy and interpregnancy hypertension on recurrence risk in a second pregnancy is therefore of importance.

Further, considering that preterm and term preeclampsia differ in pathophysiology, the two risk factors, previous preeclampsia, and interpregnancy hypertension, might interact differently depending on the subtype of preeclampsia.

We have conducted a nationwide register-based cohort study to explore the risk of preeclampsia, and the subtypes preterm and term, in a second pregnancy based on the presence of preeclampsia in the first pregnancy and the development of interpregnancy hypertension.

### Preeclampsia: a report and recommendations of the workshop of the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine and the preeclampsia foundation [^115oypSA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a substantial cause of perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of this condition has increased over the past several decades. Additional opportunities are needed to foster interdisciplinary collaborations and improve patient care in the setting of preeclampsia. In recognition of the Preeclampsia Foundation's 20th anniversary and its work to advance preeclampsia research and clinical agendas, a 2-day virtual workshop on preeclampsia was cosponsored by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the Preeclampsia Foundation and held January 25–26, 2021 in conjunction with the 41st annual pregnancy meeting. Leaders with expertise in preeclampsia research, obstetrical care, primary care medicine, cardiology, endocrinology, global health, and patient advocacy gathered to discuss preeclampsia prediction, prevention, management, and long-term impacts. The goals of the workshop were to review the following issues and create consensus concerning research and clinical recommendations: This report, developed collaboratively between the SMFM and the Preeclampsia Foundation, presents the key findings and consensus-based recommendations from the workshop participants.

### Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and intrauterine growth restriction, related or independent conditions? [^112wRn7D]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction may have similar determinants and consequences. In this study, we compared determinants and perinatal outcomes associated with these obstetric conditions.

Study Design

We analyzed 39,615 pregnancies (data from the WHO Antenatal Care Trial), of which 2.2% were complicated by preeclampsia, 7.0% by gestational hypertension, and 8.1% by unexplained intrauterine growth restriction (ie, not associated with maternal smoking, maternal undernutrition, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or congenital malformations). We compared the risk factors associated with these groups. Fetal death, preterm delivery, and severe neonatal morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for study site, socioeconomic status, and (if appropriate) birth weight and gestational age.

Results

Diabetes, renal or cardiac disease, previous preeclampsia, urinary tract infection, high maternal age, twin pregnancy, and obesity increased the risk of both hypertensive conditions. Previous large-for-age birth, reproductive tract surgery, antepartum hemorrhage and reproductive tract infection increased the risk for gestational hypertension only. Independent of maternal age, primiparity was a risk factor only for preeclampsia. Both preeclampsia and gestational hypertension were associated with increased risk for fetal death and severe neonatal morbidity and mortality. Mothers with preeclampsia compared with those with unexplained intrauterine growth restriction were more likely to have a history of diabetes, renal or cardiac disease, chronic hypertension, previous preeclampsia, body mass index more than 30 kg/cm2, urinary tract infection and extremes of maternal age. Conversely, unexplained intrauterine growth restriction was associated with higher risk of low birth weight in previous pregnancies, but not with previous preeclampsia. Both conditions increased the risk for perinatal outcomes independently but preeclampsia was associated with considerable higher risk.

Conclusion

Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension shared many risk factors, although there are differences that need further evaluation. Both conditions significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Conversely, preeclampsia and unexplained intrauterine growth restriction, often assumed to be related to placental insufficiency, seem to be independent biologic entities.

### Preeclampsia: pathophysiology, challenges, and perspectives [^111jUr35]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy-chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia-are uniquely challenging as the pathology and its therapeutic management simultaneously affect mother and fetus, sometimes putting their well-being at odds with each other. Preeclampsia, in particular, is one of the most feared complications of pregnancy. Often presenting as new-onset hypertension and proteinuria during the third trimester, preeclampsia can progress rapidly to serious complications, including death of both mother and fetus. While the cause of preeclampsia is still debated, clinical and pathological studies suggest that the placenta is central to the pathogenesis of this syndrome. In this review, we will discuss the current evidence for the role of abnormal placentation and the role of placental factors such as the antiangiogenic factor, sFLT1 (soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1) in the pathogenesis of the maternal syndrome of preeclampsia. We will discuss angiogenic biomarker assays for disease-risk stratification and for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the angiogenic pathway. Finally, we will review the substantial long-term cardiovascular and metabolic risks to mothers and children associated with gestational hypertensive disorders, in particular, preterm preeclampsia, and the need for an increased focus on interventional studies during the asymptomatic phase to delay the onset of cardiovascular disease in women.

### A literature review and best practice advice for second and third trimester risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre-eclampsia: compiled by the pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee of FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) [^115A52gy]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

At 34 +0–36 +6 weeks for women with pre‐eclampsia, randomized controlled trial data suggest that initiation of birth, which results in delivery an average of 5 days earlier than ongoing expectant care, is associated with reduced maternal morbidity and severe hypertension, but increased neonatal morbidity, particularly respiratory problems. Initiation of birth was associated with more neonatal respiratory morbidity in the Dutch HYPITAT‐II trial (703 women) in which 1% of women received antenatal steroids. On the other hand, in the PHOENIX trial (900 women), initiation of birth was associated with reduced maternal morbidity and more neonatal care unit admission, but no increase in neonatal respiratory morbidity. Although the women in the PHOENIX trial were at higher risk of adverse outcomes (based on all having pre‐eclampsia versus just under half in the HYPITAT‐II trial), a key consideration was that 60% of women in the PHOENIX trial received antenatal corticosteroids, which may explain why no difference was seen in respiratory distress in this trial. Reassuringly, however, initiation of birth (versus expectant care) has been associated with similar child development and behavior outcomes at the age of 5 years. An individual patient data meta‐analysis suggested that neonatal risk associated with initiation of birth at 34 +0–36 +6 weeks may be focused on the 34 +0–35 +6 window, with no increased risk from 36 +0 weeks; this finding is consistent with subgroup analyses in the PHOENIX trial.

At term gestational age, women with chronic hypertension may benefit from birth at 38 +0–39 +6 weeks, in terms of reduced incidence of severe hypertension, stillbirth, and cesarean delivery, but the evidence is primarily observational in nature; randomized controlled trial data on 50 women suggest that initiation of delivery at 37 +0 weeks is associated with an excess of neonatal morbidity. There is one ongoing trial of timed delivery at term that is including women with chronic hypertension and preterm gestational hypertension (ISRCTN77258279). Women with gestational hypertension or pre‐eclampsia that develops at term should be offered initiation of birth within 24 hours based on the results of the HYPITAT‐I trial.

12 RESEARCH PRIORITIES

There are three main objectives for further research. Firstly, more prospective research is required to develop and evaluate risk stratification strategies in asymptomatic unselected women. Existing evidence on the use of multimarker algorithms is promising, and therefore such models require validation in other settings. Secondly, evidence of the PLGF or sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio published to date makes it highly likely that the decision when to deliver women with gestational hypertension or early disease of pre‐eclampsia after 34 +0 weeks of gestation can be refined when these markers are added to clinical decision‐making. To date, the HYPITAT‐I and II and PHOENIX randomized controlled trials are paramount on when to deliver women with nonsevere, late‐onset hypertensive disease. The HYPITAT‐I trial has shown that there is no benefit to either the mother or child in prolonging pregnancy after 37 weeks of gestation in women with gestational hypertensive disease. The PHOENIX trial suggests delivery will reduce maternal morbidity. There is a need for a meta‐analysis of the smaller studies, such as the HYPITAT‐II trial, to ascertain the effects on neonatal morbidity, mainly respiratory distress syndrome. These findings must be re‐evaluated after adding knowledge from the PLGF or sFlt‐1/PLGF ratio studies.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, affect ≈10% of all pregnancies and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality for the mother and the baby. 1 New‐onset hypertension usually experienced after 20 weeks of gestation characterizes gestational hypertension. New‐onset hypertension with proteinuria and/or significant end‐organ dysfunction characterizes preeclampsia, whereas eclampsia is characterized by new‐onset seizures (ie, tonic‐clonic, focal, or multifocal) without a causative condition(s). 2, 3 Preeclampsia occurs among 3% to 5% of all pregnancies. 4 Risk factors identified for preeclampsia include: advanced age (> 40 years), 5 Black race, 6, 7 gestational diabetes mellitus, 5 history of preeclampsia, 5 certain preexisting medical conditions (eg, preexistent hypertension), 5, 8, 9 and high pre‐pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (> 29.0 kg/m 2). 5 Preexisting hypertension, which is known to increase the risk of superimposed preeclampsia, occurs in ≈1% to 4% of all pregnancies. 10, 11, 12

### Gestational hypertension and "severe" disease: time for a change [^116TkRaG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our understanding and management of gestational hypertension and its variants are substantially hindered by a reliance on antiquated terminology and on practice recommendations based largely on tradition rather than outcomes-based evidence. Unsurprisingly, gestational hypertension remains a major contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates, with little improvement seen over the past half century except as it relates to better newborn care. Reliance on a binary classification of vastly disparate types and degrees of organ dysfunction (severe or not severe) and the use of nonphysiological and largely arbitrary gestational age cutoffs are particularly problematic. If this situation is to improve, it will be necessary to abandon current misleading terminology and non-evidence-based traditional practice patterns and start again, building on management approaches validated by outcomes-based data.

### Elevated placental adenosine signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [^116ZHz4t]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia is a prevalent hypertensive disorder of pregnancy and a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This pathogenic condition is speculated to be caused by placental abnormalities that contribute to the maternal syndrome. However, the specific factors and signaling pathways that lead to impaired placentas and maternal disease development remain elusive.

Methods and Results

Using 2 independent animal models of preeclampsia (genetically engineered pregnant mice with elevated adenosine exclusively in placentas and a pathogenic autoantibody-induced preeclampsia mouse model), we demonstrated that chronically elevated placental adenosine was sufficient to induce hallmark features of preeclampsia, including hypertension, proteinuria, small fetuses, and impaired placental vasculature. Genetic and pharmacological approaches revealed that elevated placental adenosine coupled with excessive A₂B adenosine receptor (ADORA2B) signaling contributed to the development of these features of preeclampsia. Mechanistically, we provided both human and mouse evidence that elevated placental CD73 is a key enzyme causing increased placental adenosine, thereby contributing to preeclampsia.

Conclusions

We determined that elevated placental adenosine signaling is a previously unrecognized pathogenic factor for preeclampsia. Moreover, our findings revealed the molecular basis underlying the elevation of placental adenosine and the detrimental role of excess placental adenosine in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, and thereby, we highlight novel therapeutic targets.

Hypertensive disorders — aspirin prophylaxis for preeclampsia: We recommend initiating aspirin therapy at or before 16 weeks' gestation in patients at risk of developing preeclampsia (Strong for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence suggests that daily aspirin might reduce preterm birth, perinatal mortality, and intrauterine growth restriction when used in preeclampsia prevention. In patients without risk factors for preeclampsia, the USPSTF Guidelines for Aspirin Use to Prevent Preeclampsia do not recommend aspirin. Yip et al. identified an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage in patients who received aspirin, but Choi et al. found no significant elevated risk of maternal or neonatal bleeding events with aspirin treatment.

International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Delivery plans for women with confirmed pre‐eclampsia: delivery for pre‐eclampsia at any gestational age is recommended when there is one or more of the following conditions: abnormal neurological features such as severe intractable headache, repeated visual scotomata, eclampsia, or stroke; repeated episodes of severe hypertension despite maintenance treatment with three classes of antihypertensive agents; pulmonary edema or oxygen saturation < 90%; progressive thrombocytopenia (particularly < 50 × 10 9 /L or need for transfusion); abnormal and rising serum creatinine; abruption with evidence of maternal or fetal compromise; nonreassuring fetal status (including intrauterine fetal death). Mode of delivery is determined by several factors that include gestational age, fetal condition, and other concurrent obstetrics factors such as previous cesarean section.

Postpartum care: blood pressure should continue to be monitored after delivery until 6 days after birth, as it is likely to be highest 3–6 days after birth. Antihypertensive therapy that has been administered before birth should be continued after birth for as long as required to maintain blood pressure control. Consideration should be given to administering antihypertensive therapy for any hypertension diagnosed up to 6 days after delivery. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders should be acknowledged as predictors of long‐term maternal cardiovascular morbidity. The following measures should be implemented at 6–12 weeks after birth, and periodically thereafter, preferably yearly, following a pregnancy complicated by hypertensive disorders: history and physical examination, blood pressure measurements, and consideration of screening for other cardiovascular risk factors and for diabetes according to additional risk factors.

Automated blood pressure devices: Only automated blood pressure devices that have been shown to be accurate in pregnancy and pre‐eclampsia should be used.

### Preventing pre-eclampsia-are dietary factors the key? [^117JCvD4]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pre-eclampsia is a condition specific to the second half of pregnancy, affecting multiple organ systems, and affecting approximately 2% to 8% of pregnant women. While the condition is more commonly encountered among women in their first ongoing pregnancy, there are a number of additional recognised risk factors, including a past history of pre-eclampsia, underlying essential hypertension, the coexistence of autoimmune conditions and multi-fetal pregnancies. While the incidence of disease risk factors has steadily increased, particularly an increase in maternal age at the time of first pregnancy and an increase in maternal obesity, the actual incidence of pre-eclampsia has decreased, reflecting, in part, a trend to an earlier gestational age at birth.

Pre-eclampsia associated maternal morbidity and mortality

World-wide, hypertension during pregnancy contributes significantly to both maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity, accounting for 10% to 15% of all direct maternal deaths. The vast majority of maternal deaths attributable to pre-eclampsia occur in low to middle income countries, although the proportional contribution to direct maternal deaths in high income countries remains similar. Pre-eclampsia is a contributing factor in up to one third of all cases of serious maternal morbidity, with 5% of women with severe disease requiring admission to intensive care, and in the longer-term, increases a woman's risk of both chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Pre-eclampsia associated perinatal morbidity and mortality

Independent of the effects of both prematurity and intra-uterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia is a contributing factor in up to 2.7% of all perinatal deaths. Furthermore, pre-eclampsia is documented as an antecedent factor in up to 12% of infants born with intra-uterine growth restriction and 19% born preterm. Both prematurity and small for gestational age are associated with an increased risk of neonatal complications, including respiratory distress syndrome, feeding difficulties, hypoglycaemia, seizures, intracranial haemorrhage and prolonged hospitalisation. In the longer-term, preterm and small for gestational age infants remain at increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay in childhood, and subsequent obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in later life.

7.6 Timed delivery

Indications for planned birth, regardless of gestational age or hypertensive disorder, include those end‐organ complications associated with a heightened risk of maternal or perinatal death. For women with pre‐eclampsia, neither the serum uric acid nor the level of proteinuria should be used as indications for delivery.

At < 34 +0 weeks there are no data to indicate that women with chronic or gestational hypertension would benefit from delivery unless there is a specific indication for birth, as listed above. At this gestational age for women with pre‐eclampsia, small randomized controlled trials suggest that expectant care may improve neonatal outcomes without increasing maternal risk. However, expectant care should be undertaken only where there are adequate services to support the needs of a sick mother and baby.

At 34 +0–36 +6 weeks there are few data to guide care of women with chronic or gestational hypertension. One study on timing of birth included women with chronic hypertension, but they had either superimposed pre‐eclampsia or "deteriorating hypertension" that satisfies the definition of superimposed pre‐eclampsia by many guidelines. The HYPITAT‐II trial included 182 women with gestational hypertension. While outcomes were similar to those of women with pre‐eclampsia in subgroup analyses, initiation of birth may have been associated with reduction in maternal but an increase in neonatal risk; however, the number of women randomized was insufficient on which to base a recommendation.

### Is perinatal asphyxia predictable? [^112bXPxo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cases of neonatal encephalopathy related to perinatal asphyxia are called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and can lead to long-term neurological sequelae and cerebral palsy.

The Sarnat and Sarnat classification is still the universally accepted scoring system to provide information about the prognosis for the asphyxiated neonate. This staging is based on the infant's clinical presentation, examination findings and the presence of seizures, with emphasis on the duration of symptoms.

Both clinical (Thompson scale) and instrumental (cerebral function monitor/aEEG) assessment are validated by international literature for classifying the severity of damage immediately after birth. This allows for initiating the correct treatment (ie Therapeutic Hypothermia) as soon as possible.

Perinatal asphyxia is defined as at least one of the following characteristics in a neonate: 10 min Apgar score ≤ 5, need for resuscitation > 10 min, metabolic acidosis (pH ≤ 7.0 or BE ≤ -12 mMol/L in umbilical artery (UA) or within 1 h of life).

There is a dose-dependent relationship between the degree of acidosis and the likelihood of adverse neonatal outcome.

Both ante and intrapartum risk factors have been associated with perinatal asphyxia and HIE. Some of these are clinically recognized as asphyxial birth events (sentinel events): uterine rupture, placental abruptio, shoulder dystocia and cord prolapse. However, the majority of risk factors (preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, intrapartum fever, emergency delivery) seem to interact in the causal pathway to HIE rather than being its direct antecedent. In addition to the historically described risk factors, new ones have recently been identified, such as obesity and previous cesarean section. Nevertheless, results from a large registry of neonatal encephalopathy show that half of the neonates had neither asphyxia nor inflammatory indicators, suggesting that a large number of cases remain unexplained.

Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring provides important information about fetal status. However, its role in the prediction of fetal asphyxia remains controversial, despite efforts directed at its interpretation and the development of protocols for the management of abnormal patterns.

To summarize, there are a number of conditions that have been associated with the presence of perinatal asphyxia and its extreme consequence, HIE. Nevertheless, it is problematic to identify the sequence of events that leads to perinatal asphyxia during prenatal and intrapartum care.

In this context the objective of our study was to evaluate the association between perinatal asphyxia and HIE with the presence of risk factors and/or abnormal FHR findings in order to improve maternal and neonatal management.

### Analysis of risk factors and construction of nomograph model for critical condition of patients with hypertension during pregnancy [^1173cpeW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension in pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia, is a pervasive global health issue affecting approximately 10% of pregnant women worldwide. Hypertension in pregnancy not only involves the heart, brain, and other systemic organs of pregnant women, but also has close association with pregnancy complications and increased neonatal mortality, seriously threatening the lives of pregnant women and newborns. While the number of maternal deaths related to hypertension has decreased both domestically and internationally in recent years, hypertension in pregnancy remains a pressing issue due to its significant impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes. Individuals at higher risk of severe preeclampsia may require more frequent monitoring due to risk factors such as age, high BMI, or existing medical conditions. To date, numerous clinical studies have investigated the factors influencing the development of hypertension in pregnancy. However, the factors that contribute to the development of critical conditions in patients with hypertension during pregnancy remain poorly defined. In order to identify the risk factors for the development of critical conditions in patients with hypertension in pregnancy and to improve the prevention and treatment of critical patients, 531 cases of patients with hypertension in pregnancy admitted to our hospital were selected in this study to investigate the risk factors for the development of critical conditions. A risk prediction nomogram model was constructed to provide reference for early screening of high-risk groups and development of reasonable interventions in the future.

### Chronic hypoxia in ovine pregnancy recapitulates physiological and molecular markers of preeclampsia in the mother, placenta, and offspring [^111KFuY1]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the classic 2-stage theory of preeclampsia, impaired uteroplacental perfusion promotes placental hypoxia, oxidative stress, and ER stress. The subsequent placental release of proinflammatory cytokines, syncytiotrophoblast debris, and antiangiogenic factors into the maternal circulation induces the peripheral syndrome. For example, the angiogenic imbalance caused by the release of sFlt-1 and sEng, which oppose the actions of VEGF and PlGF, promotes global maternal endothelial dysfunction and increased peripheral vascular resistance. These changes manifest as an increase in the uterine PI, maternal systemic hypertension, and impaired renal glomerular filtration rate. On the fetal side, these changes lead to impaired fetal oxygen and nutrient delivery, yielding asymmetrical fetal growth restriction (FGR).

Data in the present study show that chronic hypoxia during the last third of pregnancy in sheep stresses the placenta, with upstream adverse effects on the mother and downstream adverse effects on the fetus, akin to those found in preeclampsia. Placentae from the hypoxic cohort showed molecular evidence of hypoxia, increased oxidative stress, activation of the UPR, dilation of ER cisternae, and increased expression of antiangiogenic factors. Upstream adverse consequences on the ewe included evidence of an angiogenic imbalance in maternal plasma, increased uterine artery PI, and a lack of an ontogenic fall in uterine vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure with advancing gestation. Downstream adverse consequences on the hypoxic offspring included FGR with evidence of fetal brain-sparing. Combined, therefore, the data in this study support the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia during the last third of pregnancy in sheep provides a link between placental stress, FGR, and maternal cardiovascular dysfunction in adverse pregnancy, as in preeclampsia. However, the differences between this preclinical model and preeclampsia are just as informative as the similarities. Although the data suggest that some features of preeclampsia can be caused by hypoxia, other features, such as overt maternal hypertension and maternal proteinuria, were not recapitulated. However, ewes undergoing hypoxic pregnancy did not show the significant fall in maternal arterial blood pressure measured in control ewes with advancing gestation. Lack of maternal hypertension may, therefore, be due to the limited duration of hypoxia towards the end of pregnancy in this ovine model. In contrast, in preeclampsia, the pathophysiology can start during the first trimester.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia and eclampsia, including preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension — preeclampsia is a multiorgan system inflammatory syndrome characterized by hypertension with proteinuria or target organ dysfunction, and develops in 20% to 50% of individuals with chronic hypertension (superimposed preeclampsia). In preeclampsia, severe features or hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) are associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. Eclampsia, the occurrence of convulsive seizures, is one of the most severe forms, and both preeclampsia and eclampsia can occur before, during, or after delivery; magnesium sulfate in addition to antihypertensive medications are the mainstay of treatment. Low-dose aspirin is the only routinely recommended intervention that has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of preeclampsia and its sequelae when taken from 12 weeks of gestation in pregnant people at moderate and greater risk; pravastatin has been investigated in small studies but larger prospective studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy.

Eclampsia is defined by the occurrence of seizures resulting from hypertensive encephalopathy on the background of preeclampsia. The development of hypertension during pregnancy, a serious and potentially fatal condition, is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and death in the United States.(1–3) It is a disease with preventable complications. The pathophysiology of hypertension during pregnancy is unclear, but there is consensus that aggressive treatment is warranted to prevent complications to both fetus and mother. A current concept of pathophysiological character, diagnosis, prevention, and management of eclampsia is discussed.

8 LONG‐TERM CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PRE‐ECLAMPSIA

Pre‐eclampsia is a well‐established risk factor for long‐term maternal and neonatal complications. Even after resolution of symptoms, an elevated risk for future maternal cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular disease exists. In addition, even though less investigated, several studies have already demonstrated that children antenatally exposed to pre‐eclampsia are at an increased risk of long‐term cardiovascular, respiratory neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, and endocrinological morbidity.

### Predictors of maternal and neonatal complications in women with severe valvular heart disease during pregnancy in Tunisia: a retrospective cohort study [^111Wkye5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Obstetric complications were 3 to 4 times more common in our population compared to the ROPAC and CAPREG studies (Table 6). Low parity (nulliparous or primiparous) is a predictor of obstetrical events in many studies, especially that it increases the risk of preeclampsia (Table 6).

In our cohort, preterm labor threat was the most common complication. This was mainly due both to uterine muscle hypoxia and to acute heart failure, which were common occurrences in our women.

Pre-eclampsia was more common in women with aortic valve disease and left ventricle dysfunction because of low cardiac output and, as expected, in nulliparous women and those with pre-existing hypertension. In our series, all the cases of preeclampsia occurred in women treated with intravenous diuretics because of acute heart failure. This is a frequently faced challenge. The use of diuretics results in placenta hypoperfusion which is the main mechanism of preeclampsia; therefore, diuretics should be avoided in such women. The use of anticoagulants is also a predictor of obstetrical complications, mainly hemorrhage. In our cohort, this factor increased the risk of obstetrical events by 8 times. Indeed, the association between hemorrhage and anemia, frequently diagnosed in our women, worsens the prognosis and results in heart decompensation. It is therefore recommended to anticipate the timing of birth to ensure a safe and effective peripartum anticoagulation.

Neonatal prognosis is closely correlated with maternal prognosis. Anyway, in our series, we found the occurrence of obstetric complications (aOR = 16.47, 95% CI[3.2–84.3]) and the revelation of valvulopathy during pregnancy (aOR = 7.33, 95% CI[1.4–36.1]) to be strong predictors of neonatal complications. In fact, the delayed discovery of valvulopathy may expose the fetus to a longer duration of hemodynamic stress, especially with a risk of placental hypoperfusion, hypotrophy, and prematurity. The immunological status of these newborns will also be precarious with a higher risk of hospitalization in the neonatal care unit. In the ROPAC registry, the rate of fetal complications among women with WHO IV heart disease was 31%, which is comparable to the 40% rate in our series. Predictors of these complications in ROPAC were multigravidity, treatment with anticoagulants, diabetes and life in low income countries (Table 6).

### The association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and maternal and neonatal outcomes: a retrospective claims analysis [^113AmKFv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes were measured in claims for both mothers and neonates; code lists for all outcomes may be found in the Supplement. The neonate was the unit of analysis for neonatal outcomes and the expectant mother was the unit of analysis for the maternal outcomes. Neonatal outcomes included pre-term delivery, neonatal morbidities (including sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, low birth weight, and severe congenital defects), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, length of stay, and cost. Neonatal morbidities were measured within 28 days of delivery, whereas NICU variables were measured for the full NICU stay. Maternal outcomes included stillbirth and cesarean delivery, which were measured on the index date. Other maternal outcomes included postpartum preeclampsia – among the gestational and chronic hypertension cohorts, and post-delivery hypertension – among the gestational hypertension and preeclampsia cohorts. Postpartum preeclampsia was not measured among the cohorts with preeclampsia or superimposed preeclampsia during pregnancy in case claims for preeclampsia after delivery were related to the preeclampsia during pregnancy that had not yet resolved. Post-delivery hypertension was not measured among the cohorts with chronic hypertension or superimposed preeclampsia, as those cohorts had hypertension prior to pregnancy, so we would expect them to continue to have hypertension after delivery. Postpartum preeclampsia, post-delivery hypertension, and maternal healthcare utilization and cost in the year following delivery were measured among the subset of mothers who had 12 months of continuous health plan enrollment following the index date.

### Endothelial activation and stress index is associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in preeclampsia [^111Fcs9m]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

With an incidence of up to 8% of all pregnancies, preeclampsia constitutes one of the most feared obstetric challenges. Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension combined with features of multiorgan dysfunction and can progress rapidly to severe adverse outcomes affecting both the mother and the fetus. Preeclampsia‐related complications, such as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome; stroke; kidney failure; or intrauterine growth restriction aggravate both maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Prediction tools to accurately identify vulnerable patients with preeclampsia prone to develop adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes are of paramount importance to guide clinical care and to optimize administration of antenatal corticosteroids to enhance fetal lung maturity before 34 weeks' gestation and the timing of delivery.

Endothelial dysfunction represents one of the key drivers in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia and is the result of insufficient trophoblast invasion in early gestation, chronic placental hypoxia, and a proinflammatory and antiangiogenic environment. Changes in endothelial and vascular function in preeclampsia have been demonstrated through reduced flow‐mediated vasodilation as a result of reduced availability of NO, which potentially persists up to several years postpartum. In addition, video capillaroscopy was able to visualize a reduced microvascular perfusion mediated by glycocalyx degradation. These vascular remodeling processes characterize preeclampsia as a female‐specific cardiovascular risk factorfor long‐term cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal complications after preeclampsia.

Until now, there was no validated, simple biomarker available representing endothelial dysfunction with prognostic value for preeclampsia‐related outcomes. Beyond this background, we aimed to investigate if the Endothelial Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) might help to predict the clinical course of preeclampsia. The EASIX is based on the routine parameters lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, and platelet counts, thus integrating different mechanisms of systemic endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction often targets kidney dysfunction, is typically associated with increased LDH release by endothelial cells, and the interaction between endothelial cells and platelets induces platelet aggregation and consumption. Originally, EASIX was developed by Luft et al as a simple score to predict endothelial‐related complications after allogenic stem cell transplantationand to predict the risk of sepsis even before conditioning therapy. Subsequent studies revealed that EASIX can be used as a marker of endothelial complications and survival in various clinical settings: EASIX was shown to be associated with the severe course of COVID‐19 diseaseand predicted death of patients with coronary artery disease, irrespective of the timing of coronary catheterization.

### Prevalence of hypertension among pregnant women when using the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines and association with maternal and fetal outcomes [^111muUf2]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Prior studies found elevated BP using ACC/AHA thresholds was associated with abnormalities in hepatic, renal, and coagulation function, but excluded women with chronic hypertension and preeclampsia, thus limiting their ability to examine changes in hard clinical end points. Several groups have examined the application of the 2017 ACC/AHA diagnostic thresholds early in pregnancy and found that stage 1 hypertension was associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia and gestational hypertension and adverse perinatal outcomes compared with normotension. Our findings confirm and extend this prior work to examine the impact of reclassifying women using not only early pregnancy BP but also outpatient BP measurements prior to pregnancy and throughout gestation up until delivery. Our approach thus mimics clinical practice. Our methodology also took into account the prescription of antihypertensive medications in addition to ICD codes and clinic BP values, which has been shown to be superior for the classification of hypertension in an outpatient population of pregnant women.

In addition to increasing the prevalence of hypertension among women of childbearing age, the application of the 2017 ACC/AHA thresholds has several implications for the care of pregnant women. First, although a new diagnosis of chronic hypertension in a pregnant woman is not necessarily an indication for medication initiation, it is considered a high-level risk factor for the development of preeclampsia and is an indication for the initiation of low-dose aspirin prophylaxis according to the US Preventive Services Task Force. In this cohort, we found that women with chronic hypertension diagnosed using the ACC/AHA criteria who were previously classified as having gestational hypertension had a risk of preeclampsia that was even higher than that of women who were diagnosed with chronic hypertension using the ACOG criteria. Thus, there is a pool of women for whom reclassification with chronic hypertension and the initiation of aspirin as a preventative therapy to reduce risk of preeclampsia has the potential to reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, which has been suggested by secondary analyses of high-risk aspirin trials. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm this finding. Second, pregnant women with chronic and gestational hypertension are at increased risk for adverse maternal and fetal/neonatal events and are often followed more closely during their pregnancies. The appropriate identification of women at heightened risk will help to intensify clinical surveillance in previously overlooked women and may help identify and prevent impending adverse events. Third, reclassification of women also resulted in the identification of more women with gestational diabetes and could be used to target women for educational programs during pregnancy aimed at cardiovascular lifestyle modification to reduce future risk.

In this preterm cohort study, maternal HDP was independently associated with adverse cognitive and language development, with accentuated associations observed in preeclampsia-exposed preterm infants, emphasizing the clinical importance of recognizing HDP as a risk, enabling targeted risk management strategies for closer monitoring and aggressive early intervention in affected populations. Preeclampsia affects 2% to 5% of all pregnancies1, 2 and is associated with premature birth and neurodevelopmental deficits in term infants, 3 likely due to placental ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress that disrupt fetal brain development. 4–10 Hypertensive disorders. In our adjusted models, HDP exposure was associated with a 3. 69-point decrease in BSID cognitive scores and a
4. 07-point decrease in language scores. Preeclampsia demonstrated greater reductions: −4. 85 and −6. 30, respectively.

A 4- to 6-point mean reduction in BSID scores can be clinically meaningful, especially at a population level, as slight differences can signal increased risk for later cognitive, language, or motor impairments. This may be from factors such as hypoxia-ischemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation, as demonstrated in animal models. 4–10, 13 Similarly, Su et al69 found higher incidence of periventricular leukomalacia in HDP-exposed preterm infants, and Xing et al70 observed abnormal white matter development in preterm infants exposed to preeclampsia using diffusion MRI. Consequently, these findings advocate for the incorporation of infant neuroimaging and/or neurodevelopment as key outcomes in future clinical trials evaluating therapies for maternal HDP or preeclampsia.

### Preeclampsia, genomics and public health… [^117DMWNx]. blogs.cdc.gov (2022). Medium credibility.

At 29 weeks pregnant, Erica was diagnosed with preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure and signs of organ failure, most often liver or kidney damage. According to the Mayo Clinic, preeclampsia usually starts after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Though rarer, preeclampsia may also develop during the post-partum period. It can lead to seizure, stroke, preterm birth, or even death in the mother and/or baby. Due to Erica's preeclampsia symptoms, she did not carry her baby full-term. She delivered her baby during her 30th week of pregnancy. Though her baby did not have any major complications, her preeclampsia remained post-partum.

Risk factors for preeclampsia include first pregnancy; history of preeclampsia; history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, or both; history of thrombophilia; pregnancy from in vitro fertilization; family history of preeclampsia: type 1 or type 2 diabetes; or body mass index) ≥ 35 kg/m. A study done by Moufarrej and colleagues used 404 blood samples from 199 pregnant women mothers to identify and validate cfRNA transcriptomic changes that are associated with preeclampsia. Pregnant women were recruited at their first clinical visit to Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. The study aimed to build a classifier that could identify pregnant women at risk of preeclampsia at or before 16 weeks of pregnancy.

They found that increasing the number of genes included for genetic model training improved the performance of the classifier. Additionally, they found a decreased signal in hepatocyte, kidney, endothelial cell, and smooth muscle signatures across pregnancy development, and an increased platelet signal before 12 weeks of pregnancy for preeclampsia, which is consistent with common preeclampsia pathogenesis and with the specific diagnoses. Moufarrej and colleagues suggested that a series of clinical tests can be used to help to identify and stratify the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in real time, thus meeting important objectives for obstetric care, such as characterizing and stratifying the development of preeclampsia in real time.

### Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and hypertension… [^111FJDJU]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia complicates 2 to 8 percent of pregnancies and increases morbidity and mortality in the mother and child. Preeclampsia is more common in women with multiple pregnancies, and in persons with conditions associated with microvascular disease. Calcium supplementation reduces the risk of preeclampsia compared with placebo. For women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, antihypertensive drugs reduce the risk of progression to severe hypertension, but may not improve other clinical outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been associated with fetal renal failure, and beta blockers are associated with the baby being born small for its gestational age. Definition Hypertension during pregnancy may be associated with one of several conditions. Pregnancy-induced hypertension is a rise in blood pressure, without proteinuria, during the second half of pregnancy.

Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder unique to pregnancy that is usually associated with raised blood pressure and proteinuria. It rarely presents before 20 weeks' gestation. Eclampsia is one or more convulsions in association with the syndrome of preeclampsia. Preexisting hypertension is known hypertension before pregnancy, or raised blood pressure before 20 weeks' gestation. It may be essential hypertension or, less commonly, secondary to underlying disease. Incidence Pregnancy-induced hypertension affects 10 percent of pregnancies, and preeclampsia complicates 2 to 8 percent of pregnancies. Eclampsia occurs in about one out of every 2, 000 deliveries in resource-rich countries. In resource-poor countries, estimates of the incidence of eclampsia vary from one out of 100 to one out of 1, 700. Prognosis The outcome of pregnancy in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension alone is at least as good as that for normotensive pregnancies.

However, once preeclampsia develops, morbidity and mortality rise for both mother and child. For example, perinatal mortality for women with severe preeclampsia is double that for normotensive women. Perinatal outcome is worse with early gestational hypertension. Perinatal mortality also increases in women with severe essential hypertension.

### Association of preeclampsia in term births with neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring… [^114YRuXi]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Preeclampsia is a disorder of abnormal placentation, dysregulated vasculature, and maternal inflammation characterized by new-onset hypertension and organ dysfunction that affects approximately 4% of pregnancies. 1–3 A leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, it is associated with adverse maternal outcomes including seizure, stroke, renal failure, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelet count syndrome, as well as a long-term increase in maternal risk for cardiovascular disease. Children born to mothers with preeclampsia have alterations in cerebral blood flow and neuronal connectivity and are exposed to abnormal levels of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors in utero, supporting a possible causal role for preeclampsia in these outcomes. 7 However, because the definitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery, it is also a major cause of preterm birth, which may itself adversely affect neurodevelopment.

The degree to which preterm birth is a mediator of the association between preeclampsia and neurodevelopment is unclear. /90 mm Hg, an increase in systolic blood pressure ≥ 30 mm Hg, or an increase in diastolic blood pressure ≥ 15 mm Hg). 8 Before 1999, preeclampsia was reported to the birth registry in a free-text field on the data collection form; since 1999, it has been reported by selection of checkboxes for mild preeclampsia, preeclampsia, preeclampsia before 34 weeks' gestation, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome. 6, 9. Biological effects of preeclampsia on the developing brain support a causal role for preeclampsia in neurodevelopment. In particular, levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, a decoy receptor for the proangiogenic placental growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, are elevated in mothers with preeclampsia throughout pregnancy and in cord blood of neonates at delivery. 7, 37, 38.

Induction of sFlt-1 expression produces a preeclampsia phenotype in rodent models, and an early human clinical trial suggests removal may improve maternal hypertension and end-organ function and prolong pregnancy, supporting a causative role in the development of preeclampsia. 39–41 Increased sFlt.
