## Question

what does poison ivy look like

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what poison ivy looks like. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the plant's appearance and how to identify it in the field. Then, I should verify the characteristic morphology of the skin reaction it causes and its time course. Next, I will consider atypical variants like black-spot dermatitis and linear streaking. Finally, I should double-check the differential with look-alike plants and summarize the key distinguishing features so the user can confidently recognize poison ivy in both its botanical and dermatologic forms [^1149LCQk] [^115ZLV9s].

> Let me first confirm the plant morphology. Poison ivy typically has compound leaves with three leaflets, which is why the mnemonic "leaves of three, let it be" is useful, though I need to remember that some specimens may occasionally have more than three leaflets, so I shouldn't over-rely on that single rule. The leaflets are glossy and can have smooth or toothed edges, and their color changes with the seasons: reddish in spring, green in summer, and yellow, orange, or red in fall. Eastern poison ivy often grows as a hairy, ropelike vine that climbs trees or structures, whereas western poison ivy tends to be a low shrub that does not climb. Flowers are small and yellow-green, and berries are white to green-yellow or amber. Wait, let me verify the seasonal color detail — yes, multiple sources confirm the spring/fall color shift, which helps distinguish poison ivy from some look-alikes that remain green in spring [^1149LCQk] [^115ZLV9s] [^114JHMrX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the rash itself. I should confirm the classic dermatitis pattern. The allergic contact dermatitis from poison ivy is usually intensely pruritic and erythematous, often appearing in linear or streak-like configurations that mirror where the plant brushed the skin. Early lesions are papules that can evolve into vesicles or even bullae in more severe cases, and the distribution is typically on exposed areas such as the arms, legs, and face. I need to ensure the timing is accurate: in previously sensitized individuals, the rash typically appears 24–48 hours after exposure, peaks over the next several days, and resolves in 1–3 weeks; first exposures can be delayed up to about 3 weeks. Let me double-check that timeline — yes, that aligns with authoritative summaries and practice parameters [^1149LCQk] [^112pMzbE] [^111XkRTg].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical? I will now examine the black-spot variant. Within hours of high-concentration urushiol contact, an irregular, angulated black macule or lacquer-like deposit can appear on the skin or clothing due to oxidation of the oleoresin; this is not an eschar but oxidized resin adherent to the surface. Initially, I almost said this black spot was a burn or eschar — wait, that would be misleading; it is the plant resin itself oxidizing on contact with air. The black spot may precede or accompany allergic contact dermatitis and typically resolves in 1–2 weeks. I should confirm histology: yellow-to-brown discoloration of the stratum corneum is characteristic, with variable inflammation beneath. Yes, case series and clinicopathologic reports support this description [^114yAK4c] [^111GMoph] [^113nkiZU].

> Next, I should review the linear streaking pattern, because that is highly suggestive. Linear papulovesicular plaques reflect the path of urushiol as the plant drags across the skin, producing streaks of erythema, papules, and vesicles that follow lines of contact. Let me verify that this pattern is emphasized in practice parameters — it is indeed described as characteristic of Toxicodendron dermatitis and helps distinguish it from many other eczematous eruptions that are more diffuse or non-linear [^112pMzbE].

> I need to check the differential with look-alike plants so we don't misidentify. Boxelder can resemble poison ivy with three leaflets but stays green in spring, whereas poison ivy is reddish in spring; Virginia creeper has five leaflets, not three; fragrant sumac has three leaflets but is not poisonous; and poison oak shares the "leaves of three" rule but has a more shrubby growth form and different geographic distribution. Poison sumac differs markedly with 7–13 leaflets, so the "leaves of three" rule does not apply. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that poison ivy can occasionally have more than three leaflets — yes, some variants do, so I must integrate leaflet count with glossiness, seasonal color, and growth habit before concluding [^114JHMrX] [^115ZLV9s] [^115KVmYZ].

> Let me consider the key distinguishing features to synthesize. Botanically, the combination of three leaflets (usually), glossy surface, seasonal color change, and either a climbing hairy vine (eastern) or a low non-climbing shrub (western) is most consistent with poison ivy. Clinically, the skin reaction is a pruritic, erythematous, often linear papulovesicular dermatitis that appears 24–48 hours after exposure in sensitized individuals and lasts 1–3 weeks; in high-concentration exposures, a black lacquer-like spot may precede or accompany the rash. I should double-check that these elements are supported across independent sources — they are, including patient-facing and professional references [^1149LCQk] [^115ZLV9s] [^112pMzbE].

> In summary, poison ivy looks like a plant with three glossy leaflets whose color shifts with the seasons and that grows either as a hairy climbing vine or a low shrub, and it causes an intensely itchy, red, often linear papulovesicular rash within 1–2 days of exposure, occasionally preceded by a black resinous spot when urushiol concentration is high. I should confirm that I've integrated both identification and dermatitis features coherently — yes, this synthesis matches the botanical and clinical evidence base [^1149LCQk] [^115ZLV9s] [^112pMzbE].

Poison ivy is identified by its **three leaflets** per leaf [^115ZLV9s] with smooth or toothed edges, a pointed tip, and a glossy surface that is green in summer and red in spring/fall [^116ysaxp]. It grows as a vine or shrub with aerial rootlets on stems and produces small green-white flowers and white berries. The plant contains **urushiol oil** [^1149LCQk], which causes an itchy, red, streaky rash with vesicles or blisters [^112pMzbE] within 24–72 hours of contact [^1149LCQk]. Immediate washing with soap and water or a commercial cleanser [^1173s21T] can reduce severity; treat mild rashes with topical corticosteroids and cool compresses, and use oral corticosteroids for severe cases [^111bWdrS].

---

## Botanical identification

Poison ivy belongs to the genus Toxicodendron and is characterized by the following botanical features:

- **Leaves**: Compound leaves with three leaflets ("leaves of three, let it be") [^115ZLV9s]. Leaflets are oval or almond-shaped with pointed tips, smooth or toothed edges, and a glossy surface. They are green in summer and turn red or orange in spring and fall [^116ysaxp].

- **Stems**: Woody stems that may climb or trail, often with aerial rootlets visible on climbing vines.

- **Flowers and fruits**: Small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by white or grayish-white berries in late summer to early fall.

---

## Geographic distribution and habitat

Poison ivy is widely distributed across North America, particularly in the **eastern and central United States** [^notfound]. It thrives in a **variety of habitats**, including forests, woodlands, meadows, and disturbed areas such as roadsides, fence lines, and gardens. Poison ivy prefers **well-drained soils** and partial shade but can adapt to a range of environmental conditions.

---

## Clinical presentation of poison ivy dermatitis

Poison ivy dermatitis, also known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, is an allergic reaction caused by urushiol oil found in the plant's sap [^1149LCQk]. The clinical presentation typically includes:

- **Rash appearance**: Linear, erythematous (red), pruritic (itchy) papules, vesicles, or bullae [^112pMzbE] that appear within 24 to 72 hours after exposure [^112Z4p47].

- **Distribution**: The rash often appears in streaks or lines corresponding to areas of contact with the plant [^1149LCQk].

- **Severity**: The severity of the reaction varies depending on the individual's sensitivity, the amount of urushiol exposure, and the duration of contact [^1173s21T].

---

## Pathophysiology of poison ivy dermatitis

Poison ivy dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction mediated by T lymphocytes [^112Z4p47]. Upon initial exposure to urushiol, the immune system becomes sensitized, and subsequent exposures trigger an inflammatory response characterized by redness, swelling, vesiculation, and intense pruritus [^111bWdrS].

---

## Treatment and management

Effective management of poison ivy dermatitis involves the following steps:

- **Immediate decontamination**: Washing the affected area with soap and water or using commercial cleansing agents (e.g. Tecnu) within 10 to 30 minutes of exposure can significantly reduce the severity of the reaction [^1173s21T] [^112hBGDX].

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Mild to moderate cases can be treated with topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and pruritus [^111bWdrS].

- **Oral antihistamines**: Oral antihistamines may provide symptomatic relief from itching [^112fhCiQ].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Severe cases or extensive involvement may require oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone acetate, to control inflammation [^112sDW8s].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing poison ivy dermatitis primarily involves avoiding contact with the plant. Recommended strategies include:

- **Protective clothing**: Wearing long sleeves, long pants, gloves, and closed shoes when working or recreating in areas where poison ivy is present [^1149LCQk].

- **Barrier creams**: Applying barrier creams containing bentoquatam before exposure may provide additional protection [^1149LCQk].

- **Education**: Learning to identify poison ivy and recognizing its seasonal variations in appearance [^115KVmYZ].

---

## Potential complications

While poison ivy dermatitis is generally self-limited, potential complications include secondary bacterial infection from scratching, persistent hyperpigmentation or scarring, and rare systemic reactions in highly sensitized individuals [^112ZK2gt].

---

Poison ivy is a common plant that causes allergic contact dermatitis in many individuals. Recognizing its distinctive features and understanding the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management strategies are essential for effective prevention and treatment of poison ivy dermatitis.

Introduction

Black-spot poison ivy is an uncommon clinical manifestation of contact with Toxicodendron plants. Unlike allergic contact dermatitis, which typically manifests in sensitized individuals within 24–48 hours, the black lacquer that results from oxidation of the oleoresin after contact with the plant develops within hours of exposure and precedes allergic contact dermatitis, in some cases by weeks. Black-spots are usually accompanied by an irritant dermatitis reaction of varying severity. The appearance of an irregular black macule is often alarming to patients and prompts clinical evaluation. Because the diagnosis is straightforward and based on clinical appearance and history alone, biopsy is rarely done; thus, few descriptions of the pathologic findings exist in the literature. We herein report 3 characteristic cases of black-spot poison ivy with clinicopathologic correlation and review the pathophysiology of this uncommon condition.

### Hippocampal pattern separation supports reinforcement learning [^114JHMrX]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Most North American hikers develop a reflexive aversion to poison ivy, which causes a painful rash, and learn to recognize its compound leaf with three leaflets that is green in summer and red in spring and autumn. The relationship between color and season distinguishes poison ivy from other plants like boxelder, which looks similar but is green in spring. Such learning problems are challenging because similar conjunctions of features can require different responses or elicit different predictions about future events. Responses and predictions also depend on the status of other features or context. In such problems, simple feature-response learning is insufficient and representations that include multiple features (e.g. leaf shape, color, and season) must be learned.

Learning in the brain operates over qualitatively distinct representations depending on brain system. Theoretical and empirical work suggest the hippocampus rapidly forms conjunctive representations of arbitrary sets of co-occurring features, making the hippocampus critical for episodic memory. During the encoding of conjunctive representations, hippocampal computations establish a minimal representational overlap between traces of events with partially shared features, in a process called pattern separation. One solution to multi-featural learning problems that require stimuli with overlapping features to be associated with different outcomes is to encode neurally separable conjunctive representations, putatively through hippocampal-dependent computations, and to assign value to each pattern separated representation, putatively through hippocampal-striatal interactions. The same circuit and computational properties that make the hippocampus vital for episodic memory can also benefit striatal-dependent reinforcement learning by providing separated conjunctive representations over which value learning can occur.

Dermatology is frequently viewed by physician and surgical colleagues as a specialty with few emergencies. Although the majority of dermatology practice is in the office setting, cutaneous emergencies do occur through referrals from primary care and as ward consults. Even though cutaneous signs of poisoning would be an uncommon emergency consultation, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of the clinical presentations so as to be able instigate appropriate time critical treatments.

### Occupational skin disease [^113WrcbU]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis, the most common occupational skin disease, is characterized by clearly demarcated areas of rash at sites of exposure. The rash improves on removal of the offending agent. In allergic contact dermatitis, even minute exposures to antigenic substances can lead to a skin rash. Common sensitizing agents include nickel and members of the Rhus genus (e.g., poison ivy, poison oak). Severe skin irritants tend to cause immediate red blisters or burns, whereas weaker irritants produce eczematous skin changes over time. An occupational cause should be suspected when rash occurs in areas that are in contact with oil, grease, or other substances. Direct skin testing (patch or scratch) or radioallergosorbent testing may help to identify a specific trigger. Skin cancer can have an occupational link in workers with prolonged exposure to sunlight and certain chemicals, although it can take decades for lesions to develop. In workers with occupational skin disease, workplace changes and protective measures are important to prevent future exposure.

### Hippocampal pattern separation supports reinforcement learning [^1168v5iP]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Animals rely on learned associations to make decisions. Associations can be based on relationships between object features (e.g. the three leaflets of poison ivy leaves) and outcomes (e.g. rash). More often, outcomes are linked to multidimensional states (e.g. poison ivy is green in summer but red in spring). Feature-based reinforcement learning fails when the values of individual features depend on the other features present. One solution is to assign value to multi-featural conjunctive representations. Here, we test if the hippocampus forms separable conjunctive representations that enables the learning of response contingencies for stimuli of the form: AB+, B−, AC−, C+. Pattern analyses on functional MRI data show the hippocampus forms conjunctive representations that are dissociable from feature components and that these representations, along with those of cortex, influence striatal prediction errors. Our results establish a novel role for hippocampal pattern separation and conjunctive representation in reinforcement learning.

Microscopic findings

The most characteristic and consistent microscopic finding in all 3 cases was yellow-to-brown discoloration of the cornified layer. This ranged from golden brown granules to a yellowish brown-to-orange discoloration extending into the epidermis. No decoration of the pigment was seen with Fontana-Masson and Perl iron stains. The degree of associated inflammation varied in each case. In case 1, there was focal spongiosis accompanied by a mild, perivascular, largely lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with rare eosinophils. Cases 2 and 3 demonstrated varying degrees of epidermal necrosis, homogenization of papillary dermal collagen, and a largely lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with karyorrhexis (Figs 3 and 5).

### Mercury poisoning: a diagnostic challenge [^113KEYcz]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical features of mercury poisoning are nonspecific, and a detailed history is very valuable. The silvery, shiny appearance of mercury makes it very exciting and attractive for children. The overall half-life of elemental mercury in the body averages approximately 2 months. Chelation therapy with dimercaptosuccinic acid is the treatment of choice if the urine or blood level of mercury is high or the symptoms are profound. Here, we describe a 14-year-old boy with fever, respiratory distress, and body rash. Investigation leading to a diagnosis of mercury poisoning was made only after his mother presented with the similar symptoms a few days later.

### Black-spot toxicodendron dermatitis with varied presentation [^111FtELz]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article describes the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and treatment of 2 unrelated cases with different presentations of black-spot Toxicodendron dermatitis. In the first case, a healthy 7-y-old male presented with a rash consisting of black dots with localized surrounding erythema on the left arm. The rash then progressed to a vesicular, pinpoint, raised rash spreading to the face, arms, and neck. In the second case, a 4-y-old male presented with non-pruritic, black, flat, non-erythematous lesions that did not progress. This patient's older sibling had been diagnosed with poison ivy 1 wk prior, and they attended the same child care where the poison ivy was thought to be acquired. In both cases, diagnosis of black-spot Toxicodendron dermatitis was made. The black spot of Toxicodendron dermatitis is caused by urushiol oxidation on exposure to air. The subject may or may not go on to develop allergic contact dermatitis after the exposure. Diagnosis of this dermatitis is made on clinical presentation, with careful consideration of history, distribution, and lesion morphology. When allergic dermatitis does develop as in the first case, systemic treatment with oral steroids is recommended. In both of these cases the black dots completely resolved in 2 to 3 wk. Dermatologic referral for dermoscopy and biopsy may be necessary if the dermatosis does not resolve as anticipated.

The relationship between herpes simplex virus (HSV) and erythema multiforme (EM) has been well described. Many authors contend that EM (excluding Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) occurs almost exclusively as a response to HSV infection. During the past year, however, we have observed several cases of EM complicating severe Rhus allergic contact dermatitis. Although this association has been previously documented, the paucity of cases in the literature, along with our experience, suggests that this is an underreported phenomenon. We describe 4 of our cases.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^111XkRTg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis (CD) — epidemiology and clinical presentation indicate that CD is common, with 5.7 million physician visits per year, and the acute clinical expression is characterized by redness, edema, papules, vesiculation, weeping, crusting, and pruritus. The severity ranges from a mild, short-lived condition to a severe, persistent, but rarely life-threatening, disease; thinner skin sites such as the eyelids, ear lobes, and genital areas are most vulnerable, whereas the thicker palms and soles are more resistant. Exposure time to allergenic contactants varies from being brief (eg, poison ivy) to protracted (eg, nickel in jewelry or work chemicals).

Clinical presentation

Case 1

A 58-year-old woman presented with a black spot on the left arm that developed overnight and became noticeably larger over the course of a few hours (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Black-spot poison ivy in case 1. Left arm with brown macule containing central black angulated discoloration.

Case 2

A 15-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic black macule on the left arm (Fig 2). A few days before its development she had been hiking with friends who later developed what was presumed to be contact dermatitis from poison ivy exposure. She also reported similar dark spots on the clothing she was wearing the day of the hike. Examination revealed an irregular black macule on the left forearm and a few eroded plaques on the arm. Scraping with a Gillette blade easily removed the pigment without causing bleeding. A superficial shave biopsy was performed (Fig 3).

### Common pediatric and adolescent skin conditions [^112143Jm]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, and it is therefore important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo are depicted. Cutaneous growths that are found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication. Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema are comprised of scaling patches and plaques; poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids; phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases. Acne vulgaris is the most common skin disease of the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating and, therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic. Vascular anomalies are most commonly exemplified as port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress by age ten; however, there has been recent concern that certain cases may need to be treated. Dermal rashes may be localized or generalized. Treatment of generalized drug eruptions involves elimination of the inciting agent, topical antipruritics, and systemic corticosteroids for severe reactions. Infectious etiologic agents of skin disease include bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Many sexually transmitted diseases are bacterial or viral in origin and present as a rash or ulcer. Impetigo is a bacterial infection which may present as a bullous eruption or as an erosion with a honey colored crust. Other bacterial infections include erythema chronicum migrans, folliculitis, and cellulitis. Fungal infections include the various forms of tinea and are usually treated with topical antifungals; if the infection is located in a hair-bearing area, systemic antifungals are necessary. Viral infections include warts, varicella, molluscum contagiosum, and herpes. Treatment varies from observation or antivirals for varicella to cryosurgery and topical imiquimod for warts. Finally, scabies and lice are infectious agents that can be treated with permethrin and pyrethrin solutions.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^112pMzbE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) from plants — Summary Statement 245 — states that plant-related ACD is due to specific sensitization; toxicodendron dermatitis is the most common presentation with characteristic linear vesicles, and plant allergens are typically in oleoresins requiring crushing for release. Specifically, it is described that ACD from plant exposure is "the result of specific cell-mediated hypersensitivity induced by previous contact with that family of plants", that "Toxicodendron dermatitis (poison ivy) is the most common form of ACD" with "streak-like or linear papulovesicular" lesions, that "the poison ivy group of plants (Anacardiaceae) causes most cases of plant dermatitis", and that "The sensitizing substances in most plants are present mainly in the oleoresin fraction… Most plants must be crushed to release the antigenic chemicals".

Discussion

All toxicodendron plants have resin channels throughout the plant that contain urushiol oleoresins that vary in composition and concentration. When the plant is injured, the sap is extruded and, within minutes of exposure to air, the sap hardens by oxidation into a black resin to seal the injury. It is often visible on previously injured sections of the plant. This black lacquer can also form on clothing, tools, paper, and skin. The finding of the black lacquer on multiple substrates supports the conclusion that on the skin the black lacquer is not an eschar but the oleoresin itself. The oleoresin also accounts for the yellowish amorphous material often present in the stratum corneum seen on hematoxylin-eosin stained biopsy sections. The high concentration of the urushiol needed to produce the black resin accounts for the irritant contact dermatitis, which can mask pathologic features of allergic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals.

This characteristic oleoresin reaction forms the basis of the black spot test, which involves blotting an injured leaf or other plant material on a piece of white paper and waiting for black lacquer formation (a way to confirm the identity of the toxicodendron plants when the botanical identification is in question). Black-spot poison ivy is mostly reported after contact with Toxicodendron radicans and T. rydbergii. Mallory et al demonstrated the formation of the black lacquer on skin of volunteers within an hour of application of the plant. Notably, the lacquer cannot be washed off with soap and water and typically falls off in 1–2 weeks. This lacquer is similar to the lacquer created from Japanese lacquer trees, which are also within the Anacardiaceae family. That lacquer has been demonstrated to be allergenic for hundreds of years.

To prevent either black-spot poison ivy or toxicodendron dermatitis after contact with the plant, the patient should wash immediately with soap and water. If available, isopropyl alcohol applied liberally followed by copious rinsing with water after contact is more effective than soap for preventing allergic contact dermatitis. Bleach rapidly inactivates urushiol on clothing and tools, and organic solvents (alcohol, gasoline, acetone) can extract it from contaminated surfaces.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^114gtMdB]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Background — Toxicodendron dermatitis epidemiology and course: Contact dermatitis from Toxicodendron species, including poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, affects millions of Americans annually, resulting in millions of visits to health care facilities each year. Approximately 50% to 75% of individuals react to urushiol, and skin effects including redness, papules and vesicles, and itching typically start within days of exposure and can last up to 3 weeks. Therefore, initial treatment is aimed at preventing or removing exposure to urushiol, with later first aid aimed at management of symptoms, and data on treatment effectiveness are limited, with few clinical trials.

### Dermatology precautions and slower titration yield low incidence of lamotrigine treatment-emergent rash [^111fxKA2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess treatment-emergent rash incidence when using dermatology precautions (limited antigen exposure) and slower titration during lamotrigine initiation.

Method

We assessed rash incidence in 100 patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder instructed, for their first 3 months taking lamotrigine, to avoid other new medicines and new foods, cosmetics, conditioners, deodorants, detergents, and fabric softeners, as well as sunburn and exposure to poison ivy/oak. Lamotrigine was not started within 2 weeks of a rash, viral syndrome, or vaccination. In addition, lamotrigine was titrated more slowly than in the prescribing information. Patients were monitored for rash and clinical phenomena using the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder Clinical Monitoring Form. Descriptive statistics were compiled.

Results

No patient had serious rash. Benign rash occurred in 5 patients (5%) and resolved uneventfully in 3 patients discontinuing and 2 patients continuing lamotrigine. Two patients with rash were found to be not adherent to dermatology precautions. Therefore, among the remaining patients, only 3/98 (3.1%) had benign rashes.

Conclusion

The observed rate of benign rash was lower than the 10% incidence in other clinical studies. The design of this study confounds efforts to determine the relative contributions of slower titration versus dermatology precautions to the low rate of rash. Systematic studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, which suggest that adhering to dermatology precautions with slower titration may yield a low incidence of rash with lamotrigine.

### Exploring the mango-poison ivy connection: the riddle of discriminative plant dermatitis [^115V6n3L]. Contact Dermatitis (2005). Low credibility.

A relationship between sensitivity to poison oak or poison ivy and mango dermatitis has been suggested by previous publications. The observation that acute allergic contact dermatitis can arise on first exposure to mango in patients who have been sensitized beforehand by contact with other urushiol-containing plants has been documented previously. We report 17 American patients employed in mango picking at a summer camp in Israel, who developed a rash of varying severity. All patients were either in contact with poison ivy/oak in the past or lived in areas where these plants are endemic. None recalled previous contact with mango. In contrast, none of their Israeli companions who had never been exposed to poison ivy/oak developed mango dermatitis. These observations suggest that individuals with known history of poison ivy/oak allergy, or those residing in area where these plants are common, may develop allergic contact dermatitis from mango on first exposure. We hypothesize that previous oral exposure to urushiol in the local Israeli population might establish immune tolerance to these plants.

Allergic contact dermatitis caused by the Toxicodendron (formerly Rhus) species-poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac-affects millions of North Americans every year. In certain outdoor occupations, for example, agriculture and forestry, as well as among many outdoor enthusiasts, Toxicodendron dermatitis presents a significant hazard. This review considers the epidemiology, identification, immunochemistry, pathophysiology, clinical features, treatment, and prevention of this common dermatologic problem. Recent research in prevention is emphasized, and resources to help in the identification of plants are provided in the bibliography. The literature was searched using a MEDLINE query for "Toxicodendron dermatitis", and the identified article bibliographies were searched as well.

Plant dermatitis is a common pathology that plagues those who work and recreate in the North American outdoors. The most common plant family to cause dermatitis is the Toxicodendron genus, which includes the plants known by the common names of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. While mortality is usually quite low for this pathology, the incidence and prevalence of the disease leads to substantial healthcare burden and financial implications across the population. The mainstays of treatment have focused on prevention, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.

### Allergic contact sensitization in healthy skin differs from sensitization in chronic dermatitis: atopic, occupational wet work, and stasis dermatitis [^114AHqzc]. Dermatologic Clinics (2020). Medium credibility.

The duration of cutaneous inflammation preceding sensitization influences the resulting allergic response; the innate immune system instructs the adaptive immune response. Potent allergens that function as their own irritant cause classic T helper cell type 1 skewed dermatitis. Examples include poison ivy, epoxy resin, and methylchloroisothiazolinone. Less potent allergens, such as food proteins and propylene glycol, sensitize skin affected by chronic dermatitis resulting in a T helper cell type 2 skewed response, sometimes with associated systemic contact dermatitis. Systemic contact dermatitis should therefore be suspected in patients with positive patch tests to ingested allergens in the setting of chronic dermatitis.

### Safety and tolerability of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a pooled analysis [^116cuTQK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The overall incidence rate of adverse experiences in the "Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders" SOC was not meaningfully different between groups (Table 4). Two adverse experiences (acne and contact dermatitis [with approximately half of the events being "poison ivy/oak"]) were reported more frequently in the sitagliptin group compared with the non-exposed group, whereas hyperkeratosis was reported more frequently in the non-exposed group (Table 5). Rash was the only skin-related adverse experience reported by at least 1% of the patients in either group (Table 6), with an incidence rate of 1.0% in the sitagliptin group and 0.9% in the non-exposed group. No adverse experiences of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in patients in the clinical trials that were pooled for this report; one event of erythema multiforme was reported for a patient in the non-exposed group. No adverse experiences consistent with the lesions observed during the preclinical development of some other (non-sitagliptin) DPP-4 inhibitors were reported.

For the analysis of angioedema-related events and the relationship of these events to concurrent treatment with ACE inhibitors, approximately 33% of patients were on an ACE inhibitor at baseline and approximately 36% were on an ACE inhibitor at any time during the studies (for a total of 1,023 and 779 patient-years on an ACE inhibitor for the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively). Among the 6139 patients included in this pooled analysis, there were 54 incident angioedema-related events, 16 of which occurred in patients concurrently taking an ACE inhibitor. The number of incident angioedema-related events per 100 patient-years while a patient was on an ACE inhibitor was the same (0.9) in both groups. The total numbers of angioedema-related events per 100 patient-years while a patient was on an ACE inhibitor were also similar in the sitagliptin (1.1) and non-exposed (0.9) groups. For patients not on an ACE inhibitor, the numbers of incident angioedema-related events per 100 patient-years were 1.1 in the sitagliptin group and 1.3 in the non-exposed group.

### Mast cell-derived interleukin 10 limits skin pathology in contact dermatitis and chronic irradiation with ultraviolet B [^11714bfG]. Nature Immunology (2007). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis, such as in response to poison ivy or poison oak, and chronic low-dose ultraviolet B irradiation can damage the skin. Mast cells produce proinflammatory mediators that are thought to exacerbate these prevalent acquired immune or innate responses. Here we found that, unexpectedly, mast cells substantially limited the pathology associated with these responses, including infiltrates of leukocytes, epidermal hyperplasia and epidermal necrosis. Production of interleukin 10 by mast cells contributed to the anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects of mast cells in these conditions. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized function for mast cells and mast cell-derived interleukin 10 in limiting leukocyte infiltration, inflammation and tissue damage associated with immunological or innate responses that can injure the skin.

### Diagnosis and management of contact dermatitis [^111bWdrS]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous and pruritic skin lesions that occur after contact with a foreign substance. There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the non-immune-modulated irritation of the skin by a substance, leading to skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which a foreign substance comes into contact with the skin; skin changes occur after reexposure to the substance. The most common substances that cause contact dermatitis include poison ivy, nickel, and fragrances. Contact dermatitis usually leads to erythema and scaling with visible borders. Itching and discomfort may also occur. Acute cases may involve a dramatic flare with erythema, vesicles, and bullae; chronic cases may involve lichen with cracks and fissures. When a possible causative substance is known, the first step in confirming the diagnosis is determining whether the problem resolves with avoidance of the substance. Localized acute allergic contact dermatitis lesions are successfully treated with mid- or high-potency topical steroids, such as triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%. If allergic contact dermatitis involves an extensive area of skin (greater than 20 percent), systemic steroid therapy is often required and offers relief within 12 to 24 hours. In patients with severe rhus dermatitis, oral prednisone should be tapered over two to three weeks because rapid discontinuation of steroids can cause rebound dermatitis. If treatment fails and the diagnosis or specific allergen remains unknown, patch testing should be performed.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

CYANOKIT is indicated for cyanide poisoning and in this setting, patients will likely be unresponsive or may have difficulty in comprehending counseling information.

Erythema and Chromaturia

Advise patients that skin redness may last up to 2 weeks and urine coloration may last for up to 5 weeks after administration of CYANOKIT. While it is not known if the skin redness predisposes to photosensitivity, patients should be advised to avoid direct sun while their skin remains discolored.

Rash

Inform patients that an acneiform rash may appear anywhere from 7 to 28 days following hydroxocobalamin treatment. This rash will usually resolve without treatment within a few weeks.

Renal Function Monitoring

Advise patients that renal function will be monitored for 7 days following treatment with CYANOKIT or, in the event of renal impairment, until renal function returns to normal.

Pregnancy

Advise pregnant women that maternal cyanide poisoning results in fetal cyanide poisoning. Treatment for cyanide poisoning may be lifesaving for both the pregnant woman and fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to notify their provider if they were pregnant during therapy with CYANOKIT [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1)].

Lactation

Advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CYANOKIT [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.2)].

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^115fRs2G]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Patch testing safety — systemic reactions and sensitization are addressed as follows: Systemic allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) after patch testing is rare, and re-activation can occur after inhalation or ingestion of related allergens; there is also the possibility of sensitizing a previously non‑sensitized patient, particularly with plant allergens such as poison ivy or oak and aniline dyes. Exaggerated local reactivities may occur if the concentration of the test substance is too strong, and the possibility of active sensitization can be minimized by testing with dilute concentrations. Foods that can cause ACD and systemic contact dermatitis include flavoring agents (oil of cinnamon, vanilla, balsam of Peru), various spices, garlic, and raw cashew nuts.

### CD1a and skin T cells: a pathway for therapeutic intervention [^115S2oJ6]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence indicates that CD1a-dependent mechanisms are involved in ACD development. First, urushiol, which is found within poison ivy and historically considered to be a hapten, was shown to directly induce CD1a-dependent T-cell responses. Using a hCD1a-Tg mouse model, Kim et al. discovered that skin inflammation was driven by urushiol-specific CD1a-dependent CD4 + T cells with secretion of IL-17 and IL-22. This characteristic type 17 cell signature corresponded to the cytokine changes observed in humans with poison ivy dermatitis. Urushiol demonstrated the capacity to displace ganglioside GD 3 from the CD1a cleft, with potentially 20% of the urushiol molecule extending outside of the cleft.

The known repertoire of CD1a contact dermatitis allergens was extended through the discovery of farnesol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl cinnamate and coenzyme Q-compounds. These allergens were found to not require cellular processing prior to CD1a loading. Additionally, Nicolai et al. determined that farnesol could reside deeply within the CD1a cleft, adopting a medial alignment and suggesting that haptenation is not essential. Similar to urushiol, farnesol was observed to displace endogenous lipids from the CD1a groove, further supporting a hapten-independent model of ACD pathogenesis. Moreover, multiple additional contact sensitizers were shown to potentiate CD1-specific responses that were dependent on the presence of endogenous lipids, with 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) in particular, inducing activation of CD1a-reactive T cells. This resulted in enhanced secretion of IFNγ, GM-CSF, type 2 and type 22 mediators. These cells were also shown to express CLA and CCR4, suggesting that they may possess the capacity to infiltrate into the skin. Therefore, allergen-­sensitive CD1a-reactive T cells contribute to ACD development. Together, this expands upon the long-recognized model of ACD involving haptenation and a type IV hypersensitivity response.

### Wolf's isotopic response of lichen planus following contact dermatitis [^1153FD39]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 48-year-old female with a history of psoriasis on guselkumab (anti-interleukin 23 [IL-23] monoclonal antibody), diabetes controlled on metformin, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 5 years ago presented to our clinic with a painful, pruritic rash along both arms. Two years before presentation, the patient began guselkumab injections every 8 weeks for chronic psoriasis. Eight months before presentation, the patient experienced an acute episode of urushiol-induced ACD following exposure to poison ivy, with pruritus and linear vesicular streaks along both arms and upper back. This rash was severe enough to require presentation to the emergency department for systemic steroids. Her skin was clear of all rashes before and after this episode, including complete clearing of her psoriasis. Four months later, she developed a new painless papulosquamous rash along her right arm and upper back, in the same distribution as her previous contact dermatitis. She later developed similar lesions along her left wrist. Two months later, she self-discontinued guselkumab. Her papulosquamous rash persisted until presentation, but it never spread to other body sites (including nails or mucosa).

The patient presented to our dermatology clinic with well-defined thin scaly plaques showing koebnerization. This rash extended from the right posterior shoulder down to the extensor and linear surfaces of the right arm and forearm, as well as on the left wrist (Fig 1). A shave biopsy was diagnostic of LP showing wedge-shaped hypergranulosis, lymphohistiocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, and necrotic keratinocytes (Fig 2). This biopsy was taken from the left wrist for cosmetic reasons, but the clinical morphology appeared identical bilaterally.

### Topical pimecrolimus in the treatment of human allergic contact dermatitis [^116esGG8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Contact dermatitis is a common clinical problem, with prevalent sensitizers being cosmetics, metals, medicines, and plants. Plants of the Toxicodendron species cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in 50% to 70% of the population. Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam developed for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for atopic dermatitis. There are studies supporting the effectiveness of macrolactams when administered before antigen challenge, but there are no studies describing the effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of established human ACD.

Objective

To investigate the effect of topical pimecrolimus in the treatment of Toxicodendron-induced ACD once rash is evident.

Methods

Poison ivy tincture was applied to the bilateral anterior forearms of 12 subjects with Finn Chambers (Allerderm Diagnostic Products, Petaluma, CA). After dermatitis was evident, volunteers treated each arm twice daily with either 1% topical pimecrolimus cream or placebo in a blinded fashion. Outcomes measured were a dermatitis grading score and time to rash and itch resolution.

Results

The median ± SEM time for rash resolution was 16.55 ± 1.59 days in the treatment group and 16.27 ± 1.82 days in the placebo group (P = 0.601). The median time for itch resolution was 4.73 ± 1.56 days in the treatment group and 4.91 ± 1.59 days in the placebo group (P = 0.167). The average dermatitis score was 2.26 ± 0.17 in the treatment group and 2.32 ± 0.15 in the placebo group (P = 0.62).

Conclusions

The application of topical pimecrolimus is ineffective in the treatment of ongoing Toxicodendron-induced ACD.

### Whip-like rash in hospitalized patient [^116hKZxc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 59-year-old man with a past medical history notable for intravenous drug use and hypertension, presented with back pain, neurologic deficits (left arm numbness, slurred speech, confusion) and a curvilinear whip-like rash on the back (Fig 1). He had been treating his back pain with acetaminophen, menthol, and heating pads. Work-up was notable for severe hyponatremia, scattered microhemorrhages on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and bacteriuria. Spinal MRI showed vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural abscesses at multiple spinal levels. Transesophageal echocardiogram was suggestive of endocarditis. Skin biopsy results are shown (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the dermatologic diagnosis?
A. Flagellate erythema
B. Vasculitis
C. Thermal injury
D. Purpura fulminans
E. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome

Answers:

A. Flagellate erythema – Incorrect. Although the rash has a whip-like shape in some regions, this patient lacks exposure to common causes including shiitake mushrooms and bleomycin.
B. Vasculitis – Incorrect. Although the rash has a dusky/purpuric appearance, the morphology (eg, curvilinear patches and eroded plaques) and distribution only on the back is atypical for vasculitis.
C. Thermal injury – Correct. Recent exposure to a heating pad and the morphology of the rash (eg, erythema and erosions in geometric shapes in area where heating pad was applied) make thermal injury the most likely diagnosis. Although erythema ab igne can result from long-term heating pad use, exam findings were consistent with thermal burn rather than erythema ab igne given lack of reticulated erythema/dyspigmentation.
D. Purpura fulminans – Incorrect. Although purpura fulminans can occur in the setting of endocarditis and sepsis, the geometric shape of the rash and localization to the back makes purpura fulminans less likely.
E. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) – Incorrect. Although SSSS can occur in the setting of S. aureus bacteremia, the patient's rash does not show the classic periorificial radial fissuring or intertriginous involvement of SSSS. Furthermore, SSSS is a more superficial process that involves toxins causing denuded skin from a subcorneal split. SSSS is also less common in adults with normal renal function.

### A rapidly fluctuating rash in a stuporous patient [^116oywm7]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Table I
Laboratory evaluation studies performed to screen for metabolic, infectious, and toxic etiologies for the patient's neurologic and cutaneous findings

After admission, he became stuporous and lost control of bowel and bladder functions. Further laboratory evaluation was remarkable for slightly elevated protein and glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (Table I). Other tests for metabolic and infectious causes as well as toxic drug or alcohol ingestion as the etiology of his neurologic status was negative (Table I). On the third day after admission, the dermatology service was consulted for a blotchy erythematous rash on his face and chest. Ancillary history showed no recent history of fish ingestion, which might implicate scombroid poisoning.

Clinical examination revealed a young man who was completely unresponsive to physical or verbal stimuli. Cutaneous examination was significant for multiple blotchy pink macules and patches varying in size from 3 mm to several centimeters. They were distributed symmetrically on the face, neck, and upper portion of the trunk, with fewer lesions on the upper portion of the thighs. Notably, the blotchy patches appeared then disappeared in a matter of seconds to 1–2 minutes (Fig 1 and Video 1). Based upon a literature review, the possibility of central nervous system (CNS)-driven autonomic neurovascular dysregulation was raised. Laboratory evaluation for metabolic causes of flushing was also conducted (Table I).

Fig 1
A rapidly fluctuating rash in a stuporous patient. A, Initial clinical examination revealed numerous blotchy pink macules and patches on the face, neck, and chest. B, Within 2 minutes, the rash spread to involve much broader areas of the chest, arms, and neck, and there was resolution of the initial sites (inked areas).

By the next day, the differential diagnosis for his neurologic dysfunction had narrowed to include a toxic ingestion driven by synthetic cannabinoids, BWC, and viral encephalitis. Based upon additional consultation by the psychiatry service and toxicology team, the clinical diagnosis of BWC was favored, and the patient was started on 2 mg of intravenous lorazepam every 8 hours, which led to rapid clinical improvement in his neurologic status and more gradual resolution of the fluctuating erythema. Given his response, the final clinical diagnosis was BWC. He was discharged 5 days after his first intravenous lorazepam dose on 5.5 mg of oral lorazepam daily to be tapered by 0.5 mg each week.

Figure 2.
Circumferential erythema, edema, and vesicles over left ankle and lower leg of boy along with marking nut brought by the parents. This figure appears in color at.

The Indian marking nut (Semecarpus anacardium) has an important role in Indian traditional medicine and folklore. The brown-black juice of the nut has been used by dhobis (washermen) to leave an indelible mark on laundry. This had resulted in several cases of "dhobi-mark" or "marking-nut" dermatitis in British soldiers posted in India. This indigenous nut has been used in diverse situations including voodoo treatment, as an amulet, abortifacient, hair colorant, in the treatment of joint pains, alopecia areata, chronic skin conditions, and tattoo removal. It belongs to the genus Toxicodendron and the family Anacardiaceae. Several plants of this genus (such as poison ivy, poison sumac, poison oak, and the cashew nut tree) are infamous for contact dermatitis. The juice of the marking nut contains bhilawanol, a mixture of alkyl catechols, which is similar to other urushiols of the Toxicodendron genus. It can cause both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. Ectopic contact dermatitis (transmitted through hands) in areas such as face and genitalia, airborne contact dermatitis, and spread through contaminated mail has also been reported. Clinical features can include pruritus, erythema, papules, urticaria, vesicles, bullae, periorbital edema, and erythema multiforme-like lesions. Nephrotoxicity may rarely occur because of systemic absorption. The history and awareness about the marking nut were crucial in diagnosing our patients. It is thus important to be aware of ethnobotany and cultural dermatoses in the tropics.

A woman in her 30s with no significant medical history presented to her primary care provider with a small red "bump" and surrounding swelling on her back. She also noted having a rash in her left axilla with an ipsilateral swollen lymph node. Due to concern for cellulitis, she was started on cephalexin. Her symptoms progressed the next day despite 3 doses of cephalexin, with larger, warm, and more painful bumps on her back with increased swelling, prompting her to visit the emergency department. Additional symptoms included weeping and crusting of the bumps with the worst pain in the center of the targetoid lesion. Exposure history revealed that she had been hiking in the Northeast region a few days before symptom onset, but she denied seeing any ticks. She also denied exposure to poison ivy, chemical agents, or other irritants. She had never had a similar rash in the past but did tend to have exuberant reactions to bug bites. Additional systemic symptoms included mild cough, bilateral hip pain, and headache. Review of symptoms was otherwise negative.

Physical examination revealed normal vital signs and a 2-cm soft, tender, mobile lymph node in the left anterior axillary fold with no other lymphadenopathy. Skin examination showed a large, circular, well-demarcated erythematous plaque on the back with a central cluster of herpetiform vesicles, bullae, and purple necrotic puncta (Fig 1), as well as erythematous patches on the anterior aspect of the chest and left lateral aspect of the breast. Initial laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (25 mm/hr) and C-reactive protein (174 mg/L), while the complete blood count with differential was unremarkable. Bacterial wound cultures and blood cultures showed no growth. Herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and Ehrlichia / Anaplasma polymerase chain reactions were negative. There was no evidence of malaria or babesiosis on Giemsa blood smears. Lyme immunoglobulin M and G antibodies were not detected.

### Cooling the itch via TRPM8 [^114FAz7t]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Cooling is an effective temporary remedy for itch, bringing welcome relief to itchy insect bites, nettle stings, poison ivy, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Menthol, causing a cooling sensation, has similar itch-relieving effects. Palkar et al. demonstrate that TRPM8, a menthol- and cold-activated ion channel, is essential for cooling to relieve itch, suggesting that pharmacologic TRPM8 activation should be explored further as an antipruritic strategy.

### Shiitake dermatitis: experience of the poison control centre network in France from 2014 to 2019 [^113z1cwq]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Shiitake mushrooms (Lentinus edodes) are an edible fungus, initially grown in Japan and China that are increasingly marketed in Europe. We previously presented 15 shiitake dermatitis cases reported to Poison Control Centres (PCCs) in France from January 2000 to December 2013. The aim of this study was to describe changes in the number of shiitake dermatitis cases since 2014, and to better describe the clinical characteristics and risk factors of this reaction.

Case Series

This observational study is a retrospective review of cases in the French PCCs database between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2019. Out of 125 shiitake exposures, we identified 59 cases of dermatitis: sex ratio of 1.80M/F; ages ranging from 19 to 69years (median: 39years). Dermatitis occurred after raw or undercooked shiitake consumption (e.g., from the wok, in soup, or on pizza). The rash appeared 1–168h (median: 48h) after shiitake ingestion. Linear, erythematous, urticarial papules and plaques developed across the trunk, arms, and legs within a few hours and persisted for 1–40d (median 10d). The amount of shiitake eaten (low vs. medium vs. high) significantly increased the duration of dermatitis (median days 4 vs. vs. 15, respectively; p = .007). In all, 38 patients received corticosteroids, antihistamine drugs, or both without demonstrated benefit. All patients made a complete recovery.

Conclusions

The mechanism of shiitake dermatitis is thought to involve lentinan, a heat-labile polysaccharide component. Inadequate cooking clearly seems to be a driver of the occurrence of shiitake dermatitis. This study highlighted a dose-dependent response, suggesting a partial toxic mechanism or a th1-type hypersensitivity mechanism. Treatment is focused on symptom management. Health professionals and the general population should be aware of both the risk associated with inadequately cooked shiitake consumption and the favourable prognosis of this still poorly known toxic dermatitis.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Methylprednisolone acetate [^116SYra7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets, USP is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 mg to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 mg to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single-dose of 80 mg to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 mg to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dose of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Notes from the field: rubella infection in an unvaccinated pregnant woman-Johnson county, Kansas, December 2017 [^112HkKka]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

On December 14, 2017, a school nurse notified the Johnson County (Kansas) Department of Health and Environment (JCDHE) that a student's mother (patient) had received a diagnosis of rubella. The school nurse learned of the patient's diagnosis when the patient picked up her daughter at school the day of the diagnosis. Follow-up by JCDHE revealed that the U.S.-born patient, aged 27 years, was 19 weeks pregnant and had not been vaccinated against rubella because of personal choice. She had tested negative for rubella by immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology during her first trimester of pregnancy.

On December 6, the patient visited a hospital emergency department complaining of palpitations, a burning, itchy rash, and fever. On December 9, she visited a second emergency department and was told she was having an allergic reaction. After conducting an Internet search, she suspected her symptoms might be caused by rubella and contacted her obstetrician, who referred her to a primary care provider. On December 12, the primary care provider submitted a blood specimen to a commercial laboratory for rubella immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing, which was reported as positive on December 14; the provider informed the patient but did not notify JCDHE.

JCDHE determined the patient had no travel history. When the patient was 15 weeks pregnant (17 days before her rash onset), her unvaccinated U.S.-born brother, aged 22 years, stayed in her home after returning from India, a country with endemic rubella transmission. The brother had a rash on his lower extremities that was diagnosed as poison ivy. Specimens from the patient and brother were collected and submitted to CDC; results were rubella IgG-positive with low avidity, indicating recent infection.

Among approximately 120 contacts of the patient, three were not vaccinated, including the patient's daughter, aged 11 years, one hospital staff member, and the patient's female coworker at a call center. All three were advised to avoid contact with pregnant women for 23 days; the patient's daughter and the hospital staff member were excluded from school and work, respectively, for 21 days.

### VisualDx: decision-support software for the diagnosis and management of dermatologic disorders [^111x2R2W]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The VisualDx system (http://www.logicalimages.com/prodVDx.htm) is a JAVA-based decision-support program developed by Logical Images to be used in clinical care to develop differential diagnoses based upon morphologic finding- and patient finding-driven searching. It consists of several modules, many of which are very relevant to infectious diseases specialists, such as Fever & Rash; International Travel; Drug Eruptions; Smallpox Vaccination; Terrorism Recognition; Immunocompromised, HIV or AIDS; Female Genital Rashes & Growths; and Male Genital Rashes & Growths. Unlike books and atlases indexed by disease, with VisualDx, clinicians can enter patient descriptors and lesion morphologies, resulting in rapid assistance with differential diagnosis. VisualDx also increases clinician awareness of, knowledge about, and skills in the recognition of chemical warfare, bioterrorism, and radiation injuries.

### CD1a on Langerhans cells controls inflammatory skin disease [^116GaSqN]. Nature Immunology (2016). Medium credibility.

CD1a is a lipid-presenting molecule that is abundantly expressed on Langerhans cells. However, the in vivo role of CD1a has remained unclear, principally because CD1a is lacking in mice. Through the use of mice with transgenic expression of CD1a, we found that the plant-derived lipid urushiol triggered CD1a-dependent skin inflammation driven by CD4(+) helper T cells that produced the cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 (TH17 cells). Human subjects with poison-ivy dermatitis had a similar cytokine signature following CD1a-mediated recognition of urushiol. Among various urushiol congeners, we identified diunsaturated pentadecylcatechol (C15:2) as the dominant antigen for CD1a-restricted T cells. We determined the crystal structure of the CD1a-urushiol (C15:2) complex, demonstrating the molecular basis of urushiol interaction with the antigen-binding cleft of CD1a. In a mouse model and in patients with psoriasis, CD1a amplified inflammatory responses that were mediated by TH17 cells that reacted to self lipid antigens. Treatment with blocking antibodies to CD1a alleviated skin inflammation. Thus, we propose CD1a as a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory skin diseases.

### Shiitake dermatitis recorded by French poison control centers-new case series with clinical observations [^116BgMrn]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) is an edible mushroom which was initially grown in Japan and China and is now sold on the European market. Flagellate erythema may arise following shiitake consumption and was first described in Japan in 1974.

Objective

This paper reports a French shiitake dermatitis case series.

Methods

The findings of retrospective study of shiitake dermatitis cases, reported to French Poison Control Centres (PCC) from January 2000 to December 2013, are reported.

Results

Among 32 exposed patients, 15 presented flagellate urticarial lesions after raw shiitake consumption. The first case of this series was reported in 2006 and the last nine cases were reported as of 2012. After shared meals, no symptoms were reported among guests, who preferred cooked shiitake to the raw mushroom. In this series, rashes appeared 12 h to 5 days (median: 24 h) after raw shiitake ingestion. Linear and itchy urticarial lesions formed on the trunk, arms, and legs within a few hours and persisted for 3–21 days. In four cases, rash and pruritus were either triggered or worsened by sun exposure. Eleven patients received corticosteroids, antihistamines, or both. All patients completely recovered.

Conclusion

Due to the rapidly increasing consumption of exotic food in Western countries, it is no surprise that cases of shiitake dermatitis are now appearing in Europe. The mechanism of shiitake dermatitis is thought to be toxic and due to lentinan, a polysaccharide component of the mushroom. There is no specific validated treatment for shiitake dermatitis. Health professionals and the general population should be aware of both the risk associated with raw shiitake consumption and of the good prognosis of this very spectacular and uncomfortable toxic dermatitis.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:

A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Idiopathic extensive acanthosis nigricans with a variant of the epidermal growth factor receptor [^111q6zEe]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 23-year-old white woman was referred to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of severe AN. The plaques first appeared around the age of 6 years on the posterolateral neck. They had progressively gotten darker and thicker, involving additional areas, particularly during menarche and pregnancy. The plaques were neither painful nor pruritic. The patient described having a normal weight throughout her childhood and adolescence but reported a 60-pound weight gain that she maintained after her 2 recent pregnancies. She had regular menses since menarche at the age of 12 years. Findings from a complete review of systems were negative except for progressive worsening of AN.

Past medical history was significant for reported hyperinsulinemia diagnosed at age 4 years after a corticosteroid injection for contact dermatitis caused by poison ivy. She did not have any chronic medical conditions. She was not taking any medications at the time of presentation except for a Mirena intrauterine device (Bayer, Whippany, NJ). Past use of an oral contraceptive pill was not associated with a change in AN. Over the years, she was treated with metformin (up to 2000 mg), isotretinoin, and various topical regimens, including 40% urea, 0.025% tretinoin cream, and 4% hydroquinone cream, all without improvement. There was no family history of AN or other genetic conditions.

Physical examination showed that the patient was a nondysmorphic female with a height of 170 cm and body mass index of 32 kg/m 2. She was Fitzpatrick skin type II. An examination of the skin showed symmetric, extensive, papillomatous, hyperpigmented velvety plaques on the neck and axillae (Fig 1). Additionally, she had hyperpigmented velvety plaques on the lateral eyes, perioral region, inframammary folds, antecubital fossae, volar wrists, and inguinal folds. There was no evidence of masculinization, lymphadenopathy, cushingoid features, or organomegaly.

### Allergic contact dermatitis frommasquerading as toxicodendron dermatitis [^111r3pwz]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Given its attractive appearance and its practical uses for shade and timber, Grevillea species have grown in popularity in the United States. In Australia, ACD secondary to Grevillea robusta exposure is often referred to as "Australia's poison ivy" and is a common cause of occupational dermatitis among woodworkers, including landscapers, carpenters, and saw-mill workers, and possibly the most common cause of phytodermatitis in the region. There are few reported cases of ACD developing from exposure to Grevillea species outside of Australia. To our knowledge, the most recent reports of Grevillea -related ACD in the United States, besides the case presented here, were in Hawaii in 1992 as described by Knight and Whitesell. In their report, they described 3 cases of dermatitis, including 1 patient who recently used silk-oak timber for woodworking and 2 patients, who were exposed to sawdust in the home after their spouses worked directly with the plant.

Grevillea dermatitis closely mimics Toxicodendron dermatitis, presenting with linear papulovesicular plaques at the sites of exposure to one of several plant-specific resorcinol derivatives with long-side chains that structurally resemble and may indeed cross-react with urushiol — a concerning prospect given the high prevalence of Toxicodendron sensitization in the United States. In addition to Grevillea robusta and the hybrid 'Robyn Gordon', other less popular Grevillea species, including Grevillea banskii, Grevillea hookeriana, and the "Mason's hybrid" are also known phytoallergens.

One other plant, the poodle-dog bush (Eriodictyon parryi), has also been described to elicit a dermatitis that closely mimics that of the Toxicodendron family. This is a perennial woody bush in the Hydrophyllacea family native to California that thrives in soil that has been disrupted by fires or landslides. In the setting of the worsening wild fires plaguing the west coast, it is positioned to become a potentially important source of phytodermatitis of which dermatologists should also be aware. The treatment in both cases includes strict avoidance of the plant, which may necessitate the removal of the plant from home gardens.

### Allergic contact dermatitis frommasquerading as toxicodendron dermatitis [^115uHYHV]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is one of several hybrid Grevillea genus plants. This species is characterized by attractive, tall bushes with toothbrush-like flowers and leathery seed capsules. Despite the oak-like appearance of the tree's bark, the Grevillea species belongs to the Proteaceae family and is unrelated to the true-oak (Quercus) species. Native to Australia, Grevillea species are highly adaptable, and thus, have also been imported to the warmer and semitropical regions of the United States, including parts of Arizona, California, Florida, and Hawaii. They produce perennial flowers and are increasingly used as ornamental plants. The medium-to-large trees of the Grevillea species can also be used as shade trees for tea and coffee plantationsand as timber for furniture, flooring, and, less commonly, wooden jewelry.

Grevillea species contain long chain alkyl resorcinols, which are phenolic compounds that are structurally similar to the sensitizing urushiols from poison ivy. They are a known cause of occupational dermatitis among arborists in Australia, and along with the poodle-dog bush, one of 2 plant species known to cause eruptions that closely mimic Toxicodendron dermatitis. Despite its growing use as an ornamental shrub, Grevillea is not a well-recognized cause of phytodermatitis in the United States. Herein, we present a case of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in the setting of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' exposure in Oakland, California.

### Characteristics of tianeptine exposures reported to the national poison data system-United States, 2000–2017 [^1134h4Wq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Exposure medical outcomes were classified according to American Association of Poison Control Centers definitions as either no effect, minor outcome, moderate outcome, severe outcome, or death. Minor outcomes were defined as symptoms that were minimally bothersome to the patient, usually resolved rapidly, and often involved skin or mucous membrane manifestations, after which the patient returned to a preexposure state of well-being with no residual disability or disfigurement. Moderate outcomes were defined as symptoms that were more pronounced, more prolonged, or of a more systemic nature than minor symptoms but were not life threatening; usually requiring some form of treatment, after which the patient returned to a preexposure state of well-being with no residual disability or disfigurement. Major outcomes were defined as symptoms that were life threatening or resulted in a significant residual disability or disfigurement. Withdrawal-associated tianeptine calls were analyzed separately for clinical effects and performed therapies. Summaries of two cases reported in 2016 are presented for illustrative purposes (Supplementary Table).

### Toxic exanthems in the adult population [^115Cwa1N]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Frequently the internist is confronted with the nonspecific exanthematous eruption. While often a sign of a benign and self-limiting process, an exanthem also might herald the development of a more severe systemic syndrome. Infections, immune-mediated processes, drug reactions, a neoplasm, and familial syndromes with poor prognoses might all manifest initially with an exanthem. A thorough history and complete physical examination should be performed on all patients who present with an exanthem. Characterization of the exanthem morphology, other physical examination findings, and review of systems can help guide laboratory testing and ensure prompt diagnosis and early treatment of potentially life-threatening conditions. This article provides a brief overview of the conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of an ill patient with an exanthem.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^117TVTNh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### Cutaneous manifestation of drug allergy and hypersensitivity [^112anRqS]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Drug hypersensitivity reactions may manifest with either organ-specific or systemic symptoms, but cutaneous eruptions are the most common manifestations. Different medications may cause identical skin symptoms, whereas hypersensitivity to a single drug may manifest with various patterns of symptoms depending on the pathomechanism of hypersensitivity. Drug reactions should be also taken into account in the differential diagnosis of numerous skin rashes. Analysis of morphology of drug-induced lesions, about potential immunologic or nonimmunological mechanisms, is important for the final diagnosis. Thus, here the authors present a morphologic approach to the diagnosis of cutaneous drug-induced eruptions.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1%) [^115KDSXL]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Primary skin infections: Impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Secondary skin infections: Infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial super-infections of fungal or viral infections. Please Note: Gentamicin Sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. Gentamicin Sulfate is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with Gentamicin Sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections, and greasy, secondary infections, such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis.

### Drug-mediated rash: erythema multiforme versus Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^111hNz9k]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 92-year-old woman presented with an acute onset generalised maculopapular rash with associated mucosal involvement, on a background of recent start of griseofulvin. The rash progressed rapidly over 2 days to involve most of her body, however, mucosal involvement was limited to her oral mucosa. Characteristic target lesions appeared at 72 h, and a diagnosis of erythema multiforme secondary to griseofulvin was made after further investigation and skin biopsy. The patient was monitored closely for progression of the rash and other indicators of more severe dermatological conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She was managed symptomatically, with resolution of the rash in 4 weeks and full recovery to her premorbid level of functioning. This case details the diagnostic and management approach to erythema multiforme, a condition that warrants thorough consideration for the differential of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Case report

A 24 year old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department and was hospitalized for a painful rash. One week before admission, a progressive, tender, blistering rash developed, involving the left side of his upper chest, left arm and left hand. His lips, oral mucosa, and tongue were also involved with associated erosions and pain in his gums. The patient denied known precipitating factors including associated medication use, preceding infections, new or different topical products, travel history, insect bites, new or multiple sexual partners, and close contacts with similar eruptions. He did, however, report a similar rash on his right leg and groin 1 month before admission that resolved spontaneously with dark spots. The patient had no known allergies, and no personal or family history of skin disease. The patient vehemently denied use of drugs and alcohol. He works in a car factory on an assembly line and denied exposure to chemicals. He reports that since admission, the rash is stable and denies new areas of involvement.

Skin examination found blanching, erythematous to violaceous patches and plaques with sharply defined borders on the left side of the upper chest, shoulder, and arm (Fig 1, A). Tender, tense bullae were found on the left shoulder and left lateral arm (Fig 1, B). Thick yellow-brown plaques with yellow crust were noted on his right thumb. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was also noted on the proximal right leg and inguinal fold. Superficial erosions on his tongue and oral commissures with hemorrhagic crust were also noted, and the nasal tip contained a crusted plaque (Fig 1, C).

### CD1-mediated immune responses in mucosal tissues: molecular mechanisms underlying lipid antigen presentation system [^111RMtvW]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple plant-derived lipid allergens have been identified. They include urushiol in poison ivy, which causes allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). This is partially mediated by the presentation of pentadecylcatechol (C15:2) in urushiol by CD1a since group 1 CD1-deficient wild-type mice demonstrate milder urushiol-induced ACD than CD1a-transgenic mice. Similarly, farnesol, an ingredient in cosmetics that can cause severe ACD, can bind to CD1a. Phospholipids in cypress pollen may also be the cause of allergy to this pollen; the CD1a- and CD1d-restricted T cells in the blood of cypress pollen-sensitive subjects have more cytokine production and proliferation in response to pollen-derived phospholipids than equivalent cells from control subjects.

The endogenous lipids that arouse CD1-restricted T cell responses include phospholipids, GSLs, and cholesteryl ester. In healthy conditions, most of these self-lipids are in cell membranes or organelles. Sebaceous-gland lipids such as squalene and wax esters in the extracellular space can also bind to CD1a. These lipids lack a polar head group that protrudes outside of CD1a and can be recognized by CD1a-autoreactive TCRs. Other pathogenic CD1-binding lipids may arise during specific conditions that induce the overexpression of self-lipid antigens; these conditions include ER/mitochondrial stress –, bacterial infection, and exposure to specific allergens.

### Scombroid fish poisoning [^1117oD3s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

A 42-year-old man presented with a 60-minute history of a burning and itching cutaneous eruption, accompanied by headache and metallic dysgeusia. Large areas of flushing without wheals, mainly over the face and trunk, were noted (Figure 1). Vital signs were normal. The rash was first noted 10 minutes after the consumption of tuna fish (Thunnus spp.) in a restaurant near Rio de Janeiro's financial district. He had no history of fish allergy or other food or drug hypersensitivity reactions. An antihistamine was prescribed, with complete resolution within 24 hours. He developed no hypersensitivity reactions on subsequent ingestions of tuna. The clinical picture was considered consistent with ichthyosarcotoxism resulting from scombroid fish poisoning.

Several marine animals are capable of producing toxins that can induce seafood-related disease. Ichthyosarcotoxism refers to seafood-related disease caused by the ingestion of toxins present in fish tissues. Histamine fish poisoning, also known as scombroid fish poisoning, is a foodborne illness associated with the consumption of fish that has been stored improperly after being caught. The term scombroidism derives from the dark-meat species of the Scombridae family (such as tuna, bonito, skipjack, marlin, and mackerel), although many other non-scombroid species (such as herring, sardines, anchovies, and mahi-mahi) may be implicated in the syndrome. The condition is probably underreported, underrecognized, and misdiagnosed as an IgE-mediated fish allergy. Presentation shares a resemblance to an allergic reaction and varies from a mild, short, self-limited illness to severe and life-threatening poisoning. –

Differentiating the High-Risk Morbilliform Drug Eruptions

In this section, we discuss the clinical features that lead to the final diagnosis of high-risk eruptions; salient findings are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Differentiating high-risk eruptions

AGEP

In the early stages of evolution, AGEP is distinguished from other morbilliform eruptions by the development of erythematous pustules that may be confused with pinpoint papules or vesicles, overlying erythematous patches. Palmar or plantar involvement is rare. Typically patients will present with high-risk involvement including the face, but pustules will first be found in the intertriginous sites including the neck, axilla, and inframammary folds (Fig. 2). Close examination within affected areas is often required to identify this hallmark feature that often appears early in the disease course. Violaceous hyperpigmentation may also be seen in more pigmented skin tones. Finally, as this condition resolves, collarettes of scale and extensive superficial exfoliation can be appreciated in areas where pustules were previously present.

Fig. 2
Characteristic pustules of AGEP in intertriginous areas. Erythematous pustules in the inframammary fold or other intertriginous sites are characteristic of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)

Clinically, patients tend to present sooner after drug initiation compared with other SCARs, often within 48 h of drug initiation with constitutional symptoms, including fevers and malaise, but generally lack features — such as mucosal involvement — which may be seen in other complex eruptions. Demographic factors can also be considered, as prior work has demonstrated that individuals who are obese and those with a history of previous drug allergy are at an elevated risk for the development of AGEP compared with other SCARs. Antibiotics are the most common cause of AGEP, reflecting that this condition often develops in patients who are being treated for bacterial infections. Finally, with regard to laboratory parameters, leukocytosis with neutrophilia is commonly present (often in greater than 80% of affected individuals), with concurrent eosinophilia being less commonly seen.

### In the pursuit of classifying severe cutaneous adverse reactions [^117Esvh4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

We suggest adding an additional type of lesion to the existing 4 types of lesions of the erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), namely "flat typical target" and call the original typical targets "raised typical target". The EM group would consist of raised typical targets and raised atypical targets, similar to the original definition, and the SJS/TEN group would consist of flat typical targets, flat atypical targets and macules with or without blisters. In our proposed modified classification (Table 1), all the lesions that are found in the EM group are raised, whereas all lesions that characterize the SJS/TEN group are flat, even though they have blisters on them.

### Methylprednisolone acetate (depo-medrol) [^112sDW8s]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of MEDROL®Tablets (methylprednisolone tablets, USP) is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending upon the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dose of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Newborn skin: part I. common rashes and skin changes [^116mb6uv]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Rashes in the newborn period are common and most are benign. Infections should be suspected in newborns with pustules or vesicles, especially in those who are not well-appearing or have risk factors for congenital infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection can cause sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay. Skin manifestations of cytomegalovirus may include petechiae due to thrombocytopenia. The most common skin manifestations of early congenital syphilis are small, copper-red, maculopapular lesions located primarily on the hands and feet that peel and crust over three weeks. Erythema toxicum neonatorum and neonatal pustular melanosis are transient pustular rashes with characteristic appearance and distribution. Neonatal acne is self-limited, whereas infantile acne may benefit from treatment. Milia can be differentiated from neonatal acne by their presence at birth. Cutis marmorata and harlequin color change are transient vascular phenomena resulting from inappropriate or exaggerated dilation of capillaries and venules in response to stimuli.

Virus‐induced maculopapular exanthema

Although skin biopsies are rarely taken from viral skin lesions, because the features observed are mostly not very specific, biopsies might be an option to differentiate viral exanthema from drug‐induced exanthema in COVID‐19 patients; in these cases, it is essential to do the differential diagnosis and rule out the pharmacological cause.

To distinguish infectious exanthema from exanthema induced by drug hypersensitivity reactions, histologic features and immunologic changes in the skin might help to diagnostically differentiate both entities.

Immunologic features of maculopapular virus exanthema known so far are summarized in Figure 5A. Typical histologic features of infectious exanthema induced by viremia or dissemination of infectious agents through the blood are shown in Table 2 and Figure 6A.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most frequent adverse reactions to potassium iodide are stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash, and salivary gland swelling or tenderness. Less frequent adverse reactions include gastrointestinal bleeding, confusion, irregular heartbeat, numbness, tingling, pain or weakness in hands or feet, unusual tiredness, weakness or heaviness of legs, fever, and swelling of neck or throat. Thyroid adenoma, goiter, and myxedema are possible side effects.

Iodism or chronic iodine poisoning may occur during prolonged treatment or with the use of high doses. The symptoms of iodism include burning of mouth or throat, severe headache, metallic taste, soreness of teeth and gums, symptoms of head cold, irritation of the eyes with swelling of the eyelids, unusual increase in salivation, acneform skin lesions in the seborrheic areas, and rarely, severe skin eruptions. If symptoms of iodism appear, the drug should be withdrawn and the patient given appropriate supportive therapy.

Hypersensitivity to iodides may occur and may be manifested by angioedema, cutaneous and mucosal hemorrhage, and signs and symptoms resembling serum sickness, such as fever, arthralgia, lymph node enlargement, and eosinophilia.

### Papular-vesicular rash in COVID-19 [^111FfNh2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

The rash usually appears 3 days after the onset of systemic symptoms and disappears by 8 days. The characteristic features of this vesicular exanthem are mild/absent pruritus, frequent trunk involvement, small size, scattered distribution of lesions, and heals without scar. Two morphological patterns of this rash are 1) widespread polymorphic pattern — more common, consisting of small papules, vesicles, and pustules, and 2) localized pattern — less prevalent, consisting of monomorphic lesions over anterior or posterior trunk.

The histology shows dyskeratosis, ballooning multinucleated cells, and scanty necrotic keratinocytes with lymphocytic satellitosis. Dermal and vessel wall edema, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and red blood cells (RBCs) extravasation are the other findings seen.

Varicella-like exanthem is a COVID-19-specific rash whose identification is helpful in the clinical diagnosis.

### Paederus dermatitis acquired in the Gambia [^111K78jh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old woman presented with a 4-day history of a sudden-onset painful rash on both arms, diarrhea, and a hoarse voice after recent travel to Senegal and the Gambia. The symptoms started on the second day of her trip to the Gambia. There was no relevant past medical history.

On examination, there were multiple erythematous and hyperpigmented patches with mild peripheral scaling on the right upper limb, the medial aspect of the left arm, and the left breast. The rest of the physical examination was normal. Photographs of early lesions showed central desquamation. The distribution of the lesions on the distal right arm and proximal right forearm (Figure 1A) and those on the left arm and breast (Figure 1B) exhibited the characteristics of "kissing lesions". These are discrete, well-defined lesions occurring in mirror-image locations on opposing skin surfaces. This is consistent with a diagnosis of paederus dermatitis, likely acquired in the Gambia. The rash was treated with clobetasone butyrate 0.05% cream twice daily and emollients.

Figure 1.
Distribution of lesions (A) on the distal right arm and proximal right forearm, as well as those (B) on the left arm and breast.

The diarrhea and hoarse voice resolved spontaneously. Salmonella DNA was detected in the stool. A respiratory viral swab result was negative, and HIV and syphilis serology results were also negative. Paederus dermatitis is an acute irritant dermatitis caused by contact with the hemolymph of rove beetles (Paederus sp), which contain a vesicant toxin called pederin. Direct skin contact is not necessary; lesions often appear in areas where the beetle has been crushed or moved. Paederus species are widely distributed, and outbreaks have been reported in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Australasia.

A complete skin examination is essential for identifying dermatoses in returned travelers. Appositional patterns should prompt clinicians to consider toxic or irritant dermatitis. There are many other causes of kissing lesions, including candidiasis, impetigo, intertrigo, syphilis, viral warts, molluscum contagiosum, and Lipschütz ulcers.

### Outsmarting poison ivy and other poisonous plants… [^116ysaxp]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

First comes the itching, then a red rash, and then blisters. These symptoms of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac can emerge any time from a few hours to several days after exposure to the plant oil found in the sap of these poisonous plants. The culprit: the urushiol oil. Here are some tips to avoid it. Recognizing Poison Ivy, Poison Oak, and Poison Sumac Poison Ivy: Found throughout the United States except Alaska, Hawaii, and parts of the West Coast. Can grow as a vine or small shrub trailing along the ground or climbing on low plants, trees and poles. Each leaf has three glossy leaflets, with smooth or toothed edges. Leaves are reddish in spring, green in summer, and yellow, orange, or red in fall. Poison Plant Rashes Aren't Contagious Poison ivy and other poison plant rashes can't be spread from person to person.

But it is possible to pick up the rash from plant oil that may have stuck to clothing, pets, garden tools, and other items that have come in contact with these plants. The plant oil lingers on virtually any surface until it's washed off with water or rubbing alcohol. Tips for Prevention
- Learn what poison ivy, oak, and sumac plants look like so you can avoid them.
- Wash your garden tools and gloves regularly. If you think you may be working around poison ivy, wear long sleeves, long pants tucked into boots, and impermeable gloves.
- Wash your pet if it may have brushed up against poison ivy, oak, or sumac. Use pet shampoo and water while wearing rubber gloves, such as dishwashing gloves. Most pets are not sensitive to poison ivy, but the oil can stick to their fur and cause a reaction in someone who pets them.
- Using wet compresses or soaking in cool water.
- Applying over-the-counter topical corticosteroid preparations or taking prescription oral corticosteroids.
- Applying topical OTC skin protectants, such as zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and calamine dry the oozing and weeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Protectants such as baking soda or colloidal oatmeal relieve minor irritation and itching. Aluminum acetate is an astringent that relieves rash.

### Poisonous plants and work | Outdoor… [^115ZLV9s]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Poisonous plants that can cause skin irritation include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.
- Burning poisonous plants may lead to lung irritation.
- Employers and workers can take actions to stay safe. Types Identifying poisonous plants The old saying "Leaves of three, let it be. " is a helpful reminder for identifying poison ivy and poison oak. However, it does not apply to poison sumac, which usually has clusters of 7–13 leaves. In some species, poison ivy and poison oak may also have more than three leaves. Their appearance may also vary depending upon the species, the local environment, and the season. There may also be common lookalike plants in the same areas. Poison Ivy Eastern poison ivy is typically a hairy, ropelike vine with three shiny green leaves budding from one small stem. The leaves may be red in the fall. Western poison ivy is typically a low shrub with three leaves that does not form a climbing vine.

It may have yellow or green flowers and white to green-yellow or amber berries. Types of Exposure Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac release an oil when part of the plant is damaged or burned. When the oil gets on the skin, most exposed people have an allergic reaction. Workers can become exposed to urushiol through:

- Direct contact with the plant.
- Indirect contact, such as touching tools, livestock, or clothing that have urushiol on them.
- Inhaling particles containing urushiol from burning plants. Exposure to an amount of urushiol less than a grain of salt causes a rash in 80–90 percent of adults. The rash may significantly impede or prevent a person from working. Burning these poisonous plants can be very dangerous because the allergens can irritate lungs. Do not burn plants that may be poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac. Inhaling smoke from burning plants can cause severe allergic respiratory problems.

First Aid Rinse skin immediately.
- Use rubbing alcohol, poison plant washes, or dishwashing soap, and lots of water.
- Rinse often to prevent wash solutions from drying on the skin and further spreading the urushiol. Scrub under nails with a brush. Apply wet compresses, calamine lotion, or hydrocortisone cream to the skin to reduce itching and blistering.

1872. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
2023. 26355 Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are plants that frequently cause allergic skin reactions. These 3 plants contain sap oil in their leaves, stems, and roots, which is released on contact and penetrates the skin to cause an itchy, red rash. Once urushiol is on the skin, it can be spread to other areas of skin by touch. People can also come into contact with urushiol by petting an animal that has sap oil on its fur. Rarely, urushiol can spread to other people through contact with clothing or objects that has urushiol on it. Approximately half to three-quarters of the US adult population develops a contact dermatitis rash after contact with poison ivy, poison oak, and/or poison sumac.

Each year, approximately 10 million to 50 million people in the US develop rash from exposure to these plants. People at highest risk are those who work outdoors, such as construction, forestry, and farm workers; landscapers; and firefighters. The rash caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac is red and bumpy in appearance, often arranged in streaks, and is very itchy. In severe cases, fluid-filled blisters may develop. The rash typically appears 24 to 48 hours after contact in people who were exposed to one of these plants in the past, with peak severity 1 to 14 days later. The rash can take up to 3 weeks to develop in individuals with a first exposure to one of these plants. The rash caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks. The key to prevention is to identify and avoid contact with these plants. Poison ivy has 3 leaflets, poison oak has 3 to 5 leaflets, and poison sumac has 7 to 13 pointed leaves.

If you are going into wooded or marshy areas, wear long sleeves, long pants, boots, and gloves. Barrier skin cream, such as lotion that contains bentoquatam, may provide additional protection.

### Poison ivy, oak and sumac contact dermatitis… [^112ZK2gt]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis is most commonly caused by poison ivy, western poison oak, eastern poison oak and poison sumac. Urushiol, commonly the chief allergen, is found in the oleoresinous sap located in the leaves, stems and roots of these plants. Between 50 and 70 percent of people are sensitive to contact with the oleoresin released from a bruised plant. Indirect contact through clothing, pets and even smoke from a burning plant may cause a similar reaction. Lee and Arriola review common presenting signs and symptoms, and management and prevention strategies for allergic contact dermatitis caused by plants. The rash associated with contact dermatitis typically appears 24 to 48 hours after exposure in a previously sensitized person. This rash is usually self-limiting and resolves one to two weeks after exposure. Redness and intense pruritus also develop, followed by papules, vesicles and sometimes bullae. Lesions can appear in streaks, suggesting plant contact.

Fluid from the lesions is not sensitizing to others. Complications include secondary bacterial infections and, rarely, erythema multiforme and urticaria. Management should include thorough washing with soap and water, preferably within 10 minutes of exposure, as this may prevent dermatitis. All contaminated clothes should be removed as soon as possible and cleaned. Frequent baths, using colloidal oatmeal, also relieve symptoms. Treatment of mild to moderate rash includes application of cool compresses or diluted aluminum acetate solution, such as Burow's solution, or calamine lotion. The authors conclude that prevention requires educating patients to recognize the offending plants and to wear protective clothing when engaging in outdoor activities. Desensitization efforts are of uncertain value.

The success of topical barrier preparations is variable, but some, such as organoclay preparation, can limit response in exposed susceptible persons when applied to the skin at least 15 minutes before anticipated exposure. Application should be repeated every four hours if exposure is prolonged.
