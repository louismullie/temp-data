## Question

Does
Illness get resolved?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether illness gets resolved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "illness" encompasses clinically, including acute, chronic, infectious, and non-infectious conditions. Then, I should verify the biological mechanisms that govern resolution, especially inflammation and tissue repair. Next, I will examine disease-specific examples with timelines for resolution. After that, I need to consider modifiers such as host factors, severity, and treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, probabilistic conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for counseling and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the scope of "illness". Illness spans acute self-limited infections, chronic diseases, and symptom-based syndromes, and importantly, many illnesses are defined by symptom clusters rather than a single pathogen or lesion, which affects how we judge "resolution" [^20e3ac8d]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also remember that some conditions blur the boundary between illness and disease, and that prognostic frameworks often serve patients better than rigid diagnostic labels when outcomes are heterogeneous [^4bdaf436].

> Next, I should review the biological basis of resolution. Resolution of inflammation is an active, tightly regulated process with specialized pro-resolving mediators and coordinated clearance of apoptotic cells; when this program fails, inflammation persists and chronic disease emerges, so resolution is not passive but a programmed return to homeostasis [^26a55c8b] [^449d9928] [^4205923d]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: this means that whether illness resolves depends on both the removal of the inciting cause and the integrity of endogenous resolution pathways, which can be impaired in certain diseases and hosts [^a3ee62c5].

> I will now examine concrete examples of resolution across conditions. Uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy hosts typically resolves within about a week, though cough and malaise can persist beyond two weeks, illustrating a common acute trajectory with a tail of residual symptoms [^acdaeada]. Norovirus gastroenteritis is usually self-resolving with supportive care, though dehydration risk can prolong recovery in vulnerable hosts, reinforcing that "resolution" is conditional on complications and comorbidity [^a2b2af9f]. Acute Q fever often resolves spontaneously within 2–3 weeks even without treatment, though timely antibiotics shorten illness and reduce complications, showing that resolution can occur naturally but is modifiable by therapy [^e70b635b]. Mpox with clade IIb is typically self-limited over 2–4 weeks, with supportive care as first-line, again underscoring that many viral illnesses are self-resolving in immunocompetent hosts [^9e03b4e5]. Even altitude illness generally resolves with descent and supportive measures, aligning with the principle that removing the environmental driver facilitates resolution [^487a12e2].

> But wait, what if the illness is chronic or has long-tail sequelae. I need to check exemplars of non-resolution. Long COVID demonstrates that a substantial minority have persistent symptoms beyond 3–6 months, with risk linked to acute severity and comorbidity, and recovery trajectories that wax and wane, so "resolution" is incomplete for a meaningful fraction [^9e5defb5] [^65e1e467]. Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma reflect failed resolution biology; while remission is achievable, tissue injury may be irreversible and relapse is common, so "resolution" in these contexts often means control rather than cure [^a3ee62c5] [^33e76967]. Critical illness survivors frequently face months to years of physical, cognitive, and mental health sequelae, and pre-existing multimorbidity predicts worse recovery trajectories, again limiting the likelihood of full resolution [^4eda3326] [^e174bfb4].

> Hold on, I should verify host and disease modifiers that shape resolution. Age, comorbidity, and frailty slow recovery across many conditions, including pneumonia and COVID-19, and are repeatedly associated with delayed return to baseline function [^5422b3b6] [^a889493e]. Severity at presentation, pathogen virulence, and access to timely, appropriate care also modify outcomes; for example, early doxycycline hastens resolution in Q fever, and early whole-body cooling changes outcomes in exertional heat stroke, illustrating that intervention timing can pivot a course toward faster resolution or chronic morbidity [^e70b635b] [^9977fdff]. I should double-check that even in self-limited diseases, complications like dehydration, secondary infection, or organ injury can convert a resolving illness into a non-resolving one, which is why counseling on red flags and follow-up remains essential [^a2b2af9f].

> Let me consider symptom-based illnesses without a clear disease label. Many common symptoms improve over weeks to months, yet 20–25% become chronic or recurrent, and serious causes unmasked at initial evaluation are uncommon on long-term follow-up, supporting a watchful, supportive approach with validated measures and clear return precautions [^722cddcf]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that most such symptoms resolve; I should correct that to "most improve, but a substantial minority persist", which is the more accurate statement from the evidence base [^722cddcf].

> I should now synthesize a cautious conclusion. Yes, most illnesses resolve, but the extent and pace of resolution vary widely with the underlying biology, the disease process, host factors, and the timeliness and effectiveness of care. Many acute infections and injuries are self-limited, chronic diseases can enter remission but often persist or relapse, and some post-acute syndromes persist beyond a year, so "resolution" is probabilistic rather than guaranteed [^acdaeada] [^a3ee62c5] [^9e5defb5]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both mechanistic and clinical data; the active resolution biology explains why many inflammations end, while clinical series and cohorts show that a nontrivial fraction fail to resolve fully, especially in vulnerable hosts or severe disease [^26a55c8b] [^4eda3326].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical implications are practical. Counsel patients that most acute illnesses improve within days to weeks, but some symptoms persist and a minority evolve into chronic problems; set expectations, provide safety-netting, and arrange follow-up to reassess trajectory [^acdaeada] [^722cddcf]. In chronic disease, frame treatment goals around control, remission, and functional recovery rather than cure, and individualize plans to risk, comorbidity, and patient preferences, which improves alignment with realistic outcomes [^33e76967] [^4bdaf436]. For post-critical illness and complex multimorbidity, anticipate prolonged, multidimensional recovery and coordinate rehabilitative, mental health, and social support to optimize resolution of deficits where possible [^4eda3326] [^e174bfb4]. I should confirm that shared decision-making includes discussing uncertainty and the possibility of non-resolution, which is especially important in serious illness and at the end of life [^7e422436].

Illness resolution is the process by which **symptoms and signs of disease disappear** and normal physiological function is restored [^notfound]. Most acute illnesses resolve spontaneously or with treatment, but some become chronic or relapse, especially if the underlying cause persists or the host response is impaired [^a3ee62c5] [^9e5defb5]. Resolution is influenced by disease type, severity, host factors, and treatment; for example, uncomplicated influenza typically resolves within 1–2 weeks [^acdaeada], whereas chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or COPD may persist or relapse despite therapy [^a3ee62c5] [^619f7a2d]. Even after clinical resolution, some patients have lingering symptoms or organ damage, and a subset develop long-term sequelae (e.g. long COVID) [^9e5defb5] [^a241f58c]. Thus, while many illnesses resolve, resolution is not guaranteed and may be partial or delayed, particularly in chronic, severe, or complex cases [^722cddcf].

## Biological mechanisms of illness resolution

Illness resolution involves coordinated biological processes that restore homeostasis:

- **Immune response**: Elimination of pathogens or repair of damaged tissue is central to resolution [^d50902e9].

- **Inflammation resolution**: Active, programmed processes (e.g. apoptosis, efferocytosis, specialized pro-resolving mediators) terminate inflammation and promote repair [^26a55c8b] [^4205923d].

- **Tissue repair**: Regeneration and remodeling restore function, though some injuries cause permanent changes [^58941686].

---

## Factors influencing illness resolution

Several factors determine whether and how quickly illness resolves:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Disease type | Acute infections often resolve spontaneously; chronic diseases may persist or relapse [^a3ee62c5] [^9e5defb5] |
| Severity | Severe illness (e.g. sepsis, ARDS) carries higher risk of chronic sequelae and delayed recovery [^65e1e467] [^728568ad] |
| Host factors | Age, comorbidities, genetics, and immune status strongly influence resolution [^5422b3b6] [^43e631a2] |
| Treatment | Timely, effective therapy accelerates resolution; delays or inadequate care impair recovery [^e70b635b] [^5422b3b6] |

---

## Examples of illness resolution

- **Acute infections**: Influenza, norovirus, and streptococcal pharyngitis typically resolve within days to weeks with supportive care [^acdaeada] [^a2b2af9f].

- **Chronic diseases**: Rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease can enter remission but often relapse; sustained remission may require long-term therapy [^a3ee62c5] [^33e76967].

- **Post-acute sequelae**: Some patients have persistent symptoms after acute illness (e.g. long COVID), reflecting incomplete resolution or ongoing pathophysiology [^9e5defb5] [^a6a30061].

---

## Barriers to illness resolution

Barriers include **persistent pathogens** (e.g. chronic viral infections), **dysregulated immunity** (autoimmunity, immunodeficiency), and **inadequate treatment** (delayed, incomplete, or ineffective therapy) [^a3ee62c5] [^5422b3b6]. Structural tissue damage (e.g. fibrosis, organ failure) may be irreversible, limiting full recovery [^58941686].

---

## Clinical implications and patient care

Clinicians should:

- **Set expectations**: Explain typical timelines and the possibility of persistent symptoms or relapse [^722cddcf].

- **Monitor progress**: Track symptoms, function, and biomarkers to detect non-resolution early [^aa6ebfa4].

- **Adjust treatment**: Modify therapy if recovery is delayed or incomplete [^aa6ebfa4].

- **Address sequelae**: Manage long-term consequences and support rehabilitation [^e174bfb4].

---

Illness resolution is the return to pre-illness function; while many illnesses resolve, some persist or leave lasting effects, and **resolution is shaped by disease, host, and treatment factors** [^a3ee62c5] [^9e5defb5].

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^20e3ac8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### The resolution of inflammation [^26a55c8b]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

In 2012, Nature Reviews Immunology organized a conference that brought together scientists and clinicians from both academia and industry to discuss one of the most pressing questions in medicine — how do we turn off rampant, undesirable inflammation? There is a growing appreciation that, similarly to the initiation of inflammation, the resolution of inflammation is an intricate and active process. Can we therefore harness the mediators involved in resolution responses to treat patients with chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases? Here, we ask five of the speakers from the conference to share their thoughts on this emerging field.

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^a3ee62c5]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Inflammation and its resolution is under-studied in medicine despite being essential for understanding the development of chronic inflammatory disease. In this review article, we discuss the resolution of inflammation in both a biological and translational context. We introduce the concept of impaired resolution leading to diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and asthma, as well as the cellular and molecular components that contribute to resolution of joint, gut, and lung inflammation, respectively. Finally, we discuss potential intervention strategies for fostering the resolution process, and their implications for the therapy of inflammatory diseases.

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^5cd91b91]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, resolution of inflammation is a tightly regulated process that restores tissue homeostasis and prevents the development of chronic inflammatory disease. Like the induction of inflammation, resolution is based on a network of cells as well as on lipid and protein mediators that cooperate for a common goal, which is to reconstruct the original state of the affected tissue. Apart from universal mechanisms tissue and disease-specific mechanisms have been identified that guide resolution of inflammation in arthritis, colitis, and asthma. Such pathways are of particular therapeutic value as their induction may provide new possibilities to reverse chronicity in distinct inflammatory diseases without curtailing the overall inflammatory response.

British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations of using time loss to measure severity

Time loss generally reflects injury severity but has limitations. First, the demarcation between the end of time loss and the resumption of 'normal training and competition' is not necessarily a clear line in the sand. In some sports, athletes may be able to participate before an injury or illness has fully resolved, for example, by adapting technique, accepting a lower performance level or playing a different role in a team (eg, a ballet dancer working at the barre but not dancing on the floor or doing any jumps). Participation before an injury or illness is fully resolved would tend to 'underestimate' the absolute severity of the injury if one considered full healing as the gold standard. Conversely, athletes may choose not to resume their 'normal' training and competition for an extended period after an injury or illness has clinically resolved to allow them to regain full fitness (eg, a professional football player after ACL reconstruction). This would overestimate the severity of the condition.

Second, a time-loss-based severity measure underestimates the severity of those health problems that limit a player's performance but do not stop the person playing. Many gradual-onset injuries fit that bill (eg, patellar tendinopathy). Similarly, when athletes have a recurrent or chronic illness, such as asthma or inflammatory arthritis, they may have a relatively low time loss (from training, competition), but they may be markedly affected in training content and intensity.

Third, time loss is inappropriate to describe the most severe types of health problems such as those leading to retirement from sport, permanent disability or death because the time loss data from those injuries is right-censored.

### Chronic fatigue syndrome and an illness-focused approach to care: controversy, morality and paradox [^1e0d9431]. Medical Humanities (2019). Medium credibility.

On one hand, there will be those who seek to escape the paradox by denying the first proposition, casting doubt on whether the person who reports an illness-without-disease is actually ill at all. They may go further to suggest that the person's reported experience is merely imaginary, deceptive or even the deserved consequence of a personal fault.

On the other hand, there will be those who seek to escape the paradox by denying the second proposition, insisting that the illness is associated with a disease and that the lack of evidence for this is only provisional. They may argue that given enough time and resources, the disease will surely be found (a view associated with preference for the label ME rather than CFS for the illness). The modernist narrative of progress and discovery in which medicine itself is strongly invested reinforces this line of argument.

However, while both ways out of the paradox of illness-without-disease have their advocates, neither fully convinces in the light of evidence for both the reality of the illness and the absence of conventionally defined disease. Consequently, the paradox is felt, but not resolved.

Is there therefore a better way to resolve the paradox? Following Whitehead, we propose an alternative approach which seeks to examine and revise the concepts of 'illness' and 'disease' themselves. Instead of thinking of illness and disease in terms of the hierarchical difference between subjective (or mental) and objective (or physical) realities, we propose that we could think of them in terms of different degrees and forms of abstraction from the totality of what is real. 'Abstraction' is a term Whitehead uses to refer to the activity of abstracting, selecting or bringing something into focus. Abstraction in this sense is a process that all organisms engage in as an aspect of their relationship with their environment: our digestive system abstracts 'food' from the substances we ingest, for example, while discarding the rest as irrelevant 'background'. Similarly discrete thoughts are abstracted from an otherwise undifferentiated stream of consciousness, in connection with the demands or features of specific situations. 20

### Outcome, recovery and return to work in severe mental illnesses [^d5d08a15]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

The assessment of outcomes of severe mental illnesses has become recently an important line of research in psychiatry, leading to distinguish different levels of outcomes and a diversity of underlying factors. The focus has shifted from a traditional medical notion of 'disease outcome' to a wider notion of 'functional outcome', and even to an inquiry about the fate of the person and its determinants. Recovery, rather than cure or remission, is regarded as the good outcome, with its own underlying factors. Return to work, as a vocational outcome, represents in research one of the good functional outcomes. It is generally understood as a sign of social recovery. But may work be regarded as a good outcome in its broader sense, i.e. as a means of full recovery? Several theoretical and empirical arguments are in favor of considering work as a privileged way toward recovery, but this does not mean it is the only way.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^9977fdff]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Exertional heat stroke (EHS) rapid recognition — collapse during or immediately after activity with heat stress prompts evaluation, with a broad differential; self-limiting postexertional collapse from venous pooling typically resolves in less than 30 min with leg elevation and rest, whereas a missed EHS diagnosis or delayed whole-body cooling may lead to organ failure or death; to optimally establish a diagnosis and manage exertional collapse, the entire clinical picture including history, mental status, vital signs including rectal temperature, available point of care laboratory results, and regular reassessments should be considered.

### Resolution of inflammation: a new therapeutic frontier [^2c992c5d]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

Dysregulated inflammation is a central pathological process in diverse disease states. Traditionally, therapeutic approaches have sought to modulate the pro- or anti-inflammatory limbs of inflammation, with mixed success. However, insight into the pathways by which inflammation is resolved has highlighted novel opportunities to pharmacologically manipulate these processes - a strategy that might represent a complementary (and perhaps even superior) therapeutic approach. This Review discusses the state of the art in the biology of resolution of inflammation, highlighting the opportunities and challenges for translational research in this field.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^5422b3b6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Which factors are important to determine non-response?

The speed at which pneumonia signs and symptoms resolve is primarily influenced by host-intrinsic factors, particularly frailty. Conditions such as diabetes, malignancy, immunosuppression, and end-organ disease often impair neutrophil function, as well as cell-mediated and humoral immunity, which in turn affect the rate of symptom recovery. Other factors, such as impaired cough and mucociliary clearance in COPD, malnutrition, chronic aspiration, impaired airway clearance in chronic alcoholism, certain neurological disorders, and impaired lung lymphatic drainage and pulmonary edema in heart failure, have all been associated with delayed resolution of pneumonia. Typically, patients show clinical improvement within 48-72h of therapy, but cough and fatigue can persist for up to two weeks in patients who are otherwise improving/responding (Table 1).

Other factors influencing the resolution time of pneumonia include the severity at presentation and the suspected pathogen. Severe cases, such as those with septic shock, multilobar or necrotizing pneumonia, or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, generally have longer recovery times. Certain pathogens are associated with slower rates of clinical improvement. Pneumonia caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for example, responds more slowly to appropriate treatment compared to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae. Bacterial load and the presence of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and Legionella infections often have slower resolution rates compared to non-bacteremic infections.

### Mass psychogenic illness: role of the individual physician [^035b7e83]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Mass psychogenic illness is characterized by symptoms, occurring among a group of persons with shared beliefs regarding those symptoms, that suggest organic illness but have no identifiable environmental cause and little clinical or laboratory evidence of disease. Mass psychogenic illness typically affects adolescents or children, groups under stress and females disproportionately more than males. Symptoms often follow an environmental trigger or illness in an index case. They can spread rapidly by apparent visual transmission, may be aggravated by a prominent emergency or media response, and frequently resolve after patients are separated from each other and removed from the environment in which the outbreak began. Physicians should consider this diagnosis when faced with a cluster of unexplained acute illness.

### The role of lipid emulsions containing omega-3 fatty acids for medical and surgical critical care patients [^a8ec92fe]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids: biologic aspects

Excessive and uncontrolled inflammation is a hallmark of critical illness, and the ability of the host response to resolve inflammation and return to homeostasis has implications on clinical outcomes. Resolution of inflammation is now understood to be a highly coordinated and biosynthetically active programmed response in which specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) take on important coordinating tasks. Arachidonic acid and long-chain omega-3 PUFAs (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) are precursors for SPMs. SPM 'families' include lipoxins (from arachidonic acid) and resolvins, protectins, and maresins (from long-chain omega-3 PUFAs). Each SPM family has distinct roles in inflammation resolution — actively disrupting inflammatory pathways and shifting the immune response towards resolution and homeostasis (Fig. 1). Contrary to many common anti-inflammatory drugs, immune modulation and tissue repair involving SPMs occurs without compromising host defences.

Fig. 1
The acute inflammatory response to critical illness and its resolution or progression to chronic inflammation. Pro-resolution lipid mediators (i.e. resolvins, protectins, and maresins) typically derive from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (i.e. prostaglandins or leukotrienes) typically derive from omega-6 PUFAs. In critical illness, prolonged inflammation triggers effects on different organs that can result in organ damage. However, the timely resolution of inflammation is associated with more favorable clinical outcomes

In addition to their inflammation-resolving effects, omega-3 PUFAs potentially counteract loss of muscle mass. Preclinical investigations suggest that increased incorporation of EPA and DHA into membrane phospholipids leads to enhanced muscle protein synthesis and/or decreases the expression of factors regulating muscle protein breakdown. The extent of these effects, however, may further depend on factors such as protein intake and age. Current clinical evidence is predominantly from oral supplementation in ageing populations and/or chronic diseases, rather than critically ill patients.

### A conceptual model of factors potentially influencing prescribing decisions for chronic conditions: an overview of systematic reviews [^88a8daef]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic conditions represent a significant and growing health issue, affecting nearly half of all adults. The World Health Organization defines them as "long duration, non-communicable" diseases caused by "a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors". Conditions must persist for at least 6 months to be labelled chronic. They are a leading cause of mortality, accounting for 74% of deaths and contribute to 85% of healthcare expenditure worldwide. The prescription of long-term medications is often the primary intervention to control disease progression, reduce complications and improve patient outcomes. However, prescribing decision-making in chronic conditions is complex and may differ from that in acute conditions.

Prescribing decision models, such as the conceptual model by Murshid and Mohaidin (Fig. 1), suggest several factor categories that may influence prescriber behaviour, including patient characteristics, pharmacist factors, marketing efforts and contextual factors, as well as trust between physicians and pharmacists. However, these models do not distinguish between prescribing in chronic and acute conditions, despite the different objectives of these prescribing contexts. Acute prescribing may be more typically urgent and symptom-driven, focussing on immediate relief or resolution of illness. Whereas, chronic prescribing often aims to slow disease progression, may require a more proactive approach and involves long-term monitoring. Furthermore, existing models may not fully account for the influence of prescriber characteristics nor incorporate some additional factors identified in the wider literature such as clinical guidelines, disease severity or risk assessment scores and clinical decision support systems. Thus, there is a need to reassess existing models, with a specific focus on chronic conditions.

Mpox in people with HIV — mild to moderate disease management: Mpox is typically a self-limiting illness that resolves spontaneously in people with well-controlled HIV, and people with mild to moderate mpox and who are not at high risk for severe disease should be managed with supportive care, including adequate pain control (BIII), and be offered referral to clinical trials of mpox treatment, if available (CIII).

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^17d5b6c0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Key aspects of resolution of inflammation

Successful resolution of inflammation is based on a number of key events. At the molecular level, pro-inflammatory mediators need to be effectively antagonized and catabolized. At the cellular level, immune cell numbers at inflammatory sites need to decline, and at the macroscopic level tissue integrity has to be restored by the activation of tissue-resident cells that induce repair. To some extent, resolution of inflammation represents a "clean-up" process, which follows the "concert" of inflammation. As such, resolution is a highly robust process, which is difficult to overwrite. In consequence, the vast majority of inflammatory responses occurring in humans are self-limited. Furthermore, at the experimental level it is still challenging to mimic chronic inflammation in animal models as many inflammatory models such as dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, antigen-induced arthritis, imiquimod-induced psoriasis, or thioglycolate-induced peritonitis are spurious and spontaneously resolve after several days or weeks of active inflammation.

### Do critical illness survivors with multimorbidity need a different model of care? [^e174bfb4]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

There is currently a lack of evidence on the optimal strategy to support patient recovery after critical illness. Previous research has largely focussed on rehabilitation interventions which aimed to address physical, psychological, and cognitive functional sequelae, the majority of which have failed to demonstrate benefit for the selected outcomes in clinical trials. It is increasingly recognised that a person's existing health status, and in particular multimorbidity (usually defined as two or more medical conditions) and frailty, are strongly associated with their long-term outcomes after critical illness. Recent evidence indicates the existence of a distinct subgroup of critical illness survivors with multimorbidity and high healthcare utilisation, whose prior health trajectory is a better predictor of long-term outcomes than the severity of their acute illness. This review examines the complex relationships between multimorbidity and patient outcomes after critical illness, which are likely mediated by a range of factors including the number, severity, and modifiability of a person's medical conditions, as well as related factors including treatment burden, functional status, healthcare delivery, and social support. We explore potential strategies to optimise patient recovery after critical illness in the presence of multimorbidity. A comprehensive and individualized approach is likely necessary including close coordination among healthcare providers, medication reconciliation and management, and addressing the physical, psychological, and social aspects of recovery. Providing patient-centred care that proactively identifies critical illness survivors with multimorbidity and accounts for their unique challenges and needs is likely crucial to facilitate recovery and improve outcomes.

### Mediators of the resolution of the inflammatory response [^86beb487]. Trends in Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The termination of inflammation is governed by endogenous molecules collectively referred to as 'mediators of resolution' of inflammation. There is now strong evidence to suggest that failed resolution may underpin autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and could thus be targeted to decrease inflammation. There are many molecules that have been described as mediators of resolution, and new players are still being continuously discovered. To support the emerging field of 'resolution pharmacology', here we discuss the scientific strategies required to qualify a molecule as a resolution mediator. Systematic definition of the players of resolution, their receptors, and downstream mechanisms remains a necessary knowledge to move the field forward and suggest new targets for the development of novel therapies to treat inflammatory diseases.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of acute altitude illness: 2019 update [^487a12e2]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) treatment — descent: "Descent remains the single best treatment for AMS and HACE, but it is not necessary in all circumstances." "Individuals should descend until symptoms resolve unless terrain, weather, or injuries make descent impossible." "Symptoms typically resolve after descent of 300 to 1000 m," and "Individuals should not descend alone, particularly if they are experiencing HACE." Recommendation language states, "Recommendation. Descent is effective for any degree of AMS/HACE and is indicated for individuals with severe AMS, AMS that fails to resolve with other measures, or HACE. Recommendation Grade: 1A."

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^7b61bd42]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammation is characterized by a sequence of events comprising an induction phase, which leads to the peak of inflammation and is gradually followed by a resolution phase. The induction phase of inflammation is designed to allow fast and robust immune activation that is required for effective host defense. It is initiated by the sensing of exogenous and endogenous danger signals resulting from mechanically, chemically, or biologically induced tissue damage followed by the recruitment of effector cells, which orchestrate an inflammatory response characterized by the release of lipid and protein mediators of inflammation.

The resolution phase of inflammation is essential to curtail inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis once the danger signal has been eliminated. It is therefore self-evident that the resolution process is tightly controlled. Failure to resolve inflammation leads to chronic inflammatory diseases at the inner surfaces of the body, such as arthritis, colitis, or asthma, which are associated with irreversible tissue damage and increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis –. Factors that can overcome effective resolution processes are (i) genetic factors that encode for exaggerated immune responses (e.g. HLA-B27 in arthritis, NOD2, and IL-10R mutations in colitis) or modulate the gut microflora, (ii) mechanisms that promote the development of autoimmunity (e.g. citrullinated protein antibodies in arthritis), and (iii) processes leading to impairment of the barrier function of epithelial surfaces leading to prolonged microbial exposure (e.g. defensin and mucin reduction in inflammatory bowel diseases) (Fig. 1).

### Performance of national COVID-19' symptom checkers': a comparative case simulation study [^f9c8b1dc]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 is a new infection in humans. The symptom profile, disease progression and complication rates are still relatively unknown. From the available evidence, four broad categories of illness have been postulated. 'Mild COVID-19' makes up over 80% of cases and is typically a self-limiting infection similar to the common cold, resolving without intervention. 'moderate COVID-19' typically has features of viral pneumonia in the absence of hypoxia, progressing to 'severe COVID-19' typically when patients require oxygen therapy. 'Critical COVID-19', where ventilatory support is typically required, occurs in less than 5% of cases. The rate of disease progression is not fixed: early intervention and various management strategies can reduce the rate of progression to critical illness and death.

While the infection fatality rate is yet to be determined, COVID-19 is associated with a substantive mortality. Over a period of 5 months, COVID-19 has led to more than 300 000 deaths, with more than half these deaths occurring within the last month.

The risk of mortality is affected by a number of risk factors. Coexisting health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer have been implicated as conferring a higher risk of mortality in COVID-19. Age appears to be the most striking and consistent risk factor for COVID-19 related mortality. Based on current data, the mortality rate in patients under 50 years of age is thought to be less than 1.1%, rising to around 14% in those over 80 years of age.

Variation in mortality also seems to exist between countries. Initially, this variation was thought to be predominantly related to the method of recording deaths and the total number of tests conducted (ie, the detection of milder cases). As the pandemic spreads across the globe, it is becoming increasingly clear that how a country responds to the pandemic impacts the number of deaths their locality will experience.

### Critical care education and the ICU care continuum [^9c40e486]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Critical care training is centered within the acute care environment, with a focus on physiology, procedural training, and interdisciplinary care. Once patients are discharged from the ICU, they receive little clinical follow-up, rendering the long-term outcomes of critical illness an abstract concept. This differs from the balance of acute care medicine, in which trainees gain exposure to a broader spectrum of care ranging, from emergency department presentations to outpatient clinics. Critically ill patients who survive to ICU discharge face a recovery path spanning weeks to years before sequelae of critical illness resolve or stabilize. The temporal separation between acute care and the associated consequences for patients creates a significant learning gap for trainees in understanding the impact of care delivered within the ICU, particularly regarding the implications for patients and their families. With training focusing on the nadir of a patient's clinical course, a time associated with relatively high rates of mortality, trainees may develop pessimistic biases, disillusionment, and burnout. In contradistinction, there may also be the temptation to frame a discharge from the ICU as a "success," when the reality is complicated and typically involves multiple care transitions and the possibility of disabilities and difficulty with return to prior function. We believe that trainee exposure to the post-ICU phase of critical illness recovery may aid in framing future goals-of-care discussions with patients and their caregivers, with an enhanced appreciation for the prognosis after prolonged critical illness and how projected outcomes align with a patient's values.

### Mechanisms of resolution of inflammation: a focus on cardiovascular disease [^cc278d52]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

The inflammatory response is an integral part of the innate immune mechanism that is triggered in response to a real or perceived threat to tissue homeostasis, with a primary aim of neutralizing infectious agents and initiating repair to damaged tissue. By design, inflammation is a finite process that resolves as soon as the threat of infection abates and sufficient repair to the tissue is complete. Resolution of inflammation involves apoptosis and subsequent clearance of activated inflammatory cells — a tightly regulated event. Chronic inflammation is a characteristic feature in virtually all inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, and it is becoming increasingly clear that derangement of the processes usually involved in resolution of inflammation is an underlying feature of chronic inflammatory conditions. This review will draw on evidence from a range of diseases in which dysregulated inflammation is important, with particular emphasis on cardiovascular disease.

### Can acutely ill patients predict their outcomes? A scoping review [^42863d11]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The full impact of an acute illness on subsequent health is seldom explicitly discussed with patients. Patients' estimates of their likely prognosis have been explored in chronic care settings and can contribute to the improvement of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. This scoping review aimed to identify studies of acutely ill patients' estimates of their outcomes and potential benefits for their care.

Methods

A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar, using terms related to prognostication and acute care. After removal of duplicates, all articles were assessed for relevance by six investigator pairs; disagreements were resolved by a third investigator. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Results

Our search identified 3265 articles, of which 10 were included. The methods of assessing self-prognostication were very heterogeneous. Patients seem to be able to predict their need for hospital admission in certain settings, but not their length of stay. The severity of their symptoms and the burden of their disease are often overestimated or underestimated by patients. Patients with severe health conditions and their relatives tend to be overoptimistic about the likely outcome.

Conclusion

The understanding of acutely ill patients of their likely outcomes and benefits of treatment has not been adequately studied and is a major knowledge gap. Limited published literature suggests patients may be able to predict their need for hospital admission. Illness perception may influence help-seeking behaviour, speed of recovery and subsequent quality of life. Knowledge of patients' self-prognosis may enhance communication between patients and their physicians, which improves patient-centred care.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^722cddcf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

### SLE: reconciling heterogeneity [^5c2e5d5d]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Illness models

One can reduce the complexity of making a diagnosis of SLE by using conceptual models. There are two such models, one separate illnesses, the other linear illness; both cluster SLE's disparate elements. The separate illnesses model posits that typical, overlap, UAS and antibody-only SLE are separate but related illnesses. A strength of this model is that it assigns different, targetable biological mechanisms to each diagnosis. Another strength is that a diagnosis, once made, does not change. Weaknesses of this model are that, in clinical practice, ambiguous diagnoses occur often, blurring the separating lines, and that diagnoses do sometimes change. Clinical protocols that rigidly adhere to sharp distinctions among diagnoses may remove options available to the treating physician. Another weakness is that insights suggested by evolving phenotypes may be unseen if an investigator believes that change of diagnosis cannot occur.

The linear illness model posits that UAS, overlap, antibody-only and typical SLE reside within a continuum of a single pathogenic process. This model applies throughout a patient's lifetime, during which the diagnosis name may change. The model's strengths are that it suggests common pathogeneses and flexible treatment protocols for all lupus spectrum illnesses; it highlights potential causes for phenotype changes. A weakness is that boundaries among diagnoses are vague, gathering under one name, like lupus spectrum, patients who have distinctly different phenotypes.

When the cause of a chronic illness is unknown, the separate illnesses model usually applies. Using this model, investigators mostly ask how of narrowly defined populations in order to discover mechanisms that will become the basis for targeted, ameliorative treatments. Investigators who ask why hope to find a single cause for a disease. When why is answered, syndromes will be seen to be different phases of a linear illness and treatment will be directed to prevention or cure.

Failure of resolution leads to chronic inflammatory diseases. Key cells of the activation and resolution phase are shown in the gray squares.

Our current concept on the nature of resolution of inflammation is dominated by specific pro-resolving lipid mediators that orchestrate the resolution process. These mediators have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. However, like the induction phase of inflammation depends on both lipid (e.g. prostaglandin E2) and protein (e.g. tumor necrosis factor) mediators, also the resolution of inflammation is likely to be based on a network of lipid and protein mediators rather than being exclusively controlled by lipids. Furthermore, in addition to universal principles underlying resolution of inflammation, disease-specific, and tissue-specific processes may exist that guide resolution in specific inflammatory conditions. This article will first summarize the universal principles of the resolution process before addressing tissue-specific and disease-specific mechanisms functional in arthritis, colitis, and asthma, as paradigm examples for chronic inflammatory diseases.

Exertional heat illness — biomarkers and follow-up for return to activity: Current RTA strategies are largely based on anecdotal observations, with most guidelines requiring full symptom resolution at rest and normal laboratory findings for organs most often affected by EHI or EHS before reintroducing activity; a follow-up evaluation about 1 wk after the incident is suggested for a physical examination and laboratory testing or diagnostic imaging, and validated instruments to accurately predict continuing tissue or organ damage are not available. In a retrospective review of 2,529 EHS episodes, indicators of acute kidney injury peak on the day of the injury and normalize within 24 to 48 h, while muscle damage and liver function–associated markers peak within 4 d and can persist outside the reference ranges for 2 to 16 d, with biochemical recovery from EHS complete within 16 d for most casualties.

### Long COVID as a long term condition [^9e5defb5]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The neglected field of long covid and post-infection conditions needs sustained research investment, increased clinical workforce training, and healthcare policy prioritisation

Long covid is a novel public health challenge with at least 200 million individuals affected by the condition worldwide. The syndrome is defined as persistent symptoms beyond three months of the covid-19 infection and lasting at least two months. The natural trajectories in the condition are not entirely well researched, but many individuals fully recover in the first 6–12 months. The chances of full recovery reduce after this period, and when the duration of symptoms are over two years, long covid is deemed to be an established long term condition in many individuals. However, the exact proportion of individuals who develop this long term condition is currently unknown. The condition in affected individuals typically remits and relapses and substantially compromises their quality of life. Long covid is more common in people with comorbidities and adds to the burden of multimorbidity or multiple long term conditions.

Long COVID — risk for persistent symptoms and clinical course — Persistent symptoms are more likely after severe illness, and patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) have higher risks of persistent symptoms including fatigue, chest tightness, anxiety, dyspnea, and myalgia. Patients with mild illness have a lower rate of ongoing symptoms most of which resolve within a year from diagnosis. Reinfection also carries an added risk for persistent symptoms.

### Prevalence of symptoms ≤ 12 months after acute illness, by COVID-19 testing status among adults-United States, December 2020-March 2023 [^a216b98d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective, multicenter study of 1,296 persons with acute COVID-like illness, approximately 16% of participants reported persistent symptoms 12 months after their illness, irrespective of their SARS-CoV-2 test result status at baseline. A higher proportion of COVID test–positive than COVID test–negative participants reported symptoms in each symptom category at baseline. The prevalence of symptoms declined substantially in both groups from baseline to the 3-month follow-up assessment and continued to gradually decrease at the 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up assessments; persistence of any symptom prevalence at 12 months was not statistically significantly different between the COVID test–positive (18.3%) and COVID test–negative (16.1%) participant groups.

These findings expand the understanding of post-COVID conditions. Previous studies have reported symptom prevalence estimates across varied, nonstandardized periods or at a single point in time, resulting in challenges comparing studies and difficulty distinguishing among the presence of reported persistent symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, those that resolved and then reemerged, and those that emerged after initial recovery. Few previous longitudinal studies have compared symptoms in COVID test–positive participants with those in persons with a COVID-like illness and who received negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. By conducting serial measurements of emerging and ongoing symptoms, this study was able to ascertain that participants who were symptomatic at a given time point included participants with ongoing symptoms as well as those with emerging symptoms (i.e. symptoms that were not present 3 months earlier). The inclusion of participants with COVID-like illness and negative test results guides discussions on characterizing symptoms associated with post-COVID conditions. This differentiation adds nuance and clarity to the natural history of post-COVID conditions and characterizes the fluctuating nature of symptoms over time and recognizes that these symptoms are not unique to COVID-19 or to post-COVID conditions. Many participants experienced new symptoms ≥ 6 months after the acute illness, suggesting that the prevalence of emerging symptoms in the months after acute COVID-like illness might be considerable. Cognitive difficulties and extreme fatigue were two common symptoms that emerged after 6 months and are often reported to occur with post-COVID conditions. Differentiating between symptoms that resolve and emerge over time helps to characterize post-COVID conditions and suggests that measurements at single time points underestimate or mischaracterize the true effects of disease.

### Inflammation and resolution in obesity [^274ee9bf]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Inflammation is an essential physiological defence mechanism, but prolonged or excessive inflammation can cause disease. Indeed, unresolved systemic and adipose tissue inflammation drives obesity-related cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Drugs targeting pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways or inflammasome activation have been approved for clinical use for the past two decades. However, potentially serious adverse effects, such as drug-induced weight gain and increased susceptibility to infections, prevented their wider clinical implementation. Furthermore, these drugs do not modulate the resolution phase of inflammation. This phase is an active process orchestrated by specialized pro-resolving mediators, such as lipoxins, and other endogenous resolution mechanisms. Pro-resolving mediators mitigate inflammation and development of obesity-related disease, for instance, alleviating insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in experimental disease models, so mechanisms to modulate their activity are, therefore, of great therapeutic interest. Here, we review current clinical attempts to either target pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6) or utilize endogenous resolution pathways to reduce obesity-related inflammation and improve cardiometabolic outcomes. A remaining challenge in the field is to establish more precise biomarkers that can differentiate between acute and chronic inflammation and to assess the functionality of individual leukocyte populations. Such advancements would improve the monitoring of drug effects and support personalized treatment strategies that battle obesity-related inflammation and cardiometabolic disease.

### National consensus project clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care guidelines, 4th edition [^7e422436]. Journal of Palliative Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Serious illness — definition and care needs are outlined, noting that individuals who are seriously ill need care that is seamless across settings, can rapidly respond to needs and changes in health status, and is aligned with patient-family preferences and goals. In this document, serious illness is defined as "a health condition that carries a high risk of mortality and either negatively impacts a person's daily function or quality of life or excessively strains their caregiver." The text emphasizes that providing "crisis-care" to individuals with a serious illness whose ongoing care needs are poorly managed has resulted in increased health care spending that does not necessarily improve quality of life, and that patients with serious illness and their family caregivers are seldom able to have their care needs reliably met, leading to symptom exacerbation crises and emergency department visits and/or repeated hospitalizations. It also highlights unmet care needs across all ages and areas of the country that burden families and the US health care system.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^07c0455a]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Exertional heat illness — graduated return to activity and staging: Following EHI or EHS, a medical evaluation is completed every week until all symptoms, signs, and abnormal laboratory values have resolved, and activities of daily living are the only "exercises" allowed for 2 wk; after resolution of symptoms and signs, low to moderate intensity physical training can be gradually increased to 60 min·d−1, then a heat acclimatization plan can be started, with release to unsupervised sport-specific activity if no symptoms of heat intolerance or abnormal blood work values are seen. The authors of this consensus statement recommend a staged process to guide return to activity after serious exertional heat illness, noting that each stage is individualized but may require up to 2 wk to complete in EHS victims and that if an athlete is unable to appropriately advance from stages 3 through 6, additional evaluation, which may include heat tolerance testing (HTT), may be needed; it is important that incremental elevations in both exercise intensity and heat stress be incorporated.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e7f24845]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^c97458b0]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Tissue-specific mechanisms of resolution of inflammation

Tissue-specific resolution processes complement the aforementioned universal mechanisms in resolution of inflammation. Since the pathways involved in the initiation of arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or asthma differ considerably from each other with respect to cytokine involvement, composition of the resident tissue, and microbial load, it is not surprising that customized resolution processes exist for specific tissues, which are guided by the local microenvironment. This is particularly relevant for tissues that represent inner surfaces of the body that are characterized by specific environmental settings. In the following chapter, we will therefore put a focus on the specific mechanisms of resolution of inflammation in diseases such as arthritis, colitis, and asthma.

Resolution of arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis is the most severe inflammatory joint disease exhibiting a remarkable level of chronicity. While pro-inflammatory mediators, like TNFα and IL-6, are well defined in arthritis, pro-resolving cytokines have not been defined until recently. In fact, IL-9 appears to be a key resolution cytokine in arthritis. Antigen-induced arthritis, which represents a self-limited arthritis model, becomes highly chronic in the absence of IL-9, while IL-9 overexpression effectively induces the resolution of arthritis in chronic models. Mechanistically, IL-9 serves as an autocrine growth factor for ILC2s. These cells have pro-resolving properties by activating the suppressive function of regulatory T cells in a cell–cell contact GITRL and ICOSL-dependent fashion. Notably, in the gut and lungs, where IL-9 is preferentially synthesized by T cells, this cytokine fuels rather than resolves inflammation supporting the concept of disease-specific resolution processes.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^9247cf2d]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Post-infectious and other infections causing chronic cough in children: Post-viral cough refers to cough after the acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and in the community cough post viral URTIs is likely the most common cause of chronic cough in children. The mean annual incidence of total respiratory illness per person per year ranges from 5.0 to 7.95 in children aged < 4 years to 2.4 to 5.02 in children aged 10 to 14 years. Following URTIs, acute cough typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks but 10% may cough for ≥ 20 to 25 days. In the follow-up of 839 children, 627 (75%) coughed for < 7 days and 171 (20%) for > 28 days, and of those with chronic cough (> 28 days), a new and serious illness was found in the 36 of the 117 children who were clinically reviewed. Other infections such as pertussis and mycoplasma can cause chronic cough, and pertussis should be suspected, especially with known contact even if the child is fully immunized.

### Stress hyperglycaemia in critically ill patients and the subsequent risk of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^22f548b9]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

'Stress hyperglycaemia' is defined as a blood glucose concentration that, in health, would lead to a diagnosis of diabetes and represents a state of temporary insulin resistance and concomitant relative insulin deficiency. While stress hyperglycaemia is associated with greater illness severity and short-term mortality, it typically resolves, at least acutely, following recovery. For this reason, stress hyperglycaemia has traditionally not been considered to have an adverse impact on long-term health. It is plausible, however, that critical illness uncovers latent insulin resistance and/or impaired pancreatic β-cell function, such that stress hyperglycaemia identifies patients at risk of subsequently developing diabetes.

Transient hyperglycaemia occurring in other contexts of physiological 'stress', such as pregnancy, is known to predict the development of diabetes. Post-partum screening programmes for women with gestational diabetes allow early identification of type 2 diabetes to delay or reduce the associated complications.

The impact of stress hyperglycaemia on the risk of incident diabetes for survivors of critical illness remains unclear. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to evaluate the longitudinal risk of developing diabetes in critically ill patients with stress hyperglycaemia. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of stress hyperglycaemia on the risk of prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance).

Given the large numbers of people infected and high rates of ongoing morbidity, research is clearly required to address the needs of adult survivors of COVID-19 living with ongoing symptoms (long COVID). To help direct resource and research efforts, we completed a research prioritisation process incorporating views from adults with ongoing symptoms of COVID-19, carers, clinicians and clinical researchers. The final top 10 research questions were agreed at an independently mediated workshop and included: identifying underlying mechanisms of long COVID, establishing diagnostic tools, understanding trajectory of recovery and evaluating the role of interventions both during the acute and persistent phases of the illness.

### Identification of persistent and resolving subphenotypes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in two independent cohorts [^728568ad]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

We observed significant differences in mortality, VFD, and length of stay between persistent and resolving HRF. While the findings may in part reflect the milder illness among patients with resolving HRF at enrollment, we hypothesize patients with persistent and resolving HRF have other underlying reasons to explain differing trajectories. Supporting this hypothesis, the risk of death was different even after adjusting for baseline PaO 2 :FIO 2 and APACHE score. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis of patients with PaO 2 :FIO 2 < 150 diminished differences in initial illness severity while strengthening the effect of persistent HRF on subsequent mortality. In fact, over half of the resolving HRF patients in our study had PaO 2 :FIO 2 < 150 at baseline, indicating that many patients who begin their ICU course with serious respiratory failure improve quickly. The prognostic value of this early trajectory, and the disconnect between initial severity of respiratory failure and subsequent outcomes, has not previously been investigated in acute HRF but has been described in ARDS. Notably, a secondary analysis of randomized trial data showed patients with ARDS that rapidly improved within 1 day had substantially lower mortality than patients with persistent ARDS and that 63% of rapidly improving ARDS patients were moderate or severe at enrollment. A study from the international multicenter LUNG SAFE cohort reported that 82% of patients with mild ARDS at enrollment have persistent or worsening ARDS in the first week of onset and that patients with persistent/worsening ARDS on ICU day 2 have higher hospital mortality compared to those with resolving ARDS. In general, the PaO 2 :FIO 2 at onset of respiratory failure is not as consistently associated with overall mortality as PaO 2 :FIO 2 measured at later time points, and in our study too, we saw the overall mortality among patients with enrollment PaO 2 :FIO 2 < 150 was similar to that of the entire cohort. These data all support an approach that incorporates reassessing respiratory failure on ICU day 3 to define a subphenotype that may be more patho-physiologically homogenous and at high risk for poor outcomes. Further work is needed to understand which underlying factors contribute to the development of persistent or resolving HRF and their associated differences in mortality, which may relate to treatment (e.g. fluid management, lung-protective ventilation), the patient (e.g. genetic susceptibility to lung injury, chronic comorbidity), and/or the acute illness itself (e.g. pathogen, type of trauma).

Participant-Reported Outcomes

Participants' survey data were summarized to describe the status of the illness (resolved or ongoing), the duration of illness, and the prevalence of longer-term symptoms. An illness was considered to be resolved if the participant did not report COVID-19 symptoms on 2 consecutive surveys or if they did not report symptoms on the last survey they completed and ongoing if they reported COVID-19 symptoms on the last survey they completed. If a participant reported cough, wheezing, or difficulty breathing during the acute phase of the illness, they were categorized as having acute respiratory symptoms.

### Ionized calcium in the ICU: should It Be measured and corrected? [^4fa82db6]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Serum ionized calcium (iCa) is often measured in patients admitted to ICUs, and at least half of these patients will have values outside the reference range during their ICU stay. The vast majority of these patients do not have an underlying disease of calcium homeostasis. This Contemporary Review discusses the rationale for measurement of iCa and whether available data support its measurement and correction. It is determined that while measurement of serum iCa is commonplace and attempted correction is popular, available evidence and logical analysis do not wholly support these practices. Abnormal values of iCa are likely a marker of disease severity in critical illness and most often normalize spontaneously with resolution of the primary disease process. Alternatively, low iCa levels in critical illness may be protective and attempted correction of low levels may be harmful. Dramatic curtailment of iCa measurement and calcium administration in several studies was not associated with worsening outcomes. The absence of high-quality data to guide practice allows for a spectrum of approaches to the measurement and treatment of iCa, but these approaches should be guided by basic principles of rational clinical decision-making. Widespread, protocolized measurement and administration with the simple goal of normalizing values in the name of "euboxia" should be discouraged.

Titers of infectious virus peak during the first 24–72 h of illness (10 3–10 7 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID 50]/mL nasopharyngeal wash) and decline within several days, with titers usually low or undetectable by day 5. Shedding in highly immunocompromised persons may last weeks to months. Compared with adults, children can shed virus earlier before illness begins and for longer periods once illness starts. As in adults, peak shedding in children occurs during the first 1–3 days of illness, but absolute levels may be higher than those in adults. In 1 report, at least 4 illnesses (8% of the total) in children were associated with presymptomatic shedding that began 6, 4, 3, and 3 days, respectively, before illness onset. The median duration of virus detection is typically 7–8 days after illness onset, but shedding for up to 21 days has been recorded. In 1 study, virus was shed by 10% of children on days 8–11, by 5% on days 12–15, and by 0% on days 16–19. Infants with infection requiring hospitalization may shed virus longer. In both adults and children, shedding does not usually continue once illness has resolved. Serologic testing indicates that ≈30%–50% of seasonal influenza infections may not result in illness.

### Do critical illness survivors with multimorbidity need a different model of care? [^4eda3326]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

There is increasing recognition that a person's pre-existing health status, and in particular the presence of multiple long-term conditions, or multimorbidity, is a key determinant of long-term outcome after ICU. Multimorbidity is often defined as the co-existence of at least two chronic conditions in an individual. This definition has come under criticism for being too simplistic as it includes combinations of well controlled or relatively mild conditions which may not meaningfully impact patients (e.g. hypertension and well controlled diabetes). There have been calls for alternative definitions which consider not only the number of conditions, but also their severity and impact, and where the condition combinations are more likely to significantly impact a person's daily life and risk of deterioration (e.g. heart failure, depression and back pain). Despite the criticisms, recent evidence indicates that critical illness survivors with multimorbidity have significantly worse recovery trajectories and outcomes compared to previously 'healthy' patients (Fig. 1). Iwashyna (2012) hypothesised that three distinct critical recovery trajectories exist, (1) the ''big hit'' (characterized by acute functional decline followed by recovery), (2) the ''slow burn'' (characterised by constant decline over time); and (3) "relapsing recurrences" (characterised by repeated acute exacerbations and partial recoveries). Building on this work, Latronico et al. (2017) hypothesised that the trajectories of critical illness survivors can be further divided based on the patient's pre-illness health status including pre-existing medical conditions. Recent studies investigating critical illness trajectories have provided further evidence that pre-existing multimorbidity and high healthcare utilisation are better predictors of hospital readmission and mortality than severity of the acute illness.

### Norovirus illnesses in children and adolescents [^a2b2af9f]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Norovirus is a leading cause of childhood vomiting and diarrhea in the United States and globally. Although most illnesses caused by norovirus are self-resolving, severe outcomes may occur from dehydration, including hospitalization and death. A vast majority of deaths from norovirus occur in developing countries. Immunocompromised children are at risk for more severe outcomes. Treatment of norovirus illness is focused on early correction of dehydration and maintenance of fluid status and nutrition. Hand hygiene, exclusion of ill individuals, and environmental cleaning are important for norovirus outbreak prevention and control, and vaccines to prevent norovirus illness are currently under development.

### Resolution of cell-mediated airways diseases [^04e8dbe5]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Multifaceted interest in resolution of inflammation

Infections, allergic reactions and a variety of other insults cause inflammation. Inflammation resolution involves normalisation of microcirculatory activities, loss of infiltrated cells, and healing of any injury that may have occurred. The resolution may not mean that everything returns to homeostasis because long after the inflammation has resolved significant changes in the innate responsiveness of cells such as the asthmatic epithelium may linger to meet the next insult somewhat differently. It is well known that individual mediators, cytokines, and cells may have both pro- and anti-inflammatory facets. Recently, there have been intriguing attempts at identifying endogenous agents with particularly active roles in resolution of inflammation. Thus, there is focus on pro-resolution effects of IL-10 and TGF-beta, adenosine and prostaglandin D2, lipoxins and other lipid mediators. Some of these regulatory molecules may live up to the actual meaning of the now almost obsolete name 'autacoids' (self remedy). Important roles of certain cells and cell phenotypes in resolution are also entertained with focus on regulatory T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. In addition, select transcription factors and post-transcriptional regulons are given roles in resolution of inflammation. This development has brought resolution hypotheses to the forefront of discussions of airways disease mechanisms. Common to the rapidly growing, multifaceted literature on mechanisms of resolution of inflammatory disease processes is the centrality of leukocyte apoptosis followed by phagocytosis of the apoptotic leukocytes. Apoptosis mechanisms are consistently emphasized whereas it appears that a role of transepithelial cell migration may have been overlooked.

### ACSM expert consensus statement on exertional heat illness: recognition, management, and return to activity [^dc9017ec]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Return to activity after serious exertional heat illness highlights that RTA (return to activity and play) decisions are challenging because understanding of recovery from EHS/EHI is incomplete; key considerations include assessing organ system recovery and physical function in warm or hot conditions; most individuals recover completely within a few weeks when promptly recognized and cooled, but some experience long-term complications; a progressive increase in exercise intensity and duration in warm/hot conditions can be used to assess recovery, and if pre heat injury exercise tolerance and expected performance are gradually regained, return to play is usually safe and advancing training/competition is acceptable.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^665e8ecf]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) — prevalence, diagnosis, and course are summarized as follows: "AMS is the most common form of altitude illness, affecting, for example, 25% of all visitors sleeping at altitudes ≥ 2,450 m (> 8,000 ft) in Colorado." "Diagnosis of AMS is based on a history of recent ascent to high altitude and the presence of subjective symptoms." Symptoms resemble a hangover; "headache is the cardinal symptom, usually accompanied by ≥ 1 of the following: anorexia, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, or, occasionally, vomiting," although "Uncommonly, AMS presents without headache." "Symptom onset is usually 2–12 hours after initial arrival at a high altitude or after ascent to a higher elevation and often during or after the first night." Pediatric presentation is noted: "Preverbal children with AMS can develop loss of appetite, irritability, and pallor." The condition generally improves without further ascent: "AMS generally resolves within 12–48 hours if travelers do not ascend farther," and "The condition is typically self-limited, developing and resolving over 1–3 days."

### Clinical significance of monitoring early symptom change to predict outcome [^aa6ebfa4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Even with efforts to develop medication algorithms for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses, there is no single authoritative method that can be used to incorporate multiple factors in the treatment decision process. For this reason, physicians are faced with the often daunting task of sifting through the numerous treatment options for psychiatric illness to develop an approach that will prove the most successful for their patients. Investigating patient patterns of response, particularly during the acute phase of treatment, and bearing them in mind when developing treatment protocols may assist clinicians in optimally managing the degree and course of symptom response. We present here a consideration of the timing and nature of response as well as individual patient predictors, which may impact therapy decisions. Furthermore, we explore the clinical significance of integrating response patterns into the treatment approach. We believe that an analysis of response patterns, in conjunction with the use of other practice guidelines, is a viable method to more effectively navigate critical decision points in the treatment process and ultimately have a dramatic effect on patient outcome.

### Methemoglobinemia secondary to babesia microti infection: a novel case report [^c1f60178]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Tick-borne illnesses and methemoglobinemia have not been known to occur together in humans. Few cases have been documented in various animals of methemoglobinemia secondary to tick-borne infections.

Case Report

A 49-year-old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department from an urgent care with hypoxia saturating in the mid 80s. He also reported a pruritic rash on his back and right shoulder as well as both of his lower extremities. The rash had been present for 4 days. The patient was tachycardic and hypoxic at 90% but denied shortness of breath. He had cyanosis of the lips and fingertips and multiple erythematous, raised, ovoid lesions on the right shoulder and left lower extremity. Methemoglobin levels were elevated at 26%. He was treated with methylene blue, supplemental oxygen, and empiric doxycycline with improvement in his oxygenation. A tick-borne illness panel later tested positive for Babesia microti infection. His skin lesions resolved with the above described treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Both tick-borne illnesses and methemoglobinemia are typically easily treatable with proper antimicrobial coverage and methylene blue, respectively. The current literature is bare regarding concurrent tick-borne illnesses, specifically babesiosis, and methemoglobinemia. Without knowledge and documentation of a potential link between the two conditions, hypoxia, if found to be due to methemoglobinemia, may be treated adequately, but a potentially life-threatening tick-borne illness may continue to cause damage and disease to the patient if not tested for, identified, and treated.

Subconjunctival hemorrhage — presentation and field management are summarized as follows: Bleeding between the conjunctiva and sclera causes a collection of blood that appears bright red, and subconjunctival hemorrhages are most often caused by straining (during sneezing, coughing, vomiting, or toileting), rubbing of the eye, or due to barotrauma if diving. Although impressive looking, this condition is typically benign and it will resolve in days to weeks without treatment, and unless there are signs of a ruptured globe or basilar skull fracture, no backcountry treatment or evacuation is required.

### Specialized pro-resolving mediators in vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^449d9928]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Timely resolution of the acute inflammatory response (or inflammation resolution) is an active, highly coordinated process that is essential to optimal health. Inflammation resolution is regulated by specific endogenous signalling molecules that function as 'stop signals' to terminate the inflammatory response when it is no longer needed; to actively promote healing, regeneration and tissue repair; and to limit pain. Specialized pro-resolving mediators are a superfamily of signalling molecules that initiate anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving actions. Without an effective and timely resolution response, inflammation can become chronic, a pathological state that is associated with many widely occurring human diseases, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Uncovering the mechanisms of inflammation resolution failure in cardiovascular diseases and identifying useful biomarkers for non-resolving inflammation are unmet needs. In this Review, we discuss the accumulating evidence that supports the role of non-resolving inflammation in atherosclerosis and the use of specialized pro-resolving mediators as therapeutic tools for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We highlight open questions about therapeutic strategies and mechanisms of disease to provide a framework for future studies on the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.

### Prevalence of symptoms ≤ 12 months after acute illness, by COVID-19 testing status among adults-United States, December 2020-March 2023 [^1be6aacd]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

To further the understanding of post-COVID conditions, and provide a more nuanced description of symptom progression, resolution, emergence, and reemergence after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-like illness, analysts examined data from the Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry (INSPIRE), a prospective multicenter cohort study. This report includes analysis of data on self-reported symptoms collected from 1,296 adults with COVID-like illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using a Food and Drug Administration-approved polymerase chain reaction or antigen test at the time of enrollment and reported symptoms at 3-month intervals for 12 months. Prevalence of any symptom decreased substantially between baseline and the 3-month follow-up, from 98.4% to 48.2% for persons who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (COVID test-positive participants) and from 88.2% to 36.6% for persons who received negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (COVID test-negative participants). Persistent symptoms decreased through 12 months; no difference between the groups was observed at 12 months (prevalence among COVID test-positive and COVID test-negative participants = 18.3% and 16.1%, respectively; p > 0.05). Both groups reported symptoms that emerged or reemerged at 6, 9, and 12 months. Thus, these symptoms are not unique to COVID-19 or to post-COVID conditions. Awareness that symptoms might persist for up to 12 months, and that many symptoms might emerge or reemerge in the year after COVID-like illness, can assist health care providers in understanding the clinical signs and symptoms associated with post-COVID-like conditions.

### Promoting resolution in kidney disease: are we nearly there yet? [^c966e179]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nephrology lacks effective therapeutics for many of the presentations and diseases seen in clinical practice. In recent decades, we have come to understand the central place of inflammation in initiating and propagating kidney disease, and, research in more recent years has established that the resolution of inflammation is a highly regulated and active process. With this, has evolved an appreciation that this aspect of the host inflammatory response is defective in kidney disease and led to consideration of a therapeutic paradigm aiming to harness the activity of the molecular drivers of the resolution phase of inflammation. Fatty-acid-derived Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), partly responsible for resolution of inflammation have gained traction as potential therapeutics.

Recent Findings

We describe our current understanding of SPMs for this purpose in acute and chronic kidney disease. These studies cement the place of inflammation and its defective resolution in the pathogenesis of kidney disease, and highlight new avenues for therapy.

Summary

Targeting resolution of inflammation is a viable approach to treating kidney disease. We optimistically look forward to translating these experimental advances into tractable therapeutics to treat kidney disease.

### Prevention of hepatitis A virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, 2020 [^89c24739]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Features and Natural History

Infection in humans occurs after an average incubation period of 28 days (range: 15–50 days). Symptomatic HAV infection is clinically indistinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis but is usually mild and self-limited, with an abrupt onset that can include fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and abdominal discomfort, followed within a few days to a week by dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. The likelihood of having symptoms with HAV infection is related to age. In children aged < 6 years, 70% of infections are asymptomatic; illnesses that do occur are not typically accompanied by jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection typically is symptomatic, with jaundice occurring in > 70% of patients. Signs and symptoms usually resolve within 2–3 months, with complete recovery within 6 months. However, 10%–15% of symptomatic persons have prolonged or relapsing hepatitis A lasting up to 6 months and should be considered infectious. Although relapse consists of elevated liver enzyme levels and detection of virus in stools, recovery from relapse is universal, and infection with HAV has not been found to cause chronic infection. Fulminant hepatic failure is rare and occurs in < 1% of cases, although hepatic failure has been observed in a higher percentage of cases in the widespread outbreaks that began in 2016.

In infected persons, HAV replicates in the liver, is excreted in bile, and is shed in stool. Peak transmissibility in infected persons occurs during the 2-week period before the onset of jaundice or elevation of liver enzymes, when concentration of virus in stool is highest. The concentration of virus in the stool decreases after jaundice appears, and most persons cease to be infectious 1 week after jaundice onset. Children can shed HAV for longer periods than adults, up to 10 weeks after onset of clinical illness. In one nosocomial outbreak, infants who were infected as neonates shed HAV for up to 6 months. Chronic shedding of HAV in feces does not occur typically; however, recurrent shedding occurs during relapses in persons with relapsing illness. Viremia occurs soon after infection and persists through the period of liver enzyme elevation but at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than in stool (,–). Prolonged viremia and fecal shedding of HAV for more than a month in immunocompetent persons and for more than a year in immunocompromised patients has been reported in several studies. Prolonged viremia after organ transplantation also has been described.

### Mpox clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies: a review [^9e03b4e5]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A global outbreak of clade IIb Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections spread rapidly across at least 118 countries resulting in a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) from July 2022 to May 2023. This outbreak affected more than 99 000 persons worldwide and caused more than 33 000 infections and 60 deaths in the US. In 2024, there have been approximately 200 new infections per month in the US. On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization declared mpox a PHEIC for a second time due to a rapid increase in infections with clade I MPXV in Central Africa.

Observations

Mpox is primarily acquired through direct skin to skin contact with MPXV. With clade IIb MPXV, infections are most commonly associated with sexual activity among individuals who are gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. After a median incubation period of 7 to 10 days, prodromal symptoms include fever (62%-72%), lymphadenopathy (56%-86%), myalgias (31%-55%), malaise (23%-57%), and headache (25%-55%). Skin lesions progress through 4 well-defined stages (macules, papules, vesicles, and pustules) over 2 to 4 weeks. Clade IIb MPXV is typically a self-limited illness with a low mortality rate (< 0.2% in the US); however, severe illness and death may occur in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with advanced HIV (CD4 count < 200 cells/μL). Mpox should be suspected in patients with potential exposure to MPXV who have skin lesions, and the diagnosis is confirmed with polymerase chain reaction testing of lesions. Management is supportive and focuses on skin care and symptom relief with analgesics. While no antiviral treatments are currently approved for mpox by the US Food and Drug Administration, several therapeutics, such as tecovirimat, brincidofovir, and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous, are available through expanded access programs or clinical trials. Vaccination with the 2-dose Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic vaccine is recommended for high-incidence populations and has an efficacy of 66% to 86%.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mpox is a viral infection transmitted primarily through close skin to skin contact that typically causes a self-resolving illness but can result in severe illness and death in immunocompromised individuals. First-line therapy is supportive care, although patients with severe mpox infection may be treated with advanced therapeutics. Mpox vaccination is effective and, if available, should be offered to individuals at risk of exposure to mpox.

### Glucagon orchestrates stress-induced hyperglycaemia [^f437205a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Stress‐induced Hyperglycaemia

Stress‐induced hyperglycaemia, also referred to as stress hyperglycaemia, hospital hyperglycaemia or hyperglycaemia of critical illness is a serious and common condition where blood glucose levels > 140 mg/dl occur during hospitalization for traumatic injury, burn, surgery and critical or acute medical illness 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. SIH typically resolves on recovery from the acute medical insult and before discharge from the hospital. Some restrict the use of the term SIH to those patients without a history of diabetes, while others include all patients irrespective of their baseline diabetes status. In the present review, patients previously diagnosed with diabetes and those with no medical history of diabetes will be discussed together. SIH typically occurs in 35–40% of all hospitalized patients when 140 mg/dl is used as the threshold 23. In a more recent study assessing almost 50 million point‐of‐care glucose values from over 3.4 million patients, the prevalence of hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl) was 32.2% in patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and 32.0% in non‐ICU patients 30. Approximately 70–80% of patients with SIH admitted to the ICU have no history of diabetes 23, 31. With over 38 million US hospital discharges per year in 2011 and the high prevalence of SIH, this condition is estimated to affect millions annually and has a substantial impact on healthcare costs 32, 33, 34.

### Inflammation resolution: implications for atherosclerosis [^d2ea33a2]. Circulation Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Resolution is an active and highly coordinated process that occurs in response to inflammation to limit tissue damage and promote repair. When the resolution program fails, inflammation persists. It is now understood that failed resolution is a major underlying cause of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we will review the major failures of resolution in atherosclerosis, including the imbalance of proinflammatory to pro-resolving mediator production, impaired clearance of dead cells, and functional changes in immune cells that favor ongoing inflammation. In addition, we will briefly discuss new concepts that are emerging as possible regulators of resolution and highlight the translational significance for the field.

Inflammation must be tightly regulated to both defend against pathogens and restore tissue homeostasis. The resolution of inflammatory responses is a dynamic process orchestrated by cells of the immune system. Macrophages, tissue-resident innate immune cells, are key players in modulating inflammation. Here, we review recent work highlighting the importance of macrophages in tissue resolution and the return to homeostasis. We propose that enhancing macrophage pro-resolution functions represents a novel and widely applicable therapeutic strategy to dampen inflammation, promote repair, and restore tissue integrity and function.

### What are the targets of inflammatory bowel disease management [^33e76967]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

With recent evidence suggesting that keeping the inflammatory process under tight control prevents long-term disability, the aim of treatments in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has shifted from symptom control toward the resolution of bowel inflammation. Mucosal healing is currently recognized as the principal treatment target to be used in a "treat to target" paradigm, whereas histologic healing and normalization of biomarkers are being evaluated as potential future targets. Although symptom relief is no longer a sufficient target, patient experience with the disease is of unquestionable importance and should be assessed in the form of patient-reported outcomes, to be used as a co-primary target with an objective measure of disease activity. IBD in is a heterogeneous disease; thus besides defining common treatment targets, every effort should be made to deliver a personalized treatment plan based on the risk factors for disease progression and individual drug metabolism to improve treatment success.

### Clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of ross river virus… [^7a445733]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Ross River virus disease is a mosquito-borne illness characterized by fever, arthralgias, and rash.
- It is endemic to Australia, Papua New Guinea, and many South Pacific Islands.
- There is no specific treatment for Ross River virus disease; clinical management is supportive.
- Counsel patients about using personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites.
- Patients with Ross River virus disease should not donate blood for 4 months after their illness. Clinical features Patients with Ross River virus disease most commonly report polyarthritis, fever, fatigue and rash. Arthritis is usually symmetrical and involves peripheral joints, including knees, ankles, wrists, fingers, and metacarpophalangeal joints. Rash occurs primarily on the limbs and trunk and is typically maculopapular, with purpuric and vesicular rashes less common. Most symptoms resolve after a few weeks, but joint pain and fatigue can persist for six months or more.

No fatal cases of Ross River virus disease have been reported. Diagnosis The differential diagnosis will vary depending on the travel destination of the patient. In travelers to Australia, it might include other arboviral diseases, such as Barmah Forest virus disease, or non-arboviral diseases such as adenoviral, enteroviral, or rickettsial infections. In a traveler to Papua New Guinea or Pacific Island nations, possible arboviral diseases also include dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus disease. Treatment and prevention Currently there are no specific medications for Ross River virus disease. Supportive care is recommended for any patient suspected of having Ross River virus disease. Over-the-counter pain relievers, rest, fluids, and physical therapy can be used to relieve some symptoms. Patients should be advised to avoid aspirin containing drugs or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if dengue virus disease is suspected or has not been ruled out.

In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized to receive supportive treatment, such as intravenous fluids, pain medication, and nursing care.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^4bdaf436]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis is the traditional basis for decision-making in clinical practice. Evidence is often lacking about future benefits and harms of these decisions for patients diagnosed with and without disease. We propose that a model of clinical practice focused on patient prognosis and predicting the likelihood of future outcomes may be more useful.

Discussion

Disease diagnosis can provide crucial information for clinical decisions that influence outcome in serious acute illness. However, the central role of diagnosis in clinical practice is challenged by evidence that it does not always benefit patients and that factors other than disease are important in determining patient outcome. The concept of disease as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' is challenged by the frequent use of diagnostic indicators with continuous distributions, such as blood sugar, which are better understood as contributing information about the probability of a patient's future outcome. Moreover, many illnesses, such as chronic fatigue, cannot usefully be labelled from a disease-diagnosis perspective. In such cases, a prognostic model provides an alternative framework for clinical practice that extends beyond disease and diagnosis and incorporates a wide range of information to predict future patient outcomes and to guide decisions to improve them. Such information embraces non-disease factors and genetic and other biomarkers which influence outcome.

Summary

Patient prognosis can provide the framework for modern clinical practice to integrate information from the expanding biological, social, and clinical database for more effective and efficient care.

### Duration of untreated, uncomplicated Chlamydia trachomatis genital infection and factors associated with Chlamydia resolution: a review of human studies [^892b922e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The majority of Chlamydia trachomatis genital infections in humans are asymptomatic and without clinical evidence of complications at the time of diagnosis. The natural history of chlamydial infection in humans, including the duration of infection and factors influencing resolution of infection, is not yet completely understood. This is in part attributable to the inherent challenges and ethical considerations in studying untreated chlamydia in humans. An improved understanding of the natural history of chlamydia in humans has implications for chlamydia screening and treatment recommendations. In April 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened an advisory group for the Chlamydia Immunology and Control Expert Advisory Meeting, in which studies related to chlamydia natural history, pathogenesis, and immunobiology were reviewed and gaps in our knowledge that would have implications for prevention and control of C. trachomatis infection were identified. This article summarizes the key questions posed and the evidence reviewed on the duration of untreated, uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection in humans and the factors associated with chlamydia resolution.

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^4d54ad78]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Natural killer (NK) cell have also been proposed to play a role in the resolution of allergic airway disease. NK cells are diminished in their numbers in asthma and have lost essential cytotoxic properties, which may explain the increased number of leukocytes in the airways of asthma patients.

Taken together, these data suggest that resolution of inflammation is orchestrated in a tissue-specific and disease-specific manner. The mechanisms that guide resolution in inflammatory processes do not seem to be uniform. In contrast, they appear to be tailored to effectively switch off the dominant cellular and molecular immune process that is also responsible for the activation of inflammation in the respective disease. This concept bears great advantages for the organism, as it can effectively stop inflammation and instigate tissue repair without the need to create a state of systemic immune suppression. It also demonstrates that resolution of inflammation should be perceived as a local process that aims to contain the immuno-inflammatory pathways operating in the affected tissues and organs, while not triggering a systemic change of the immune status of the individual. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the best strategies to therapeutically foster resolution of inflammation may vary from disease to disease and rather depend on effectively influencing the local inflammatory micro-milieu than inducing a state of systemic immune suppression. In the following chapter, potential therapeutic approaches that have the potential to strengthen resolution of inflammation will be discussed.

### Resolution of chronic inflammatory disease: universal and tissue-specific concepts [^918b3a5e]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Resolution of colitis

Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are severe inflammatory conditions that preferentially affect the distal small intestine or colon with little signs of spontaneous resolution. Resolution of colitis appears to essentially depend on regulatory T cells. It has been shown that during the process of resolution, T cells change their transcriptional profile and acquire regulatory properties with induction of the canonical TGF-beta pathway. Furthermore, IL-10 and IL-35 production by Treg cells supports the resolution process. In this context it is particularly remarkable that some of these regulatory T cells originate from the trans-differentiation of TH17 cells. Regulatory T cells have shown to effectively suppress pro-inflammatory immune responses in experimental colitis. For instance, in the adoptive T cell transfer model of colitis, transfer of naturally occurring regulatory T cells and ex vivo TGFβ-induced regulatory T cells permit resolution of colitis. Interestingly, a pilot study in Crohn's disease used ex vivo generated ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cells from the peripheral blood for clinical treatment. The administration of such antigen-specific Treg cells was well tolerated and resulted in dose-dependent efficacy, indicating that Treg-based immunotherapeutic approaches hold promise for resolution of inflammation.

### Diagnosis and management of Q fever – United States, 2013: recommendations from CDC and the Q fever working group [^e70b635b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute Q fever in adults — The majority of acute Q fever cases resolve spontaneously within 2–3 weeks, even without treatment, but symptomatic patients with confirmed or suspected acute Q fever, including children with severe illness, should be treated with doxycycline. Doxycycline is the most effective treatment for Q fever, and treatment is most effective when given in the first 3 days of symptoms, shortens the illness, and reduces the risk for severe complications. If doxycycline is contraindicated because of allergies, other antibiotic regimens that can be used include moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin. Treatment for acute Q fever is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons or for those whose symptoms have resolved, although it might be considered in those at high risk for developing chronic Q fever; in one study, those who eventually had chronic Q fever were more likely to have not received appropriate doxycycline treatment during their acute illness. Patients with acute Q fever should undergo a careful clinical assessment to determine whether they might be at risk for progression to chronic Q fever, including review of possible immunosuppressive conditions, pregnancy testing when appropriate, and assessment for vascular and heart valve defects because certain valvular lesions might not be detectable by auscultation.

### Symptom duration and risk factors for delayed return to usual… [^a889493e]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Presence of chronic conditions also affected return to health rates; among 180 persons with no or one chronic medical condition, 39 with two chronic medical conditions, and 44 with three or more chronic medical conditions, 28%, 46%, and 57%, respectively, reported not having returned to their usual state of health within 14–21 days after having a positive test result. Resolution of Symptoms and Duration Among the 274 symptomatic outpatients, the median number of symptoms was seven of 17 listed in the interview tool, with fatigue, cough, and headache those most commonly reported. Among respondents who reported fever and chills on the day of testing, these resolved in 97% and 96% of respondents, respectively.

Symptoms least likely to have resolved included cough and fatigue; among 90 who reported shortness of breath at the time of testing, this symptom had not resolved in 26. The median interval to symptom resolution among those who reported individual symptoms at the time of testing but not at the time of the interview ranged from 4 to 8 days from the test date, with the longest intervals reported for loss of smell and loss of taste. 1, 2). This report indicates that even among symptomatic adults tested in outpatient settings, it might take weeks for resolution of symptoms and return to usual health. Not returning to usual health within 2–3 weeks of testing was reported by approximately one third of respondents.

Even among young adults aged 18–34 years with no chronic medical conditions, nearly one in five reported that they had not returned to their usual state of health 14–21 days after testing. In contrast, over 90% of outpatients with influenza recover within approximately 2 weeks of having a positive test result. Older age and presence of multiple chronic medical conditions have previously been associated with illness severity among adults hospitalized with COVID-19; in this study, both were also associated with prolonged illness in an outpatient population.

Post-COVID conditions: information for healthcare providers Supporting Files Public Domain Apr 8, 2021 File Language: English. Details Corporate Authors: Description: Updated Apr. 8, 2021 Some patients who have been infected with SARS-COV-2 have symptoms and clinical findings that persist beyond four weeks or can recur following initial recovery. Persistent symptoms and clinical findings can occur regardless of the severity of acute COVID-19. Medical and research communities are still learning about these post-acute symptoms and clinical findings. Post-COVID conditions are being referred to by a wide range of names, including post-acute COVID-19, long-term effects of COVID, long COVID, post-acute COVID syndrome, chronic COVID, long-haul COVID, late sequelae, and others, as well as the research term post-acute sequalae of SARS-COV-2 infection.

external icon Although standardized case definitions are still being developed, in the broadest sense, it can be considered a lack of return to a usual state of health following acute COVID-19 illness. It might also include development of new or recurrent symptoms that occur after the symptoms of acute illness have resolved.

### Characterising long COVID: a living systematic review [^a6a30061]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The symptoms of long COVID are equally ill-defined, with patients describing it as a fluctuating illness of disparate symptoms. Indeed, the National Institute for Health Research has suggested that postacute COVID-19 may consist of several distinct clinical syndromes including: a postintensive care syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, long-term COVID-19 syndrome and disease from SARS-CoV-2 inflicted organ damage. Additionally, even with an expanding knowledge of risk factors in the acute phase, little is currently known on predictive factors for developing long COVID. Despite suggested classifications, there is yet no clear consensus.

Our early understanding of long COVID has been accumulated from case reports and cross-sectional online survey studies as the pandemic global research focus has largely been on studies of hospitalised patients during the acute phase. As the pandemic progresses, emerging studies have followed up patients to present the fluctuating multiorgan sequelae of acute COVID-19, yet evidence is still scarce. There continues to be a call to further understand and acknowledge this condition by incorporating patient knowledge and experiences, together with standardised studies, exploring underlying aetiologies behind different syndromes.

Given the enormous number of people worldwide who have suffered from COVID-19, it is essential to establish a precise categorisation of long COVID. Such categorisation will not only help people better understand their symptoms but also direct research into prevention, treatment and support, ultimately allowing us to understand and prepare to respond to the long-term consequences inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review seeks to synthesise and continually update the evidence on the character and prevalence of long COVID.

### Symptom duration and resolution with early outpatient treatment of convalescent plasma for coronavirus disease 2019: a randomized trial [^c23ff4cd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

We investigated the influence of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) versus control plasma on resolution of symptoms from the day of transfusion through day 14 of follow-up as part of a randomized controlled trial. This analysis explores the resolution of all symptoms, the resolution of symptoms closely aligned with the ability to return to work, and the clustering of symptoms at day 14. We also explored the change in severity of symptoms by day 14 between treatments for 4 symptoms with higher impact on overall day-to-day functioning: cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and headache. We chose these symptoms for an in-depth look at changes in severity owing to their impact on quality of life, including at work.

### Beyond survival: identifying what matters to survivors of critical illness [^27322434]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Non-mortality endpoints in clinical trials

Surviving an ICU stay matters overwhelmingly. Conditional on survival, there are multiple other facets which matter substantially. A study among survivors demonstrated that some perceived the burden of survivorship as " worse than death ". Although a minority hold this view, most patients and caregivers are accepting of tragic trade-offs associated with survival. From a practical standpoint, "affective forecasting" in the setting of new disabilities remains challenging and is unpredictably influenced by patients' resilience and adaptation. This underpins the importance of looking beyond mortality and derived measures. So how do we identify areas which deserve prioritization in terms of developing and testing treatment strategies based on patients' perspectives?

Current critical care literature is rife with trials which have not demonstrated meaningful mortality reduction, while this could be attributed to trials being under-powered or study populations being heterogeneous, the trend remains disappointing. A systematic review of 212 trials provided no conclusive evidence of any single pharmacological intervention translating to mortality benefit. Interestingly, another meta-analysis concluded that patient-important outcomes other than mortality were seldom primary outcomes and commonly used surrogates did not directly matter to patients. With this background, our current framework affords a limited insight into the impact of various interventions in this growing population. These issues are being increasingly recognized, culminating in calls for more efficient, patient-centered research.

Substantial work has been done in this area leading to development of core-outcome sets and validated measures to encourage standardized reporting and comparability between trials. Although work on this topic engaged patients and caregivers, overall representation of such groups has been low. Patients who do not survive for long are naturally excluded. For survivors, a single interview far removed from index episode introduces biases and is incapable of tracking "response shifts." Our current understanding therefore remains primarily reflective of the perception of stakeholders other than patients or care-givers.

The key question remains: What matters most to survivors of critical illness and their caregivers and how could these priority areas be identified reliably?

Recovery is multidimensional with its extent varying across multiple domains, such as cognitive, physical, mental health, return to work or residence, and therefore identification of order of prioritization is a key initial step.

### Why Do some people develop serious COVID-19 disease after infection, while others only exhibit mild symptoms? [^43e631a2]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The year 2020 was a landmark year of a once-in-a-century pandemic of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, that led to a rapidly spreading coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The spectrum of disease with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from asymptomatic to mild upper respiratory illness, to moderate to severe disease with respiratory compromise to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death. Early in the pandemic, risk factors were recognized that contributed to more severe disease, but it became evident that individuals and even young people could have severe COVID-19. As we started to understand the immunobiology of COVID-19, it became clearer that the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were variable, and in some cases, the excessive inflammatory response contributed to greater morbidity and mortality. In this review, we will explore some of the additional risk factors that appear to contribute to disease severity and enhance our understanding of why some individuals experience more severe COVID-19. Recent advances in genome-wide associations have identified potential candidate genes in certain populations that may modify the host immune responses leading to dysregulated host immunity. Genetic defects of the type I interferon pathway are also linked to a more clinically severe phenotype of COVID-19. Finally, dysregulation of the adaptive immune system may also play a role in the severity and complex clinical course of patients with COVID-19. A better understanding of the host immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 will hopefully lead to new treatment modalities to prevent the poor outcomes of COVID-19 in those individuals with pre-existing risk factors or genetic variants that contribute to the dysregulated host immune responses.

### Risk variants in the exomes of children with critical illness [^0e7b7352]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

De Novo Enrichment in Children With Critical Illness

Among the 57 resolved or partially resolved probands, 46 were trios, and among the 227 unresolved probands, 114 were trios (Table 1). We assessed enrichment of de novo variants in genes without a known disease association (Table 2; eTable 8 in the Supplement). De novo LOF variants were enriched in unresolved probands (observed, 14; expected, 6.8; enrichment, 2.05; P = 0.01) but not in resolved probands (observed, 3; expected, 2.8; enrichment, 1.09; P = 0.52). These data support the hypothesis that despite ndES probands in the PICU likely carry LOF risk variants.

### Role of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators in pulmonary inflammation diseases: mechanisms and development [^d50902e9]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammation is a major defense mechanism of the human body. If the body is subjected to an injury, infection, or other similar stimuli, the innate immune system becomes activated within seconds-to-minutes. Innate immunity is useful in promoting inflammation and can aid in determining the level of pathogenic invasion or stimuli. Although inflammatory reactions evolve as an adaptive reaction that could restore homeostasis, a successful inflammatory response is complete only after resolution and restoration phases. If inflammation persists or becomes uncontrolled, it could elicit an overprotective response by the body. Thus, inflammatory factors can mediate an auto-immune reaction to attack healthy cells and tissues in the body. This action can cause rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, asthma, and vasculitis. Recently, studies have shown that chronic, persistent inflammation might be the cause of cancer, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease) and even certain types of mental illness.

Acute inflammation is induced by the innate immune system, which has an essential protective role, prevents some infections, and promotes healing in injured tissues. Briefly, if the body is stimulated by inflammation, infection, or other pathogenic factors, an acute immune response is accelerated. Inflammatory cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), are recruited by cytokines and chemokines, which accelerate the inflammatory response and reduce further damage to tissues.

After the body initially launches an immune response, acute inflammation begins to subside. Phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils) are mobilized to eliminate apoptotic and necrotic cells and thereby promote the repair/recovery of tissue and maintain tissue homeostasis by generating pro-inflammatory mediators. In health, this process occurs actively in a specific self-limiting manner. However, if the acute inflammatory response is not controlled or completed within a specific timeframe, inflammation may persist, or the body may initiate an exaggerated inflammatory response, which may lead to inflammation recurrence. Such situations may induce chronic inflammation, disease, or even death.

### Mood, illness and injury responses and recovery with adventure racing [^dd4e2739]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Exercise stress, immune status, and mood are interrelated. The stress of adventure racing is unique; exercise is very prolonged and competitive, with severe sleep deprivation and sustained cognitive demands, usually in arduous terrain and environmental conditions. The purpose of this prospective, descriptive study was to identify mood changes along with symptoms of illness and injury during and in the weeks following an international-level adventure race.

Methods

Mood, sleep, injury, and illness data were collected using questionnaires before, during, and for 2 weeks following New Zealand's Southern Traverse Adventure Race in November 2003.

Results

Mood was variable between athletes, but peaks of altered mood subscores were evident (P < .05) during the first 24 hours of racing, around race completion, and, as was hypothesized, 3 days after racing. Altered mood subscores resolved within 2 weeks. Symptoms of upper respiratory illness were most common immediately before (25/60, 42%) and after (28/49, 57%) racing, and largely resolved over the 2-week follow-up (5/27, 19%). Skin wounds and infections were common (43/49, 88%) immediately after the race but settled quickly. Pain was universal (100%), and musculoskeletal injury was common (38/48, 79%). Gastrointestinal complaints were common at the finish (8/49, 16%) and during the next 5 days but settled more quickly than upper respiratory symptoms.

Conclusions

Adventure racing of approximately 100 hours causes significant symptomatic injury and illness and mood state disruption, which generally resolve within a fortnight following racing. Disrupted mood and symptoms of illness and injury indicate athlete susceptibility to overreaching or overtraining without sufficient recovery.

### Executive summary: evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^1e7fa033]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric somatic symptom and related disorders in the emergency department (ED) — Somatic symptom and related disorders encompass conditions in which physical symptoms are not intentionally produced or associated with material gain, and symptoms of pediatric somatic symptom and related disorders often do not meet strict diagnostic criteria and defy categorization, with clinical presentations most often involving neurologic, pain, autonomic, or gastrointestinal tract symptoms. Risk factors include higher rates in patients who are adolescent, female, or of minority ethnicities; who live in urban areas; are from nonintact families; whose parents have lower education level; whose family members have somatic symptom and related disorders; and who have histories of psychological trauma. Caring for such patients in the ED can be particularly vexing, because few patients will have received a formal diagnosis, and ED clinicians often do not have access to sufficient clinical information to confirm the diagnosis, and because of diagnostic uncertainty, patients with somatic symptom and related disorders are at risk for extensive, invasive, or potentially harmful testing and interventions in the ED. ED management strategies — ED clinicians may consider doing the following: Reassure the patient and family that the patient's symptoms are being heard and taken seriously and that testing and treatment that are medically indicated will be performed; Emphasize collaboration between the patient, family, and all caregivers; make referrals as needed; and identify common goals and outcomes. Educating the patient and family about the limitations of the ED setting and what are alternative settings for evaluation and treatment may be beneficial; Introduce the concept of working on improving functioning while also working on symptom resolution; Coordinate the patient's care with the medical home and other involved care providers to help the ED clinician avoid unnecessary testing or intervention and reassure the patient and family.

### Premature commitment to uncertain decisions during human NMDA receptor hypofunction [^bfd5b821]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Furthermore, low-dose infusions of ketamine have been proposed as a pharmacological model of symptoms observed at early stages of psychosis, — a stage where patients report elevated uncertainty rather than the overconfidence characteristic of later stages of the disease. This early stage of the disease is extremely difficult to study because patients are typically not receiving health care before developing a full-blown psychosis. The two effects of ketamine observed in our task could potentially reconcile these two stages in a unified account: an initial state of high uncertaintyand premature commitmentswhich progressively results in overconfidence and a weaker relation between confidence and decision accuracy — both of which being characteristic of psychosis. Confirming this speculative hypothesis will require testing patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in our task at different stages of their illness. Such clinical investigation could clarify whether "jumping to conclusions" (a form of premature commitments) aims at resolving the abnormal uncertainty experienced by patients at early stages of their illness. It may also ultimately help determine whether treatment at early stages of psychosis should aim at increasing tolerance to uncertainty, through psychotherapeuticor pharmacologicalapproaches.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with schizophrenia [^c3920074]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis in youth psychosis — effective treatment relies on an accurate diagnosis and a thorough assessment to identify any other contributing medical or psychiatric conditions and/or psychosocial stressors, and the proper assessment of psychosis in youth requires the gauging of potential symptom reports in the context of normal development; the mere fact that a child responds affirmatively to questions regarding hallucinations or delusions does not ipso facto mean the child is psychotic. Psychotic symptoms occur in the context of an illness, and psychotic illnesses are rare in youth, especially in children younger than 12 years. The accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses should be based on characteristic patterns of illness and overt signs on the mental status examination, and clinical features that help confirm a diagnosis of schizophrenia include deteriorating function, thought disorder, and bizarre behavior. Medical conditions that can result in psychosis include central nervous system infections, delirium, neoplasms, endocrine disorders, genetic syndromes (e.g., velocardiofacial [22q11] syndrome), autoimmune disorders, and toxic exposures. Drugs of abuse that can result in psychotic symptoms include dextromethorphan, lysergic acid diethylamide, hallucinogenic mushrooms, psilocybin, peyote, cannabis, stimulants, and inhalants, and prescription drugs associated with psychosis include steroids, anticholinergics, antihistamines, and amphetamines; typically, acute psychosis secondary to intoxication resolves within days to weeks once the offending drug is discontinued. Adolescents with EOS appear to be at substantial risk for comorbid substance abuse, cannabis use in teenagers is associated with a higher risk of eventually developing psychosis, and when drug abuse precedes the development of schizophrenia it is difficult to gauge whether the psychosis represents independent drug effects or the unmasking of the underlying illness.

### Catatonia and its treatment [^9c6a990a]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Psychiatric diagnoses are currently categorized on a syndromic basis. The syndrome of catatonia, however, remains in a diagnostic limbo, acknowledged predominantly as a subtype of schizophrenia. Yet, catatonia is present in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatry patients, only a minority of whom have schizophrenia. Among those with comorbid affective disorders, who comprise the largest subgroup of catatonic patients, the catatonic signs typically resolve dramatically and completely with benzodiazepine therapy. Those with schizophrenia respond less reliably, suggesting that the underlying processes causing the catatonia may be different in this group. The majority of patients with catatonia have concurrent psychosis. Failure to treat the catatonia before institution of antipsychotic medication may increase the risk of inducing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. At this point of time, the pathobiology of catatonia is unknown; the major reason for considering catatonia as a separate diagnostic entity would be to increase recognition of this eminently treatable neuropsychiatric syndrome.

### Beyond survival: identifying what matters to survivors of critical illness [^a241f58c]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Critical care has made great strides in the last 50 years. Advances have led to significant reduction in hospital mortality despite an increase in severity of illness. Though encouraging, survivors of critical illness often endure long-term sequelae across multiple domains which can be debilitating and life changing. These new or worsening impairments often persist years beyond index hospitalization. The impact of these impairments on patients, families, and healthcare systems cannot be underestimated. Although majority of patients are grateful to have survived even in the face of significant disability, some may regret having survived because of new or worsened disabilities.

Research in critical care has focused on mortality as the primary outcome of interest. The choice of a binary outcome: mortality being the focus of most trials is rational and intuitive. The importance of survival remains beyond debate, although intensive care unit stays for some represent a temporary stop in the natural dying process. Realistically, majority of survivors have expectations beyond survival. Therefore, the current practice of assessing interventions primarily on the basis of how effectively they influence mortality only deserves scrutiny.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^d7ddf104]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute urticaria — testing recommendations and indications: Skin testing or laboratory evaluation for allergy to foods, food additives, or aeroallergens not supported by a specific history compatible with IgE-mediated pathogenesis has not been associated with improved outcomes of care and is not recommended. Because acute urticaria and angioedema will usually resolve spontaneously, laboratory evaluation for chronic illness not suggested by the clinical history or physical examination and elimination diets are not recommended, and extensive evaluation for specific viral pathogens (or antiviral therapy) is not indicated unless suggested by the clinical history. In contrast, skin testing or immunoassay to identify specific triggers for acute urticaria and angioedema can be helpful if an allergic cause is suggested based on the patient's history, and skin testing in this scenario would only be done after the resolution of acute hives with suppression of antihistamines or through serologic testing in the presence of significant dermatographism.

Pain complaints — Infants and young children are at particular risk of being inadequately medicated for pain symptoms; when using analgesic medications, it is important to adopt a preventive approach by treating pain early and aggressively along with medications for anxiety and depression as indicated; the clinician should be aware of potential interactions when combining analgesic medications with other medications, particularly those that could contribute to an increased risk of sedation or respiratory distress; the mental health clinician typically participates in pain management as part of a multidisciplinary team using pharmacological and nonpharmacological modalities, and in disabling chronic pain can help the family and pediatric health care team adopt a rehabilitation model focused on adaptation to symptoms that may not resolve.

Assess illness understanding and prognostic awareness — best practices — begin after establishing a mutually agreed-upon agenda, when a best practice is to assess the patient's and family's understanding of the patient's medical condition by asking what they understand about the injury or illness and by actively listening to gauge prognostic awareness and readiness for updates; it is common to encounter overly optimistic or unrealistic trajectories or prognoses. It is particularly important to address and discuss the needs of trauma patients with underlying frailty or comorbidities that pose additional risks and barriers for recovery, and promoting accurate illness understanding often requires multiple conversations over time.

### Efferocytosis in health and disease [^4205923d]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2020). High credibility.

The clearance of apoptotic cells by professional and non-professional phagocytes - a process termed 'efferocytosis' - is essential for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Accordingly, defective efferocytosis underlies a growing list of chronic inflammatory diseases. Although much has been learnt about the mechanisms of apoptotic cell recognition and uptake, several key areas remain incompletely understood. This Review focuses on new discoveries related to how phagocytes process the metabolic cargo they receive during apoptotic cell uptake; the links between efferocytosis and the resolution of inflammation in health and disease; and the roles of efferocytosis in host defence. Understanding these aspects of efferocytosis sheds light on key physiological and pathophysiological processes and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for diseases driven by defective efferocytosis and impaired inflammation resolution.
