## Question

How would a specific clinical practice guideline support the implementation of an individualized plan of care. Be specific to a patient with MDD.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how a clinical practice guideline (CPG) can be used to support the development of an individualized plan of care for a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which CPG to anchor to and why. Then, I should verify the foundational principle of shared decision-making and how it operationalizes individualization. Next, I will examine the initial assessment and diagnostic formulation that shape the plan. After that, I need to check how severity, chronicity, and recurrence guide treatment selection and escalation. Then, I will review measurement-based care and iterative adjustment. I should also consider special populations and contextual factors, and finally synthesize how the CPG's algorithmic structure enables, rather than constrains, individualized care with a concrete example pathway.

> Let me first confirm the guideline anchor. The 2022 VA/DoD MDD CPG is a strong choice because it explicitly emphasizes patient-centered care, shared decision-making, and an algorithmic framework designed for adaptation to individual patient needs and local resources, which directly maps to individualized planning [^113ZppLz] [^115ocgsi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to ensure the core principle is clear. The VA/DoD CPG repeatedly states that treatment decisions should be made through shared decision-making, integrating clinical evidence with patient values, capabilities, and preferences. This is the mechanism by which guidelines become individualized rather than one-size-fits-all [^1115LSQn] [^112EVUCd].

> Next, I should review the initial assessment and diagnostic formulation, because individualization starts with a comprehensive understanding of the person. The CPG directs a thorough diagnostic evaluation including functional status, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, prior treatment history, family history, and suicide risk, and it recommends using measurement-based care (for example, PHQ-9) to quantify baseline severity and track change; this biopsychosocial formulation identifies predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors that shape the plan [^113kZnjo] [^114xXvPr] [^115q5jT9].

> Wait, let me verify how severity and clinical features steer initial modality selection. For uncomplicated MDD, the CPG supports either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy as first-line monotherapy based on patient preference. For severe, persistent, or recurrent presentations, it suggests combination therapy, reflecting higher symptom burden and functional impairment. Importantly, the strength of evidence for choosing one specific modality over another is often weak, reinforcing the need to individualize by preference, prior response, comorbidity, and access [^112PgFnJ] [^117EQLFj] [^113VEmQd].

> I will now examine how measurement-based care operationalizes iterative individualization. The CPG recommends routine, quantitative symptom tracking (for example, PHQ-9) at each visit, sharing results with the patient, and using those data to adjust treatment; if remission or patient-defined goals are not met, the plan should be reassessed, with attention to diagnosis, adherence, and adequacy of dose or engagement, aligning adjustments with patient preferences and evolving context [^115q5jT9] [^113uGapm] [^113HkV48].

> But wait, what if the patient does not respond adequately after an adequate trial? I should confirm the escalation logic. After 6–12 weeks of optimized treatment, partial or nonresponse should trigger reassessment of diagnosis and adherence, followed by switching modality or agent, augmentation, or combination strategies, chosen via shared decision-making; the CPG also reminds us that maximizing SSRI dose may not be helpful and can worsen tolerability, so dose escalation alone is not a reliable strategy [^111ZQkSR] [^111tjUuj] [^113ELnPn].

> Let me consider special populations and contextual factors, because individualization often hinges on these. In older adults, I need to check for different adverse effect profiles and consider lower starting doses, fall risk, and cognitive effects; in adolescents, I should confirm that CBT or IPT are first-line and that family engagement and school-based supports are integrated; across ages, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and access constraints should modify modality, setting, and supports to preserve equity and feasibility [^114Fe3PT] [^1169SG7o] [^1172H5RG].

> Hold on, I should verify how the algorithmic structure supports, rather than constrains, personalization. The VA/DoD algorithm provides decision points that prompt clinicians to consider patient willingness, prior treatment adequacy, and goals, and it explicitly encourages adaptation to local resources and patient-specific factors; this scaffold ensures no step is missed while still allowing flexible, patient-centered choices at each branch [^112Mp2J5] [^115ocgsi].

> Let me synthesize a concrete, individualized pathway to ensure this is actionable. For a patient with moderate MDD, prior good response to sertraline, current preference to avoid medication, and access to CBT, I would individualize by offering CBT monotherapy first, using PHQ-9 at each visit to track response, and if there is inadequate improvement after 6–8 weeks, I would revisit preferences and consider either adding sertraline or switching to sertraline monotherapy based on shared decision-making. If severe features emerge, I would pivot to combination therapy and coordinate collaborative care if in primary care, documenting how each decision aligns with the patient's goals and context [^112sLXjy] [^115q5jT9] [^117JWHUa].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that guidelines dictate a single best treatment; I should double-check and correct that. The VA/DoD and APA guidelines consistently note that evidence is often insufficient to rank one specific antidepressant or psychotherapy as superior for all, so the safest, most evidence-concordant path is to present balanced options, elicit preferences, and adjust based on response and tolerability, which is the essence of individualized, guideline-concordant care [^112PgFnJ] [^116m4yEY].

---

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) support individualized MDD care by providing a **structured, evidence-based framework** that integrates patient preferences, comorbidities, and severity into treatment selection [^113ZppLz]. They emphasize **shared decision-making** to choose among pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or combination therapy, and mandate **measurement-based care** with validated tools (e.g. PHQ-9) to track response and guide adjustments [^114xXvPr] [^115q5jT9]. CPGs also specify escalation strategies for inadequate response (switch, augment, or combine) and recommend collaborative care to coordinate services and address barriers, ensuring care is tailored to the patient's unique context and goals [^112C92B1] [^117JWHUa].

---

## Structured assessment and diagnosis

CPGs provide a **standardized approach to assessment**, ensuring accurate diagnosis and severity grading, which are essential for individualized care [^113vDr3J]. They recommend comprehensive evaluation of symptoms, functional impairment, comorbidities, and psychosocial factors, enabling clinicians to tailor treatment plans to the patient's specific needs [^113Ehed7].

---

## Evidence-based treatment selection

CPGs offer **evidence-based recommendations** for treatment selection based on severity, chronicity, and patient preferences [^113VEmQd]. For mild to moderate MDD, they recommend either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, with the choice guided by patient preference, prior treatment response, and comorbidities [^notfound]. For severe, chronic, or recurrent MDD, combination therapy (pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy) is recommended to optimize outcomes [^117EQLFj].

---

## Shared decision-making

CPGs emphasize **shared decision-making** as a core principle in individualized care [^1115LSQn]. Clinicians are encouraged to discuss treatment options, risks, benefits, and patient preferences, fostering collaborative decision-making that aligns with the patient's values and goals [^112PgFnJ].

---

## Measurement-based care

CPGs advocate for **measurement-based care (MBC)** using validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to monitor treatment response and guide adjustments [^115q5jT9]. MBC enables clinicians to objectively assess symptom improvement, identify non-responders, and tailor treatment plans accordingly [^113HkV48].

---

## Flexibility in treatment adjustments

CPGs provide **clear guidance on managing treatment resistance or partial response**, recommending strategies such as switching, augmenting, or combining treatments based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment [^112C92B1]. This flexibility allows clinicians to adapt treatment plans dynamically in response to patient needs and preferences [^111tjUuj].

---

## Collaborative care models

CPGs recommend **collaborative care models**, particularly in primary care settings, to enhance individualized care [^117JWHUa]. Collaborative care involves coordinated efforts among primary care providers, mental health specialists, and case managers, ensuring comprehensive, patient-centered care that addresses both clinical and psychosocial needs [^115XeFzh].

---

## Addressing patient-specific factors

CPGs recognize the importance of **patient-specific factors** such as age, gender, cultural background, and comorbidities in treatment planning [^1172H5RG]. They provide guidance on adapting treatment plans to accommodate these factors, ensuring culturally sensitive and clinically appropriate care [^114Fe3PT].

---

## Continuous monitoring and follow-up

CPGs emphasize the importance of **regular follow-up and monitoring** to assess treatment effectiveness, adherence, and patient satisfaction [^112jbrLn]. This ongoing evaluation allows clinicians to make timely adjustments to treatment plans, ensuring continued alignment with patient goals and preferences [^1121vTGs].

## Example: individualized care plan for MDD

| **Step** | **Guideline-supported action** | **Individualized consideration** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Comprehensive assessment | - Symptom severity <br/> - Functional impairment <br/> - Comorbidities <br/> - Patient preferences [^113Ehed7] |
| 2 | Shared decision-making | - Discuss treatment options <br/> - Risks <br/> - Benefits <br/> - Patient values [^1115LSQn] |
| 3 | Treatment selection | - Mild to moderate MDD: pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy <br/> - Severe/chronic/recurrent MDD: combination therapy [^113VEmQd] |
| 4 | Measurement-based care | - Regular PHQ-9 monitoring <br/> - Adjust treatment based on response [^115q5jT9] |
| 5 | Collaborative care | - Coordinate with primary care <br/> - Mental health specialists <br/> - Case managers [^117JWHUa] |
| 6 | Continuous monitoring | - Regular follow-up <br/> - Adjust treatment as needed [^112jbrLn] |

---

Clinical practice guidelines support individualized care for MDD by providing a **structured, evidence-based framework** that integrates patient-specific factors, shared decision-making, and continuous monitoring. This approach ensures that treatment plans are tailored to meet each patient's unique needs and preferences, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life [^113ZppLz].

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for major depressive disorder (MDD) — initial monotherapy selection states that MDD can be treated efficaciously with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy as monotherapy, honoring patients' preference, and that for patients with an initial episode of MDD or those who have previously responded well to monotherapy there was not sufficient evidence to recommend one specific therapeutic modality over another, with both modalities having established efficacy as monotherapy in RCTs. In selecting treatment, the provider should explain the risks and benefits of all treatments to achieve a shared decision, and patient preference should drive the decision process; offering either treatment modality is far superior to no treatment, and the confidence in the quality of evidence for specific treatment modalities was very low. The Work Group determined a Strong recommendation is warranted and decided upon a Strong for recommendation for Recommendation 6. Regardless of treatment choice, patients should be made aware of the risks and benefits of each option and the importance of full engagement in treatment to maximize benefit, and neither pharmacotherapy nor psychotherapy is as effective when delivered at less than the recommended frequency or dose.

Scope of this guideline — audience and population: This clinical practice guideline (CPG) is based on published clinical evidence available through January 31, 2021 and is intended to provide general guidance on best evidence-based practices, and it is not intended to serve as a standard of care. It is intended for use by all healthcare providers caring for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), with this version particularly tailored to primary care providers (PCPs) and mental health providers. The patient population of interest is adults (≥ 18 years) with a DSM or ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis of MDD eligible for care in the VA or DoD healthcare delivery systems, including mild, moderate, and severe MDD, chronic major depression per DSM-IV, and persistent depressive disorder/chronic major depression per DSM-5, and it also includes adults with MDD who have either partially responded or not responded to treatment for depression. The CPG does not address patients at risk for suicide or patients with post-stroke depression or bipolar disorder I/II, as recommendations for these populations are included in other VA/DoD CPGs.

Treatment of depression — research and funding needs emphasizes developing innovative ways to match patients with treatments and states that studies should examine the efficacy of a step-wise approach like switching patients from medication to types of psychotherapies (or vice versa) in cases of treatment failure, with the goal to better understand how to make the treatment more effective for all persons or to better understand for which individuals the treatment is not recommended. The page notes that, given the complexity and large resource needs of randomized clinical trials, available high-quality research is limited, that funding is highly competitive and thus available to a relatively small number of investigators, and that addressing the many questions raised will require more investment in complex and expensive research across many investigative teams, including much larger sample sizes for key questions about moderators and mediators of treatment response than are typical of current psychotherapy research studies.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^117HqvqH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

Objectives

To extend current published guidance regarding the management of major depression in clinical practice, by examining complex cases that reflect real-world patients, and to integrate evidence and experience into recommendations.

Methods

The authors who contributed to recently published clinical practice guidelines were invited to identify important gaps in extant guidance. Drawing on clinical experience and shared knowledge, they then generated four fictional case studies to illustrate the real-world complexities of managing mood disorders. The cases focussed specifically on issues that are not usually addressed in clinical practice guidelines.

Results

The four cases are discussed in detail and each case is summarised using a life chart and accompanying information. The four cases reflect important real-world challenges that clinicians face when managing mood disorders in day-to-day clinical practice. To partly standardise the presentation of each case and for ease of reference we provide a Time Line, History Box and Management Chart, along with a synopsis where relevant. Discussion and formulation of the cases illustrate how to manage the complexities of each case and provide one possible pathway to achieving functional recovery.

Conclusion

These cases draw on the combined clinical experience of the authors and illustrate how to approach diagnostic decision-making when treating major depressive disorder and having to contend with complex presentations. The cases are designed to stimulate discussion and provide a real-world context for the formulation of mood disorders.

Treatment of depression — family support and care-team communication emphasizes that families struggling with difficult psychosocial circumstances can be referred to social services agencies for needed supports, and that the clinician should address any questions or disagreements about treatment, inquire about the parents' understanding of the outcomes of the assessment, and support and encourage the youth and parents/guardians in their efforts to adhere to the treatment plan. Feedback to the patient's care team is generally permissible with basic consent for treatment, and if parents/guardians specifically consent, information from involved systems can facilitate coordination of care; feedback should be prompt, concise, jargon free, and helpful and may include the presenting problem/reason for referral, a description of the assessment process, the diagnoses given, and the treatments recommended.

### Implementing practice guidelines for depression: applying a new framework to an old problem [^116FUFb5]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

We discuss the challenges of implementing clinical practice guidelines for depression in the primary care setting. Multiple potential barriers can limit physician guideline adherence and translation of research into improved patient outcomes. Six primary barriers relate to providers (lack of awareness, lack of familiarity, lack of agreement, lack of self efficacy, lack of outcome expectancy, and inertia of previous practice). In addition, factors related to patient, guideline, and practice environment factors encompass external barriers to adherence. By delineating the underlying barriers to adherence, different interventions that are tailored to improve physician adherence to guidelines can be utilized. We review examples of these barriers, as well as interventions to improve guideline adherence. We also review characteristics of successful interventions to improve physician adherence to guidelines for depression. Since different physicians and practice settings may encounter a variety of barriers, multifaceted interventions that are not focused exclusively on the physician tend to be most effective.

VA/DoD MDD guideline — treatment setting in primary care states: For patients with MDD who are being treated in the primary care setting, we recommend the use of collaborative/integrated care models (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended). Evidence cited supports effectiveness versus usual care for clinically significant reduction in depressive symptoms, improved treatment adherence, symptom remission at six-month follow-up, and more favorable rates of recovery from symptoms at 12 month follow-up, with greater reductions in depressive symptoms in collaborative care settings when compared with usual care. Collaborative care is described as meeting four criteria: a multi-professional approach to patient care, a structured management plan, scheduled patient follow-ups, and enhanced inter-professional communication, and personnel include PCPs, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and mental health specialists with prescriptive authority such as clinical pharmacists, psychiatrists, advanced practice nurse practitioners, and physician assistants; inclusion of a psychiatrist to guide MDD treatment was shown to have greater improvement in depressive symptoms as compared to TAU. For delivery, telephone-delivered care management had comparable effects to face-to-face management on depression symptoms; collaborative care models are associated with increased patient satisfaction compared to usual care, and the benefits of collaborative care for depression outweigh the risks in primary care. This is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, and The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.

### APA releases guideline on treatment of patients with major… [^1121vTGs]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association recently updated its guideline on the treatment of major depressive disorder. The new evidence-based guideline summarizes recommendations on the use of antidepressants and other drug therapies; psychotherapy, including cognitive behavior therapy; and electroconvulsive therapy. Because many patients with major depressive disorder have co-occurring psychiatric disorders, including substance use disorders, physicians should also consider appropriate treatments for these diagnoses. Patients who have depressive symptoms in the context of another disorder but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder should be treated according to guidelines pertaining to the primary diagnosis. Selection of an initial treatment modality should be influenced by clinical features, such as severity of symptoms and presence of co-occurring disorders, as well as other factors, such as patient preferences and prior treatment experiences.

Because the effectiveness of antidepressants is generally comparable between and within drug classes, the initial selection will be based largely on anticipated adverse effects, safety and tolerability, pharmacologic properties, and cost. An incomplete response to treatment is associated with poor functional outcomes; therefore, the acute phase of treatment should not be concluded prematurely in patients who do not fully respond. If a moderate improvement in symptoms does not occur within four to eight weeks after treatment initiation, the diagnosis should be reconsidered, adverse effects and adherence to therapy assessed, comorbidities and psychosocial factors reviewed, and the treatment plan adjusted. For patients who are being treated with psychotherapy, the frequency of sessions and the specific approach to psychotherapy should be reassessed.

If minimal or no improvement is noted after an additional four to eight weeks, the treatment plan should be readjusted, and consultation should be considered. Continuation Phase In the continuation phase, management is aimed at preventing relapse. Systematic assessment of symptoms and monitoring for adverse effects of medications, adherence to therapy, and functional status are essential. To reduce the risk of relapse, patients in whom pharmacotherapy has been successful should continue treatment at the same dosage for four to nine months. Depression-focused cognitive behavior therapy is also recommended in the continuation phase. The antidepressant that produced symptom remission during the acute phase should be continued at the full therapeutic dosage. If depression-focused psychotherapy was used during the acute and continuation phases, maintenance therapy should be considered, with less frequent sessions.

Maintenance ECT can be considered in patients with depressive episodes that have not responded to medications or depression-focused psychotherapy, but that have responded to ECT.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^111mU2Wo]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

How the APA clinical practice guideline compares to other clinical practice guidelines for treatment of depression — this section notes that various other organizations' guidelines are now considered to be outdated and highlights guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kaiser Permanente Care Management Institute, the Veteran's Affairs/Department of Defense, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The American Psychiatric Association's last guideline on depression focused on major depressive disorder in adults and is now listed as outdated; its main recommendations include overall psychiatric management. For patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder, antidepressant medication or psychotherapy were recommended as initial treatments; for moderate to severe major depressive disorder, a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy was recommended; and for severe major depressive disorder that was not responding to medication or psychotherapy or with associated catatonic or psychotic features, electroconvulsive therapy was recommended. The recommendations also included monitoring during the continuation phase of treatment, a maintenance phase of treatment, tapering of medication during the discontinuation phase, and consideration of psychiatric factors, psychosocial and demographic factors, and other co-occurring medical conditions. Like the American Psychiatric Association's guideline, the present American Psychological Association's guideline also includes recommendations for psychotherapy and for antidepressant medication; however, it more commonly recommends combinations of psychotherapy and antidepressant medication versus antidepressant medication alone and does not detail recommendations for the various stages of treatment.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^116dgvE9]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To enhance the quality of care and clinical outcomes for children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD). The aims are as follows: (1) to summarize empirically based guidance about the psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatment of MDD and PDD in children and adolescents; and (2) to summarize expert-based guidance about the assessment of these disorders as an integral part of treatment, and the implementation of empirically based treatments for these disorders in clinical practice.

Method

Statements about the treatment of MDD and PDD are based upon empirical evidence derived from a critical systematic review of the scientific literature conducted by the Research Triangle Institute International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (RTI-UNC) Evidence-based Practice Center under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Evidence from meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/RTI-UNC review is also presented to support or refute the AHRQ findings. Guidance about the assessment and clinical implementation of treatments for MDD and PDD is informed by expert opinion and consensus as presented in previously published clinical practice guidelines, chapters in leading textbooks of child and adolescent psychiatry, the DSM-5-TR, and government-affiliated prescription drug information websites.

Results

Psychotherapy (specifically, cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have some rigorous (randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses) empirical support as treatment options. Because effective treatment outcomes are predicated in part upon accuracy of the diagnosis, depth of the clinical formulation, and breadth of the treatment plan, comprehensive, evidence-based assessment may enhance evidence-based treatment outcomes.

Conclusion

Disproportionate to the magnitude of the problem, there are significant limitations in the quality and quantity of rigorous empirical support for the etiology, assessment, and treatment of depression in children and adolescents. In the context of a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent-trained behavioral health specialists, the demonstration of convenient, efficient, cost-effective, and user-friendly delivery mechanisms for safe and effective treatment of MDD and PDD is a key research need. Other research priorities include the sequencing and comparative effectiveness of depression treatments, delineation of treatment mediators and moderators, effective approaches to treatment nonresponders and disorder relapse/recurrence, long-term effects and degree of suicide risk with SSRI use, and the discovery of novel pharmacologic or interventional treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^111kT12S]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Clinical formulation — children and adolescents with depressive disorders: The development of a clinical formulation includes consideration of contextual and historical factors, child and family strengths, environmental supports, and gender/sexual/cultural/spiritual issues, resulting in an understanding of the biological, psychological, and social factors associated with the symptom presentation. The biopsychosocial formulation can be organized into predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective (ameliorating) factors (4 P's), with predisposing factors as areas of vulnerability increasing risk for psychopathology, precipitating factors as stressors or contextual events with a chronologic association with symptom onset, perpetuating factors as patient, family, or community aspects that prolong the problem, and protective factors as strengths of the patient and family/community.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. I. classification, burden and principles of management [^114PB4bf]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most burdensome illnesses in Canada. The purpose of this introductory section of the 2009 revised CANMAT guidelines is to provide definitions of the depressive disorders (with an emphasis on MDD), summarize Canadian data concerning their epidemiology and describe overarching principles of managing these conditions. This section on "Classification, Burden and Principles of Management" is one of 5 guideline articles in the 2009 CANMAT guidelines.

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to the Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support.

Results

Epidemiologic data indicate that MDD afflicts 11% of Canadians at some time in their lives, and approximately 4% during any given year. MDD has a detrimental impact on overall health, role functioning and quality of life. Detection of MDD, accurate diagnosis and provision of evidence-based treatment are challenging tasks for both clinicians and for the health systems in which they work.

Limitations

Epidemiologic and clinical data cannot be seamlessly linked due to heterogeneity of syndromes within the population.

Conclusions

In the eight years since the last CANMAT Guidelines for Treatment of Depressive Disorders were published, progress has been made in understanding the epidemiology and treatment of these disorders. Evidence supporting specific therapeutic interventions is summarized and evaluated in subsequent sections.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116M3Cfi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — initial treatment for mild major depressive disorder (MDD) states that ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild MDD (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence), and the informed decision on options of CBT, second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), or combination therapy should be personalized based on benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, symptoms, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and patient preferences; for mild MDD, the CPG extrapolated from evidence largely in moderate to severe MDD and downgraded certainty to low and strength to conditional due to lack of direct evidence, hence CBT can be considered as initial treatment, and the CPG suggests that use of SGAs as initial treatment should be based on additional considerations such as limited access to or cost of CBT, history of moderate or severe MDD, or patient preferences.

Management after inadequate response — patients with MDD who have received an adequate trial (six to 12 weeks) of initial maximized pharmacotherapy but have achieved partial (< 50% improvement in symptoms) or no response should be reassessed and, once diagnosis and treatment adherence are confirmed, treatment should be adjusted to achieve remission; maximized pharmacotherapy is defined as an antidepressant dose advanced to either the FDA maximum recommended dose and/or maximum dose tolerated by the patient for a minimum of four to six weeks, and in STAR*D patients commonly required eight weeks or more to achieve response or remission; an SR by Braun et al. (2020) found no clinically relevant dose-effects gradients for SSRIs and that dropout rates increased with dose, primarily due to side effects, suggesting that maximizing the dose of an SSRI may not be clinically useful; further, STAR*D demonstrated that at least one-third of patients did not achieve remission after four consecutive, highly optimized treatment steps.

Adult depression — American Psychiatric Association guideline states that certain treatment approaches might be considered as applied first (psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy for adults) and then suggests other options (complementary and alternative treatments for adults) if first options are not available or acceptable. Both APA and Kaiser guidelines recommend consideration of patient culture, values and preferences, and medication side effects. The APA guideline was frequently unable to recommend a specific antidepressant medication over another due to insufficient evidence, though it recommended a combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy versus antidepressant medication alone in some cases.

### Individualizing therapy for adults with major depressive… [^111hxKtD]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on February 20, 2023 Managing patients with depressive disorders constitutes a significant portion of the typical family physician's practice. A serial cross-sectional study in. Health Affairs estimated that the percentage of U. S. adult primary care visits that addressed mental health concerns rose from 10. 7% in 2006 to
15. 9% by 2018. Previous AFP Community Blog posts have discussed the primary care evidence base for psychologic and pharmacologic treatments and screening and treatment guidelines from the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Physicians. In the February issue, Dr. Heather Kovich and colleagues provided an update on pharmacologic treatment and tapering strategies to minimize the risk of discontinuation syndrome. When initiating medication, the authors recommend using shared decision-making, considering factors such as "prior treatment and response, comorbidities, costs, and risk of adverse effects".

An accompanying editorial by Drs. Andrew Buelt and John McQuaid compared the three major U. S. clinical guidelines for major depressive disorder from the ACP, the American Psychological Association, and the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense. All of the guidelines recommend initial treatment with evidence-based psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Pharmacogenetic tests such as GeneSight Psychotropic " not been shown to improve patient-oriented outcomes and not recommended to assist in drug choice. " Most patients will not experience additional benefit from combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy; however, the VA/DoD suggests that this combination is appropriate for patients with severe, persistent, or recurrent depression.

A Canadian group recently developed a visual evidence-informed decision support tool based on a literature review and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments depression treatment guidelines. The tool comprises two Figures that guide primary care clinicians in antidepressant selection based on specifiers, comorbid conditions, adverse effects, drug interactions, and administration.

### A review of the current guidelines for depression treatment [^112PXfBN]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

A variety of American and European guidelines are available for clinicians treating major depressive disorder and depressive subtypes. Major Western guidelines published since 2000 make similar recommendations for all stages of treatment for depression, including a reliance on measurement-based care. First-line treatment is usually a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, psychotherapy, or a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Next-step treatment recommendations are switching or augmentation, depending on patient response to the initial treatment. Maintenance therapy continues the approach that led to remission. The American Psychiatric Association will release a new treatment guideline to offer information on developments made since the last guidelines were published in 2000. Despite progress made during the last decade, no major breakthroughs in the treatment of depression have occurred, and genetic testing developments allowing for personalized care remain the goal of research.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^116KaRfk]. The American Psychologist (2022). Medium credibility.

The American Psychological Association (APA) developed this clinical practice guideline to provide recommendations for the treatment of depressive disorders, including major depression, subsyndromal depression, and persistent depressive disorder. It addresses three developmental cohorts: adolescents, general adults, and older adults (ages 60 and over). Ten systematic reviews and meta-analyses, along with other literature and observations from practitioners and patients, served as the basis for the guideline. The guideline development panel consisted of health professionals from psychology, psychiatry, and family medicine as well as community members who self-identified as having had depression. The panel examined the efficacy of psychological treatments and of complementary and alternative medicine treatments. It also examined comparative effectiveness among psychological treatments, by themselves and in combination with pharmacotherapy, and comparative effectiveness of psychological treatments in relation to pharmacotherapy and to complementary and alternative treatments. The panel made recommendations for treatment of depression in adolescents, adults, and older adults but did not make treatment recommendations specific to children. These recommendations, presented in detail in the guideline, are summarized here. The target audience for the guideline includes clinicians, researchers, patients, family members, and policymakers.

### Improving patient outcomes in depression through guideline-concordant, measurement-based care [^115XeFzh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Because patients often seek treatment for depression in primary care, primary care physicians need the tools and knowledge to properly assess and manage major depressive disorder. Effective management includes using guideline-based treatment, measurement-based assessment, collaboration, and comorbid disease treatment. Treatment guidelines enable clinicians to create an effective, evidence-based management plan, and measurement tools allow for objective assessment and tracking of patients' symptoms and side effects over the course of treatment. Collaboration among primary care clinicians, case managers, and mental health specialists can improve adherence and outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder, including those with comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions. These approaches to patient care provide individualized treatment to help patients with depression.

(Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Evidence suggests employing MBC in the treatment of patients with major depression enhances outcomes, and MBC features three key elements: collect (use reliable, validated, and clinically appropriate measures), share (results are shared and discussed with the patient and other providers involved in the patient's care), and act (results are used by the patient and provider to make clinically appropriate adjustments in care). As of January 2018, the Joint Commission requires MBC use in all mental health treatment programs accredited under behavioral health standards. The evidence reviewed, including a systematic review, found the overall evidence for MBC was weak, the quality of evidence was rated as poor with none of the studies including all three key elements, there was insufficient evidence to recommend any particular measure though the DoD and VA promote the use of the PHQ-9, and no specific frequency of monitoring can be recommended as superior.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^113VHi18]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP clinical practice guideline for children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD) aims to enhance quality of care by summarizing empirically based guidance on psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatment and expert-based guidance on assessment and implementation in clinical practice. Meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/RTI-UNC review are included, and guidance on assessment and implementation is informed by expert opinion and consensus sources including the DSM-5-TR. Psychotherapy (specifically, cognitive–behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have some rigorous empirical support as treatment options, and comprehensive, evidence-based assessment may enhance evidence-based treatment outcomes. The guideline notes significant limitations in rigorous empirical support and a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent–trained behavioral health specialists, and highlights research priorities including delivery mechanisms, comparative effectiveness and sequencing of treatments, mediators and moderators, approaches for nonresponders and disorder relapse/ recurrence, long-term effects and degree of suicide risk with SSRI use, and discovery of novel pharmacologic or interventional treatments. Epidemiology cited includes that nearly 30% of youth worldwide are reported to have a depressive disorder and that estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of MDD among U.S. adolescents was reported to be 11% and 7.5%.

### The effectiveness of enhanced evidence-based care for depressive disorders: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113HkV48]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence-based care is the use of the best available evidence together with clinical judgement, as well as patient preferences, to make healthcare decisions. Over the past 50 years, several psychotherapies and pharmacological interventions have demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of depressive disorders. Yet remission rates remain low, with only about one-in-three individuals achieving remission in acute treatment trials. In fact, Pence and colleagues estimate that only about 6% of individuals with depression in primary care achieve remission. Clearly, efforts are needed to improve outcomes for depression treatment.

Several care models have been developed to improve treatment for depression, all of which provide "enhanced" evidence-based care (EEC). The essential component of all of these approaches is Measurement-Based Care (MBC). MBC in psychiatry is defined as the use of validated clinical measurement instruments to objectify the assessment, treatment, and clinical outcomes, including efficacy, safety, tolerability, functioning, and quality of life, in patients with psychiatric disorders. The concept of MBC was derived from the stepwise treatment algorithm by Trivedi et al.

Rigorous assessment and treatment algorithms of MBC are regarded as key instruments to optimize treatment delivery and outcomes for MDD. These explicit treatment protocols aim at a predefined treatment goal (e.g. remission or response). Treatment algorithms provide strategies (which treatments to use), tactics (how to implement the treatments), treatment steps (in what order to implement the different treatments), standardized evaluation instruments, critical decision points and standardized medical decisions based on preset "if-then-rules". Simply put, MBC is "the routine measurement of symptoms and side effects at each treatment visit and the use of a treatment manual describing when and how to modify medication doses based on these measures". MBC uses patient-reported rating scales in conjunction with evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to provide an objective assessment of patient progress over time to guide a more effective plan of care.

### Comparing clinical guidelines for the management of major… [^116NCrkE]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines from the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, updated in 2022; American Psychological Association, published in 2019; and American College of Physicians, published in 2016, are widely used for the management of major depressive disorder. 3–5 All of these guidelines recommend treatment with pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy. Treatment recommendations are similar among guidelines, with only select differences in patient populations, specific treatments, and strength of recommendations. This editorial highlights the similarities and differences that are most relevant to family physicians and other clinicians treating patients with major depressive disorder. Patient Population The APA guidelines provide recommendations for three age cohorts: children and adolescents, adults, and older adults.

The ACP and VA/DoD guidelines do not address children and adolescents, focusing mainly on adults; the VA/DoD guidelines provide some specific recommendations for older adults. The ACP and APA guidelines focus on the effectiveness of psychotherapy and the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy, whereas the VA/DoD guidelines additionally examine a broader range of interventions and settings. Initial Treatment Recommendations All three guidelines recommend initial treatment with evidence-based psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Notably, the VA/DoD guidelines provide the strongest level of recommendation for the use of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy but a weaker level of recommendation for specific treatment options. This reflects changes in the literature — recent, larger pharmacotherapy trials demonstrate smaller effect sizes than older, smaller trials.

Combining Therapies There is a lack of evidence showing a significant benefit from combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in most patients with major depressive disorder. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend combining psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy only in patients with depression that is severe, persistent, or recurrent. If psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are combined, the APA recommends cognitive behavior therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy plus a second-generation antidepressant. Summary For major depressive order, it is reassuring that different guideline processes arrived at generally similar conclusions. However, it is important for physicians to understand the guidelines' differences to effectively apply these tools to patient care. Editor's Note: Dr. Buelt served as a member of the work group that developed the VA/DoD guidelines. Dr.

McQuaid served as a cochampion for the VA/DoD revision and chair of the panel that developed the APA guidelines.

Highlighted features — methodology and structural updates: The 2022 VA/DoD MDD CPG used a more rigorous application of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology than previous iterations for rating evidence, resulting in the exclusion or downgrading of data used in previous versions and impacting the strength of some recommendations (e.g. Strong for downgraded to Weak for) despite a similar evidence base; in addition, this CPG includes consumer input whereas prior versions did not. Compared with the 2016 VA/DoD MDD CPG, which divided treatment between "treatment of uncomplicated mild to moderate MDD" and "treatment of severe, chronic, or recurrent MDD (complex)", this CPG refers to "treatment of uncomplicated MDD" and "treatment of MDD that is severe or has partial or limited response to initial treatment" to better align with the research literature and clinical practice; the latter section now includes recommendations previously listed across several sections to improve clarity, and the algorithm has been designed to better reflect this structure as well.

Major depressive disorder — diagnosis, severity, and comorbidity are described as follows: Major depressive disorder is defined as the presence of a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities that occurs along with at least 4 additional diagnostic criteria or symptoms for at least 2 weeks and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Based on severity of symptoms, functional impairment, and level of patient distress, MDD can be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. One third of patients with MDD have severe MDD, which is associated with more difficulty in achieving treatment response and remission. In addition, about 75% of people with MDD also have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, which can make their symptoms worse and recovery more difficult.

American Psychiatric Association (APA) guideline — adult major depressive disorder (MDD) treatment sequencing is as follows: For mild to moderate MDD, first line pharmacotherapy treatments include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (except fluvoxamine), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, mirtazapine, and bupropion; if a patient has not demonstrated sufficient response after 4 to 6 weeks of trying a pharmacotherapy, the patient should switch to another medication or to psychotherapy or augment with another medication or psychotherapy. Patient preference should be used to determine psychotherapy format (individual or group), and computer-based cognitive-behavioral therapy can be offered as a first-line treatment or as an augmentation to treatment for mild to moderate MDD; for those who decline or are unable to access first line recommended psychotherapies or pharmacotherapies, the guideline suggests offering short term psychodynamic psychotherapy or nondirective supportive psychotherapy. In treating severe or chronic or recurrent complex MDD the guideline recommends a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.

Older adult depression — prevalence and course is marked by high inpatient rates, frequent relapse, and treatment resistance. Prevalence is reported as higher still (10%-42%) among older patients in inpatient settings, including long-term care. Subthreshold depression is 2–3 times more common than major depression in older adults, and 8%-10% of those with subthreshold symptoms develop major depression each year. The clinical presentation in older adults differs from earlier life by following a relapsing and recurrent course, and depression is often treatment resistant, with partial response linked to continuing disability, caregiver burden, and elevated risk for early relapse and recurrence.

### The 2020 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders: major depression summary [^115CmDsw]. Bipolar Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To provide a succinct, clinically useful summary of the management of major depression, based on the 2020 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders (MDcpg 2020).

Methods

To develop the MDcpg 2020, the mood disorders committee conducted an extensive review of the available literature to develop evidence-based recommendations (EBR) based on National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines. In the MDcpg 2020, these recommendations sit alongside consensus-based recommendations (CBR) that were derived from extensive deliberations of the mood disorders committee, drawing on their expertise and clinical experience. This guideline summary is an abridged version that focuses on major depression. In collaboration with international experts in the field, it synthesises the key recommendations made in relation to the diagnosis and management of major depression.

Results

The depression summary provides a systematic approach to diagnosis, and a logical clinical framework for management. The latter begins with Actions, which include important strategies that should be implemented from the outset. These include lifestyle changes, psychoeducation and psychological interventions. The summary advocates the use of antidepressants in the management of depression as Choices and nominates seven medications that can be trialled as clinically indicated before moving to Alternatives for managing depression. Subsequent strategies regarding Medication include Increasing Dose, Augmenting and Switching (MIDAS). The summary also recommends the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and discusses how to approach non-response.

Conclusions

The major depression summary provides up to date guidance regarding the management of major depressive disorder, as set out in the MDcpg 2020. The recommendations are informed by research evidence in conjunction with clinical expertise and experience. The summary is intended for use by psychiatrists, psychologists and primary care physicians, but will be of interest to all clinicians and carers involved in the management of patients with depressive disorders.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^113buvLF]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA guideline — strengths and limitations of systematic reviews and meta-analyses — states that reviews conducted by evidence-based practice centers were "conducted in accordance with the IOM's (2011b) systematic review standards by designated Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence-based practice centers" and that "both reviews are transparent in including background data as well as strength of evidence and risk of bias information". Limitations included that "there were some areas not covered… and the focus of both was only on major depressive disorder". For other included reviews, an AMSTAR assessment found they "included a comprehensive literature search; provided characteristics of the included studies; an assessment of quality was conducted, documented, and used in conclusions; and finally, the methods used to combine findings were appropriate", with additional strengths that "five of the six did not base inclusion on publication status and also assessed for likelihood of publication bias", but "a limitation of all but one of these reviews is that they did not provide a list of studies that were included and excluded". The panel emphasizes interpretation in context, noting "Results should therefore be read as best evidence according to method used and viewed as a guideline not a prescription for treatment funding and decision-making".

### Florida best practice psychotherapeutic medication guidelines for adults with major depressive disorder [^114yMZAC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Herein we provide the 2015 update for the Florida Best Practice Psychotherapeutic Medication Guidelines (FPG) for major depressive disorder (MDD). The FPG represent evidence-based decision support for practitioners providing care to adults with MDD.

Participants

The consensus meeting included representatives from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (FAHCA), advocacy members, academic experts in MDD, and multidisciplinary mental health clinicians, as well as health policy experts. The FAHCA provided funding support for the FPG.

Evidence

Evidence was limited to results from adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; in addition, pooled-, meta-, and network-analyses were included. Recommendations were based on consensus arrived at by the multistakeholder Florida Expert Panel. Articles selected were identified on the electronic search engine PubMed with the dates 2010 to present. The search terms were major depressive disorder, psychopharmacology, antidepressants, psychotherapy, neuromodulation, complementary alternative medicines, pooled-analysis, meta-analysis, and network-analysis. Bibliographies of the identified articles were manually searched for additional citations not identified in the original search.

Consensus Process

A consensus meeting comprising all representatives took place on September 25–26, 2015, in Tampa, Florida. Guiding principles (eg, emphasis on the most rigorous evidence for efficacy, safety, and tolerability) were discussed, defined, and operationalized prior to review of extant data. As MDD often pursues a recurrent and chronic course, principles of practice, measurement-based care, and comprehensive assessment and management of overall physical and mental health were emphasized. Evidence supporting pretreatment major depressive episode specifiers (eg, mixed features, anxious distress) and the role of pharmacogenomics (and other biological-behavioral markers) in informing treatment selection were comprehensively discussed. Algorithmic priority was assigned to agents with relatively greater therapeutic index (ie, efficacy) and minimal propensity for safety and tolerability disadvantages.

Conclusions

The updated 2015 FPG provide concise, pragmatic, evidence-based decision support for treatment selection and sequencing for adults with MDD. Principles of practice include measurement-based care, priority to both psychiatric and medical comorbidity, identification of DSM-5-defined specifiers (eg, mixed features), suicide risk assessment, and evaluation of cognitive symptoms. The FPG have purposefully aimed to minimize emphasis on "expert opinion" and instead differentially emphasized extant evidence for pharmacologic treatments.

### Challenges and algorithm-guided treatment in major depressive disorder [^113N598u]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder is complicated and difficult to treat, primarily because of its chronic and recurrent nature and the poor efficacy of most pharmacologic treatment options. Until more effective treatments become available, clinicians must focus on optimizing patient outcomes through patient care. Implementing measurement-based care and using treatment algorithms can reduce symptoms of depression and help patients achieve and maintain remission.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115bVF2g]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Depression treatment — generalizability to settings and providers (provider perspective and collaborative care) — states that treatment providers (including administrators) should consider setting-specific factors that can limit transferability of efficacy and outlines a collaborative care option for atypical contexts. The guideline notes that treatment providers (including administrators) should consider similar issues and that the efficacy of a given approach as found in a research study may only reflect its efficacy based on the specific treatment circumstances, which might include outpatient versus inpatient delivery or additional resources unavailable in routine care, and that such circumstances may limit the transferability of treatment efficacy to real-world contexts. When implementing treatments in settings atypical from standard structures, an option for individualizing the treatment might include an emphasis on a collaborative model wherein patients become more active participants; certain general medical settings have adopted a collaborative care model whereby patients are provided an initial choice of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy and, depending on one's progress, predetermined algorithms help determine further treatment choices; such protocols require involvement of various health care specialists and additional resources beyond typical outpatient services; and administrators and therapists need to consider the relevance of the literature, options for addressing gaps, and the applicability of the collaborative care model to their specific setting or context.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in Japan [^111j4s3w]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Japanese treatment guidelines, consensus guidelines, and treatment algorithms for managing patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have been developed and/or updated in the past decade. The treatment guidelines, which are evidence-based, are the most detailed of the 3 types of guidance; they describe how to establish a treatment plan, treatment methods, and special problems such as intractable depression and suicide. The Japanese consensus guidelines were compiled from the results of a survey about treatment choices in MDD that was sent to members of the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were the most common first-line treatments, followed by tricyclic antidepressants and tetracyclic antidepressants. The consensus guidelines are not evidence-based but are practical and easy to use. The Japanese treatment algorithm for MDD is a flowchart created in conjunction with the International Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project. The flowchart shows steps in treatment both for patients who respond to initial treatment and for those who need several trials of treatment. These 3 forms of guidance for managing patients with MDD in Japan are reviewed.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^117QBGdg]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Treatment planning and informed consent — children and adolescents with depressive disorders: Treatment planning derives from the diagnoses and clinical formulation, and high-quality treatment plans are safe, timely, effective, efficient, feasible, equitable, and child and family centered. A range of potentially effective treatments and other interventions should be explained in accordance with the cognitive and linguistic level of the parents/guardians and patient, prioritized according to the acuity, severity, distress, and impairment associated with each diagnosed disorder, and the clinician should provide sufficient information to enable the patient and parent/guardian to make an informed decision about treatment options. Level of care decisions are informed by diagnosis, the current severity of symptoms, comorbid medical or psychiatric disorders, the child's risk to self or others, prior illness course and complications, potential supports, and the treatment alliance. Many stakeholders agree on at least 4 basic elements of the informed consent process — capacity of the decision maker, disclosure by the clinician, confirmation of understanding, and free authorization of the plan — and these 4 elements translate into 5 components for discussion (the diagnosis; an explanation of the proposed treatment; the attendant risks and benefits of the proposed treatment; alternative treatments and their risks and benefits; and the risks and benefits of declining treatment). Strategies to improve comprehension can include providing written educational materials, multimedia presentations, decision-making worksheets, standardized consent forms, asking for a "repeat back", and engaging in extended back-and-forth discussions until understanding is achieved, with documentation providing evidence that the patient and parent/guardian were adequately prepared to provide assent and consent for treatment.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11186Vq3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — key questions on comparative effectiveness and harms in major depressive disorder (MDD) specify: for adults attempting initial treatment, the effectiveness of SGA monotherapy compared with nonpharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy (Key Question 1a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (1b); for adults who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with 1 SGA, the comparative effectiveness of second-line therapies (2a) and whether comparative effectiveness varies by MDD severity (2b); the comparative risks for harms for those attempting initial treatment or those who did not achieve remission after an initial adequate trial with an SGA (3a) and whether comparative risks vary by MDD severity (3b); and whether benefits and risks differ by subgroups defined by psychiatric symptoms or demographics (4). The Clinical Guidelines Committee was particularly interested in comparative effectiveness of treatment according to MDD severity because screening is becoming more widespread and may increase diagnosis of milder MDD.
