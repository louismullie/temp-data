## Question

urge incontinence in 18 year old male that started 2 years ago, subsided in symptoms and is now getting worse again over the last month

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing an 18-year-old male with recurrent urge urinary incontinence over two years, including how to approach the differential diagnosis, workup, and treatment planning. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical problem and how to frame it diagnostically. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation elements that are mandatory before labeling this as idiopathic OAB. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for a young man, including structural, functional, and neurologic causes. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic workup with appropriate testing and when to escalate to urodynamics. Finally, I will map evidence-based treatment options, including behavioral, pharmacologic, and advanced therapies, and close with follow-up and special considerations for this age group.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem framing. Urge urinary incontinence in a young man is uncommon and warrants a careful search for secondary causes before concluding idiopathic OAB, even though OAB prevalence in men can reach roughly 7–27% in population data and UUI is less common than in women, so I should not jump to conclusions here [^notfound]. I need to ensure the symptom complex truly reflects urgency with leakage, quantify frequency and nocturia, and screen for red flags such as hematuria, recurrent UTIs, neurologic symptoms, or incomplete emptying that would push me toward targeted testing rather than empiric therapy [^114Pa1ti].

> Next, I should review the mandatory initial evaluation. Wait, let me verify the basics: a detailed history of bladder symptoms, fluid and caffeine intake, medication review, prior trauma or surgeries, and bowel habits; a focused physical exam including abdominal and neurologic screening; and urinalysis to exclude infection and hematuria are foundational and guideline-required before any diagnosis of OAB is made [^114AhvsC] [^1146cr2H]. I should also confirm that a bladder diary for 3 days is obtained to quantify voids, urgency, and incontinence episodes, because this both supports diagnosis and establishes a baseline for treatment response [^115Q8uMZ].

> Now, I will construct the differential diagnosis, but hold on, I should prioritize by likelihood and severity in an 18-year-old. Idiopathic OAB remains possible, though less common at this age, and I must not anchor on it prematurely [^11544zjP]. Congenital or acquired urethral stricture disease can present with storage symptoms including urgency and urge incontinence and is a key consideration in young men; importantly, urethroplasty can improve urgency/UUI in a substantial proportion, which underscores a structural contributor in some cases [^117QHsUC]. Primary bladder neck obstruction or dysfunctional voiding can mimic or cause OAB-like symptoms in adolescents and young adults and should be on the list, especially with straining or weak stream features [^116BJKx8]. I should also consider neurogenic etiologies such as occult spina bifida or tethered cord, albeit less likely without neurologic signs, and keep inflammatory mimics like interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome in mind if pain is prominent [^notfound].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup sequence. Let me first confirm noninvasive steps: bladder diary, uroflowmetry with post-void residual, and renal ultrasound if hematuria or recurrent infections are present; these help detect obstruction, incomplete emptying, or anatomic abnormalities without immediate invasive testing [^11137BcH] [^114v9Lok]. If uroflow is abnormal or PVR is elevated, I should consider pressure-flow urodynamics to distinguish obstruction from detrusor overactivity, recognizing that a normal urodynamic study does not exclude OAB and that provocative maneuvers may be needed in selected cases [^1114RySj] [^1113A1ih]. But wait, what if symptoms are refractory or the diagnosis remains uncertain after initial therapy? In that scenario, multichannel urodynamics or videourodynamics can be justified to clarify etiology before advanced treatments, aligning with EAU guidance to obtain urodynamics when contemplating invasive therapy [^1178VX1u] [^112UDmjZ].

> Let me think about treatment once secondary causes are reasonably excluded and the patient remains bothered. I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized, as no treatment is an acceptable choice after appropriate counseling, and that behavioral therapies are foundational due to favorable risk–benefit profiles [^114wGGKw]. Bladder training, pelvic floor muscle therapy with urge suppression, fluid and caffeine management, and timed voiding are first-line and can be initiated now; evidence, albeit largely in women, suggests bladder training may reduce incontinence episodes and can be comparable or even superior to anticholinergics in some contexts, with fewer adverse effects, which is relevant when counseling a young man concerned about side effects [^112o5L7b] [^113SiSEo] [^1155KnAV].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic options if behavioral therapy is insufficient. Antimuscarinics or a beta-3 agonist are appropriate second-line choices, and I need to counsel on side effects, including dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive concerns with anticholinergics, and to monitor for efficacy and tolerability at 4–12 weeks; if one agent fails, switching class or combining classes can be reasonable in shared decision-making [^116Jkkfk] [^117TY3iy]. Hold on, I should verify comparative efficacy in men; pooled analyses suggest similar efficacy across sexes, supporting the use of these agents in appropriately selected male patients after excluding obstruction or other secondary causes [^117Bwfap].

> If oral therapy fails or is not tolerated, I need to consider advanced options, but I should double-check candidacy and counseling. OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 units intradetrusor is guideline-supported for refractory OAB/UUI, with robust symptom improvements but a meaningful risk of urinary retention and need for intermittent catheterization; this risk–benefit discussion is essential in a young, active patient [^11728dmL]. Sacral neuromodulation and tibial neuromodulation are additional pathways; while men are underrepresented in trials, symptomatic response during test phases appears similar, though men proceed to implantation less often, and implantable tibial systems show promising reductions in UUI with generally minor adverse effects, which may appeal to patients preferring office-based procedures [^116x7my6] [^114zgdpC]. I should confirm that augmentation cystoplasty is reserved for severe, refractory cases with patient acceptance of lifelong catheterization, which is rarely indicated at this age but belongs in the spectrum of options [^117MCMyr].

> I should confirm follow-up cadence and expectations. Reassessment at 4–12 weeks after initiating therapy is reasonable to gauge response and adherence, and I must remind the patient that progress is often gradual and nonlinear, with good and bad days. Setting realistic goals and allowing therapy adjustments improves satisfaction and persistence [^112NbXwU] [^116HRq8C]. If multiple optimized trials fail, I need to reconsider the diagnosis, repeat urodynamics if indicated, and reassess for missed obstruction, neurogenic features, or inflammatory disease before escalating further [^112UDmjZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure age-specific counseling is addressed. Young men with UUI face unique psychosocial burdens, including anxiety, sleep disruption, and sexual dysfunction, and may underuse care; proactively discussing these issues and aligning treatments with lifestyle and goals can improve engagement and outcomes [^115R5v9a]. Let me reconsider the possibility of structural disease one more time; given the relatively early onset and male sex, I should maintain a low threshold to image the upper and lower urinary tracts and, if symptoms persist or worsen despite therapy, to pursue pressure-flow studies to exclude subtle obstruction or primary bladder neck dysfunction before committing to long-term pharmacologic or procedural management [^117QHsUC] [^116BJKx8].

Urge incontinence in an 18-year-old male with a 2-year history and recent worsening most likely reflects **idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB)** [^11544zjP] or a **functional bladder disorder** [^112xwVrk], but secondary causes must be excluded. The evaluation should include a **focused history, physical exam, urinalysis, and bladder diary** [^114AhvsC]; urodynamics are reserved for refractory or complex cases [^112UDmjZ]. First-line management is **behavioral therapy** (bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, fluid management) [^112o5L7b] [^1155KnAV]; if inadequate, offer antimuscarinics or a beta-3 agonist [^112qdqSw] [^116Jkkfk]. Refer to urology if symptoms persist or red flags appear (hematuria, recurrent UTIs, neurologic signs, or suspected obstruction) [^114Pa1ti].

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial evaluation

- **History**: Onset, duration, severity, fluid intake, caffeine/alcohol, medications, bowel habits, sexual history, family history, neurologic symptoms [^114Pa1ti].
- **Physical exam**: Abdomen, genitalia, digital rectal exam, focused neurologic exam [^116c7og5].
- **Urinalysis**: Exclude infection, hematuria, glycosuria [^114AhvsC].
- **Bladder diary**: 3-day record of fluid intake, voids, urgency, incontinence episodes [^116c7og5].

---

### Further evaluation (if initial evaluation is inconclusive or symptoms persist)

- **Uroflowmetry with post-void residual**: Assess flow rate and retention [^11137BcH].
- **Renal/bladder ultrasound**: Evaluate for structural abnormalities, stones, residual urine [^116c7og5].
- **Urodynamic studies**: Consider if refractory, complex, or prior bladder surgery [^112UDmjZ] [^113xbNGS].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management (first-line)

Conservative management includes **bladder training** with scheduled voiding and delayed urgency to enlarge bladder capacity [^112o5L7b], **pelvic floor muscle training** with biofeedback to suppress urgency and improve control [^115R5v9a], and **lifestyle modifications** such as fluid management, caffeine reduction, weight management, and constipation treatment [^1155KnAV].

---

### Pharmacological management (second-line)

Pharmacological options include **antimuscarinic agents** (oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin) to reduce urgency and incontinence [^112qdqSw] [^116Jkkfk], or **beta-3 agonists** (mirabegron, vibegron) for similar benefit with a different side-effect profile [^112qdqSw] [^116Jkkfk]. If one agent is ineffective or poorly tolerated, switching class or combining classes is reasonable [^117TY3iy].

---

### Advanced therapies (refractory cases)

Advanced options include **intravesical botulinum toxin** (onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U) for refractory OAB [^11728dmL], **sacral neuromodulation** for refractory cases [^112hMRD4], and **augmentation cystoplasty** for severe refractory cases willing to self-catheterize [^117MCMyr].

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with behavioral therapy and medications; many patients improve significantly, though some have chronic symptoms requiring ongoing management [^116HRq8C]. Follow-up should include regular visits to assess response, adherence, and side effects, with therapy adjustments as needed [^112NbXwU].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

- **Persistent symptoms**: Despite conservative and pharmacologic therapy [^111kP9hJ].
- **Red flags**: Hematuria, recurrent UTIs, neurologic symptoms, suspected obstruction [^114Pa1ti].
- **Complex cases**: Consideration of advanced therapies or invasive procedures [^116yx1iP].

---

Urge incontinence in an 18-year-old male is most often functional (OAB or dysfunctional voiding) [^notfound], but secondary causes must be excluded. Start with **behavioral therapy** [^112o5L7b]; add medications if needed [^112qdqSw], and refer to urology for persistent or complex cases [^111kP9hJ].

### Seminal papers in urology: anticholinergic therapy vs. onabotulinumtoxina for urgency urinary incontinence [^112DF6xJ]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Following cessation of treatment, those in the Botox arm had a trend towards greater long-term control off-treatment. However, this did not reach statistical significance.

Overall, both treatments were found to be effective to the same degree, with side effect profile being the primary delineator. Given the significant side effect of dry mouth in the anticholinergic group did not result in treatment cessation, it is likely that the higher rate of UTI and ISC represent the more significant burden to patient outcomes.

In practice, this study supports anticholinergic therapy remaining first-line for OAB management, primarily as risk-reduction for adverse events, with escalation of dose or change in agent considered if inadequate effect. Intravesical Botox should be considered second-line in treatment resistant cases, but with careful discussion of potential infection and retention, and guided by patient ability to identify these events and enact management such as self-catheterisation. This is reflected in current guidelines recommending Botox as a third-line agent, despite non-inferiority.

Assessment of evidence

"Anticholinergic Therapy vs. OnabotulinumtoxinA for Urgency Urinary Incontinence" is a large, multicentre, randomised controlled trial which re-established the non-inferiority of these two key management options for urge incontinence, while highlighting the importance of adverse event profiles in treatment selection for this population.

Using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool (version 2), we found this study to have a low risk of bias in all areas.

Although published 10 years ago, it still has ongoing significant impact on management discussions in current practice, with both AUA and EUA citing this study in respective OAB management guidelines.

Weaknesses of the study include the lack of sub-group analysis between participants who were dose-escalated or changed agent in comparison with the Botox arm. In addition, patients who previously had anticholinergic treatment were not excluded, and no sub-group analysis was performed to determine if prior treatment of any kind conveyed residual influence on efficacy outcomes. However, this was adjusted for within the randomisation process, indicating generalisability of outcomes regardless.

Overall, these factors do not detract from the outcomes and their ability to be translated to clinical decision making. Large sample-size randomised controlled trials of invasive surgical management such as intravesical injection are rare, and it is highly unlikely that another study will be safely or ethically conducted in the near term.

Background

Overactive bladder disease (OAB) is defined by the Standardization Subcommittee of the International Continence Society (ICS) as urinary urgency, with or without urinary incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, with no proven infection or other obvious pathology. As part of the National Overactive Bladder Evaluation (NOBLE) program: 16.5% of the USA population (16% of men and 16.9% of women) over 18 years of age had symptoms consistent with OAB. This translates into approximately 34 million symptomatic people in the USA alone. Of the 16.5% of the adult population with symptoms consistent with OAB, 37.2% were characterized as having OAB with urinary urge incontinence (UUI). OAB significantly impacts heath related quality of life and is associated with comorbidities such as increased risk of falls and fractures, increased urinary tract and skin infections, sleep disturbances, depression, and decreased sexual health. The economic impact of OAB is considerable given its estimated attributable cost of $12.02 billion in the USA for the year 2000.

Depending on severity and etiology, initial treatment of OAB is characterized by behavioral modification (timed voiding, bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, etc) and antimuscarinic drugs. Behavioral interventions for treating OAB such as bladder training are often the first line therapy for mild symptoms of urge, frequency, and/or incontinence. Bladder training involves patient education, scheduled voiding, and positive reinforcement. Other behavioral interventions include pelvic floor exercises (PFE) and biofeedback. PFEs are thought to inhibit spontaneous bladder contractions and also increase bladder outlet resistance to result in reduced leakage and increased voiding intervals. Biofeedback is a way of notifying the patient when certain physiologic events are occurring (e.g. unstable bladder contraction or proper PFE contraction).

In a Cochrane review on bladder training, treatment outcomes consisted of patient's global observations (perception of a cure or improvement in their incontinence), quantification of symptoms (adverse events, number of incontinence episodes, number of micturitions in day and night), and quality of life (Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and SF-36). Outcomes in PFEs and biofeedback include the quantification of symptom domains, and urodynamic outcomes.

### Using the circumstances of symptom experience to assess the severity of urgency in the overactive bladder [^1122o3dP]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We identified a method for quantifying the symptoms of the overactive bladder that addresses the assessment of urgency.

Materials and Methods

An observational study of a cohort was used. Data were collected prospectively from 5,423 consultations on 1,797 patients (158 males and 1,639 females) being assessed and treated for the overactive bladder. The study was conducted during 5 years. The reported frequencies and incontinence episodes were recorded. Using ranked ordinal scales (none, mild, moderate, severe) the symptoms of urgency and urge incontinence associated with waking and rising, hearing running water, arriving home ("latchkey"), cold weather and when feeling tired or worried were noted. The experiences of urgency and urge incontinence, without reference to the circumstances in which they were experienced were similarly assessed and if on treatment, they were asked to grade their overall response.

Results

Reported urinary frequency and incontinence episodes were strongly associated with patient grading of response to treatment. Therefore, the symptoms assessed on the scale of none, mild, moderate and severe were compared with disease severity by using reported frequency and incontinence episodes. The description of the symptoms with reference to the situations in which they were experienced showed clear associations with frequency and incontinence, falling along a progressive scale. An overall pattern could be detected in that at points on the scale of none, mild, moderate and severe, the least frequency and incontinence tended to be associated with waking, rising and latchkey symptoms. Next followed symptoms precipitated by running water and cold weather. Aggravation by fatigue or worry was associated with the greatest disease severity (ANOVA F = 8.9, p < 0.001). This scale covered a wide range from frequencies of 7 to 15 times daily and incontinence episodes through 0 to 4 times daily.

Conclusions

Qualifying the experience of urgency and urge incontinence, according to the circumstances in which these symptoms are experienced, seems to offer a promising new method for assessing the severity of urgency and urge incontinence.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^116x7my6]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — men and minimally invasive therapies reports that men have remained almost unstudied regarding response to minimally invasive treatments, and the data on sacral neuromodulation (SNM) remain equally sparse; studies suggest men respond symptomatically during test phase similarly to women yet are less likely to proceed to SNM implantation, and population data indicate male gender was a predictor of failure. For intradetrusor botulinum toxin (BTX), one study exclusively in men showed robust improvement but many declined a second injection, and compared to women, men receiving BTX also had a greater elevation in post‑void residual (PVR) and a higher incidence of need to clean intermittent catheterization (CIC).

1 Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent a heterogeneous group of symptoms with high economic and social costs and significant effects on patients' quality of life. The prevalence of LUTS in the United States ranges between 45% and 70% and increases with age. Urinary urgency (URG) is a lower urinary tract symptom defined as a compelling need to urinate which is difficult to defer. Urinary urgency can be associated with incontinence, which defines urinary urgency incontinence (UUI). URG and UUI represent common LUTS that have been traditionally referred to within the overarching syndrome of overactive bladder (OAB). OAB is a heterogenous syndrome which is defined by the presence of urinary urgency, usually with urinary frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence. The prevalence of OAB ranges between 15% and 43% of women and 11%–27% of men in the United States. URG and UUI are key symptoms of OAB, but these symptoms have not been well researched individually, making the present data challenging to interpret due to heterogenous patient populations included in prior research. We aimed to examine individual symptoms (in particular, URG and UUI), rather than more heterogenous symptom complexes, and therefore will avoid the commonly used but less specific overactive bladder or "OAB" terminology.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^111kP9hJ]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU) — Guideline Statement 16: "Patients who are refractory to behavioral and pharmacologic therapy should be evaluated by an appropriate specialist if they desire additional therapy. Expert Opinion". The Panel defines refractory as a patient "who has failed a trial of symptom-appropriate behavioral therapy of sufficient length to evaluate potential efficacy and who has failed a trial of at least one anti-muscarinic medication administered for 4 to 8 weeks". Failure may reflect "lack of efficacy and/or inability to tolerate adverse drug effects". Before advancing to further therapies, "a comprehensive evaluation should be conducted to ensure that the patient's symptoms are attributable to OAB and not to some other disease process that requires other kinds of treatment".

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment research needs and medical therapy evidence gaps include that behavioral modifications and non-invasive treatments have been well studied and are relatively effective particularly in milder cases, yet they are time consuming or difficult to implement and adherence is limited by self-efficacy and discipline; individualized recommendations and phenotyping for biological and psychological attributes are proposed to personalize care. In medical therapy, many insurance providers mandate step therapy trialing one or more antimuscarinic medications before other therapies, evidence for advanced therapies in treatment-naive patients is scant, and a key unanswered question is the timepoint (in hours or days) after pharmacotherapy when maximum symptoms control is achieved; most studies assessed patient response at twelve weeks of follow-up even though steady state occurs within days.

### Disruptive effects of overactive bladder and urge urinary incontinence in younger women [^114dCSMy]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although most studies of overactive bladder (OAB) have investigated older patients, many younger women suffer from OAB syndrome with and without urge urinary incontinence. OAB in these women is associated with an increased risk of depression, sexual dysfunction, sleep disruption, and lost productivity in the workplace. Many patients adopt coping strategies rather than seeking treatment; therefore, available treatments are underused in this population.

### Recommendations of the SUFU / AUGS / ICS female stress urinary incontinence surgical publication working group: a common standard minimum data set for the literature [^1144juAf]. Urogynecology (2024). High credibility.

Female SUI surgery — reporting reoperation/reintervention for complications should detail reasons, methods, and outcomes: Reoperation rate/reason/type should address Complications, persistent/recurrent SUI, Pain/Dyspareunia, and other causes, and assessment of the safety of surgical intervention for SUI must include reintervention and/or reoperation for management of adverse events (AEs) and outcomes following the index procedure. Intervention for the management of complications should be considered distinct from reinterventions related to persistent or recurrent SUI, and it should be clear whether any retreatment or reintervention was related to AEs/complications, including voiding dysfunction, urinary retention, foreign body-related issues, pain, and dyspareunia. For postoperative complaints, the authors must include if the patient's complaints are either worsening or de novo, if the effects/outcomes are causing or contributing to the patient's symptoms, or if the goal of the reoperation/reintervention includes the adjustment, revision, alteration, or removal of any component of the index SUI surgery. Manuscripts should be explicit in how complications or AEs are managed with reoperations or interventions, including whether chart reviews, payor data, and/or direct patient responses were used, and authors should assess and include whether reoperation/reintervention data on surgical treatment for complications was missed because of patients lost to follow-up, non-response to treatment, and/or patient relocation during the study period. Information regarding the location of reintervention (office versus operating room) and any anesthetic treatment (e.g., none, sedation, general anesthesia) should be included. The WG recommends that the manuscript includes the outcomes of the reoperations or interventions that were performed to address the complications or AEs; complications of SUI surgery that fail to improve with reintervention/reoperation are of particular concern, and when that information is not available, a statement to that effect should be included so that readers can appreciate that limitation.

Adult urodynamics — uroflowmetry (Guideline Statement 15) indicates: Uroflow may be used by clinicians in the initial and ongoing evaluation of male patients with LUTS that suggest an abnormality of voiding/emptying. (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C) Although the literature reviewed fails to specifically identify clinical scenarios when uroflowmetry is useful, the panel believes that this test has value in the evaluation of disorders of voiding, even if further testing is required to make a specific diagnosis, and uroflowmetry can also be used for monitoring treatment outcomes and correlating symptoms with objective findings; risks/harms of uroflowmetry include false positives and negatives, results should be interpreted in light of potential artifact, peak and mean can be affected by volume voided and test circumstances, and serial measurements that are consistent, similar and comparable provide the most valuable information; the panel supports the use of uroflowmetry in the initial diagnosis and follow-up of LUTS in men, while the correlation of urinary symptoms and uroflow in women is not as well understood.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^1113A1ih]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — urgency and urinary urge incontinence and detrusor overactivity (DO) note diagnostic limitations and priorities. Overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms may arise from increased bladder sensitivity or involuntary contractions and can present as urinary urgency, frequency and/or urgency incontinence. UDS may often fail to identify abnormal contractions in patients with urgency incontinence, and measurements of urinary sensation are subjective and largely correlated with volume. In patients with urgency incontinence, more study is needed in performing cystometry, further insight is needed into the optimal filling protocol that is most accurate in diagnosing DO, clarity is needed about if and when provocative studies should be performed to elicit DO, and more data are needed to stratify outcomes of treatment based on the presence or absence of DO.

### Refractory overactive bladder: a common problem? [^116La7xp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

However, dose adjustment, the combination of two different antimuscarinic drugs, and replacement by another antimuscarinic or a beta-3 agonist are options in order to improve treatment success in individual patients with OAB. Selection of the best tolerated drug is of great importance to avoid unnecessary side effects. Especially in older patients where co-medication can have its own anticholinergic effects and/or compete in metabolism in the cytochrome P450 system, impairment of cognitive function as a side effect, and metabolic interactions, can largely be avoided by choosing an appropriate antimuscarinic such as the quaternary molecule trospium chloride, which does not seem to contribute to such effects and enables flexible dosing.

In patients in whom critical reassessment of diagnosis leads to an exclusion of underlying causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction and who do not respond to intensive first-line therapy including adjusted antimuscarinic treatment, the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, the intravesical administration of onabotulinumtoxinA injections, or augmentation cystoplasty may be further treatment options.

### International consultation on incontinence 2016; executive summary: urodynamic testing [^1113YDwy]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The International Consultation on Incontinence has published an update of the recommendations for the diagnosis and management of urine incontinence (ICI2016). This manuscript summarizes the consultations committee-recommendations with regard to urodynamic assessment.

Methods

Expert consensus on the basis of structured evidence assessment has been the basis of the consultations publication and has been summarized by the committee for this manuscript.

Results

Patients that are not satisfied with their initial management on the basis of their reported signs and symptoms of urinary incontinence, as well as all patients with neurological abnormalities that are potentially relevant for the function of the lower urinary tract, may very likely profit from objective diagnosis and staging and grading of their dysfunction, with urodynamic testing, regardless their age, vulnerability and/or comorbidities. The principles and technical innovations as well as the principal recommendations for the utilization of (invasive) urodynamic assessment for women, men, children, and vulnerable elderly, with or without neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction with urinary incontinence are provided in this abbreviated ICI recommendations-document.

Conclusions

The ICI2016 committee on urodynamics presents an executive summary of the most important reasons and recommendations for the use of urodynamic investigations for patients with urinary incontinence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^116yx1iP]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder history and symptom elicitation — The clinician should carefully elicit the patient's bladder symptoms to document duration of symptoms and baseline symptom levels, to ensure that symptoms are not the consequence of some other condition and to determine whether the patient constitutes a complex OAB presentation that may require referral; questions should assess bladder storage symptoms associated with OAB (e.g., urgency, urgency incontinence, frequency, nocturia), other bladder storage problems (e.g., stress incontinence episodes) and bladder emptying (e.g., hesitancy, straining to void, prior history of urinary retention, force of stream, intermittency of stream), and the symptom of urgency is defined by the ICS as the "complaint of sudden compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer", with clinicians able to ask if the patient has a problem getting to the bathroom in time assuming normal mobility.

14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder

The efficacy of Toviaz extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for ≥ 6-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of Toviaz 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received Toviaz 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received Toviaz 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19–91 years).

The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition.

Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of Toviaz are reported in Table 10.

Figures 1–4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies.

A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting Toviaz therapy.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112xwVrk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Overactive bladder in men: special considerations for evaluation and management [^111ZPWQr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men may arise from a variety of underlying causes, including benign prostatic hyperplasia. LUTS may have a significant component of storage symptoms (urgency, frequency, urge incontinence) at presentation; however, the absence of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms does not necessarily imply pure outlet obstruction nor does their presence indicate the lack thereof. Symptomatic correlates to urodynamic findings are high when considering isolated OAB symptoms. However, mixed presentations or more overtly obstructive scenarios have less correlation with baseline symptom appraisal instruments. The ideal approach for diagnosis and management is predicated on a graded approach, with more invasive evaluation withheld for those men in whom presumptive therapy fails or who present with associated complex symptoms and in whom a higher level of intervention is being considered. The increasing incidence of LUTS with age implies a partial detrusor contribution, which must be considered in the overall management schema.

### What is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom? Individual-and population-level perspectives for both men and women [^1147WmVs]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

4.3 Implications of the findings

From the population perspective, this study identifies urgency as the most pressing public health priority across both genders, a situation reflected in the current major interest in so-called overactive bladder syndrome. For women, SUI is and should be a major priority, with a high prevalence of bothersome symptoms (12% of women). Notably, 7.5% of all women reported UUI with moderate or major bother, and 6% reported nocturia with moderate or major bother. In contrast, for men most current interest focuses on storage symptoms, and although both bothersome urgency and nocturia were highly prevalent (6.8% and 6.0% of men, respectively), these data suggest that postmicturition dribble (7.7% of men) may be an overlooked area for investigation and funding.

Among symptomatic individuals in both genders, we found that UUI was the symptom most likely to cause moderate or major bother. This is consistent with previous studies that suggest substantial impacts of UUI on quality of life and strong associations with anxiety and depression. Clinicians should be aware of the differing impacts of each subtype of incontinence for women, and question patients carefully regarding the extent of bother, managing patients according to their responses.

Overall treatment compliance with many medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia is suboptimal and especially poor for medications for overactive bladder syndrome, even in comparison with long-term medications for hypercholesterolemia or osteoporosis. We found that only a minority of men or women who reported any symptom had substantial bother. The high prevalence of these symptoms, therefore, does not imply large unmet demand for therapy. Our results suggest that most LUTS are well tolerated across ages and genders, partly probably due to their fluctuating nature, and therefore they highlight the importance of bother assessment in clinical practice, especially before invasive diagnostics or initiation of therapy.

### The role of electrical stimulation techniques in the management of the male patient with urgency incontinence [^112hMRD4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Overactive bladder affects 10–27% of men, a significant portion of whom report urge urinary incontinence that is inadequately treated with first-line and second-line treatments. There is thus a substantial need to critically evaluate the alternative means of clinical management.

Recent Findings

This review presents the current evidence for the use of sacral neuromodulation and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation in the treatment of men with urge incontinence, as well as evaluates the financial implications of these treatments. Other alternative modes of electrical stimulation for urge incontinence are also briefly reviewed.

Summary

Both sacral neuromodulation and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation prove to be viable, durable options for treating patients with refractory urge incontinence. Alternative modes of stimulation are also beginning to show promise.

### Clinical presentation and treatment of macroplastique® urethral exposures: a retrospective case series [^111JWjdM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Manufacturers of Macroplastique® for urethral bulking have not previously reported exposures as potential complications. This study was aimed at identifying presenting symptoms, management, and outcomes in patients experiencing urethral or bladder exposures.

Methods

A retrospective case series from 2010 to 2019 was performed in an academic affiliated hospital system. Participants were 18–89 years old and received Macroplastique® urethral bulking for treatment of stress urinary incontinence. Charts were identified through diagnosis and procedure codes relating to injections of urethral bulking agents and foreign bodies in the bladder or urethra. Factors evaluated were patient history and presenting symptoms, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcomes using frequency tables for categorical values and statistical distribution with median and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables.

Results

After review of 1,269 charts, 580 cases met the inclusion criteria and 14 Macroplastique® urethral exposures were identified. The median age at first presentation was 73.5 years (IQR57.5–79.7 years) with 48 months (IQR 22–78 months) as the median time to first presentation after last Macroplastique® injection. The median number of injection sessions was 2 (IQR 1–2.75 sessions) with a medium volume of 4.5 mL (IQR 2.75–9.0 ml). Presenting symptoms included urge incontinence (64.3%), stress urinary incontinence (57.1%), recurrent urinary tract infection (42.9%), urinary urgency (28.9%), urinary frequency (28.9%), urinary retention (14.3%), and interrupted flow (7.1%). Macroplastique® urethral exposures were extracted in 10 patients using blunt, sharp, or electrocautery excision. No complications after excision were identified and improvement in urinary symptoms was observed.

Conclusion

Urethral bulking with Macroplastique® can lead to symptomatic urethral exposures.

2 Materials and Methods

The LURN is a multicenter, National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases sponsored research network consisting of six clinical sites and a data coordinating center. After obtaining institutional review board approval, we recruited a treatment seeking cohort of adult men and women with URG with or without UUI (cases) between March 2021 and June 2024 who presented for urologic or urogynecologic care at one of the clinical sites. Additionally, we recruited controls, defined as an age‐matched group of people without significant LUTS.

2.1 Study Population

Inclusion and exclusion criteria are outlined in Table 1. Participants were included as cases if they were at least 18 years old, able to complete self‐reported questionnaires electronically, had access to a smart phone, and had bothersome symptoms of URG or UUI. Presence of urinary urgency or UUI were each defined as a response of "sometimes", "often", or "always" with at least "somewhat" bother to the following items on the LUTS Tool with a 1‐month recall period:

"During the past month, how often have you had a sudden need to rush to urinate?"

"How often have you had a sudden need to rush to urinate for the fear of leaking urine?"

Table 1
LURN II Urinary Urgency Phenotyping (UPP) study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Cases were grouped as having urinary urgency without UUI (URG) versus UUI by their response to LUTS Tool item "How often in the past month have you… leaked urine in connection with a sudden need to rush to urinate?" Participants who respond "sometimes", "often", or "always" were classified as having UUI, while participants responding "never" or "rarely" were classified as URG.

Participants were included in the control group if they were at least 18 years old and did not report urinary urgency or other LUTS. Specific inclusion criteria for controls were absence of urinary frequency (< 8 voids/day), nocturia (0‐1 void/night), and answered "never" or "rarely" to LUTS Tool items 1‐month recall version regarding URG, urinary incontinence, and UUI.

Overactive bladder (OAB) research needs and future directions — OAB, because it is a symptom complex, is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion and treatments are aimed at relieving symptoms, highlighting that understanding the pathophysiology and risk factors for development of OAB is needed and that future research will need to address epidemiology, QoL, treatment modalities, and basic bladder physiology including sensory and motor signaling. Research often dichotomizes OAB into OAB-dry and OAB-wet, but this compartmentalization highlights a lack of understanding; in addition, particularly in females, stress urinary incontinence may exist concomitantly with OAB symptoms and isolated nocturia is a separate symptom entity requiring different evaluation and management strategies; therefore the phenotype of bladder symptoms should be carefully considered and declared in all research. Studies assessing how OAB develops and its natural history and progression are required, and the timing and circumstances of development and associated risk factors are not yet well-understood.

### Pathophysiology of overactive bladder [^111ATfAU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common disorder that negatively affects the quality of life of our patients and carries a large socioeconomic burden. According to the International Continence Society, it is characterized as urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually, with frequency and nocturia in the absence of causative infection. The pathophysiology of this disease entity varies between neurogenic, myogenic, or idiopathic factors. This paper provides a review of the contemporary theories behind the pathophysiology of OAB.

1 INTRODUCTION

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a stressful and disruptive disorder that causes millions of individuals to suffer from a decrease in their quality of life.OAB is defined as the presence of urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. Urgency is the complaint of a sudden, irresistible desire to pass urine. Frequency is the number of voids per day (> 7 voids per day). Nocturia is greater than 1 void per night. Urge incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine associated with sudden compelling desire to void. To be diagnosed a combination of these symptoms must be present without a pathologic or metabolic component causing them. The national prevalence of OAB is 16.5%. The real number of individuals with OAB is most likely much larger. Many people living with OAB delay or do not seek medical attention, others are embarrassed and do not know how to talk to their health care providers about their symptoms, and others are often unaware that there are treatments available for OAB.

Patients are offered treatment following guidelines from the American Urological Association. First‐line treatments are physical therapy and behavioral therapies. These can be effective, but many patients are noncompliant. Second‐line treatment are medications. Anticholinergic and β‐3 agonist drugs show improvement rates of 70% to 80% but produce significant side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, and cognitive decline) and can be cost‐prohibitive. Third‐line therapies include intradetrusor onabotullinumtoxin (Botox) injections, and neuromodulation. Botox produces a temporary improvement in up to 70% of cases; however, may cause urinary retention. Neuromodulation using percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is up to 70% effective and has few side effects but requires frequent visits to the clinic. Also, because it lacks an objective method of nerve location and activation, PTNS' efficacy can be highly dependent on the clinician performing the procedure. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), has improvement rates of 70%–75%, but is invasiveand may require additional surgeries.

### Abstract… [^115dbtAJ]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Classification UI can be transient or chronic. Transient UI arises suddenly, lasts less than six months, and can be reversed if the underlying cause is addressed. 12 Chronic UI is differentiated into stress, urge, mixed, overflow, or functional subtypes. Stress UI caused by urethral sphincter weakness or urethral hypermobility results in predictable loss of urine with activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure. Stress UI affects 25% to 45% of women older than 30 years.
13. Urge UI related to detrusor overactivity causes involuntary loss of urine associated with urgency as well as increased urinary frequency or nocturia. Patients typically lose urine on the way to the toilet. Prevalence ranges from 9% of women in their forties to 31% of women in their seventies. 13 Mixed UI has components of stress and urge UI and has a prevalence of 20% to 30%.

Overflow UI accounts for 5% of chronic UI because of detrusor underactivity or bladder outlet obstruction, which leads to urinary retention and subsequent leakage. 13 Patients may strain to pass urine or have a sensation of incomplete emptying. Functional UI occurs when there are barriers to toileting, such as cognitive impairment, physical frailty, or immobility. The number of patients affected by functional UI is unclear. 1, 13. History A thorough history can often distinguish between transient and chronic UI, as well as the subtype of chronic UI. The mnemonic TOILETED is helpful to identify causes for transient UI. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation requires weekly procedures for the initial three months and subsequent monthly maintenance treatments.

It has similar effectiveness as antimuscarinic medications. MIXED, OVERFLOW, AND FUNCTIONAL UI Management of mixed UI should be directed toward treating predominant symptoms. Reversible causes of overflow UI should be identified. Intermittent or indwelling catheterization is often required if the etiology is irreversible. 40 Behavior therapies, such as assisted and timed toileting, are the primary treatment for functional incontinence. 40.

### Can we predict the success of prostatic surgery for male lower urinary tract symptoms: ICI-RS 2018? [^111qbsUP]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common and bothersome symptoms in the aging population, of which the etiology is multifactorial. Prostatic surgery may be considered to alleviate some of these LUTS, especially in patients in which benign prostatic obstruction is believed to be the underlying cause. The aim of this paper is to discuss underlying pathophysiology, signs, and conditions that may lead to success or failure after prostatic surgery in male patients with LUTS.

Methods

The paper is a report of presentations and subsequent discussions at the annual International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society, in June 2018 in Bristol.

Results and Conclusions

Unfavorable outcomes after prostatic surgery are reported in 25% to 30% of the patients. This may be due to persistent or de novo symptoms, related to the multifactorial origin of symptoms. Specific underlying conditions such as with detrusor overactivity, detrusor underactivity, and nocturnal polyuria are discussed in their relationship with prostatic surgery. Knowledge gaps are addressed and specific research questions proposed.

### Application of guidelines to the evaluation of the male patient with urgency and / or incontinence [^116c7og5]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review and evaluate the evidence from contemporary evidence-based guidelines regarding the assessment of men with urinary urgency and/or incontinence.

Recent Findings

There are a number of evidence-based guidelines which describe the pathways for assessing men with the symptoms of urgency and/or incontinence. We summarize the conclusions of the European Association of Urology, American Urological Association and National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines.

Summary

All guidelines recommend a directed history, examination (including digital rectal examination), urinalysis and bladder diary as being essential in the assessment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms, although there are no high levels of evidence studies to support this. Creatinine estimation and prostate-specific antigen are recommended in selected groups of men, the latter after appropriate counselling. Uroflowmetry with postvoid residual assessment is recommended for at specialist assessment. Pad tests may be useful to quantify leakage. Ultrasound assessment of prostatic size and protrusion into the bladder base may be useful. Cystometry is recommended for men considering prostatic surgery, although there is a poor level of evidence underpinning this. Noninvasive surrogates for cystometry, such as penile plethysmography, lack sufficient evidence to allow recommendations to be made.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^114Pa1ti]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Medical history and bladder symptom assessment — clinician assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB should characterize symptoms, assess severity and duration, exclude alternative diagnoses, and identify complicated signs or symptoms that may necessitate referral or additional evaluation. Bladder symptom assessment should include questions about typical OAB symptoms (urinary urgency, daytime and nighttime frequency, urgency urinary incontinence [UUI]), other urinary storage impairments (stress incontinence, incontinence without sensation), and the ability to empty the bladder (straining to void, poor force of stream, urinary hesitancy, history of urinary retention, sensation of incomplete emptying). Predominant emptying symptoms can indicate an elevated post-void residual (PVR) and/or bladder outflow obstruction (BOO), especially in patients with prostates. Certain signs or symptoms may suggest a more complicated process that may require further evaluation include abdominal pain, pelvic pain, hematuria, recurrent UTI, sudden onset of severe OAB symptoms, concomitant neurologic symptoms (blurred vision, limb weakness or numbness), and bowel dysfunction (fecal incontinence, severe constipation). The presence of incomplete emptying or other complicated symptoms warrants specialist evaluation.

### Multicenter analysis of urinary urgency and urge incontinence in patients with anterior urethral stricture disease before and after urethroplasty [^117QHsUC]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Little published data exist on the impact of urethral stricture surgery on urinary urgency. We evaluated urinary urgency and urge incontinence before and after anterior urethroplasty.

Materials and Methods

Male patients who underwent 1-stage anterior urethroplasty were retrospectively identified at 8 centers. Patients with preoperative and 2-month or greater postoperative subjective urinary urgency assessments were included in study. Patients who received anticholinergic medications preoperatively were excluded. Univariate and multivariate analysis was done to analyze the association of patient characteristics with preoperative and postoperative symptoms as well as improvement or worsening of symptoms after surgery.

Results

Symptom and followup data on urgency and urge incontinence were available in in 439 and 305 patients, respectively. Preoperatively 58% of the men reported urgency and 31% reported urge incontinence. Postoperatively this decreased to 40% of men for urgency and 12% for urge incontinence (each p < 0.01). Of the men 37% reported improvement in urgency and 74% experienced improvement in urge incontinence. Few of those without preoperative symptoms showed worse symptoms, including urgency in 9% and urge incontinence in 5%. New urgency was more likely to develop in men with a higher body mass index (OR 1.09, p = 0.02). Men with stricture recurrence were less likely to show improvement in urgency (OR 0.24, p = 0.03). Older men were more likely to have new urge incontinence (OR 1.06, p = 0.01) and less likely to notice improvement in urge symptoms (OR 0.92, p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The prevalence of urgency and urge incontinence in male patients with anterior urethral stricture is high. The majority of men experience symptom stability or improvement in urinary urge symptoms following anterior urethroplasty.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^116jrYoU]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) with severely reduced mobility — management stance: A common situation associated with OAB is severely reduced mobility with causes that can range from dementia, severe arthritis, severe obesity, hemiparesis/plegia, and lower extremity amputations; in these situations, despite receiving an urge to urinate, the patient physically cannot get from their current position without assistance to a toileting facility and this cannot be corrected pharmacologically. In certain patients for whom hygiene and skin breakdown are major concerns, treatment may be considered regardless of the patient's perceptions when it is in the patient's best interests; in these patients, behavioral strategies that include prompted voiding and fluid management may be helpful, whereas pharmacologic treatments and invasive treatments are generally not appropriate; untreated incontinence can result in falls when a patient with compromised mobility attempts to move quickly to a toileting facility, and the treating physician, the patient and the caregiver must address the risks when making the decision whether or not to treat OAB.

### Update on drugs for overactive bladder syndrome [^115Gnmm2]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Around 1.5% of adults in Europe and the USA have urge urinary incontinence (involuntary leakage immediately preceded or accompanied by urgency). This is usually due to overactive bladder syndrome (defined as urgency, with or without urge incontinence, and usually with frequency and nocturia), which occurs in around 12% of adults, and is similarly prevalent in men and women. We last reviewed this condition in 2001. Since then, two new antimuscarinic drugs, darifenacin (Emselex) and solifenacin (Vesicare) have been licensed in the UK for urge incontinence and/or increased urinary frequency and urgency (as may occur in patients with overactive bladder syndrome), as have transdermal oxybutynin (Kentera) and modified-release formulations of tolterodine (Detrusitol XL) and propiverine (Detrunorm XL). Here we review the place of these newer drugs and formulations.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^1111Nf3s]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Bladder function context — history should address fluid intake, medications, and medical/surgical conditions that can mimic or exacerbate OAB, with optional cognitive and frailty screening when relevant. Bladder function is dependent on factors including fluid intake, medications, medical conditions, and surgical history, and clinicians should inquire about the volume and type of daily fluid intake along with the number of daytime and nighttime voids and whether urgency contributes to frequency. Large volume fluid intake will certainly lead to more frequent voiding, but in the absence of bothersome or persistent urgency it is not considered pathologic. Current medications should be reviewed with special attention to diuretics and diabetic medications that cause glucosuria (i.e. SGLT2 inhibitors) as these patients may have urinary frequency, and urinary frequency without persistent urgency can point to polyuria secondary to fluid intake and/or medication rather than OAB. Co-morbid medical conditions can mimic OAB symptoms, exacerbate symptoms, or limit OAB treatment response, including recurrent UTI, poorly controlled diabetes, untreated sleep apnea, and prior pelvic surgeries including those for incontinence; impaired cognition and mobility may lead to functional incontinence. Clinicians may use the Mini Mental Status Exam as a standardized, quick, and reproducible means to assess cognitive impairment in patients who are at high risk, and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS-9) is a visual tool to assess frailty in a clinical setting. The presence of neurological disorders with OAB symptoms is suggestive of NLUTD and should be evaluated according to The AUA/SUFU Guideline on Adult Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction: Diagnosis and Evaluation, and a history of pelvic malignancies, pelvic radiation, or concerns about foreign bodies in the urinary tract warrants additional evaluation.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) description — LUTS is a term utilized to represent a multifactorial constellation of nonspecific symptoms that affects both bladder filling and urine storage. Filling LUTS include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and nocturia, and voiding LUTS include slow stream, hesitancy, intermittency, incomplete bladder emptying and post-void or terminal dribbling. For the purposes of this document, LUTS is applicable to both men and women, and irritative LUTS may co-exist with obstructive LUTS and may cloud the assessment, thereby making diagnosis important.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 68-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease who presented with urinary incontinence following a kidney transplant. Through a structured clinical approach, including targeted history-taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script is constructed, and the differential diagnosis is refined. As the clinical course progresses, additional investigations provide key insights, leading to the final diagnosis.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^115NH6v9]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — overactive bladder (OAB), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and mixed urinary incontinence are defined as symptom complexes that include a component of urinary urgency with or without incontinence in the absence of infection or other pathology. Urgency is the sudden uncontrollable desire to void that is difficult to defer and may or may not be associated with urinary incontinence. OAB is a syndrome in which several of the storage-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) coexist with urgency being the principal and essential parameter, and by definition at least one parameter must exist in addition to the urgency in order to diagnose OAB. Mixed incontinence is the combination of SUI and urge incontinence, patients will often describe urinary frequency with low-volume voids, nocturia is a more variable part of the OAB complex and usually has a multifactorial etiology, and patients with nocturia as a primary symptom that significantly affects quality of life require separate investigation and are beyond the scope of this guideline.

The UPSTREAM and FUTURE trials found no added benefit from routine urodynamics (UDS) in men with presumed benign prostatic obstruction or women with overactive bladder symptoms unresponsive to initial therapy. However, these population-based studies were not powered to evaluate specific subgroups for which a higher degree of diagnostic certainty could have led to better outcomes. This consensus paper argues that UDS is essential in selected cases for which comprehensive clinical assessment alone may be insufficient. A selective approach to UDS will ensure that patients receive the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

An example prompt is, "Do you have a problem with urinary incontinence (or your bladder) that is bothersome enough that you would like to know more about how it could be treated?", and this quality improvement intervention has been shown to increase appropriate care by 15% in patients aged 75 years or older.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^116Jkkfk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — overactive bladder (OAB) pharmacotherapy — clinicians should offer antimuscarinic medications or beta-3 agonists to improve urinary urgency, frequency, and/or urgency urinary incontinence (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Clinicians should counsel patients with OAB on the side effects of all oral medication options; treatment should be chosen based on side effect profiles and in the context of shared decision-making. Clinicians should discuss the potential risk for developing dementia and cognitive impairment with patients with OAB who are taking, or who are prescribed, antimuscarinic medications. Clinicians should use antimuscarinic medications with extreme caution in patients with OAB who have narrow-angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, or a history of urinary retention. Clinicians should assess patients with OAB who have initiated pharmacotherapy for efficacy and onset of treatment side effects. In patients with OAB who experience intolerable side effects or who do not achieve adequate improvement with an OAB medication, clinicians may offer a different medication in the same class or different class of medication to obtain greater tolerability and/or efficacy. In patients with OAB who do not achieve adequate improvement with a single OAB medication, clinicians may offer combination therapy with a medication from a different class (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B).

### Bladder training for treating overactive bladder in adults [^112o5L7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common chronic and bothersome condition. Bladder training is widely prescribed as a first-line treatment for OAB, but the efficacy has been systematically evaluated for urinary incontinence rather than OAB alone.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of bladder training for treating adults with OAB compared to no treatment, anticholinergics, β3-adrenoceptor agonists, or pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) alone or in combination.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 6 November 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials involving adults aged 18 years or older with non-neurogenic OAB. We excluded studies of participants whose symptoms were caused by factors outside the urinary tract (e.g. neurologic disorders, cognitive impairment, gynecologic diseases).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. participant-reported cure or improvement, 2. symptom- and condition-related quality of life (QoL), and 3.

Adverse Events

Secondary outcomes included 4. participant-reported satisfaction, 5. number of incontinence episodes, 6. number of urgency episodes, and 7. number of micturition episodes. For the purpose of this review, we considered two time points: immediately after the treatment (early phase) and at least two months after the treatment (late phase). We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 15 trials with 2007 participants; participants in these trials were predominantly women (89.3%). We assessed the risk of bias of results for primary and secondary outcomes, which across all studies was similar and predominantly of high risk of bias, and none were at low risk of bias. The certainty of evidence was low to very low, with some moderate, across measured outcomes. Bladder training versus no treatment: three studies involving 92 participants compared bladder training to no treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of bladder training on cure or improvement at the early phase (risk ratio (RR) 17.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 256.56; 1 study, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Bladder training may reduce the number of incontinence episodes (mean difference (MD) -1.86, 95% CI -3.47 to -0.25; 1 study, 14 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies measured symptom- and condition-related QoL, number of adverse events, participant-reported satisfaction, number of urgency episodes, or number of micturition episodes in the early phase. Bladder training versus anticholinergics: seven studies (602 participants) investigated the effects of bladder training versus anticholinergic therapy. Bladder training may be more effective than anticholinergics on cure or improvement at the early phase (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.70; 4 studies, 258 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of bladder training on symptom- and condition-related QoL (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.77; 2 studies, 117 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Although the evidence is very uncertain, there were fewer adverse events in the bladder training group than in the anticholinergics group (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.17; 3 studies, 187 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (MD 0.36, 95% CI -0.27 to 1.00; 2 studies, 117 participants; very low-certainty evidence), the number of urgency episodes per 24 hours (MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.62 to 2.02; 2 studies, 92 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and the number of micturition episodes per 24 hours (MD -0.35, 95% CI -1.90 to 1.20; 3 studies, 175 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies measured participant-reported satisfaction in the early phase. Bladder training versus PFMT: three studies involving 203 participants compared bladder training to PFMT. The evidence is very uncertain about the different effects between bladder training and PFMT on symptom- and condition-related QoL at the early phase (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.40; 2 studies, 178 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no adverse events in either group at the early phase (1 study, 97 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain about the effects of the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39, 1 study, 81 participants; low-certainty evidence) and very uncertain about the number of micturition episodes per 24 hours (MD 0.10, 95% CI -1.44 to 1.64; 1 study, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies measured cure or improvement, participant-reported satisfaction, or number of urgency episodes in the early phase. Although we were interested in studies examining bladder training versus β3-adrenoceptor agonists, in combination with β3-adrenoceptor agonists versus β3-adrenoceptor agonists alone, and in combination with PFMT versus PFMT alone, we did not identify any eligible studies for these comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

This review focused on the effect of bladder training to treat OAB. However, most of the evidence was low or very-low certainty. Based on the low- or very low-certainty evidence, bladder training may cure or improve OAB compared to no treatment. Bladder training may be more effective to cure or improve OAB than anticholinergics, and there may be fewer adverse events. There may be no difference in efficacy or safety between bladder training and PFMT. More well-designed trials are needed to reach a firm conclusion.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^117TY3iy]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists, management of medication adverse effects, AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering a different medication in the same class or a different class of medication to obtain greater tolerability and/or efficacy in patients with overactive bladder experiencing intolerable side effects or not achieving adequate improvement with an overactive bladder medication.

### Content validity and test-retest reliability of patient perception of intensity of urgency scale (PPIUS) for overactive bladder [^1142yPLy]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Several limitations should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. First, previous studies have indicated that OAB was almost equally prevalent among men and women. However, a relatively small percentage (18%) of men participated in the study, while target enrollment for men in OAB clinical trials is typically about 30%. The results could be more confidently generalized to the male patient population if more male patients were interviewed. Another limitation was that the urgency and incontinence continuum was not fully explored, which remained a challenge in assessing urinary urgency. One participant described experiencing incontinence at all level of urgency. Further studies are needed as Starkman et al. pointed out "While some argue that urgency is episodic and maximal, we believe it can be subjectively graded. For example, some episodes of urgency can be suppressed, some persistently require immediate action, and some are so overwhelming that urge incontinence results. Although evidence for such a continuum is lacking, it remains conceptually intuitive". PPIUS has been included in two completed, one withdrawn, and one ongoing clinical trial as shown in the ClinicalTrial.gov website.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113wM9mn]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — second-line pharmacologic management for overactive bladder (OAB) states Guideline Statement 8: "Clinicians should offer oral anti-muscarinics, or oral β3-adrenoceptor agonists as second-line therapy", with the label "Standard" and "Evidence strength – Grade B; Benefits outweigh risks/burdens". Anti-muscarinic medications reduce symptoms but "can commonly have non-life-threatening side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, dry or itchy eyes, blurred vision, dyspepsia, UTI, urinary retention and impaired cognitive function", and "Rarely, life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmias have been reported". Across randomized trials there was "no compelling evidence for differential efficacy across medications". Qualitative analysis indicated that "for 24-hour frequency, urgency incontinence and incontinence, baseline symptom level was closely related to degree of symptom reduction", with "patients with more severe symptoms, on average, experienced greater symptom reductions", whereas "for urgency incontinence and total incontinence episodes, only patients with relatively low baseline symptom levels were likely to experience complete symptom relief", and "for urgency and nocturia, however, there was no apparent relationship between baseline symptom levels and symptom reduction". Given similar efficacy, "the choice of medication for a particular patient depends on the patient's history of anti-muscarinic use, information regarding adverse events experienced in the past, the impact on the patient of adverse events, patient preferences, comorbidities, use of other medications and the availability of and resources to acquire specific medications".

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113xbNGS]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for urinary incontinence in men, more specifically with respect to urodynamic testing, AUA/SUFU 2012 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining pressure flow studies to evaluate for bladder outlet obstruction in patients with urgency incontinence after bladder outlet procedures.
