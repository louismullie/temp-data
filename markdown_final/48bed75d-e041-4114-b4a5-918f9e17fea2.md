## Question

What does FVC pre 80% and post 87% mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "FVC pre 80% and post 87%" means in spirometry and how to interpret these results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what FVC represents and why we measure it before and after bronchodilator. Then, I should verify what the percentages mean and how they are calculated. Next, I will interpret the magnitude of change and whether it meets accepted criteria for a bronchodilator response. After that, I should consider what this implies diagnostically for obstructive versus restrictive disease and whether it changes management. Finally, I will review quality considerations and when to repeat testing or add further studies like lung volumes or DLCO to clarify the pattern.

> Let me first confirm the basics: FVC stands for forced vital capacity, the total volume of air exhaled during a maximal forced expiration, and it is measured twice — before and after administering a short-acting bronchodilator — to assess reversibility and refine the interpretation of airflow limitation, so "pre 80%" and "post 87%" refer to pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator FVC expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal value for the patient's age, sex, height, and race/ethnicity [^116yFLCa] [^117NCPzZ].

> Wait, let me verify the calculation so I don't jump to conclusions: these percentages are derived by dividing the measured FVC by the predicted FVC and multiplying by 100, so pre-bronchodilator FVC is 80% of predicted and post-bronchodilator FVC is 87% of predicted, indicating an absolute improvement of 7 percentage points of predicted FVC after bronchodilator [^116yFLCa] [^117NCPzZ].

> I will now examine the magnitude of change and whether it constitutes a clinically meaningful bronchodilator response. A commonly used criterion for a positive bronchodilator response in adults is a relative increase in FVC of at least 12% and an absolute increase of at least 200 mL, so a 7% rise alone would not meet that threshold, though I should double-check the absolute volume change in liters before concluding definitively [^117NCPzZ].

> Hold on, let's not conflate FVC change with obstruction. I need to ensure I interpret this in the context of the FEV1/FVC ratio and the pre/post pattern, because a modest FVC increase with bronchodilator can reflect reduced hyperinflation and improved emptying rather than a change in the obstructive ratio, and in some patients the FVC rise is more pronounced than the FEV1 rise, which can even shift a borderline pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC into the non-obstructive range post-bronchodilator, so I should confirm the pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC values before labeling the defect [^116NjEvL] [^115Dzv9i].

> Let me consider the diagnostic implications carefully: if the pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is less than 0.70 and the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC remains less than 0.70, that supports fixed airflow obstruction consistent with COPD. If the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is 0.70 or higher, that suggests a reversible component and argues against a COPD diagnosis at that time, so I should confirm the ratio on both occasions and, if the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is between 0.60 and 0.80, repeat spirometry on a separate day to account for biological variability before making a firm diagnosis [^115Dzv9i] [^117As1no].

> But wait, what if the FVC is low both before and after bronchodilator with a preserved or normal FEV1/FVC ratio? That pattern suggests a restrictive defect rather than obstruction, and I should verify with static lung volumes and ideally diffusing capacity to confirm restriction and explore etiologies, because relying on FVC alone without TLC can misclassify mixed defects or early obstruction as restriction [^116NjEvL] [^112k9JNo].

> I should double-check test quality and repeatability because interpretation hinges on it. The best FVC and FEV1 from technically acceptable maneuvers should be reported, the FEV1/FVC should be taken from the acceptable maneuver with the largest sum of FEV1 and FVC, and repeatability within 150 mL for adults is expected for grade A quality, so if repeatability is poor or the post-bronchodilator FVC grade is lower, I need to consider repeating the study before making clinical decisions [^116yFLCa] [^117NaUXH].

> Next, I should review whether this degree of FVC change alters management. A small FVC improvement without meeting bronchodilator response criteria may still be clinically meaningful if symptoms and exercise tolerance improve, but GOLD advises that the magnitude of acute reversibility does not reliably predict long-term benefit from bronchodilators or ICS, so I should avoid overinterpreting a modest FVC change and instead integrate symptoms, exacerbations, and functional status when deciding on therapy [^113d5NE3] [^112NBb3G].

> Let me reconsider the original statement to ensure I haven't missed anything: "FVC pre 80% and post 87%" means the patient's FVC improved from 80% to 87% of predicted after bronchodilator, a 7% relative increase that is below standard adult thresholds for a positive bronchodilator response, so this alone does not establish reversibility. I need the absolute volume change in liters and the pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio to determine whether obstruction is present and whether it is fixed or reversible before assigning a diagnostic label or changing treatment [^117NCPzZ] [^115Dzv9i].

---

The notation "FVC pre 80% and post 87%" means the **forced vital capacity (FVC) was 80% of predicted before bronchodilator** and increased to **87% of predicted after bronchodilator**, indicating a **modest improvement** with bronchodilation. This 7% rise suggests a small, **partially reversible component** but does not meet the standard 12% and 200 mL threshold for a significant bronchodilator response [^117NCPzZ]. Clinically, this pattern is common in COPD and other obstructive diseases, and the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio should be used to confirm airflow obstruction and guide diagnosis and management [^115Dzv9i] [^113eVjqR].

---

## Clinical significance of FVC pre- and post-bronchodilator measurements

FVC is a key spirometric measure of lung volume and is commonly used to assess **restrictive and obstructive lung diseases**. Comparing pre- and post-bronchodilator FVC helps determine the presence and degree of **reversibility** of airflow limitation.

---

## Interpretation of "FVC pre 80% and post 87%"

The notation "FVC pre 80% and post 87%" indicates that the patient's FVC was 80% of the predicted normal value before bronchodilator administration and increased to 87% of predicted after bronchodilator administration. This represents a **7% improvement** in FVC following bronchodilation.

---

## Clinical implications of the observed improvement

The observed 7% improvement in FVC suggests a modest **bronchodilator response**, indicating partial reversibility of airflow limitation. However, this improvement does not meet the commonly accepted criteria for a significant bronchodilator response, typically defined as an increase in FVC or FEV1 of at least 12% and 200 mL [^117NCPzZ] [^116Eszwp]. Therefore, the observed change is considered **mild to moderate** and may reflect underlying obstructive lung disease with a partially reversible component.

---

## Diagnostic considerations

The modest improvement in FVC with bronchodilation suggests obstructive lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. However, a definitive diagnosis of COPD requires confirmation of **persistent airflow limitation** [^113eVjqR], defined by a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.70 [^115Dzv9i]. In this case, the FEV1/FVC ratio should be evaluated post-bronchodilator to confirm the presence of airflow obstruction and guide further diagnostic and management decisions [^113WdzSb].

---

## Clinical management implications

The modest improvement in FVC may influence clinical management by indicating potential benefit from bronchodilator therapy, although the response is not considered **clinically significant** by standard criteria. Management decisions should consider the patient's symptoms, functional status, and overall clinical context, and additional diagnostic tests — such as diffusing capacity (DLCO), lung volumes, and imaging — may be warranted to further characterize the underlying lung disease and guide treatment planning [^116zeTJ1].

## Interpretation of FVC pre- and post-bronchodilator measurements

| **Measurement** | **Pre-bronchodilator** | **Post-bronchodilator** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| FVC (% predicted) | 80% | 87% | Modest improvement (7%) indicating partial reversibility |
| Clinical significance | Mildly reduced lung volume | Slight improvement with bronchodilation | Suggests obstructive lung disease with partial reversibility |

---

The notation "FVC pre 80% and post 87%" indicates a modest improvement in FVC following bronchodilation, suggesting partial reversibility of airflow limitation. This finding is **not sufficient to meet standard criteria** for a significant bronchodilator response but may still have clinical implications for diagnosis and management of obstructive lung disease [^112NBb3G].

### Acute bronchodilator responses decline progressively over 4 years in patients with moderate to very severe COPD [^115kvnYD]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We previously reported a progressive decline in absolute responses of FEV1 and FVC to a near-maximal dose of 2 different short-acting bronchodilators over 4 years. Since varying host factors and the method of expressing the response may impact the time trend of acute bronchodilator responses, we now examined the potential influence of salient host characteristics on changes in bronchodilator responses over time expressed in different ways.

Methods

As part of the 4-year, placebo-controlled Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) trial, pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed at baseline and 1 month and every 6 months thereafter. Post-bronchodilator values for FEV1 and FVC were analyzed for subjects completing at least the 1 year visit (Placebo - N = 2463; Tiotropium - N = 2579), stratified by GOLD stage, age, gender and smoking status and expressed as absolute, relative (%) and % predicted changes from pre-bronchodilator values. Annual changes in bronchodilator response were estimated using linear mixed effects models.

Results

For all subjects analyzed, FEV1 and FVC bronchodilator responses showed progressive and highly significant (p < 0.0001) declines over 4 years. Declines were generally larger in patients with severe/very severe than mild/moderate airflow obstruction, in older patients (≥ 65 yrs) and in former than continuing smokers.

Conclusion

Acute FEV1 and FVC responses to bronchodilators decline significantly over time in COPD patients, whether expressed as absolute, relative or % predicted changes, potentially impacting on the clinical responses to bronchodilator therapy as well as on the annual rate of decline in post-bronchodilator lung function.

### Consequences of using post-or prebronchodilator reference values in interpreting spirometry [^111jQcdf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Postbronchodilator spirometry is used for the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, prebronchodilator reference values are used for spirometry interpretation. Objectives: To compare the resulting prevalence rates of abnormal spirometry and study the consequences of using pre- or postbronchodilator reference values generated within SCAPIS (Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study) when interpreting postbronchodilator spirometry in a general population. Methods: SCAPIS reference values for postbronchodilator and prebronchodilator spirometry were based on 10,156 and 1,498 never-smoking, healthy participants, respectively. We studied the associations of abnormal spirometry, defined by using pre- or postbronchodilator reference values, with respiratory burden in the SCAPIS general population (28,851 individuals). Measurements and Main Results: Bronchodilation resulted in higher predicted medians and lower limits of normal (LLNs) for FEV 1 /FVC ratios. The prevalence of postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio lower than the prebronchodilator LLN was 4.8%, and that of postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC lower than the postbronchodilator LLN was 9.9%, for the general population. An additional 5.1% were identified as having an abnormal postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio, and this group had more respiratory symptoms, emphysema (13.5% vs. 4.1%; P < 0.001), and self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.8% vs. 0.5%, P < 0.001) than subjects with a postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio greater than the LLN for both pre- and postbronchodilation. Conclusions: Pre- and postbronchodilator spirometry reference values differ with regard to FEV 1 /FVC ratio. Use of postbronchodilator reference values doubled the population prevalence of airflow obstruction; this was related to a higher respiratory burden. Using postbronchodilator reference values when interpreting postbronchodilator spirometry might enable the identification of individuals with mild disease and be clinically relevant.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^115DWSe3]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Table 5
Regression of difference between observed pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function values (post bronchodilator – pre-bronchodilator values) in millilitres

*Difference at age 40 years, body mass index 23 and 175 centimetres height in men or 165 centimetres height in women.

Table 6 shows the mean differences and 95% limits of agreement for the observed values, the predicted values and the lower limits of normal. The mean observed differences and the predicted differences are equal, by definition, but the limits of agreement are much narrower for the predicted values, as expected.

Table 6
Pre- and post- bronchodilator differences (in millilitres) between observed spirometric values, predicted values and lower limits of normal values for men and women

Table 7 gives the sensitivity and specificity of using the pre-bronchodilator values and the pre-bronchodilator values adjusted with a fixed constant when compared with the gold standard of using the calculated lower limits of normal using the post-bronchodilator values. The data used to estimate these come from the participants excluded from the "normal" population, and therefore do not include individuals who were used to estimate the original norms. Compared with the "gold standard" of the lower limit of normal derived from post-bronchodilator spirometry, use of the pre-bronchodilator LLN criterion results in a substantially lower sensitivity when judging an abnormal FEV1 (sensitivity = 78.4%) or FEV1/FVC ratio (sensitivity = 65%), though specificity remains high. Changing the LLN based on the pre-bronchodilator spirometry with an added constant improves the characteristic of the tests overall and the Youden's index is above 0.95 for all measures. Table 8 gives the sensitivity and specificity of using the pre-bronchodilator values and the pre-bronchodilator values adjusted with a fixed constant when compared with the gold standard of using the post-bronchodilator values when using the fixed cut off of 70% as the criterion for a low FEV1/FVC. In this case adding a constant lowers Youden's Index and sensitivity, but increases the specificity of the test.

Second, if the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio is between 0.60 and 0.80 on a single spirometric measurement, this should be confirmed by repeat spirometry on a separate occasion, as in some cases the ratio may change as a result of biological variation when measured at a later interval. When the initial post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio is < 0.6, it is very unlikely to rise spontaneously above 0.7.

Third, there is a long-standing debate on whether it is better to use a fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio of < 0.7 or the lower limit of normal (LLN) for the diagnosis of COPD. GOLD favors the use of the former because it is simple and independent of reference values, since it relates to variables measured in the same individual and has been used in all the clinical trials that form the evidence base on which treatment recommendations are drawn. GOLD 2023 acknowledges that use of a fixed FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7 to define airflow obstruction may underdiagnose young adults and overdiagnose the elderly, especially in mild disease, compared to using the LLN values of FEV 1 /FVC. LLN values are based on the normal distribution and classify the bottom 5% of the healthy population as abnormal. Thus, LLN values are highly dependent on the choice of reference equations as well as race/ethnicity, and there are no longitudinal studies available validating the use of the LLN. Further, using the fixed ratio is not inferior to LLN regarding prognosis. Finally, the risk of misdiagnosis and overtreatment of individual patients using the fixed ratio as a diagnostic criterion is limited, as spirometry is only one biological measurement to establish the clinical diagnosis of COPD in the appropriate clinical context (symptoms and risk factors). Diagnostic simplicity and consistency are crucial for the busy clinician.

### A randomised dose-ranging study of tiotropium respimat® in children with symptomatic asthma despite inhaled corticosteroids [^117V1BbK]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Patients' baseline asthma characteristics are summarised in Table 2. At screening, mean pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 values (± standard deviation: 1.539 ± 0.385 L, 1.909 ± 0.469 L) were 79.7% and 98.9% of predicted normal, respectively. Mean reversibility with bronchodilator use (% of pre-bronchodilator) was 370 ± 171 mL (24.6%). At baseline, mean FEV 1 was 1.640 ± 0.386 L (85.4% of predicted normal), with 29.7% of patients having an FEV 1 value > 90% of predicted normal.

FEV 1, forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC, forced vital capacity; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; PEF, peak expiratory flow; SD, standard deviation.

Efficacy

For the primary efficacy end point, statistically significant differences in peak FEV 1(0–3h) response after 4 weeks of treatment were observed for each tiotropium Respimat® dose group versus placebo Respimat® (Figure 2). The adjusted mean differences between tiotropium Respimat® 5 μg, 2.5 μg and 1.25 μg versus placebo Respimat® were 87 mL (p = 0.0002), 104 mL (p < 0.0001) and 75 mL (p = 0.0011), respectively. There was no dose-dependent response observed in patients treated with tiotropium Respimat®, with only minor, non-statistically significant differences between the different doses in peak FEV 1(0–3h) response after 4 weeks of treatment.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^11247HZs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The criteria for grading BDR, whether based on FEV 1 or FVC, and establishing a positive BDR warrant careful consideration. It was reasoned that a positive BDR could be defined as a ∆FEV 1(%PN) or ∆FVC (%PN) exceeding values observed in patients with a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC within the predicted normal range. In the subset of patients meeting this criterion (i.e. having a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC > 80% of predicted normal), 14.0% and 10.0% exceeded two standard deviations above the mean for %∆FEV (%PN) %∆FVC (%PN), respectively. Assuming that this BDR reflects reversal of the "normal" bronchomotor tone, we propose defining a positive BDR as a ≥ 14% increase in ∆FEV 1(%PN) or ≥ 10% increase in ∆FVC (%PN), irrespective of absolute changes in liters or pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC. Tan et al. reported BDR in 3,922 healthy subjects and found a mean ∆FEV 1(%PN) of 10% (upper 95%CI: 10.5) and 9.2% (upper 95%CI: 10.5) for %∆FVC (%PN). Based on these data, recent ERS/ATS recommendations define a positive BDR as a ∆FEV 1(%PN) or ∆FVC (%PN) of > 10%. However, this recommendation has not previously been validated in patients with airflow obstruction. The current study, conducted on a large cohort of patients from a tertiary care setting, demonstrates that applying the normalized BDR method reduces bias introduced by pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and FVC. Regarding the definition of a positive BDR, the data herein support a ∆FEV 1(%PN) ≥ 14% or ∆FVC (%PN) ≥ 10% in agreement with the recent ERS/ATS standards for FVC but not for FEV 1 (> 10% for the ERS/ATS and ≥ 14% in the current study). The difference could relate to the respective method of data analysis. The ERS/ATS definitions are based on data obtained in healthy non-smokers irrespective of pre-bronchodilator values whereas we obtained our limits in patients with pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and FVC values > 80% of predicted normal, possibly including patients with mild airflow obstruction The application of the recent ERS/ATS standards for assessing the BDR has been tested in patients with established medical diagnoses to understand its impact on clinical practice. Li et al. demonstrated that the new ERS/ATS approach to assessing BDR better differentiated between COPD and asthma than previous ERS/ATS standards. Furthermore, Chaiwong et al. found that in the clinical characterization of obstructive lung disease the previous and recent ERS/ATS standards can be used interchangeably. Finally, Beasley et al. suggested that either definition of a positive bronchodilator response has a minor role in the diagnosis of obstructive lung disease. In contrast, using the recent ERS/ATS standards may have therapeutic implications in children with asthma. Perhaps the definition of a positive bronchodilator response proposed in the current manuscript may be more discriminatory in the classification of patients with obstructive lung disease.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113eRQyK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to classify airflow obstruction severity based on post-bronchodilator FEV1 (in patients with FEV1/FVC < 0.70), as follows:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|GOLD 1 (mild)|- ≥ 80% of predicted|
|GOLD 2 (moderate)|- 50–79% of predicted|
|GOLD 3 (severe)|- 30–49% of predicted|
|GOLD 4 (very severe)|- < 30% of predicted.|

### Predictive value of prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry for COPD features and outcomes [^116Q5GSW]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

COPD prevalence is lower when postbronchodilator spirometry is used compared with when prebronchodilator spirometry is used. In the absence of a true 'gold standard' for COPD diagnosis, the utility of a diagnostic test depends on whether it can predict outcomes or change disease management. Previous studies showed conflicting results regarding the ability of prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry in predicting mortality. Whether postbronchodilator spirometry is superior to prebronchodilator spirometry to predict outcomes other than mortality has not been studied. We hypothesised that prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometries are associated with COPD features and predict outcomes with the same accuracy.

Subjects with significant hyperinflation, and therefore with more dyspnoea, may have a reduced prebronchodilator FVC and a normal FEV 1 /FVC ratio. Because FVC increase is more common than FEV 1 increase after bronchodilator, postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 (POSTO) may be more sensitive to diagnose symptomatic patients with clinically significant hyperinflation than prebronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 (PREO). Therefore, it is critical to examine whether subjects with PREO and no AFO in postbronchodilator spirometry (POSTN) would have more clinical, functional and radiographic COPD features than subjects with POSTO and no AFO in prebronchodilator spirometry (PREN). Do clinical, functional and radiographic features differ between subjects with PREO and POSTN and subjects with PREN and POSTO?

We compared the predictive value of prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.7 and FEV 1% predicted for chronic bronchitis, dyspnoea, exercise capacity and COPD radiographic findings at phase 1 (baseline); respiratory exacerbations, change in dyspnoea, FEV 1 and exercise capacity from phase 1 to phase 2 visit (about 5 years apart); and mortality. We also examined whether subjects with discordance in prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry have different clinical, functional and radiographic features.

### Estimating the U.S. prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry: the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 [^115SWNoe]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Spirometry measurements can be used to define COPD, specifically the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. Accordingly, the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) standards for the diagnosis and management of patients with COPD state that spirometry should be performed in all patients suspected of COPD and is necessary for diagnosis, assessment of disease severity, and monitoring disease progression.

Recent estimates based on self-reported data show that 15 million Americans aged 18 years and older have been diagnosed with COPD. Estimating the prevalence of COPD can, however, be challenging and may vary based on the diagnostic method (e.g. self-report or spirometry), the criteria used for defining COPD (e.g. GOLD, ATS/ERS), and the age group analyzed (e.g. 18 years and older or 40 years and older). Estimates will also vary if pre-bronchodilator or post-bronchodilator spirometry results are used with the GOLD guidelines advocating the use of post-bronchodilator spirometry while the ATS/ERS guidelines support the use of pre-bronchodilator spirometry. The GOLD criteria with the fixed cutoff may be simpler to use in daily clinical practice, however, studies suggest that it overestimates disease burden in the elderly. While the ATS/ERS guidelines may be better suited to capture age-related decline in pulmonary function, their use is more computationally intensive and requires appropriate, population-based, reference equations for the interpretation of pulmonary function tests.

During 2007–2010, the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted a spirometry component which obtained pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator pulmonary lung function data on survey participants 6–79 years of age. Data on respiratory symptoms and diseases were also collected. These data offer a unique opportunity to examine multiple approaches to estimating the prevalence of COPD in a large nationally representative sample.

The main objectives of this study were 1) to estimate the prevalence of COPD in the United States based on pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements and according to the operational definitions in the two major published guidelines: ATS/ERS and GOLD and 2) to examine the potential impact of nonresponse on the estimated prevalence.

### Annual rates of change in pre-vs. post-bronchodilator FEV1 and FVC over 4 years in moderate to very severe COPD [^112dM9PH]. Respiratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

While the slope of decline in FEV1 has traditionally been calculated from the post- rather than the pre-bronchodilator measurement in COPD interventional trials, it is not clear whether and to what extent these two slopes differ in symptomatic patients with COPD. Therefore, we used data from the 4-year UPLIFT trial of tiotropium 18 mcg QD vs. placebo to compare annual rates of change in pre- vs. post-bronchodilator FEV1 in 5041 patients with moderate to very severe COPD (mean FEV1 48% pred) in whom the post-bronchodilator FEV1 was measured after 4 inhalations of two different classes of short-acting inhaled bronchodilators at baseline and 1 month and every 6 months post-randomization over 4 years. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate annual rates of decline in FEV1 and FVC pre- and post-bronchodilator in each treatment group separately, after adjusting for height, gender, smoking status, baseline % predicted FEV1 or FVC, and baseline acute % improvement in lung function. The slopes of the post-bronchodilator FEV1 and FVC were significantly steeper than the pre-bronchodilator slopes regardless of treatment arm (p < 0.001), while the estimated variances of the slopes were similar. Post-bronchodilator increases in FEV1 and FVC diminished progressively and significantly (p < 0.0001) over the 4-year trial, suggesting a possible explanation for the significant differences between the pre- and post-bronchodilator slopes. While the reasons for these differences are not completely clear, they are important to consider when assessing treatment effects on rates of decline in FEV1 and FVC.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^117UnbPW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society spirometry — EOFE indicator based on repeatability — applies when the patient cannot expire long enough to achieve a plateau; in this case, the measure of whether EOFE has been reached is for the patient to repeatedly achieve the same FVC, and for within‑maneuver acceptability, the FVC must be greater than, or within the repeatability tolerance of the largest FVC observed before this maneuver in the current testing set. If the first maneuver of either the prebronchodilator or post‑bronchodilator testing set does not have a plateau and FET < 15 seconds, it provisionally meets this EOFE criterion for acceptability, becoming acceptable if it is within the repeatability tolerance, or if is greater than, a subsequent FVC.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^111BSwUT]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by post-bronchodilator spirometry. Data on "normal values" come predominantly from pre-bronchodilator spirometry. The effects of this on diagnosis are unknown.

Methods

Lower limits of normal (LLN) were estimated from "normal" participants in the Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) programme. Values separately derived using pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry were compared. Sensitivity and specificity of criteria derived from pre-bronchodilator spirometry and pre-bronchodilator spirometry adjusted by a constant were assessed in the remaining population. The "gold standard" was the LLN for the post-bronchodilator spirometry in the "normal population". For FEV1/FVC, sensitivity and specificity of criteria were also assessed when a fixed value of < 70% was used rather than LLN.

Results

Of 6,600 participants with full data, 1,354 were defined as "normal". Mean differences between pre- and post- bronchodilator measurements were small and the Bland-Altman plots showed no association between difference and mean value. Compared with using the gold standard, however, tests using pre-bronchodilator spirometry had a sensitivity and specificity of detecting a low FEV1 of 78.4% and 100%, a low FVC of 99.8% and 99.1% and a low FEV1/FVC ratio of 65% and 100%. Adjusting this by a constant improved the sensitivity without substantially altering the specificity for FEV1 (99%, 99.8%), FVC (97.4%, 99.9%) and FEV1/FVC (98.7%, 99.5%).

Conclusions

Using pre-bronchodilator spirometry to derive norms for lung function reduces sensitivity compared to a post-bronchodilator gold standard. Adjustment of these values by a constant can improve validity of the test.

### The effect of bronchodilators on forced vital capacity measurement in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [^115uc6C2]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a key measure of disease severity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and is an important clinical trial endpoint. We hypothesize that reversible airflow limitation co-exists in a subgroup of patients with IPF, and that bronchodilator use will improve the performance characteristics of FVC.

Methods

IPF patients with pre and post-bronchodilator spirometry testing performed were identified from two tertiary referral cohorts. The difference between pre and post-bronchodilator FVC (intra-test difference) was calculated. The test characteristics of pre and post-bronchodilator FVC change over time (inter-test difference) were assessed in patients with sequential spirometry, and were used to generate sample size estimates for hypothetical clinical trials using change in FVC as the primary endpoint.

Results

There were 551 patients, contributing 967 unique spirometry tests. The mean intra-test increase in FVC with bronchodilator use was 0.04 L (2.71 vs. 2.75 L, p < 0.001). Reversible airflow limitation (increase in FEV1 or FVC of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL) occurred in 9.1% of patients. The inter-test difference in change in FVC over time were equivalent for pre and post-bronchodilator (p = 0.65), leading to similar sample size estimates in a hypothetical clinical trial using change in FVC as the primary endpoint.

Conclusion

Approximately one in ten patients with IPF has physiological evidence of reversible airflow limitation, and bronchodilator use in these patients may improve the assessment of disease progression based on FVC change over time. Bronchodilator use does not appear to meaningfully impact the precision of FVC as an endpoint in clinical trials.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114QXf45]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis and classification — recommendation and spirometric confirmation: We suggest post-bronchodilator spirometry to confirm clinical diagnosis of COPD (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Expiratory flow obstruction is confirmed by presence of FEV1/FVC less than 70% or less than lower limit of normal (LLN) based upon age appropriate cut-offs in post-bronchodilator spirometry, and post-bronchodilator spirometry improves the accuracy of COPD diagnosis over pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Evidence suggests that a post-bronchodilator ratio of FEV1/FVC less than 70% is acceptable confirmation of the presence of COPD in older patients without a prior history of asthma; however, clinicians must use caution when applying this criteria to elderly patients because FEV1/FVC less than 70% can be a normal part of aging, and using lower FEV1/FVC threshold may exclude more patients from being considered as "obstructed" and therefore diminish the sensitivity but increase the specificity. Reversibility to acute inhalation of short-acting bronchodilators may vary in repeated testing in COPD patients, the absence of acute reversibility after treatment with a bronchodilator may not predict response to long-term pharmacotherapy, and thus, reversibility testing should not be used to gauge the potential benefits of treatment. The Work Group decided upon a Weak for recommendation.

Spirometry reporting and data interoperability — The ATS standardized report form should be the default report form for spirometry systems, and the default set of reference values for all ages should be the GLI reference equations; in addition to summary reports, the interpreter should have access to a report of all maneuvers within a testing session. The flow and/or volume data from each test session must be available for expert audit, and the system should have the capability to export data to electronic medical records as .pdf and discrete data using HL7 Clinical Document Architecture Release 2 or Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes should be used. The date and time for each maneuver must be recorded because diurnal variations of 3% in FEV1 and 6% in PEF have been reported, and the time and date are useful for verifying pre- and post-bronchodilator maneuvers. Operator comments are a key part of the report.

### Pre-and post-bronchodilator lung function as predictors of mortality in the lung health study [^113HKLig]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

This analysis examined data from the Lung Health Study to determine whether post-bronchodilator lung function predicts mortality. Overall, we found that the pre- and post-bronchodilator measures of lung function, whether used categorically (as stages of COPD) or continuously (as FEV 1% predicted) predicted mortality similarly. This finding suggests that post-bronchodilator lung function data may not be needed for studies that look at long term outcomes in COPD.

Most guidelines defining COPD say that spirometry should be performed after the administration of an adequate dose of an inhaled bronchodilator in order to minimize variability. These same guidelines, however, state that "neither bronchodilator nor oral glucocorticosteroid reversibility testing predicts disease progression, whether judged by decline in FEV 1, deterioration of health status, or frequency of exacerbations in patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD and abnormal spirometry. Small changes in FEV 1 (e.g. < 400 ml) after administration of a bronchodilator do not reliably predict the patient's response to treatment". Others have suggested that one cannot use prebronchodilator lung function to define COPD, the reason being that airflow limitation can be variable and that this component can be easily reverse with a bronchodilator. Other research, though, has suggested that bronchodilator responsiveness is highly variable and that "over half the patients initially classified as reversible by the ATS/GOLD definition would be reclassified had they attended on another occasion".

### Can we use lung function thresholds and respiratory symptoms to identify pre-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? A prospective, population-based cohort study [^111TJMh3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The term "pre-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" ("pre-COPD") refers to individuals at high risk of developing COPD who do not meet conventional spirometric criteria for airflow obstruction. New approaches to identifying these individuals are needed, particularly in younger populations. Objectives: To determine whether lung function thresholds and respiratory symptoms can be used to identify individuals at risk of developing COPD. Methods: The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study comprises a population-based cohort first studied in 1968 (at age 7yr). Respiratory symptoms, pre- and post-bronchodilator (BD) spirometry, diffusing capacity, and static lung volumes were measured in a subgroup at age 45, and the incidence of COPD was assessed at age 53. For each lung function measure, z -scores were calculated using Global Lung Function Initiative references. The optimal threshold for best discrimination of COPD incidence was determined by the unweighted Youden index. Measurements and Main Results: Among 801 participants who did not have COPD at age 45, the optimal threshold for COPD incidence by age 53 was pre-BD FEV 1 /FVC z -score less than -1.264, corresponding to the lowest 10 th percentile. Those below this threshold had a 36-fold increased risk of developing COPD over an 8-year follow-up period (risk ratio, 35.8; 95% confidence interval, 8.88 to 144), corresponding to a risk difference of 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 67.4). The sensitivity was 88%, and the specificity was 87%. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.79 and 0.14, respectively. Respiratory symptoms, post-BD spirometry, diffusing capacity, and static lung volumes did not improve on the classification achieved by pre-BD FEV 1 /FVC alone. Conclusions: This is the first study, to our knowledge, to evaluate the discriminatory accuracy of spirometry, diffusing capacity, and static lung volume thresholds for COPD incidence in middle-aged adults. Our findings support the inclusion of pre-BD spirometry in the physiological definition of pre-COPD and indicate that pre-BD FEV 1 /FVC at the 10th percentile accurately identifies individuals at high risk of developing COPD in community-based settings.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^114Ea2fD]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The misclassification in BDR among patients with a low or high pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC value has been previously documented in the COPDGene study. In that study, the percent change in FEV 1 using the pre-bronchodilator values [∆FEV 1(%Pre−B)] aligned with the absolute change in FEV 1 (∆FEV 1) only at a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 of approximately 1 L. At that degree of airflow obstruction, ∆FEV 1(%Pre−B) and ∆FEV 1 were 16% and 0.16 L, respectively. As anticipated, these two parameters (i.e. ∆FEV 1(%Pre−B) and ∆FEV 1) diverged significantly at lower and higher pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 values. The authors of that study suggested that the magnitude of the BDR is best assessed by ∆FEV 1 and proposed defining a positive BDR as a ∆FEV 1 > 0.16 L, irrespective of the corresponding ∆FEV 1(%Pre−B). However, this approach neglects inter-individual differences in the predicted normal FEV 1. For example, a ∆FEV 1 of 0.16 L in a patient with a predicted normal FEV 1 of 3 L cannot be equated with the same ∆FEV 1 change in a person with a predicted normal FEV 1 of 4 L. Furthermore, the data were obtained among patients with COPD, excluding other forms of obstructive lung disease including asthma, limiting the generalizability of the results.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113d5NE3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Post-bronchodilator spirometry and reversibility testing — practice guidance: Post-bronchodilator spirometry is required for the diagnosis and assessment of COPD, but assessing the degree of reversibility of airflow obstruction (e.g., measuring FEV1 before and after bronchodilator or corticosteroids) to inform therapeutic decisions is no longer recommended because the degree of reversibility in a single patient varies over time and has not been shown to differentiate the diagnosis from asthma or to predict the response to long-term treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids; accordingly, it is not necessary to stop inhaled medication before obtaining spirometry measurements during follow-up of patients.

Grading the quality of the test session — The ATS-recommended system "should be used", with Grade "U" added to denote "usable" values, and FEV1 and FVC graded separately; grading applies to the set of prebronchodilator maneuvers as a whole and is determined separately for the set of post-bronchodilator maneuvers. The grading system informs the interpreter about confidence that results reflect the best patient effort at the time and the probability of achieving an equivalent value if repeated. Although results below grade A may still be clinically useful, "the overriding goal of the operator must be to always achieve the best possible testing quality for each patient", and operators should explain that the grade reflects blow consistency rather than lung health.

Bronchodilator responsiveness testing — procedure and system safeguards: the standard uses the term "bronchodilator responsiveness testing"; the patient first performs prebronchodilator spirometry to achieve three acceptable FEV1 and FVC measurements, then "Three or more additional post-bronchodilator acceptable FEV1 and FVC measurements are then obtained after the wait time specified in the facility protocol", and "Every facility conducting bronchodilator responsiveness testing must have a written protocol for the test"; to prevent mislabeling and premature measurement, "the system must display the time elapsed since the last prebronchodilator maneuver" and "must provide a warning message to the operator" if the elapsed time is less than the required wait time.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^114QoimJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

To assess and compare the BDR in FEV 1 and FVC relative to the pre-bronchodilator or predicted normal values, bivariate scatter plots were used. Subgroup analyses on BDR were undertaken in a subset of patients with a Δ0.2 L change in FEV 1 (N = 213). Comparisons of ∆FEV 1(%Pre−B) to %ΔFEV 1(%PN) and ∆FVC (%Pre−B) to %ΔFVC (%PN) were conducted as a function of the pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 in all patients and the subset of patients with a ≥ 0.2 L change in FEV 1. In addition, analyses were also conducted in a subgroup of patients with a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FVC > 80% of predicted normal (N = 462). All analyses were conducted using Stata 17.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).

### Post-pulmonary tuberculosis lung function: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114uaava]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

Although post-tuberculosis lung disease poses a substantial threat to individuals who have recovered from pulmonary tuberculosis, data showing objective functional impairment in such people are scarce. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate respiratory impairment after pulmonary tuberculosis disease and examine differences in ventilatory defects.

Methods

We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, and CINAHL from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 13, 2024. We included any study design with data on lung function tests in individuals with a previous diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis versus healthy controls. Outcomes extracted from eligible studies included forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 as a percentage of the predicted value (FEV 1%), FVC as a percentage of the predicted value (FVC%), and FEV 1 /FVC ratio. Pre-bronchodilator values were preferentially selected. Random effects mean difference models were used when possible and standardised mean difference where it was necessary to standardise to a single scale (ie, FEV 1%, FVC%, and FEV 1 /FVC ratio). Between-study heterogeneity was estimated with I 2. This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021248838).

Findings

Of the 5594 publications found, data from 19 studies were included for meta-analyses, reporting on 75960 individuals of whom 7447 had past pulmonary tuberculosis. All studies reporting absolute values, using various levels of adjustment or standardisation, showed that previous pulmonary tuberculosis had a negative effect across all spirometric values: FEV 1–0·41 L (95% CI -0·51 to -0·32, I² = 90·4%), FVC -0·25 L (-0·33 to -0·17, I² = 80·6%), and FEV 1 /FVC ratio -0·37 (-0·54 to -0·19, I² = 92·0%). In those studies, using reference values to derive FEV 1% and FVC %, prior pulmonary tuberculosis had a pooled standardised mean difference of -0·44 (-0·60 to -0·28, I² = 95·6%) and -0·33 (-0·54 to -0·13, I² = 91·3%), respectively, compared with controls.

Interpretation

People who recover from pulmonary tuberculosis have significantly decreased lung function compared with controls, with FEV 1 more affected than FVC, giving a mixed obstructive and restrictive picture with predominantly airflow obstruction.

Diagnostic criteria — spirometry confirms COPD when, in the appropriate clinical context, there is non‑fully reversible airflow obstruction defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7 post‑bronchodilation; individuals with structural or physiological abnormalities without airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 post‑bronchodilation) are labeled Pre‑COPD, and the term PRISm (Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry) has been proposed for those with a normal ratio but abnormal spirometry; subjects with Pre‑COPD or PRISm are at risk of developing airflow obstruction over time, but not all do.

### Differences in spirometry interpretation algorithms: influence on decision making among primary-care physicians [^113J1Kbj]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Differences in interpretation were also encountered when the pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio was less than 0.70 with a FEV 1 increase of greater than 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator challenge. When participants were asked to interpret case 4 using algorithm 1, 72% of individuals selected 'suspect asthma'. Applying algorithm 2, however, 77% selected 'asthma versus COPD' and only 13% selected 'consistent with asthma'. Similar results can also be seen in cases 5, 7 and 8, which share spirometric resemblance to case 4. The reliance of changes in FEV 1 after bronchodilator challenge to distinguish asthma from COPD in algorithm 1 led to consideration of asthma despite the presence of data that were also consistent with COPD.

Last, differences were also observed when the pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio was less than 0.70 with a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio > 0.70. Two cases fall under this category: cases 3 and 9. Using both algorithms 1 and 2, the majority of participants agreed that the spirograms were consistent with asthma for both cases. When participants interpreted case 3 and case 9 using algorithm 1, 21 and 33% suspected COPD and 71 and 57% suspected asthma, respectively. This was not the case with algorithm 2, in which a higher portion of participants suspected asthma (83 and 87%) and fewer individuals considered COPD.

Multiple regression analysis of the risk factors that were significant after adjusting for age, sex, height, and height-squared indicated that post-bronchodilator FVC was lower in those with increased waist circumference (− 172 ml), Indo-Caribbean participants (− 180 ml) and those who were underweight (− 185 ml), and higher in those who smoked cannabis (+ 155 ml) (Table 4).

Risk factors for low pre-bronchodilator FVC were of similar significance to those for post-bronchodilator FVC except that indoor air pollution and levels of education were related to pre-bronchodilator FVC but not to post-bronchodilator FVC (Tables 3, 4 and Additional file 1: Table S2).

Statistical methods

Data from all randomized patients with acceptable pre- and post-bronchodilator measurements at baseline were included in this analysis. A mixed-effects model with repeated measurements analysis of variance was utilized to determine the rate of change in spirometry variables. Data sets were restricted to patients with ≥ 3 post-randomization spirometry test sets for calculation of annualized rate of decline in FEV 1, FVC, and SVC, and to patients with ≥ 1 post-randomization spirometry test set for calculation of annualized rate of decline in IC and FEV 6. IC at baseline was divided into approximate quartiles using the cut points of 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 L. Hazard ratios for the risk of an exacerbation and for mortality were calculated using Cox regression.

### Pre-and post-bronchodilator lung function as predictors of mortality in the lung health study [^114zGDvH]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Burrows acknowledged the complexity of the relation between bronchodilator responsiveness and outcomes in obstructive lung disease. He noted that different studies had varying results and suggested that several factors, such as how baseline lung function is determined, how responsiveness is measured, and the prevalence of "asthma" in the studied population, may be important determinants of outcomes. His conclusion that mortality is "related to age and to a low initial post-bronchodilator FEV 1 " provides, in part, the historic rationale for using post-bronchodilator lung function to define COPD.

This study has limitations that are important to its interpretation. The most important was that it was not a true "population-based" study but was a clinical intervention trial that targeted early COPD. Study participants had to be current smokers at entry with lung function that was mildly abnormal, and subjects who regularly used bronchodilators were excluded. Although asthma history was not a specific exclusion criterion, excluding people with regular bronchodilator use had the net effect of eliminating subjects with clinically significant asthma from the population. Thus, these findings may not necessarily apply to a population that includes never smokers or where a large proportion of the population has asthma that is symptomatic. Also, a more inclusive population of smokers where reversibility is more common may have yielded different results. This limitation is decreased by our study design that looked at data from the year 1 and year 5 follow-up, at which point some subjects had stopped smoking and many developed symptoms consistent with asthma or COPD. In addition, one would not expect the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 of never smokers (in the absence of asthma) to differ significantly from the pre-bronchodilator value. Finally, the dose of bronchodilator used in this study (two inhalations, 200-μg total dose, of isoproterenol) is less than what has been used in other clinical trials, some of which have used 400 μg of isoproterenol and 400 μg of albuterol. Thus, it is unknown whether the findings would be similar if a "maximal bronchodilitation" protocol was used.

Another limitation was the absence of other important measures of COPD, such as an impaired exercise testing, impaired diffusion capacity or abnormal imaging. Recent work in COPD has highlighted that measures other than lung function are important predictors of impaired function and poor outcomes. Lung function remains, however, the primary means of diagnosing and classifying COPD at the present time and this is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.

### Bronchodilator responsiveness in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: time to stop chasing shadows [^112a6VUa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent publications have reexamined what degree of change constitutes a positive bronchodilator response and whether this should be based on an absolute or relative value. In reality, the criteria used to define a positive response, whether absolute or relative, or in the FEV 1 or FVC or both, are essentially arbitrary. Attempts have been made to validate criteria on the basis that they are greater than the response seen in, for example, 95% of healthy individuals, but there is little difference in the proportion of healthy individuals and people with airflow obstruction who show a positive response. Moreover, the response to a bronchodilator has been shown to be highly variable both between and within individuals and to decline over time.

From a diagnostic point of view, whether or not the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 or FEV 1 /FVC ratio fall in the normal range is more relevant than the magnitude of the change, as a normal post-bronchodilator ratio excludes a diagnosis of COPD on current criteria. It is more logical, therefore, to abandon the concept of a "reversibility test" with a "positive" or "negative" result and focus on the post-bronchodilator values achieved. Larger FEV 1 responses are seen if both a β agonist and an antimuscarinic bronchodilator are administered, but the optimum doses and interval between administering the drugs and performing the post-bronchodilator measurements has not been determined. Patients taking long-acting bronchodilators are usually asked to withhold these before testing the acute bronchodilator response, but whether they do so or not is often in practice unknown, and some long-acting bronchodilators have effects that last more than 24 hours. Differences in the way reversibility has been assessed contribute to the wide differences in the reported prevalence of reversible disease in patients with COPD.

Airflow obstruction assessment — post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC thresholds: Assessment of the presence or absence of airflow obstruction based on a single measurement of the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio should be confirmed by repeat spirometry on a separate occasion if the value is between 0.6 and 0.8. If the initial post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.6 it is very unlikely to rise spontaneously above 0.7.

### Pulmonary function testing… [^111dsobc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- For many years, confusion has existed concerning the normal range for pulmonary function test results. Using statistical guidelines that have been traditionally applied to the interpretation of measured forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, we have redefined normal limits for the most common pulmonary function test values, including those for FVC, FEV1, mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the FVC, FEV1, as a proportion of FVC, residual volume, functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, diffusion capacity, maximum voluntary ventilation, and peak expiratory flow. Our goal is to provide a simple and consistent scheme for interpretation of pulmonary function test data. We consider the assumptions used to achieve this simplification to be reasonable, as long as their limitations are understood. Pennock BE, Cottrell JJ, Rogers RM.

### Office spirometry: indications and interpretation [^117NCPzZ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

High-quality, office-based spirometry provides diagnostic information as useful and reliable as testing performed in a pulmonary function laboratory. Spirometry may be used to monitor progression of lung disease and response to therapy. A stepwise approach to spirometry allows for ease and reliability of interpretation. Airway obstruction is suspected when there is a decreased forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, but there is no strong evidence to clearly define what constitutes a significant decrease in this ratio. A low FVC is defined as a value below the 5th percentile in adults or less than 80% of predicted in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FVC are used together to identify obstructive defects and restrictive or mixed patterns. Obstructive defects should be assessed for reversibility, as indicated by an improvement of the FEV1 or FVC by at least 12% and 0.2 L in adults, or by more than 12% in children and adolescents five to 18 years of age after the administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. FEV1 is used to determine the severity of obstructive and restrictive disease, although the values were arbitrarily determined and are not based on evidence from patient outcomes. Bronchoprovocation testing may be used if spirometry results are normal and allergen- or exercise-induced asthma is suspected. For patients with an FEV1 less than 70% of predicted, a therapeutic trial of a short-acting bronchodilator may be tried instead of bronchoprovocation testing.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113eVjqR]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain spirometry to establish the diagnosis of COPD by eliciting a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 confirming the presence of persistent airflow limitation.

### Argument for changing criteria for bronchodilator responsiveness [^116Eszwp]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Extensively used current guidelines of the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) define a positive aerosolized bronchodilator (BD) response as: "… an increase in FEV(1) and/or FVC ≥ 12% of control and ≥ 200 mL". We hypothesized that BD responsiveness was better assessed using a statistical approach, linked to each individual's spirometric measurements, rather than the variability of others.

Design

We retrospectively analyzed 1-year's pre- and post-BD spirometric tests from our hospital's clinical laboratory. Using measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1-s (FEV(1)), forced expiratory volume in 3-s (FEV(3)), and forced vital capacity (FVC) from each of three satisfactory forced pre-BD and three satisfactory forced post-BD spirometric maneuvers, we classified each of 313 consecutive patient studies as responders or non-responders in two ways. First, we used ATS/ERS guideline criteria based on population variability. Second, we used unpaired, single-tailed t-tests at P < 0.05 for FEV(1), FEV(3), and FVC, considering the variability of and difference between each individual's pre- and post-BD maneuvers.

Results

135 studies were both ATS/ERS and t-test non-responders, three were ATS/ERS responders and t-test non-responders, 86 were ATS/ERS and t-test responders, and 89 were ATS/ERS non-responders and t-test responders. The latter 89 included many patients with either low baseline FEV(1) (< 1.50 L) who could not reach the 200 mL increase criterion or high baseline FEV(1) (> 3.00 L) who could not reach the 12% increase criterion.

Conclusions

We believe individual t-tests may categorize patient's BD responsiveness better than ATS/ERS guideline criteria which are based on population responses and require both fixed volume and percentage changes. Its usefulness by others remains to be shown.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^114ckBAB]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

GOLD defines chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) in terms of post-bronchodilator lung function, but the data from which 'normal values' are derived are generally based on pre-bronchodilator lung function measures. Although some authors have provided local equations based on post-bronchodilator values or assessed differences when using bronchodilators, there is no general account of the systematic difference between the two measures. As "normal" values are derived from "normal" people without overt pathology, it might be anticipated that the differences would be small and possibly not clinically important. The Burden of Lung Disease (BOLD) Initiative was designed to develop methodology that can be used to estimate the prevalence and economic burden of COPD. BOLD is a survey of COPD among non-institutionalised adults aged 40 years and over. Study participants complete a questionnaire covering respiratory symptoms, health status, activity limitation, and exposure to potential risk factors, and perform pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry tests.

This analysis uses BOLD data to estimate the differences between pre- and post-bronchodilator measures and the lower limit of normal values (LLN) derived using either pre- or post-bronchodilator lung function measures in the same subjects. We also assessed the extent to which any differences varied by age, body mass index and height for males and females, separately, and the extent of misclassification using criteria based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry. For FEV1/FVC we also looked at the extent of misclassification using criteria based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry and defining airway obstruction by FEV1/FVC < 70% rather than < LLN.

### Long-term outcomes following first short-term clinically important deterioration in COPD [^1149SFxE]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design and treatments

The TORCH study (SCO30003, NCT00268216) was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study that assessed spirometric values, health status, frequency of exacerbations, and mortality in patients randomized to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 500/50 μg, FP 500 μg, SAL 50 μg, or placebo. The ECLIPSE study (SCO104960, NCT00292552) was a large, observational, longitudinal study of patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD aimed at defining COPD phenotypes and identifying biomarkers to help predict disease progression. Detailed methodologies for both studies have been previously published. Both studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines, and approved by the relevant ethics review committees. All participants gave written informed consent.

Patients

Patients with a diagnosis of COPD in the TORCH study were aged 40–80 years, current or former smokers with ≥ 10 smoking pack-years, had a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 < 60% of predicted value and a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio ≤ 0.70. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of asthma or respiratory disorders other than COPD, lung-volume reduction or lung transplant surgery, and receiving long-term oral corticosteroid therapy.

In the ECLIPSE study patients were aged 40–75 years, with baseline post-bronchodilator FEV 1 < 80% of predicted value, baseline post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ≤ 0.70, and ≥ 10 smoking pack-years. Exclusion criteria included known respiratory disorders other than COPD, history of other significant inflammatory disease, COPD exacerbation ≤ 4 weeks prior to enrollment, and prior lung surgery.

Table 2
Diagnosis of COPD and reversibility tests.

COPD according to the NICE, GOLD and ERS guidelines in 3887 smokers who were smoking more than 8 cigarettes per day at the time of the trial. The prevalence has been calculated using either FVC or the best of FVC and SVC. Figures in bold indicate the analysis which is recommended in the guidelines, respectively. The table is also showing reversibility after inhalation of 0.8 mg of salbutamol as percent of predicted value and as percent of pre-bronchodilator value.

Prior to bronchodilatation FVC was higher than SVC in the total groups of smokers (n = 3887) whereas the opposite was the case in those 1577 subjects who had a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /VC-ratio below 0.75 (figure 2). Bronchodilatation abolished this difference (figure 2). There was a fair, but not excellent, correlation (r = 0.57) between the difference between SVC and FVC corrected for the VC level when pre- and post-bronchodilator values were compared (figure 3). Pre-bronchodilator SVC was higher than FVC in those with the lowest pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 while the opposite was found in those with normal FEV 1 (figure 4A). This was obvious prior to bronchodilatation (total group) but remained when analyses of post-bronchodilator values were analysed in those with a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /VC ratio below 0.75 (figure 4B).

### Estimating the U.S. prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry: the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 [^111kZm4y]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During 2007–2010, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted a spirometry component which obtained pre-bronchodilator pulmonary lung function data on a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 6–79 years and post-bronchodilator pulmonary lung function data for the subset of adults with airflow limitation. The goals of this study were to 1) compute prevalence estimates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements and fixed ratio and lower limit of normal (LLN) diagnostic criteria and 2) examine the potential impact of nonresponse on the estimates.

Methods

This analysis was limited to those aged 40–79 years who were eligible for NHANES pre-bronchodilator spirometry (n = 7,104). Examinees with likely airflow limitation were further eligible for post-bronchodilator testing (n = 1,110). Persons were classified as having COPD based on FEV1/FVC < 70% (fixed ratio) or FEV1/FVC < lower limit of normal (LLN) based on person's age, sex, height, and race/ethnicity. Those without spirometry but self-reporting both daytime supplemental oxygen therapy plus emphysema and/or current chronic bronchitis were also classified as having COPD. The final analytic samples for pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator analyses were 77.1% (n = 5,477) and 50.8% (n = 564) of those eligible, respectively. To account for non-response, NHANES examination weights were adjusted to the eligible pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator subpopulations.

Results

In 2007–2010, using the fixed ratio criterion and pre-bronchodilator test results, COPD prevalence was 20.9% (SE 1.1) among US adults aged 40–79 years. Applying the same criterion to post-bronchodilator test results, prevalence was 14.0% (SE 1.0). Using the LLN criterion and pre-bronchodilator test results, the COPD prevalence was 15.4% (SE 0.8), while applying the same criterion to post-bronchodilator test results, prevalence was 10.2% (SE 0.8).

Conclusions

The overall COPD prevalence among US adults aged 40–79 years varied from 10.2% to 20.9% based on whether pre- or post-bronchodilator values were used and which diagnostic criterion (fixed ratio or LLN) was applied. The overall prevalence decreased by approximately 33% when airflow limitation was based on post-bronchodilator as compared to pre-bronchodilator spirometry, regardless of which diagnostic criterion was used.

Spirometry grading for FEV1 and FVC — repeatability thresholds and measurement counts are defined as follows: Grade A requires ≥ 3 acceptable with repeatability "Within 0.150 L" for Age > 6 yr or "Within 0.100 L" for Age ≤ 6 yr*; Grade B requires 2 acceptable with the same thresholds; Grade C requires ≥ 2 acceptable "Within 0.200 L" for Age > 6 yr or "Within 0.150 L" for Age ≤ 6 yr*; Grade D requires ≥ 2 acceptable "Within 0.250 L" for Age > 6 yr or "Within 0.200 L" for Age ≤ 6 yr*; Grade E is " ≥ 2 acceptable OR 1 acceptable" with " > 0.250 L" for Age > 6 yr or " > 0.200 L" for Age ≤ 6 yr*; Grade U is "0 acceptable AND ≥ 1 usable"; and Grade F is "0 acceptable and 0 usable". Repeatability grading is determined separately for pre- and post-bronchodilator maneuver sets, applied to the differences between the two largest FVC and the two largest FEV1 values, and FEV1 and FVC are graded separately; for those age 6 years or younger, limits are "Or 10% of the highest value, whichever is greater".

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117Dpbtm]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Spirometry — considerations in performing spirometry (Figure 2.4) state that forced spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow obstruction, and peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. Preparation includes that spirometers should produce hard copy or have a digital display of the expiratory curve to permit detection of technical errors or have an automatic prompt to identify an unsatisfactory test and the reason for it. During performance, the pause between inspiration and expiration should be less than one second, the recording should go on long enough for a volume plateau to be reached, which may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease, and both FVC and FEV1 should be the largest value obtained from any of three technically satisfactory curves and the FVC and FEV1 values in these three curves should vary by no more than 5% or 150 mL, whichever is greater; the FEV1/FVC ratio should be taken from the technically acceptable curve with the largest sum of FVC and FEV1. For bronchodilation testing, possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short-acting beta2-agonist, 160 mcg short-acting anticholinergic, or the two combined; FEV1 should be measured 10–15 minutes after a short-acting beta2-agonist is given, or 30–45 minutes after a short-acting anticholinergic or a combination of both classes of drugs, and patients already on bronchodilator treatment, in whom spirometry is requested for monitoring purposes do not need to stop their regular treatment for spirometry. For evaluation, spirometry measurements are evaluated by comparison of the results with appropriate reference values based on age, height and sex, and the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of non-fully reversible airflow obstruction.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^115Ckwqn]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

As expected, the observed value of lung function in a "normal" population changes little with the use of a bronchodilator and differences between centres were not significant. The case for the predicted and for the lower limit of normal is more complicated, although the mean difference is the same for the predicted as for the observed, by definition, and similar in magnitude for the lower limit of normal. This analysis has shown that, although the pre-bronchodilator lower limit of normal for the lung function test is a reasonable approximation to the lower limit of normal, using pre-bronchodilator norms substantially reduces the sensitivity of spirometry in identifying cases of chronic airflow limitation. Addition of a fixed amount provides an even more nearly approximate value to the true post-bronchodilator "normal" values, raising sensitivity to over 99%.

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^114dccBd]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Practice considerations — population and diagnostic definitions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — state that this recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms and does not apply to persons with a chronic cough, sputum production, difficulty breathing, or wheezing; a postbronchodilator spirometry ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 0.70 confirms the presence of persistent airflow obstruction and a diagnosis of COPD in persons with appropriate symptoms and significant exposures to noxious stimuli; airflow obstruction is classified by postbronchodilator FEV1% predicted as 80% or more is mild, 50% to 79% is moderate, 30% to 49% is severe, and less than 30% is very severe, and symptoms are categorized using scoring from standardized tools assessing symptom burden and history of exacerbations.

### COPD diagnosis related to different guidelines and spirometry techniques [^116PwkAd]. Respiratory Research (2007). Low credibility.

Definitions

The definitions and recommendations for defining COPD from the ERS consensus statement from 1995, the NICE guideline, and the GOLD guidelines were used to calculate the prevalence of COPD (table 1). In the NICE guidelines a FEV 1 < 80% of predicted value is required for a COPD diagnosis. To fulfil the COPD definition according to the ERS guidelines FEV 1 /VC has to be < 88% (men) or < 89% (women) of predicted value whereas a FEV1/VC ratio < 0.7 is required in NICE and GOLD recommendations. InNICE and GOLD guidelines only FVC is used while the best of FVC and SVC is used in the ERS recommendations. The ATS/ERS standards published in 2004 are identical to the GOLD guidelines in this context and are therefore not specifically considered.

Table 1
Definitions of COPD according to the ERS consensus statement, the NICE and the GOLD guidelines.

In the present study lung function was calculated after bronchodilatation, according to NICE, ERS and GOLD guidelines and FEV 1 /VC ratio was calculated by using only FVC or the best out of FVC and SVC. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm (reg.no. 98:044).

### Evaluating how post-bronchodilator vital capacities affect the diagnosis of obstruction in pulmonary function tests [^116NjEvL]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although the ratio of FEV 1 to the vital capacity (VC) is universally accepted as the cornerstone of pulmonary function test (PFT) interpretation, FVC remains in common use. We sought to determine what the differences in PFT interpretation were when the largest measured vital capacity (VC max) was used instead of the FVC.

Methods

We included 12,238 consecutive PFTs obtained for routine clinical care. We interpreted all PFTs first using FVC in the interpretation algorithm and then again using the VC max, obtained either before or after administration of inhaled bronchodilator.

Results

Six percent of PFTs had an interpretive change when VC max was used instead of FVC. The most common changes were: new diagnosis of obstruction and exclusion of restriction (previously suggested by low FVC without total lung capacity measured by body plethysmography). A nonspecific pattern occurred in 3% of all PFT interpretations with FVC. One fifth of these 3% produced a new diagnosis of obstruction with VC max. The largest factors predicting a change in PFT interpretation with VC max were a positive bronchodilator response and the administration of a bronchodilator. Larger FVCs decreased the odds of PFT interpretation change. Surprisingly, the increased numbers of PFT tests did not increase odds of PFT interpretation change.

Conclusions

Six percent of PFTs have a different interpretation when VC max is used instead of FVC. Evaluating borderline or ambiguous PFTs using the VC max may be informative in diagnosing obstruction and excluding restriction.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^112ZjJgF]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Further, for each lung function measurement from those who had been excluded because they had a smoking history, a diagnosis of a history of current respiratory symptoms, differences between pre- and post bronchodilator measures were entered into regression models with GOLD class (mild, moderate, severe or very severe) as a predictor to investigate whether there was association between the difference and the GOLD class.

Finally we used the observed post-bronchodilator ventilatory function from those who had been excluded because they had a smoking history, a diagnosis or a history of current respiratory symptoms to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of using the pre-bronchodilator LLN or the pre-bronchodilator LLN corrected by a constant which was the mean difference between the pre- and post-bronchodilator lower limits of normal. These were then compared with a gold standard of the LLN estimated directly from the post-bronchodilator ventilatory function. Further, for FEV1/FVC we also estimated sensitivity and specificity using the fixed value of 70% rather than LLN. In this case we considered the pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC or the pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC corrected by a constant which was the mean difference between the observed pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC. These were then compared to a gold standard of using the post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC. In addition to sensitivity and specificity we give Youden's Index, the sum of sensitivity and specificity −1, a summary validity score that has useful properties in some circumstances. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX USA).

Ethical approval for the study was given in each site before starting data collection and all participants signed a consent form after receiving details of the purpose and content of the study.

Conclusion

We found that is this cohort both pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function predicted mortality with similar accuracy. This validates the approach taken in a number of long-term studies where only prebronchodilator lung function is available, although studies that include similar data in never smokers and subjects with asthma are needed.

### Restrictive spirometric pattern in the general adult population: methods of defining the condition and consequences on prevalence [^113GPs4o]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Attempts have been made to use dynamic spirometry to define restrictive lung function, but the definition of a restrictive spirometric pattern (RSP) varies between studies such as BOLD and NHANES. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and risk factors of RSP among adults in northern Sweden based on different definitions.

Methods

In 2008–2009 a general population sample aged 21–86y within the obstructive lung disease in northern Sweden (OLIN) studies was examined by structured interview and spirometry, and 726 subjects participated (71% of invited). The prevalence of RSP was calculated according to three different definitions based on pre-as well as post-bronchodilator spirometry: 1) FVC < 80% & FEV 1 /FVC > 0.7 2) FVC < 80% & FEV 1 /FVC > LLN 3) FVC < LLN & FEV 1 /FVC > LLN RESULTS: The three definitions yielded RSP prevalence estimates of 10.5%, 11.2% and 9.4% respectively, when based on pre-bronchodilator values. The prevalence was lower when based on post-bronchodilator values, i.e. 7.3%, 7.9% and 6.6%. According to definition 1 and 2, the RSP prevalence increased by age, but not according to definition 3. The overlap between the definitions was substantial. When corrected for confounding factors, manual work in industry and diabetes with obesity were independently associated with an increased risk for RSP regardless of definition.

Conclusions

The prevalence of RSP was 7–11%. The prevalence estimates differed more depending on the choice of pre- compared to post-bronchodilator values than on the choice of RSP definition. RSP was, regardless of definition, independently associated with manual work in industry and diabetes with obesity.

### ARTP statement on pulmonary function testing 2020 [^112NBb3G]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Bronchodilator response

Rationale

The reasons for delivering a bronchodilator drug in the context of lung function testing may include the following:

To see if useful improvement in lung function can be achieved.
To record lung function post bronchodilator to see if airflow obstruction is still present.
To help confirm the presence of asthma.

It has been argued that asking the patient whether any useful improvement is achieved may be a better indicator than any particular test for assessing 'useful improvement'. However an improvement in FEV 1 by > 4% of the subject's predicted value has been found to be associated with useful improvement as assessed both by the subject and their peers.

Recording postbronchodilator spirometry has been recommended for determining if someone has COPD. The idea being that any 'reversible' component will then have been relieved and it would be reasonable to presume that any remaining obstruction would be 'fixed'. However bronchodilator response may be variable day to day so this is not entirely true.

There is debate about what degree of responsiveness would indicate the presence of asthma to distinguish it from other respiratory diseases. The result from short-term bronchodilator responsiveness alone is not a reliable method for making a diagnosis of asthma, as this clinical diagnosis is based on clinical examination and history together with diagnostic tests.

Methods

Depending on the purpose of the test, other bronchodilator drugs that the patient is taking may need to be stopped for an appropriate time prior to testing (see 'Withholding bronchodilators' section) so that the response to the bronchodilator being assessed can be determined.

Maximal forced expiratory manoeuvres are undertaken (as described in 'Spirometry' section) to record FEV 1, FVC, RVC and PEF preadministration and postadministration of a bronchodilator. The drug used may be salbutamol or terbutaline for a β 2 agonist and/or ipratropium bromide for an anticholinergic agent. Delivery may best be undertaken by supervising the use of a metered dose inhaler with a spacer device, but a nebuliser could be used alternatively. An appropriate delay after administration must occur to allow the drug to achieve maximum effect (15 min for a β 2 agonist and 30 min for an anticholinergic agent). Administration and dose of any prescribed medication should be covered by local protocol.

### Preserved ratio impaired spirometry is associated with small airway dysfunction and reduced total lung capacity [^113VphG4]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm) refers to decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) in the setting of preserved ratio. Little is known about the role of PRISm and its complex relation with small airway dysfunction (SAD) and lung volume. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between PRISm and SAD and lung volume.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional community-dwelling study in China. Demographic data, standard respiratory epidemiology questionnaire, spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS) and computed tomography (CT) data were collected. PRISm was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 0.70 and FEV 1 < 80% predicted. Spirometry-defined SAD was defined as at least two of three of the post-bronchodilator maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), forced expiratory flow 50% (FEF50), and forced expiratory flow 75% (FEF75) less than 65% of predicted. IOS-defined SAD and CT-defined gas trapping were defined by the fact that the cutoff value of peripheral airway resistance R5-R20 > 0.07 kPa/L/s and LAA -856 > 20%, respectively. Analysis of covariance and logistic regression were used to determine associations between PRISm and SAD and lung volume. We then repeated the analysis with a lower limit of normal definition of spirometry criteria and FVC definition of PRISm. Moreover, we also performed subgroup analyses in ever smoker, never smoker, subjects without airway reversibility or self-reported diagnosed asthma, and subjects with CT-measured total lung capacity ≥ 70% of predicted.

Results

The final analysis included 1439 subjects. PRISm had higher odds and more severity in spirometry-defined SAD (pre-bronchodilator: odds ratio [OR]: 5.99, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 3.87–9.27, P < 0.001; post-bronchodilator: OR: 14.05, 95%CI: 8.88–22.24, P < 0.001), IOS-defined SAD (OR: 2.89, 95%CI: 1.82–4.58, P < 0.001), and CT-air trapping (OR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.08–3.72, P = 0.027) compared with healthy control after adjustment for confounding factors. CT-measured total lung capacity in PRISm was lower than that in healthy controls (4.15 ± 0.98 vs. 4.78 ± 1.05 L, P < 0.05), after adjustment. These results were robust in repeating analyses and subgroup analyses.

Conclusion

Our finding revealed that PRISm was associated with SAD and reduced total lung capacity. Future studies to identify the underlying mechanisms and longitudinal progression of PRISm are warranted.

### Lung function impairment and the risk of incident dementia: the rotterdam study [^116qnBKk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Spirometry test

Lung function was assessed via pre-bronchodilator spirometry performed by trained paramedical personnel using a Master Screen PFT Pro (Care Fusion, Netherlands) according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines. Predicted FVC and predicted FEV 1 values were calculated using Global Lung Initiative (GLI) reference equations taking age, sex, height, and ethnicity into account. Based on these values, the following subgroups were defined: COPD (FEV 1 /FVC < 70%), PRISm (FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 70% and FEV 1 < 80% predicted), and normal spirometry (FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 70% and an FEV 1 ≥ 80% predicted) were distinguished. Spirometry was conducted in accordance with the ATS/ERS guidelines, with specific preparatory instructions, e.g. with respect to smoking or other factors. In order to guarantee the reliability and reproducibility, at least two spirometry tests were implemented on each participant, and the best reading was obtained. No specific preparatory instructions were given (e.g. related to smoking or other factors). The quartile categories of lung function parameters were derived from values in this study, which is similar to quintile subgroups in a previous study. For calculation of trending hazard ratio with 10% change in lung function, lung function parameters were included in cox models after being divided by 10. Airflow limitation was confirmed by the value of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC below 0.7.

Study population

The study population comprised male and female patients (40 to 80 years of age), who were current or former smokers with a history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking. Eligible patients were required to have a diagnosis of COPD as defined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society, with a severity defined as a pre- and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.70 at screening, and a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 ≥ 30% and < 80% of predicted normal and ≥ 750 mL at screening, and a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 < 80% of predicted normal at baseline. Laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening, and chest X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) scan performed within 6 months prior to screening, had to be deemed acceptable by the investigator for inclusion in the study.

### Estimating the U.S. prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry: the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 [^1159Lhc4]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Spirometry can be used to define COPD yet currently established guidelines (e.g. ATS/ERS and GOLD) differ in their recommendation for using spirometric measurements to do so. Specifically, the GOLD guidelines recommend using post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and ATS/ERS recommends pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < LLN. Applying both of these criteria to the 2007–2010 NHANES spirometry data, we found the prevalence of COPD in the U.S. for individuals aged 40 to 79 years to be 14.0% using the fixed ratio criterion with post-bronchodilator spirometry (GOLD) and 15.4% using the LLN criterion with pre-bronchodilator spirometry (ATS/ERS). Currently, no other published post-bronchodilator COPD prevalence estimates exist for the overall U.S. population. A similar study, conducted outside the U.S. which utilized fixed ratio, post-bronchodilator spirometry data in an aged 40+ population was the PLATINO study which found a 14.3% pooled prevalence across five Latin American cities. This is comparable to the estimated U.S. prevalence of 14.0% we found using fixed ratio, post-bronchodilator spirometry data in a population ages 40 to 79 years.

Examination of the differences between using pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator data revealed a reduction in COPD prevalence after bronchodilation, relative to before bronchodilation, of 33% using the fixed ratio criterion (pre-bronchodilator 21% vs. post-bronchodilator 14%) and 34% for the LLN criterion (pre-bronchodilator 15% vs. post-bronchodilator 10%). This puts our pre- to post-bronchodilator reduction estimates at the high end, but within, the 25–35% range of reductions in prevalence found in a number of other studies. This finding further strengthens the growing body of evidence that COPD prevalence rates computed using post-bronchodilator spirometry are likely to be 25–35% lower than those computed using pre-bronchodilator spirometry.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116QiQbz]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic criteria — In the appropriate clinical context, spirometry confirming non‑fully reversible airflow obstruction with FEV1/FVC < 0.7 post‑bronchodilation establishes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas individuals with symptoms, structural lesions, and/or physiological abnormalities without airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7 post‑bronchodilation) are labeled Pre‑COPD; the term PRISm identifies those with a preserved ratio but abnormal spirometry, and subjects with Pre‑COPD or PRISm are at risk of developing airflow obstruction over time, but not all of them do.

### Post-bronchodilator spirometry reference values in adults and implications for disease management [^112PczKB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

International guidelines promote the use of post-bronchodilator spirometry values in the definition and severity classification of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, post-bronchodilator reference values have not yet been developed.

Objectives

To derive reference values for post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC, and to compare these reference values with locally derived and existing pre-bronchodilator reference values.

Methods

Based on a random sample of a general adult population, 2,235 subjects (70% of invited subjects) performed spirometry with reversibility testing. A reference population of healthy never-smokers constituted 23% of the study population (n = 515). Reference values for median and lower-limit-of-normal pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function and bronchodilator response were modeled using quantile regression analyses.

Main Results

The reference population had equal proportions of men and women in the age range 26–82 yr. Both FEV1 and FVC decreased with age and increased with height. FEV1/FVC decreased with age, although this trend was not statistically significant for men after bronchodilatation. Linear models gave the best overall fit. Lower-limit-of-normal post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC exceeded 0.7 for both sexes. Post-bronchodilator prediction equations gave higher predicted FEV1 and FEV1/FVC than both locally derived and existing pre-bronchodilator equations. The bronchodilator response decreased with age.

Conclusions

The present study is the first to develop reference values for post-bronchodilator lung function. Post-bronchodilator prediction equations can facilitate better management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by avoiding falsely high FEV1% predicted with a subsequent underestimation of disease severity.

Spirometry reported values — pre- and post-bronchodilator outputs and definitions: "The following measurements are reported separately for the sets of prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator maneuvers"; "The largest FVC and the largest FEV1, observed from all of the acceptable values are reported… Their ratio is used for FEV1/FVC", and if a bronchodilator is given, both percentage and absolute changes in FEV1 and FVC versus prebronchodilator are reported; reporting change in FEV1 as "a percentage of the predicted FEV1 or as z-scores" avoids sex and height bias; FIVC is the largest inspiratory volume immediately after forced expiration, PEF is the highest flow from a maximum forced expiratory maneuver with the largest value reported from acceptable maneuvers, and FET is "the time in seconds measured from Time 0 to the end of the expiratory plateau or the beginning of inspiration after maximal forced expiration, or the time that the patient comes off the mouthpiece".

Table 4 shows the coefficients and the explained variance (R 2) for the prediction equations for the "normal" population. The coefficients for age, age 2, (where relevant) and height are the same whether estimating the mean or the lower limit of normal. Values are given for each of the four measures of ventilatory function, pre- and post-bronchodilator and for each sex separately. The pre- and post- bronchodilator values for the intercepts are all within 100 mL of each other with the exception of the lower limit of normal for the FEV 1 in men, where the difference is approximately 125 mL. The pre- and post- bronchodilator values are often very close to each other and for the FEV 6 the differences are negligible. Differences in the coefficients for age and height are also negligible, with the exception of the values for the FEV 1 /FVC ratio. The prediction equations for the FEV 1 /FVC ratio are relatively poor as is seen by the much lower R 2 value, but the differences between pre- and post-bronchodilator values are still less than 3%.

### Impact of using pre-and postbronchodilator spirometry reference values in a Chinese population [^114pWzT4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Spirometry reference equations that are derived from a large, nationally representative general population are warranted in China, and the impact of using prebronchodilator (pre-BD) and post-BD spirometry reference values has yet to be assessed in Chinese populations. Objectives: To present the pre-BD and post-BD spirometry reference values for Chinese adults using the China Pulmonary Health (CPH) Study. Methods: A reference population of 17,969 healthy, nonsmoking participants in the CPH Study was used to calculate the pre- and post-BD reference values for FEV 1, FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC ratio. Pre- and post-BD reference values were applied to the entire CPH population (N = 50,991) to illustrate the divergence between the use of different references in determining disease prevalence and severity grading. Measurements and Main Results: The prevalences of airflow limitation were 5.36% using the pre-BD reference and 8.02% using the post-BD reference. Individuals who had a post-BD FEV 1 /FVC ratio lower than the post-BD reference value but higher than the pre-BD reference value were found to have significantly higher rates of self-reported respiratory symptoms and significantly lower values on spirometry indicators than those whose post-BD FEV 1 /FVC ratio was greater than the post-BD reference value. An additional 3.51% of participants were identified as having grade II-IV chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using the post-BD FEV 1 predicted values. Conclusions: This study generated and applied pre- and post-BD spirometry reference values in a nationally representative Chinese adult population. Post-BD reference values may serve as an additional criterion in identifying individuals at risk for obstructive pulmonary diseases, and their diagnostic and prognostic values should be further investigated.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^1163XXFm]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Using different predictors of normal lung function based on pre- or post- bronchodilator spirometric values provides slightly different results, but these may not be of great clinical significance provided they are used consistently in comparative studies. In a clinical setting spirometry should be used in combination with other information to guide management and these small differences are unlikely to be important when setting criteria for a positive screening test if this is based on a pre-bronchodilator assessment of spirometry. We have provided prediction equations for post-bronchodilator lung function in people over the age of 40 years living in Europe. We have also provided approximate mean differences between pre-and post-bronchodilator values and we have given estimates of the effect of using the different methods on sensitivity and specificity of a test for COPD.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^115Tig1X]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of using ∆FEV 1(%PN) or ∆FVC (%PN) for assessing the BDR in patients with airflow obstruction, particularly those with lower pre-BD FEV 1 and FVC values. Unlike the recent ERS/ATS definition of a positive BDR, derived solely from data in clinically normal subjects (5), the current study used a comprehensive pulmonary function dataset encompassing a diverse range of pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and FVC values. In contrast to the updated ERS/ATS standards, our findings advocate for raising the threshold for a positive ∆FEV 1(%PN) from 10 to 14%, while confirming the 10% for ∆FVC (%PN).

### Estimating the U.S. prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using pre-and post-bronchodilator spirometry: the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) 2007–2010 [^11422ygk]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

During 2007–2010, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted a spirometry component which obtained pre-bronchodilator pulmonary lung function data on a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 6–79 years and post-bronchodilator pulmonary lung function data for the subset of adults with airflow limitation. The goals of this study were to 1) compute prevalence estimates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry measurements and fixed ratio and lower limit of normal (LLN) diagnostic criteria and 2) examine the potential impact of nonresponse on the estimates.

Methods

This analysis was limited to those aged 40–79 years who were eligible for NHANES pre-bronchodilator spirometry (n = 7,104). Examinees with likely airflow limitation were further eligible for post-bronchodilator testing (n = 1,110). Persons were classified as having COPD based on FEV 1 /FVC < 70% (fixed ratio) or FEV 1 /FVC < lower limit of normal (LLN) based on person's age, sex, height, and race/ethnicity. Those without spirometry but self-reporting both daytime supplemental oxygen therapy plus emphysema and/or current chronic bronchitis were also classified as having COPD. The final analytic samples for pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator analyses were 77.1% (n = 5,477) and 50.8% (n = 564) of those eligible, respectively. To account for non-response, NHANES examination weights were adjusted to the eligible pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator subpopulations.

Results

In 2007–2010, using the fixed ratio criterion and pre-bronchodilator test results, COPD prevalence was 20.9% (SE 1.1) among US adults aged 40–79 years. Applying the same criterion to post-bronchodilator test results, prevalence was 14.0% (SE 1.0). Using the LLN criterion and pre-bronchodilator test results, the COPD prevalence was 15.4% (SE 0.8), while applying the same criterion to post-bronchodilator test results, prevalence was 10.2% (SE 0.8).

Conclusions

The overall COPD prevalence among US adults aged 40–79 years varied from 10.2% to 20.9% based on whether pre- or post-bronchodilator values were used and which diagnostic criterion (fixed ratio or LLN) was applied. The overall prevalence decreased by approximately 33% when airflow limitation was based on post-bronchodilator as compared to pre-bronchodilator spirometry, regardless of which diagnostic criterion was used.

Table 1 provides additional detail on the covariates of the cohort at year 1, including the total follow-up time and the mortality rate per 1,000 person-years of follow-up. As would be expected, age was the strongest predictor of mortality. Similar data for the Year 5 cohort is displayed in Table 2.

Changes in the COPD classification stages between pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function measurements for the year 1 and the year cohort is shown in Table 3. At year 1, 3,804 of 5,307 (71.7%) remained in the same category for both pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 and at year 5, 4,079 of 5,320 (76.7%) remained in the same category for both pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV 1. The mean FEV 1, as a percentage of predicted, increased from 74.1% (Standard deviation [SD] 10.3%) to78.1% (SD 10.0%) at year 1 and from 70.3% (SD 12.5%) to 74.3% (SD 12.1%) at year 5.

### "GOLD or lower limit of normal definition? A comparison with expert-based diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in a prospective cohort-study" [^112k9JNo]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) acknowledged the importance of FEV1 as distinct parameter to diagnose COPD, and defined airflow obstruction if both the FEV1/FVC ratio is < 0.7 and the FEV1 < 80% of predicted, and thus 'starting' the diagnosis of COPD from GOLD II onwards. Application of the NICE definition (post-bronchodilator values) in our cohort as compared to the expert panel diagnosis of COPD led to very high specificity (99%; only two false positives) but low sensitivity (66%, 82 false negatives). Incorporating a second PFT parameter as FEV1 into a FEV1/FVC-based definition might effectively reduce false positive test results, however for correction of false negative results at least a three parameters approach is needed.

Certain limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of our findings. PFT was only performed once at baseline, and secular trends could have been missed. Second, information on graphical PFT results as the flow volume curve or the flow pressure curve also enhance the diagnostic ability of the expert panel, but we could not quantify how much these graphs added to the final decision of the panel.

Another limitation in our study is incorporation bias when assessing the added value of other PFT variables to improve the diagnosis of GOLD or LLN. PFT parameters play an important role in the diagnosis of the expert panel. Thus, overoptimism of the diagnostic performance of PFT variables such as FEV1 and RV/TLC should be considered. Robust external validation and accurate cut-off calculations are still needed before the proposed algorithm of including FEV1 and RV/TLC in the GOLD or LLN definition may be adopted in routine practice. Our intention, however, was not to create a new definition of COPD, but to raise the awareness of some of the shortcomings of the single fixed cut-off value of FEV/FVC 0.7 and the age-adjusted LLN definitions.

In conclusion, both the conventional GOLD criteria and some of the most frequently used LLN-based diagnoses of COPD share major shortcomings as compared to the expert panel diagnosis of COPD. While GOLD definition tends to overdiagnose COPD, LLN-based definitions tend to underdiagnose COPD in symptomatic patients. Adding the information on FEV1 and RV/TLC to the GOLD definition reduced the number of misdiagnoses substantially for either definition. Further studies are needed to explore the usefulness of 'an upgraded' COPD or LLN diagnosis with determination of the optimal cut-off values for RV/TLC and DLCO.

### Pre-and post-bronchodilator lung function as predictors of mortality in the lung health study [^115pTs1h]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Results

There were a total of 5,887 participants in the Lung Health Study, of whom 721 died by the end of the follow-up period of up to 15 years. The major causes of death at follow-up were lung cancer and cardiovascular disease with comparatively fewer deaths due to non-malignant respiratory disease. At baseline, the mean age of the cohort was 48.5 years and the mean FEV 1 was 74.7%. Of these, we had complete data on 5,307 who participated in the examination at year 1 (there were 13 deaths before the year 1 visit). Among the 5,307 on whom we had complete data at year 1, we had 65,472 person years of follow-up, with a median and maximum follow-up time of 12.8 and 14.0 years, and 628 deaths (Table 1). Among the 5,320 on whom we had complete data at year 5 (there were 149 deaths prior to the year 5 visit), we had 45,808 person years of follow-up, with a median and maximum follow-up time of 8.8 and 10.0 years, and 500 deaths (Table 2).

*for men aged 40 years, with body mass index 23 and 175 centimetres tall and women aged 40 years, with body mass index 23 and 165 centimetres tall.

Table 5 gives the regression coefficients for the difference between observed pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function values (post bronchodilator – pre-bronchodilator values) for the "normal population". The intercept represents the mean difference between the two measurements at age 40 years, body mass index 23 and average height. For FEV1 these mean levels increased significantly post-bronchodilator (91 mL (95% CI: 64, 117) for men and 77mL (95% CI: 63, 92) for women), for FEV1/FVC the mean levels also increased significantly post-bronchodilator (2.35% (95% CI: 1.76, 2.93) for men and 2.94% (95% CI: 2.43, 3.45) for women. In contrast the FVC fell significantly by 46 mL (95% CI: 7, 86) in men and by 47 mL (95% CI: 21, 72) in women. The regression coefficients for age, body mass index and height show negligible associations which are for the most part not significant. Further, a random intercept model (a regression model with a separate intercept for each centre) showed no evidence of between-centre heterogeneity, suggesting that the results are similar in each of the centres included in the study. For the "; non-normal" population the differences between pre- and post-bronchodilator were: FEV 1 in women with mild disease was 59mL (95% CI: 9, 109) greater than those with severe disease; FVC in men with severe disease was 95mL (95% CI: 10, 177) greater than those with mild disease; FVC in men with very severe disease was 275mL (95% CI: 60, 490) greater than those with mild disease; FEV 6 in men with very severe disease was 176mL (95% CI: 20, 332) greater than those with mild disease; FEV 1 /FVC in men with moderate disease was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.29%, 1.52%) greater than those with mild disease.

### Impaired diffusing capacity and COPD incidence in adults with symptoms and normal spirometry [^111G9AYb]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Impaired diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO) in the absence of post-bronchodilator (BD) airflow obstruction has been proposed as a marker of 'Pre-COPD'. However, the relationship between impaired DLCO and subsequent lung function decline and COPD incidence has not been examined in-depth.

Methods

We conducted an observational study of adults aged between 40 and 70 years who were evaluated at a multi-centre lung function laboratory in Australia between 2014 and 2024. Adults referred with respiratory symptoms or a clinical suspicion of obstructive airways disease with follow-up spirometry obtained ≥ 12 months after the initial assessment were included. The relationship between impaired DLCO and subsequent lung function decline and COPD incidence was assessed among those with normal spirometry at baseline.

Results

A total of 266 patients with a mean age of 53.2 (SD 12.8) years were evaluated after a median follow-up of 2.3 [IQR 1.5 to 3.3] years. We found no evidence of an association between impaired DLCO (below the lower limit of normal) and annualised rate of decline in post-BD FEV 1 (MD -0.1% predicted per-year, 95%CI -1.3 to 1.2), FVC (-0.4% predicted, 95%CI -1.6 to 0.8) or FEV 1 /FVC (-0.1% per-year, 95%CI -0.1 to 0.1). The sensitivity of impaired DLCO for COPD incidence was 40%, and specificity 82%. Findings were similar in sub-samples limited to current and former smokers, and when impaired DLCO was defined as < 80% predicted.

Conclusion

Impaired DLCO was not an effective discriminator of lung function decline or COPD incidence in this real-world cohort.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^117BR23x]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A positive bronchodilator response has been defined as a 12% increase in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) from their respective pre-bronchodilator values, combined with at least a 0.2 L absolute change. Recent recommendations suggested the use of the percent change in FEV 1 and FVC relative to their predicted normal values without having applied them in patients with airflow obstruction. The aim of the current study was to compare the two approaches over a wide range of pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and FVC values.

Methods

A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing spirometry and bronchodilator testing was completed. The change in FEV 1 and FVC with a bronchodilator was expressed relative to the pre-bronchodilator and predicted normal FEV 1 and FVC.

Results

In 1,040 patients with a non-paradoxical change in FEV 1, 19.0% had a ≥ 12% change in FEV 1 using their pre-bronchodilator value compared to 5.7% using their predicted normal value. For FVC, the respective values were 12.7% vs. 5.8%. The difference was retained in patients with a ≥ 0.2 L change in FEV 1 or FVC. In unobstructed patients, the upper threshold (two standard deviations above the mean) of the bronchodilator response was 14% for FEV 1 and 10% for FVC using predicted normal values.

Conclusions

Expressing the percent change in FEV 1 and FVC relative to predicted normal values reduces the over-estimation of the bronchodilator response, especially in patients with a very low pre-bronchodilator FEV1, including in those with a ≥ 0.2 L change in FEV 1. Irrespective of pre-bronchodilator values, a ≥ 14% change in FEV 1 and ≥ 10% change in FVC relative to the predicted normal values could be considered a positive bronchodilator response.

### Can spirometric norms be set using pre-or post-bronchodilator test results in older people? [^113Nnvtg]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is defined by post-bronchodilator spirometry. Data on "normal values" come predominantly from pre-bronchodilator spirometry. The effects of this on diagnosis are unknown.

Methods

Lower limits of normal (LLN) were estimated from "normal" participants in the Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) programme. Values separately derived using pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry were compared. Sensitivity and specificity of criteria derived from pre-bronchodilator spirometry and pre-bronchodilator spirometry adjusted by a constant were assessed in the remaining population. The "gold standard" was the LLN for the post-bronchodilator spirometry in the "normal population". For FEV1/FVC, sensitivity and specificity of criteria were also assessed when a fixed value of < 70% was used rather than LLN.

Results

Of 6,600 participants with full data, 1,354 were defined as "normal". Mean differences between pre- and post- bronchodilator measurements were small and the Bland-Altman plots showed no association between difference and mean value. Compared with using the gold standard, however, tests using pre-bronchodilator spirometry had a sensitivity and specificity of detecting a low FEV1 of 78.4% and 100%, a low FVC of 99.8% and 99.1% and a low FEV1/FVC ratio of 65% and 100%. Adjusting this by a constant improved the sensitivity without substantially altering the specificity for FEV1 (99%, 99.8%), FVC (97.4%, 99.9%) and FEV1/FVC (98.7%, 99.5%).

Conclusions

Using pre-bronchodilator spirometry to derive norms for lung function reduces sensitivity compared to a post-bronchodilator gold standard. Adjustment of these values by a constant can improve validity of the test.

### Increased accuracy after adjustment of spirometry threshold for diagnosing COPD based on pre-bronchodilator FEV / FVC [^1133Hus3]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

COPD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Spirometry is the most common lung function test for diagnosing COPD with a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 confirming the presence of the disease. However, diagnosticians appear reluctant to use bronchodilators, which have been linked to the misdiagnosis of COPD. Therefore, we investigated whether the threshold for diagnosing COPD should be modified when diagnosing COPD based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry.

Methods

Data from 23,433 participants were merged from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007–2012. Participants were excluded for having no post-bronchodilator spirometry, for being below the age of 40, and for having asthma or lung cancer. These exclusion criteria resulted in 680 participants being included in the present study. Participants with COPD were defined as those with a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70. The threshold for diagnosing COPD based on pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC was varied while calculating accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.

Results

Diagnosing COPD based on pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 contributes to the misdiagnosis of COPD through poor classification rates. By adjusting the threshold and diagnosing COPD based on a pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.66, the overall classification rates increase noticeably, resulting in a 15% increase in accuracy.

Conclusion

We suggest a slight adjustment using pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 0.66 when diagnosing COPD based on pre-bronchodilator spirometry. This approach could prevent cases of misdiagnosed COPD, which can lead to potentially harmful treatment of people who do not have COPD and foregone treatment in patients with COPD.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^117Be5JN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study underscore that normalizing the bronchodilator-induced change in FEV 1 and FVC relative to the predicted normal FEV 1 and FVC values reduces the proportion of patients exhibiting a positive BDR, compared to referencing their prebronchodilator values. This reduction in BDR is particularly noteworthy in patients with a low pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, even among those with a ≥ 0.2 L absolute change in FEV 1. Regardless of pre-bronchodilator values, a ≥ 14% change in FEV 1(%PN) and ≥ 10% in FVC (%PN) could be considered a positive BDR. Expressing the changes in FEV 1 and FVC relative to predicted normal values addresses the biases introduced by using the pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and FVC in the assessment of the BDR (1–3). Additionally, this approach compensates for inter-individual differences in predicted normal FEV 1 and FVC values, addressing a limitation associated with evaluating BDR by a fixed absolute change in FEV 1 or FVC.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116Rwkyi]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Spirometric criteria to define airflow obstruction — For diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), GOLD uses a post-bronchodilator ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) < 0.7. The fixed FEV1/FVC ratio (< 0.7) may lead to over-diagnosis in the elderly and under-diagnosis in approximately 1% of young adults, especially in mild disease. If COPD is suspected in younger adults (age < 50 years) who have a repeated fixed ratio ≥ 0.7, comparing the ratio to a predicted lower limit of normal (LLN) or using z-scores may help. LLN classifies the bottom 5% of the healthy population as abnormal, and a z-score of −1.645 is equivalent to the 5th centile. The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) found that classification using z-scores versus a fixed ratio can differ and its clinical relevance remains uncertain; GLI predicted values are based on pre-bronchodilator measurements, and postbronchodilator reference values were more successful at identifying individuals with mild COPD than prebronchodilator values in SCAPIS. There are no longitudinal studies validating LLN, and using the fixed ratio is not inferior to LLN regarding prognosis; thus, GOLD favors using the fixed ratio over LLN.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115TQgF8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pre- or post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic approach — notes that, in line with other National and International guidelines, GOLD has recommended using post-bronchodilator values when considering a diagnosis of COPD; however, it is now recognised that the bronchodilator response has little value in differentiating asthma from COPD, that pre-bronchodilator values are reproducible, and that obstruction only found on post-bronchodilator measurements is uncommon. Obtaining post-bronchodilator values is more time consuming. Pre-bronchodilator spirometry can be used as an initial test in symptomatic patients, and if it does not show obstruction, performing post-bronchodilator spirometry is not necessary unless there is a very high clinical suspicion of COPD.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^113ZfLMz]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Lower limit of normal (LLN) and fixed cutoffs — percent predicted values should not be used to define abnormality because the true LLN is age- and/or height-dependent and varies among individuals; fixed cutoffs such as 80% predicted for forced vital capacity (FVC) or 0.70 for the FEV1/FVC ratio are based on middle-aged adults, can yield erroneous decisions in children and in older or shorter adults, and introduce sex bias. The LLN does not necessarily need to be the fifth percentile and can be adjusted with outcome data; caution is warranted near dichotomous boundaries, especially with results from a single occasion. In clinical testing where disease is suspected, the pretest probability is higher and the false positive rate is much lower than the lowest 5% implied by percentile thresholds.

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^117BGzqa]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In pulmonary function testing, the evaluation of a bronchodilator response (BDR) during spirometry involves the administration of inhaled short-acting airway smooth muscle relaxing agents, such as β2-adrenergic agonists. The previous criteria for identifying a positive BDR, as outlined by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines, necessitate both a 0.2 L and 12% increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC). If these dual criteria are not met, the BDR is deemed negative. However, it is important to note that this definition of a BDR lacks sensitivity, particularly for individuals with either low or high pre-bronchodilator FEV1 or FVC values.

Airflow resistance is inversely related to the airway radius (r) which, in turn, determines airway circumference (c = 2πr). Because bronchodilators decrease airflow resistance by lengthening circumferential airway smooth muscle, any increase in airway smooth muscle circumference can be converted to a related change in the radius (r). For example, a bronchodilator-induced 5 mm increase (Fig. 1) in airway circumference (c) elicits distinct effects on radial change (Δr) when referenced to the baseline radius of the constricted airway (r 1 or r 2) or to the radius of a normal airway (r n). Consequently, a 5 mm circumference lengthening results in a 27% and 40% radial increase relative to r 1 (3 mm) and r 2 (2 mm), respectively. Conversely, when referenced to the normal airway radius (4 mm), the same circumference lengthening yields a 20% radial increase for both airways. Similarly, in the clinical arena, bronchodilator-induced changes in FEV 1 and FVC, which are surrogates of airway caliber, are exaggerated when referencing to pre-bronchodilator values versus the predicted normal values.

End of forced expiration (EOFE) acceptability for forced vital capacity (FVC) — if an expiratory plateau is achieved with ≤ 25 mL in the last 1 s of expiration, FVC meets EOFE acceptability criteria. If no plateau, FVC meets EOFE acceptability criteria when achieved expiratory time ≥ 15 s; if neither condition is met, when FVC is within the repeatability tolerance of, or is greater than, the largest prior observed FVC, FVC may meet EOFE usability criteria. If there are no prior observed FVC values in the current pre- or post-bronchodilator testing set, then the FVC provisionally meets EOFE acceptability criteria.

There was no study evaluating exacerbation as a primary end point; four studies including 1,218 patients with a serious risk of bias and overall moderate quality of evidence examined the need to add or increase systemic oral corticosteroids as a surrogate marker for exacerbations.

### Predictive value of prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometry for COPD features and outcomes [^113vsH9Y]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Results

Of 10 192 subjects with at least 10 or more pack-years of smoking, we excluded 192 with incomplete prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spirometric data. Ten thousand subjects were included in in the analysis. We had available data regarding respiratory exacerbations for 8479 subjects. Of the 10 000 subjects, 4857 completed a phase 2 visit that included respiratory questionnaires, spirometry and 6 min walk test. We also had available mortality data for 8221 subjects.

Using PREO, the AFO prevalence was 50.2% (5016 of 10 000), whereas using POSTO, the prevalence was 44.5% (4451 of 10 000; P < 0.001). There were 1167 subjects with discordant spirometry: 866 (8.7%) with PREO-POSTN and 301 (3%) with PREN-POSTO (supplementary table 1).

### A comparative study of bronchodilator response: utilizing pre-bronchodilator versus predicted normal values [^114tjViK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A positive bronchodilator response has been defined as a 12% increase in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) from their respective pre-bronchodilator values, combined with at least a 0.2 L absolute change. Recent recommendations suggested the use of the percent change in FEV 1 and FVC relative to their predicted normal values without having applied them in patients with airflow obstruction. The aim of the current study was to compare the two approaches over a wide range of pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 and FVC values.

Methods

A retrospective review of consecutive patients undergoing spirometry and bronchodilator testing was completed. The change in FEV 1 and FVC with a bronchodilator was expressed relative to the pre-bronchodilator and predicted normal FEV 1 and FVC.

Results

In 1,040 patients with a non-paradoxical change in FEV 1, 19.0% had a ≥ 12% change in FEV 1 using their pre-bronchodilator value compared to 5.7% using their predicted normal value. For FVC, the respective values were 12.7% vs. 5.8%. The difference was retained in patients with a ≥ 0.2 L change in FEV 1 or FVC. In unobstructed patients, the upper threshold (two standard deviations above the mean) of the bronchodilator response was 14% for FEV 1 and 10% for FVC using predicted normal values.

Conclusions

Expressing the percent change in FEV 1 and FVC relative to predicted normal values reduces the over-estimation of the bronchodilator response, especially in patients with a very low pre-bronchodilator FEV1, including in those with a ≥ 0.2 L change in FEV 1. Irrespective of pre-bronchodilator values, a ≥ 14% change in FEV 1 and ≥ 10% change in FVC relative to the predicted normal values could be considered a positive bronchodilator response.

### Pre-and post-bronchodilator lung function as predictors of mortality in the lung health study [^112Y4XGU]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is supposed to be classified on the basis of post-bronchodilator lung function. Most longitudinal studies of COPD, though, do not have post-bronchodilator lung function available. We used pre-and post bronchodilator lung function data from the Lung Health Study to determine whether these measures differ in their ability to predict mortality.

Methods

We limited our analysis to subjects who were of black or white race, on whom we had complete data, and who participated at either the 1 year or the 5 year follow-up visit. We classified subjects based on their baseline lung function, according to COPD Classification criteria using both pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function. We conducted a survival analysis and logistic regression predicting death and controlling for age, sex, race, treatment group, smoking status, and measures of lung function (either pre- or post-bronchodilator. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and also calculated area under the curve for the logistic regression models.

Results

By year 15 of the study, 721 of the original 5,887 study subjects had died. In the year 1 sample survival models, a higher FEV 1% predicted lower mortality in both the pre-bronchodilator (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81, 0.94 per 10% increase) and post-bronchodilator (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77, 0.90) models. The area under the curve for the respective models was 69.2% and 69.4%. Similarly, using categories, when compared to people with "normal" lung function, subjects with Stage 3 or 4 disease had similar mortality in both the pre- (HR 1.51, 95% CI 0.75, 3.03) and post-bronchodilator (HR 1.45, 95% CI 0.41, 5.15) models. In the year 5 sample, when a larger proportion of subjects had Stage 3 or 4 disease (6.4% in the pre-bronchodilator group), mortality was significantly increased in both the pre- (HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.51, 4.75) and post-bronchodilator (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.63, 3.73) models.

Conclusions

Both pre- and post-bronchodilator lung function predicted mortality in this analysis with a similar degree of accuracy. Post-bronchodilator lung function may not be needed in population studies that predict long-term outcomes.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1119hqok]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis — spirometric criteria and thresholds emphasize that diagnosis requires confirmation of an airflow limitation that is not fully reversible via spirometry and the history of a potentially causative exposure, with airflow limitation defined by a low post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio. The threshold FEV1/FVC ratio to confirm airflow limitation is described as uncertain; a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.7 has traditionally been the criterion, which may identify airflow limitation more often in the elderly and less among young adults less than 45 years of age compared with a threshold based on the lower limit of normal of FEV1/FVC. The page notes that advocates for the fixed ratio argue it identifies patients with significant pulmonary pathology not detected by the lower limit of normal, whereas advocates for the lower limit of normal argue the fixed ratio is more likely to yield false-positive results.

### Is It time to abandon the postbronchodilator requirement in defining chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^112JNDUK]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Definitions used in clinical medicine are, by nature, dogmatic and somewhat arbitrary. They do, however, serve a useful purpose in helping to determine who may be more likely to benefit from an intervention.

A particular problem with definitions relates to thresholds. Values of any measurement close to a threshold may be within the measurement error for that value, yet one slightly above the threshold is considered "normal" and one slightly below the threshold is considered "abnormal".

Using spirometry to measure lung function and determine the presence of obstruction presents some of the challenges of these definitions and thresholds. The Global Initiative on Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommends classifying obstruction based on the post-bronchodilator spirometry, and uses a fixed ratio of the FEV 1 to the FVC of less than 0.70 to define obstruction. Other guidance recommends using the FEV 1 /FVC below the lower limit of normal to define obstruction but also states that this should be based on a postbronchodilator spirometry.

The origins of the requirement for postbronchodilator are not perfectly clear. The initial 2001 GOLD document states, "The presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV 1, 80% of the predicted value in combination with an FEV 1 /FVC < 70% confirms the presence of airflow limitation that is not fully reversible", without a reference or other justification for this statement. In general, measurement of lung function after the administration of a bronchodilator in a population results in a mean improvement of 3–4% in both the FEV 1 and the FVC, with a great deal of variability in this change. One thought is that the postbronchodilator spirometry is a more accurate and stable measure, although this, to my knowledge, has never really been demonstrated as completely being an actual effect of the bronchodilator as opposed to being a learning effect of doing a difficult set of maneuvers a second time. And although lung function decline based on postbronchodilator spirometry varies from that seen in prebronchodilator spirometry in the context of clinical trials, either measurement can be used to assess lung function decline. Another thought has been that response to a bronchodilator distinguishes asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although this has also been demonstrated to not be true.

### Should the diagnosis of COPD be based on a single spirometry test? [^1174hbrY]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent chronic respiratory condition that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and lungs to inhaled particles or gases. Current international clinical COPD guidelines state that spirometry is required to make the diagnosis. These guidelines state that the presence of a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) over forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio below 0.70 confirms the presence of airway obstruction in subjects who are suspected of having COPD due to cumulative exposure to risk factors (e.g. tobacco smoke, occupational or indoor air pollution) and presence of respiratory symptoms that are compatible with COPD. There is increasing evidence that the use of an age- and sex-specific lower limit of normal value for FEV 1 /FVC would be a more appropriate approach when defining airway obstruction.

In routine clinical practice, a COPD diagnosis is often based on a single initial spirometry test, and none of the above COPD guidelines recommend repeat spirometry testing when making the diagnosis of COPD, or indicate that a different result may be found if spirometry is repeated. Interestingly, although long-term variability has been reported for FEV 1 and FVC in healthy subjectsand for patients with COPD, and their year-to-year variability is reported in ERS/ATS lung function guidelines to be ± 15%, similar evidence for variability of FEV 1 /FVC is lacking.

The aim of this study was, therefore, in a sample of subjects at risk for COPD, to investigate the long-term stability of a diagnosis on the basis of a once-only measurement of post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio in primary care. We examined shifts in diagnostic category (i.e. shifts between 'obstructed' and 'non-obstructed' and vice versa) after 1 year and 2 years. We used routine spirometry data from subjects who had entered a respiratory health diagnostic and annual monitoring service offered by primary care diagnostic centres in the Netherlands.

### Which bronchodilator reversibility criteria can predict severe acute exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients? [^116UTLDe]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

We enrolled participants from four different prospective COPD cohort studies in South Korea: Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) Airway Registry (NCT02527486), COPD in Dusty Area (CODA) Registry (KCT0000552), Korean COPD Subgroup Study (KOCOSS) (NCT02800499), and Korean Obstructive Lung Disease Cohort (KOLD). All COPD studies were registered with the exception of KOLD, which had been launched 12 years previously. The study design and methods were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No. H-1507–030–686).

Participants who were over 40 years of age and who showed a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0.7 were included. Those who were diagnosed with asthma, those not followed-up for at least 1 year, or those with a lack of information were excluded. Duplicate patients who were included in two or more cohorts were also excluded.

Various criteria for BDR positivity have been used both clinically and in research. Available definitions are distinguishable by the representative level of lung function (FEV1 or FVC, and whether to adopt an absolute or percentage change in that level. Several definitions use both absolute and percentage changes in pulmonary function to compensate for discordance in improvement from the baseline after bronchodilator application caused by the severity of COPD and thus provide a more comprehensive approach. The GOLD criteria for BDR positivity is an increase of 12% and 200 mL in post-bronchodilator FEV1, the ATS criteria for BDR positivity is an increase of 12% and 200 mL in FEV1 or FVC, the ACCP requires an increase of 15% in FEV1. The major criteria of the Spanish definition of ACOS are an increase of 15% and 400 mL in FEV1. The criteria compatible with ACOS in GINA require an increase of 12% and 400 mL in FEV1, while the ERS criteria are that post FEV1%- pre FEV1% ≥ 10%. Finally, a criterion that was introduced by a study free of biases from sample size and sex was an 8% increase in FEV1.

### Standardization of spirometry 2019 update. An official American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society technical statement [^113WDhMj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Preschool spirometry indices — FEVt is the maximal volume expired by Time t seconds from Time 0 of a forced expiratory maneuver. Children aged 6 years or younger have relatively large airways compared with their lung volume and may complete expiration in < 1 second; therefore, FEV0.75 and FEV0.5 have been used, and in children aged 6 years or younger, FEV0.75 was found to provide information similar to that of FEV1. The ATS/ERS statement on preschool testing states that FEV0.75 and FEV0.5 should be reported; because GLI reference values for FEV0.75 (but not for FEV0.5) are available for ages 3–7 years, FEV0.75 should be reported for children aged 6 years or younger, and if FET is > 1 second, then FEV1 should also be reported. The mean forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (FEF25–75), may be reported from the maneuver with the largest sum of FEV1 and FVC, but FEF25–75 is highly dependent on the validity of the FVC measurement and the degree of expiratory effort, and a volume adjustment may be required when comparing pre- and post-bronchodilator FEF25–75 values.

Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry — diagnostic algorithm for COPD: Measure pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, classify as not COPD, with consideration to measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC if a volume responder is suspected (e.g., low FEV1 or high symptoms). If pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, measure post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC; if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ≥ 0.7, interpret as flow response needing follow-up with repeat assessment, and if post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.7, COPD is confirmed. If the pre-bronchodilator values show obstruction the diagnosis of COPD should be confirmed using post-bronchodilator measurements, and individuals whose pre-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC shows obstruction but whose post-bronchodilator ratio does not show obstruction have an increased risk of future development of COPD and should be followed closely.

According to the fixed FEV 1 /FVC definition, 83.0% of initially obstructed subjects were still categorised as having airway obstruction after 1 year, and after 2 years only 76.2% had obstruction (Figure 3b). Of the subjects without baseline airway obstruction (n = 1,255), 87.5% remained unobstructed after 1 year and 81.3% after 2 years. Again, agreement between obstruction/non-obstruction status was 'substantial' when comparing T0 with T1 (Kappa = 0.707, 95% CI = 0.678–0.736) and T0 with T2 (Kappa = 0.695, 95% CI = 0.666–0.724) classifications.

Figure 4 shows that diagnostic shifts were observed across the full range of baseline FEV 1 /FVC values. Numbers (%) of patients with borderline results in terms of the fixed FEV 1 /FVC definition (e.g. FEV 1 /FVC between 0.68 and 0.72) were 337 (14.3%) at T0, 319 (13.6%) at T1 and 321 (13.6%) at T2. Of the 315 patients who shifted category in either direction between T0 and T1, only 65 (20.6%) were in the 0.68–0.72 range at T0.

Factors associated with shifting between diagnostic categories

Several factors were independently associated with shifting from being obstructed at T0 to being non-obstructed at T1 when applying the LLN FEV 1 /FVC criterion. Higher body mass index (BMI) and baseline short-acting bronchodilator use increased the odds of shifting to non-obstructed (Table 2). Older age, baseline post-BD FEV 1 < 50% predicted, baseline inhaled corticosteroid use, and being a current smoker or using a short-acting bronchodilator at T1 reduced this odds.

Being male, older age, lower baseline post-BD FEV 1% predicted, and being current smoker at baseline increased the odds of shifting from being non-obstructed to being obstructed at T1, whereas higher baseline BMI reduced these odds (Table 2).

Bronchodilator reversibility was not significantly associated with diagnostic shift in either direction.
