## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for swelling of the underside of the tongue?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for swelling on the underside of the tongue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about anatomic localization of ventral tongue and floor-of-mouth spaces. Then, I should organize the differential by pathophysiology and highlight must-not-miss emergencies. Next, I will map imaging discriminators that separate cystic, vascular, infectious, and neoplastic processes. After that, I should layer in systemic causes of macroglossia and uncommon mimics. Finally, I will prioritize the differential by clinical tempo and provide high-yield management pearls with source-backed justifications [^114h7Bh6].

> Let me first confirm the anatomic frame. "Underside of the tongue" spans the ventral tongue and the floor of mouth, chiefly the sublingual space above the mylohyoid and contiguous with the submandibular and parapharyngeal compartments; this space houses the sublingual gland, minor salivary glands, ducts, neurovascular structures, and lymphatics, and precise localization on imaging guides the differential and surgical approach [^114h7Bh6].

> I need to lay out a broad categorical scaffold so I don't miss key entities. Hold on, I should verify the major buckets: cystic or fluid-filled lesions, vascular anomalies, infectious and inflammatory processes, benign and malignant neoplasms, congenital or developmental anomalies, traumatic or iatrogenic causes, and systemic or metabolic macroglossia; this structure aligns with radiologic and clinical literature and will support targeted testing and triage [^114h7Bh6] [^113JphMT] [^115EVkAC].

> Before diving into details, airway comes first. Wait, let me verify the high-risk emergent etiologies that can rapidly obstruct the airway: lingual abscess, bradykinin-mediated angioedema including ACE inhibitor–associated cases that may be unilateral, hemorrhagic hematoma, and severe infectious or inflamed lingual thyroglossal duct cyst; securing the airway early and using CT to distinguish abscess from cellulitis are critical steps, with imaging often showing diffuse tongue edema in angioedema and rim-enhancing collections in abscess [^113VS16K] [^113YaGKh] [^117W8fRg] [^117UJoU2].

> Now, for cystic or fluid-filled lesions, let me consider ranula first because it is a common benign cause in the sublingual space. On CT and MRI, ranulas appear as well-circumscribed, T2-bright, fluid-attenuation cysts; crucially, absence of diffusion restriction helps distinguish ranula from epidermoid, and plunging ranulas track through or behind the mylohyoid into the neck, while unusually "ascending" ranulas are rare [^114h7Bh6] [^114EnFTY] [^115T1Lze].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially linked "70–80% absence of orthotopic thyroid" to a lingual thyroglossal duct cyst, but that's not correct. Hold on, I should verify: the 70–80% figure pertains to lingual thyroid ectopia, not TGDC, so I need to correct that assertion; when lingual thyroid is suspected, scintigraphy and evaluation for absent cervical thyroid are essential preoperatively, whereas suprahyoid TGDCs are midline cysts along the embryologic tract with characteristic imaging and hyoid association [^113CBJcx] [^114NXnzt] [^116RYvHF] [^112XHswL].

> I will now examine additional cystic mimics. Epidermoid and dermoid cysts often occupy the midline or sublingual region and classically show diffusion restriction for epidermoid, helping to separate them from ranulas; enteric duplication cysts are rare but can occur in the tongue and may be identified by heterotopic intestinal elements on pathology or prenatal imaging [^114h7Bh6] [^116Jt3NY] [^1163115M].

> Next, I should review vascular anomalies because they frequently present in the oral cavity and can bleed or impair function. Lymphatic malformations of the tongue are often multiloculated, T2-hyperintense, and septated on MRI, can cause bleeding and feeding or airway disturbances, and require individualized decision-making for sclerotherapy versus surgery; hemangiomas tend to present in infancy and enhance, and vascular malformations may be compressible with phleboliths or flow voids on imaging [^115EVkAC] [^112CvgC8] [^111K3zan].

> I need to ensure I don't overlook infectious or inflammatory entities. Lingual abscess, although rare, can threaten the airway; CT typically shows a rim-enhancing collection and gas in advanced cases, and, interestingly, needle aspiration via the inferior surface often suffices and may avoid worsening edema compared with incision, whereas posterior abscesses demand aggressive management due to deeper spread risk [^113YaGKh] [^117W8fRg]. Focal myositis can mimic neoplasm but is inflammatory and biopsy-proven, and Melkersson–Rosenthal syndrome presents with orofacial swelling, fissured tongue, and sometimes facial palsy with granulomatous histology, requiring careful differentiation from other granulomatous diseases [^111rhCL5] [^113KpVKZ].

> Let me think about angioedema carefully, and I should double-check for mimics. ACE inhibitor–induced or bradykinin-mediated angioedema can show asymmetric or diffuse tongue edema on contrast-enhanced CT, often without response to antihistamines or steroids; early airway protection is paramount when the floor of mouth or supraglottis is involved, and rare unilateral presentations do occur; carotid artery dissection with acute hypoglossal denervation can mimic angioedema in the very acute edematous stage, so persistent focal swelling with evolving weakness should prompt vascular imaging [^113VS16K] [^117UJoU2] [^112GoACe] [^113sshMV].

> Hold on, I should review benign and malignant neoplasms next. Schwannomas at the base of tongue are rare, well-circumscribed, enhancing masses often confirmed with S-100 positivity and treated surgically with nerve preservation; lipomas are uncommon in the tongue but show diagnostic fat signal or attenuation and may rarely infiltrate and masquerade as angioedema, while malignant considerations include squamous cell carcinoma and salivary gland cancers such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, in which pain, rapid growth, or neurologic deficits can be ominous [^112VitkP] [^114EL2di] [^117CrrPi] [^111RgUQW].

> I need to check congenital and developmental possibilities. Lingual thyroid typically presents as a midline base-of-tongue mass that moves with deglutition, often representing the only functioning thyroid tissue, necessitating scintigraphy and ultrasound to document absence of cervical thyroid; osseous choristoma near the foramen cecum is a calcified, low-signal lesion on MRI, and intralingual TGDCs follow the embryologic tract and can be managed by endoscopic transoral approaches in select cases [^113CBJcx] [^112XHswL] [^115KLcm7] [^114NXnzt].

> Traumatic and iatrogenic causes deserve a careful history. Wait, let me verify how often a foreign body is missed: retained foreign bodies in the tongue are frequently misdiagnosed until CT reveals the characteristic radiopaque line, with many located in the anterior two-thirds and marginal zones; postoperative macroglossia and hemorrhage can follow prone positioning or instrumentation, and electrodes or needles can cause deep hematoma with airway compromise, particularly in anticoagulated patients [^111bnUTG] [^114upA75] [^111bqtoR].

> I will now consider systemic and metabolic macroglossia. A wide range of systemic etiologies can cause diffuse tongue enlargement, including lymphangioma, hemangioma, congenital hypothyroidism, acromegaly, amyloidosis, and storage disorders, and one must also remember rare associations like paraproteinemia-associated scleredema that can present with macroglossia and lip edema and respond to intravenous immunoglobulin; in older adults with isolated macroglossia, I should double-check for systemic clues and consider targeted genetic or hematologic testing [^113JphMT] [^116Vmchg] [^1146CSgB].

> Next, I should review how clinical tempo reshapes prioritization. For acute, painful swelling with fever or odynophagia, I should prioritize abscess, traumatic hematoma, and infected congenital lesions, while for sudden nonpruritic swelling without urticaria, I should think angioedema and its mimics; for subacute, painless, well-circumscribed masses, cystic lesions such as ranula or TGDC and benign solid neoplasms rise on the list, whereas diffuse, chronic enlargement points toward macroglossia from systemic or vascular causes; this stratification aligns with imaging-led diagnostic pathways in the sublingual space [^114h7Bh6] [^113JphMT].

> Let me outline the imaging-based differentiation algorithm and ensure it's internally consistent. For acute scenarios, contrast-enhanced CT rapidly distinguishes abscess, detects foreign bodies, and surveys trans-spatial spread; fluid attenuation without diffusion restriction favors ranula, fat attenuation confirms lipoma, rim enhancement indicates abscess, and bone destruction raises concern for malignancy; MRI refines indeterminate cases and surgical planning, with diffusion restriction supporting epidermoid and multiloculated, septated T2-bright signal supporting lymphatic malformation; ultrasound helps with superficial cysts and confirming orthotopic thyroid when lingual thyroid or TGDC is suspected [^114h7Bh6] [^114NXnzt] [^116RYvHF].

> But wait, what about red-flag pearls and pitfalls that change management? I should confirm a history of oral trauma or fish bones because failure to ask leads to frequent misdiagnosis of retained foreign body as tumor, document ACE inhibitor use in unilateral or bilateral tongue swelling because antihistamines and steroids won't help bradykinin angioedema, use needle aspiration as a first-line drainage tactic for lingual abscess to avoid worsening edema, and remember that strawberry tongue points to systemic infections or toxin-mediated states rather than local floor-of-mouth pathology [^111bnUTG] [^117UJoU2] [^113YaGKh] [^117PCqXf].

> Pulling this together, I should now synthesize a prioritized differential that matches underside-of-tongue swelling patterns. The most common benign sublingual mass is a ranula from the sublingual or minor salivary glands; other frequent cystic lesions include epidermoid or dermoid and, along the midline tract, TGDC, while vascular malformations and lymphatic malformations are prominent in children; emergent must-not-miss entities include lingual abscess and angioedema that can rapidly compromise the airway; in adults with a solid lesion, consider schwannoma or lipoma, but keep a high index of suspicion for salivary gland malignancy or SCC when pain, rapid enlargement, or neurologic signs are present [^114h7Bh6] [^113VS16K] [^111RgUQW].

---

Bottom tongue swelling has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **angioedema** (allergic, ACE inhibitor, hereditary) [^113VS16K], **infectious abscess** (lingual, sublingual, submandibular) [^113YaGKh], and **ranula** (simple or plunging) [^114h7Bh6]. Other important considerations include neoplasms (SCC, lymphoma, salivary tumors) [^111RgUQW], vascular malformations (hemangioma, lymphangioma) [^111K3zan], and systemic diseases (amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, acromegaly) [^113JphMT]. Rapid airway **assessment** is critical [^117UJoU2], with CT/MRI and ultrasound guiding diagnosis and management [^114h7Bh6].

---

## Infectious causes

- **Lingual abscess**: Rare but potentially life-threatening [^113YaGKh] [^117W8fRg] often associated with trauma or immunocompromise [^111ErYS6]; presents with pain, swelling, dysphagia, and fever.

- **Sublingual and submandibular space infections**: Commonly odontogenic [^114h7Bh6]; may extend to the tongue, causing significant swelling and airway compromise [^117W8fRg].

- **Lingual tonsillitis**: Inflammation of lingual tonsils causing localized swelling and discomfort [^113VS16K].

---

## Inflammatory and allergic causes

- **Angioedema**: Rapid, non-pitting swelling [^113VS16K]; can be allergic, ACE inhibitor-induced [^112GoACe], or hereditary; may cause airway obstruction [^117UJoU2].

- **Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome**: Rare granulomatous disorder [^113KpVKZ] with recurrent orofacial swelling, facial palsy, and fissured tongue [^112XzhhC].

- **Orofacial granulomatosis**: Chronic granulomatous inflammation causing persistent or recurrent swelling [^117SACa4].

---

## Traumatic causes

Hematoma from blunt or penetrating trauma, including iatrogenic injury [^111bqtoR], can cause lingual **hematoma** with swelling. Foreign body retention [^111bnUTG] may also lead to **localized swelling and inflammation**.

---

## Neoplastic causes

Benign tumors such as lipoma [^114EL2di], schwannoma [^112VitkP], hemangioma, lymphangioma [^111K3zan], and rhabdomyoma [^113SKH6Q] can cause localized swelling. Malignant tumors, including **squamous cell carcinoma**, **lymphoma**, and salivary gland malignancies [^111RgUQW], can present as tongue swelling [^113JphMT].

---

## Congenital and developmental anomalies

Congenital and developmental anomalies that cause floor-of-mouth or tongue-base swelling include **ranula** [^114h7Bh6], a mucous retention cyst of the sublingual gland that may be simple or plunging [^114EnFTY] and can cause significant swelling. A thyroglossal duct cyst presents as a midline cystic lesion along the thyroglossal duct tract, including at the tongue base [^113CBJcx] [^114NXnzt]. Lingual thyroid consists of ectopic thyroid tissue at the tongue base, causing midline swelling [^113CBJcx] [^112XHswL].

---

## Vascular malformations

Hemangioma is a **benign vascular tumor** that causes localized swelling [^115EVkAC], whereas **lymphangioma** is a benign lymphatic malformation causing diffuse or localized swelling [^111K3zan].

---

## Systemic diseases

Systemic diseases that can produce tongue swelling include **amyloidosis**, in which protein deposition causes macroglossia [^113JphMT]; hypothyroidism, which can cause myxedema with tongue swelling; and acromegaly, which leads to growth hormone–mediated macroglossia [^1146CSgB].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history, physical examination, and airway evaluation [^111TbBSA].

- **Imaging**: CT/MRI for deep infections or neoplasms; ultrasound for cystic lesions [^114h7Bh6].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers, thyroid function, complement studies for angioedema [^113VS16K].

- **Biopsy**: For suspected neoplastic or granulomatous lesions [^111RgUQW].

---

## Management strategies

Management prioritizes **airway management** [^117UJoU2], with immediate intervention for any airway compromise. Medical therapy includes antibiotics for infections [^117W8fRg]; antihistamines, corticosteroids, or epinephrine for allergic reactions; and treatments directed at the underlying systemic disease. Surgical options include incision and drainage for abscesses, excision for tumors or cysts, and sclerotherapy or laser therapy for vascular malformations [^115EVkAC].

---

Bottom tongue swelling has a broad differential, including infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, neoplastic, congenital, vascular, and systemic causes. Rapid **airway assessment** [^117UJoU2], imaging, and targeted therapy are essential for management [^113JphMT].

- **Case 1**:
	- A 62-year-old male with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. The axial image of contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) demonstrates asymmetric left-sided tongue oedema (arrow). The coronal reformatted image of CE-CT shows extension of oedema into the left pharyngeal wall (arrow).

- **Case 2**:
	- A 49-year-old male with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. The axial CE-CT shows diffuse enlargement of the tongue with decreased attenuation due to oedema (large arrow). The small arrow indicates the endotracheal tube. The sagittal CE-CT shows glossomegaly (arrow) and marked laryngeal oedema (asterisk). The endotracheal tube is inserted by the trans-nasal approach because of marked glossomegaly.

- **Case 3**:
	- A 54-year-old female with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. The axial CE-CT of the neck shows diffuse enlargement of the tongue (arrow). Vessels are recognized within the tongue, reflecting decreased attenuation due to oedema. The axial CE-CT of the abdomen on the same date shows thickened and contrast-enhancing uroepithelium of the renal pelvis (large arrow). Perinephric fluid is also noted (small arrows). No stone disease was recognized in the ureter or urinary bladder (not shown). Urinalysis was unremarkable except for microscopic haematuria, which returned to normal 3 days later. Follow-up CT 1 month later showed complete resolution of renal pelvic wall thickening and perinephric fluid (not shown).

The differential diagnosis of upper airway obstruction includes neoplasms, parapharyngeal abscess, and infections (e.g. tonsillitis, laryngitis, and cellulitis) and these should be excluded by the imaging findings.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^114h7Bh6]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

There are many causes and sequelae of inflammation and infection within the sublingual and submandibular spaces. Proper localization of the abnormality is useful in determining etiology.

- **Ranula**: Among the differential diagnoses of cystic lesions in the sublingual space, a ranula is a commonly acquired lesion. Traditionally considered a post-inflammatory or post-traumatic sequela of glandular obstruction, a ranula is a mucous retention cyst arising from the sublingual or minor salivary glands.

	- On imaging, ranulas have the typical appearance of cystic lesions with fluid attenuation on CT, hyperintensity on T2-weighted MR sequences, and are anechoic on ultrasound. MRI in particular can serve to assess the size, content, location, and extent of the lesion, especially in preoperative planning. Additionally, a ranula can be indistinguishable from an epidermoid cyst based on CT and sonography, but the absence of restricted diffusion on MRI establishes the diagnosis.

	- **Fig. 5**: Simple ranula. (a) Axial and (b) coronal contrast-enhanced CT images demonstrate a well-circumscribed fluid attenuation lesion within the left sublingual space.
	- **Fig. 6**: Sublingual space ranula. (a) Axial T2-weighted MR image shows a high-signal lesion within the left sublingual space. (b) Axial diffusion-weighted image and (c) ADC map demonstrate lack of restricted diffusion, confirming the diagnosis, as opposed to an epidermoid cyst which would have restricted diffusion.

### Lingual abscess: Diagnosis and treatment [^113YaGKh]. Head & Neck (2004). Low credibility.

Lingual abscesses are very rare, and consequently, individual surgeons often lack experience in diagnosing and treating this condition. We present four cases of lingual abscesses that were diagnosed and treated over the past two years.

- **Methods**: The medical records, films, and charts of four patients with lingual abscess were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical presentation, radiographic features, treatment, and outcomes of the cases were examined.

- **Results**: Diagnosis was obtained by clinical examination and CT. In all cases, we avoided incision and drainage and preferred draining the abscess and aspirating pus with a large-bore needle through the inferior surface of the tongue. All patients responded remarkably well and did not experience any recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Lingual abscesses are rare conditions. In contrast to the approach in most deep neck space infections, a more conservative therapeutic approach by needle aspiration is effective. This method has the advantages of not exacerbating the edema of the tongue and avoiding airway compromise.

- **Symptoms**: A wide variety of symptoms have been reported depending on the site of the mass, including tongue discomfort, bleeding, pain, and difficulty in oral feeding. Roy et al. reported that bleeding from the tongue surface, pain, and eating difficulty were alleviated by cauterization.

- **Functions**: In most patients who exhibited functional impairment, the lesions were so extended that they were no longer indications for one-time surgical resection. Large masses located at sites such as the tongue base cause respiratory disturbances, swallowing disorders, and difficulty in speech. According to the report by Azizkhan et al., oral intake of normally cooked food became possible in 14, and normal vocalization became possible in eight of the 21 patients with tongue base lesions. Additionally, five of the 17 patients who needed tracheotomy were weaned.

- **Cosmetic improvements**: Objective evaluation of cosmetic effects is also difficult. Azizkhan et al. reported that, of the 20 patients, excluding one with severe deformity who died, deformities of structures around the tongue, such as the mandible and maxilla, were mild in six, moderate in five, and severe in nine. There have been a few reports that cosmetic improvements were also observed in patients who showed a reduction in tongue size by surgical resection, but objective evaluation is insufficient.

Complications, including facial nerve paralysis, vagus nerve paralysis, infection, hematoma, seroma, salivary leakage, ruptured suture, and skin failure, have been documented, though the properties of the lesions are unclear in some papers.

### The ptotic tongue-imaging appearance and pathology localization along the course of the hypoglossal nerve [^111P36tc]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

CT and MRI findings of tongue ptosis and atrophy should alert radiologists to potential pathology along the course of the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII), a purely motor cranial nerve that supplies the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue. While relatively specific for hypoglossal nerve pathology, these findings do not accurately localize the site or cause of denervation. A detailed understanding of the anatomic extent of the nerve, which crosses multiple anatomic spaces, is essential to identify possible underlying pathology, ranging from benign postoperative changes to life-threatening medical emergencies. This review describes key imaging findings of tongue denervation, segmental anatomy of the hypoglossal nerve, imaging optimization, and comprehensive imaging examples of diverse pathology that may affect the hypoglossal nerve. Armed with this knowledge, radiologists will increase their sensitivity for the detection of pathology and provide clinically relevant differential diagnoses when faced with findings of tongue ptosis and denervation.

### Clinical reasoning: A 65-year-old woman with isolated macroglossia as the initial presentation of a rare disease [^1146CSgB]. Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Macroglossia can be seen in multiple conditions, but its evaluation becomes more challenging when approached as an isolated presenting symptom. This is a case of a 65-year-old patient with isolated progressive tongue hypertrophy of unclear etiology for 5 years. We navigate the causes of macroglossia and discuss the clinical and diagnostic procedures that helped us narrow the differential diagnoses for our patient. We emphasize searching for evidence of more systemic involvement and the use of appropriate genetic testing to change the course of the disease and avoid therapeutic delay.

### Tongue lymphangioma in adult [^111K3zan]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphangioma is a benign, hamartomatous tumor of the lymphatic channels. It is usually found in the head and neck region. Most lymphangiomas are present at birth and are typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood. When lymphangioma occurs in the mouth, the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is the most commonly affected region. A risk of secondary growth is classically described after surgical reduction. In this paper, we present nine cases of tongue lymphangioma and provide a literature review of tongue lymphangioma.

### Clinicopathological analysis of extraneural sporadic haemangioblastoma occurring in the tongue [^1134zT2v]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A Chinese man in his early 40s presented with symptoms of snoring and hoarseness for over 1 year, which had worsened in the previous week. During a routine physical examination, his physician discovered a faint, red mass with an uneven surface at the base of the tongue. The tumor exhibited no tenderness or adhesion, and its mobility was acceptable. Other general and elemental physical examinations were negative. The patient was born and lived in Guangdong, China, and had no relevant family or personal medical history.

Subsequent indirect laryngoscopy revealed a mass at the left base of the tongue, measuring approximately 1.5 × 1.0 cm. Further contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans of the oropharynx and mandible identified an uneven oval mass measuring nearly 4.6 × 3.9 cm, with a relatively clear boundary, located in the body and left root of the tongue. CT and MRI enhancement scans indicated inhomogeneous contrast enhancement within the mass. Chest CT and ECG revealed no additional abnormal findings.

- **CT imaging**: Figure 1 illustrates the lesion on the left side of the tongue (red arrow), which demonstrates slightly low density on the non-contrast CT scan (A) and is significantly enhanced on the arterial phase CT scan (B), with measurements of about 46 × 39 mm.

The tumor underwent a radical resection. The entire mass was sampled, routinely fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin post-surgery, embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned into a series of 4 μm thick slices from each paraffin-embedded block. These sections were stained with H&E and evaluated by three professional pathologists.

### Characteristics of retained foreign bodies in the tongue: A retrospective study of 35 cases [^111bnUTG]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

There are only a few case reports of foreign bodies (FBs) in the tongue, and delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis is commonly reported. The purpose of this study was to identify the demographic, clinical, and radiological features that might facilitate the diagnosis of retained FBs in the tongue.

A retrospective case series was performed. Clinical and imaging data of patients with FBs in the tongue at Wuhan University Hospital of Stomatology were reviewed. The outcome variable was a preliminary, radiological, intraoperative, or pathological diagnosis. Covariates included age, sex, FB-related history, symptoms and signs, duration, and computed tomography (CT) imaging features. Descriptive statistics were computed for each study variable.

Thirty-five patients were included, with a mean age of 54.5 ± 11.2 years and 19 males (54.3%). Eighty percent of the patients reported FB-related history with a mean duration of 4 weeks. More than 70% of the patients presented with tongue swelling. Approximately half of the 35 cases were preliminarily misdiagnosed, and 15 of them were initially suspected to be tumors. After CT examinations, 33 of the 35 cases were diagnosed as FB. A characteristic CT imaging feature of the FB was a radiopaque line. Most FBs were located at the anterior two-thirds and marginal area of the tongue and in an oblique direction. The depth of FB was 0.61 ± 0.42 cm. The superficial ends of most FBs were close to the surface of the dorsum and the tongue margin.

The possibility of a retained FB should be included in the differential diagnosis when patients present with tongue symptoms.

### Acute airway obstruction requiring nasotracheal intubation following hypoglossal neuromonitoring: a case report [^111bqtoR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Acute lingual swelling is a potentially life-threatening phenomenon that can lead to rapid airway compromise. Generally, causes of acute lingual swelling include hemorrhage, edema, infarction, and infection. Postoperative macroglossia is a known complication of neurological procedures, especially among craniotomies conducted in the sitting position. In these cases, extreme neck flexion likely results in impaired venous drainage of the tongue, leading to edema. In our case, the patient was positioned ¾ prone, and the head was flexed at approximately 10 degrees. It is possible this amount of flexion could have resulted in partial local venous compression or lymphatic obstruction. Additionally, if arterial or venous flow was partially obstructed during the prolonged procedure, reperfusion injury following the procedure likely contributed to this patient's presentation.

Another likely etiology in this case is hematoma formation caused by traumatic arterial injury secondary to electrode placement. Evaluation by otolaryngology revealed that while there was no surface hematoma that could be drained, the needle electrode may have caused arterial injury within the deep tissue, causing postoperative lingual swelling once removed. The tongue is a relatively well-vascularized structure, receiving blood supply from the lingual artery and its branches. Cases of penetrating injury to the tongue resulting in disruption of the lingual artery, causing edema and airway compromise, have previously been described. Several studies have also identified anticoagulation therapy as a risk factor for such occurrences.

### Outlandish manifestation of swelling in early childhood seen in the patient's floor of the mouth [^115T1Lze]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Ranula is a cyst-like growth that occurs in the oral cavity beneath the tongue. It consists of saliva from a ruptured salivary gland or duct. Rather than just flowing directly from the glands into the oral cavity, saliva permeates the nearby connective tissues and creates a bubble. A ranula could indeed appear at any time in a person's life for inexplicable reasons. Trauma such as an oral operation, a facial blow, or nibbling the lower lip may possibly initiate one.

This is a case study of an early childhood boy who presented with a swelling in the floor of the mouth with unknown etiology for the last six months.

### A 66-year-old woman with fever, cough, and a tongue lesion [^112ejWRf]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old woman presented with an acute onset of fever, chills, and a productive cough associated with right-sided chest pain. During a recent hospitalization for dyspnea, she had been diagnosed with Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and had been taking a tapering dose of prednisone starting approximately six weeks prior to admission. In the interim, her dyspnea had resolved on treatment with steroids. At the time of presentation, her prednisone dose was 40 mg.

Additional medical history included venous thromboembolism, for which the patient was receiving anticoagulation therapy, and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus. Many years earlier, she had been treated for tuberculosis in her home country. The patient had immigrated to Queens, New York, from a Nepalese village eight years prior. While still in Nepal, she had worked on a farm and had been in close proximity to cows.

In Queens, she lived with her family in a house with a small garden but had no pets. Recent travel included a visit to Nepal nine months ago and a trip to Syracuse, New York, one month prior to presentation. She was a never smoker and did not consume alcohol.

### Tongue base schwannoma: Report, review, and unique surgical approach [^112VitkP]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Base of tongue schwannomas are exceedingly rare and therefore often are not immediately included in the differential diagnosis and treatment of oropharyngeal tumors. After a thorough review of the English literature, we found only six previously reported cases of tongue base schwannomas. We are contributing a report of a 37-year-old woman with progressive dysphagia, dysarthria, and large tongue base schwannoma. Diagnosis was confirmed by imaging studies and biopsy followed by surgical excision designed to preserve nerve function.

A number of surgical approaches have been described for tongue base schwannomas. Each has its own degree of postoperative morbidity. The use of a unilateral transcervical incision with blunt dissection was simple and quickly accomplished with protection of nearby nerves. Histologic identification of Antoni A and B areas along with strong and diffuse staining with S-100 stain pathologically completed the diagnosis of schwannoma.

A thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC) is a common embryological remnant that typically presents as an anterior neck mass; however, this malformation can occur in any adjacent area, including the tongue base (lingual type), along the migration path of the thyroid during embryonic development. Lingual TGDC is often quiescent until infection occurs. Supraglottitis, or inflammation of the supraglottis, is a potentially life-threatening disease. Because of the anatomical proximity of lingual TGDC to the supraglottis, lingual TGDC infection might be related to a presentation of supraglottitis.

A 49-year-old male initially presented with clinical symptoms of acute supraglottitis. After intensive medical treatment resulting in no improvement, a computed tomography scan was performed, raising the suspicion of an infected lingual TGDC. Transoral marsupialization using a rigid laryngoscope was performed to drain the abscess inside the cyst. A diagnosis of lingual TGDC was made based on the characteristic histological pattern of the lesion. After treatment, a follow-up computed tomography scan showed no evidence of recurrence.

To the authors' knowledge, only a few reports have pointed out similarities in the clinical and radiological findings between acute supraglottitis and an infected lingual TGDC. Clinicians should consider lingual TGDC during the differential diagnosis of supraglottitis, especially in patients with poor response to medical treatment.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^114iC9Xs]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

**Learning points**: Giant cell arteritis can result in a wide range of symptoms due to the extensive distribution of the external carotid artery. Face and neck swelling and trismus are under-recognised features of giant cell arteritis and can be transient prior to developing classic giant cell arteritis symptoms. Trismus can occur in isolation from jaw claudication in giant cell arteritis. We recommend that any patient above the age of 50, who presents with face and neck swelling or trismus, should have giant cell arteritis considered as a differential diagnosis.

### The ptotic tongue-imaging appearance and pathology localization along the course of the hypoglossal nerve [^115WDhyy]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Tumors, both benign and malignant, are the most common cause of nerve damage at the skull base (intracanalicular) segment (Fig. 6). These tumors may extend from the skull base itself, resulting in erosion and destruction of the hypoglossal canal within the occipital bone. The most common malignant tumors are metastases from breast, lung, and prostate primary malignancies. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma may extend directly through the skull base, affecting the hypoglossal nerve.

- **Fig. 6: Lesions involving the intracanalicular segment of the hypoglossal nerve**.
	- Axial T1W in a 44-year-old patient with chronic left-sided tongue weakness demonstrates a dumbbell-shaped mass (dot) extending from the left cerebellomedullary cistern, causing smooth remodeling of the hypoglossal canal (arrows).
	- Axial post-gadolinium T1W in the same patient confirms marked, homogenous enhancement of the mass (dot), subsequently proven to be a schwannoma by fine needle aspiration.
	- Axial SSFP in a 55-year-old male with multiple right lower cranial neuropathies demonstrates a mass (dot) occupying the right jugular bulb, with involvement of the right hypoglossal nerve (arrow) within the hypoglossal canal and with partial occlusion of the sigmoid sinus (s) and the internal jugular vein (v).
	- Axial post-gadolinium T1W in the same patient as previous confirms enhancement of the mass, which was later biopsy proven to be a jugular paraganglioma.
	- Axial CT bone reconstructions following intravenous iodinated contrast in a patient with a history of metastatic NSCLC demonstrates permeative erosion of the left basi-occipital region.

### Characteristics of lingual thyroglossal duct cysts under flexible laryngoscopy and treatment approaches [^114qUgNS]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2022). Low credibility.

Lingual thyroglossal duct cysts (LTGDCs) are clinically rare and often misdiagnosed as epiglottic cysts, leading to mistreatment. Simple and accurate diagnosis is crucial. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of LTGDCs with flexible laryngoscopy and imaging, improve their diagnosis, and explore surgical methods for patients undergoing an initial operation and those with recurrence.

In total, 10 patients with LTGDCs were admitted from April 2014 to December 2020. By reviewing the diagnosis and treatment of the first typical case, the characteristics of LTGDCs under flexible laryngoscopy were summarized. Based on these characteristic manifestations, a clinical diagnosis of LTGDC was correctly made in the other 9 patients. All patients underwent preoperative CT of the neck with sagittal reconstruction and thyroid ultrasound.

Of the 10 patients, the first 2 had recurrent LTGDCs after several operations and underwent Sistrunk surgery. The remaining 8 were newly diagnosed and underwent endoscopic radical resection with low-temperature coblation. Among these, 7 experienced no recurrence, while 1 required Sistrunk surgery after developing short-term recurrence. All patients were followed up for 5 months to 6 years after the last operation and remained without recurrence.

LTGDCs can be easily misdiagnosed as epiglottic cysts in clinical practice. A correct clinical diagnosis can be based on the characteristic features observed through flexible laryngoscopy.

### Intralingual mucous extravasation cyst: An uncommon lingual cyst [^117SD4L8]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We present a rare case of an intralingual ranula. The discussion includes differential diagnosis, etiology, diagnostic features, and management.

- **Case report**: An 18-year-old man presented with a mass extending along the ventral surface of the tongue up to the tip. The computed tomography scan clearly defined the extent of a cystic lesion, leading to the pathological diagnosis of an intralingual ranula.

- **Conclusion**: Lingual cysts exhibit varied etiology. The diagnosis relies on histological examination of the cyst wall. Conservative resection followed by histological examination is the standard of care.

### Acute tongue swelling, the only initial manifestation of carotid artery dissection: a case report with differentiation of clinical picture [^113sshMV]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

While it is well known that carotid artery dissection can cause hypoglossal palsy, leading to muscle atrophy and fat tissue replacement in the chronic stage, the acute edematous stage, which can mimic tongue angioedema, is less recognized. We present a case of a 52-year-old man who reported to the accident and emergency department with a 3-hour history of right-side tongue swelling. Initially diagnosed with angioedema, he was treated with corticosteroids and antihistamines. However, his tongue swelling persisted, and he subsequently developed unilateral weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the tongue, head, and neck revealed denervation of the right half of the tongue due to hypoglossal nerve injury during extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection. There was no evidence of ischemic complication in the right cerebral artery distribution. He was commenced on antiplatelet therapy as a prophylactic measure to prevent cerebral ischemia. Swelling and weakness of the tongue subsided in the following months. We believe that hypoglossal palsy caused by ICA dissection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute tongue swelling.

### Unusual presentation of lipoma on the tongue [^1168Kq3u]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Lipomas are benign soft tissue neoplasms that rarely occur in the oral cavity. Of the total reported cases of lipoma, only about 15% to 20% have occurred in the head and neck region, with the tongue being an even rarer site, accounting for roughly 4% of cases. These tumors are slow-growing and usually asymptomatic. However, when they grow to a large size, they can hinder the physiological processes associated with the area. This case report describes the diagnostic features of tongue lipoma with a brief review of the literature.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^111UXTex]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Face and neck swelling is a non-specific sign with a lengthy list of differential diagnoses. Temporal fossa swelling is well recognized in giant cell arteritis; however, face and neck swelling is less common, occurring in 6.5% of cases. The swelling follows a waning and waxing pattern and may be due to spasm and collateralization of the facial artery. The raised inflammatory markers can cause physicians to treat the initial presentation as an infection and to attribute the resolution of swelling to antibiotic response, as illustrated in our case.

Trismus (reduced jaw opening) has a prevalence of 6.8% in giant cell arteritis but is seldom reported due to its overlap with jaw claudication. Our case demonstrates that trismus can occur in isolation from jaw claudication. The mechanism for trismus in giant cell arteritis is uncertain but is thought to be due to restricted blood flow to the masseter muscles via distal branches of the external carotid arteries. Interestingly, the patient developed subclinical hyperthyroidism during her admission, though it is uncertain if this is related to giant cell arteritis affecting the superior thyroid or a sick euthyroid state. Thyroid dysfunction has been described in giant cell arteritis, though no clear correlation was established due to the overlapping patient epidemiology of giant cell arteritis and thyroid diseases.

The third presentation with airway narrowing led to a revisit of the patient's diagnosis and presented as one of the first cases of CT-documented airway narrowing secondary to giant cell arteritis.

### Lingual hamartomas: Clinical characteristics, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcomes [^111Kjvcm]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

To further clinically characterize lingual hamartomas, and to consolidate literature by analyzing clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and outcomes, this study presents a retrospective chart and literature review.

- **Methods**: A case series from 1989 to 2020 at a tertiary pediatric center was examined, with follow-up ranging from 2 months to 12 years. The study considered patient demographics, clinical presentations, physical examination findings, surgical pathology, operative methods, pre-operative imaging, and follow-up. Additionally, a review of English-language literature from 1945 to 2020 was conducted.

- **Results**: Seven patients (four male, three female) with nine lingual hamartomas were identified. The average age at surgical excision was 7.9 months (SD 3.5 months, range 3 to 14 months). Follow-up ranged from 2 months to 12 years, with all patients having no recurrence. Physical examination identified five pedunculated hamartomas and two sessile hamartomas. One patient had a neck CT, one had a neck ultrasound, and two had facial MRIs. CT and ultrasounds confirmed the presence of cervical thyroid. MRI suggested no muscular invasion for one patient, whereas motion artifact obscured findings for the other patient. Most patients who presented with dysphagia or poor weight gain achieved post-surgical improvement. The present cases, combined with the literature review, identified 57 patients with 63 lingual hamartomas.

- **Conclusions**: Lingual hamartomas appear as hypovascular pedunculated masses near the foramen cecum. There is no demographic predisposition, and most are identified during infancy. Imaging is typically used for evaluation.

### Unilateral tongue swelling: an unusual presentation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related angioedema [^112GoACe]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Angioedema is a rare but potentially fatal complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) treatment. This class of drugs is widely used in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac failure, and other common conditions. This case report discusses a male patient in his 60s who presented with acute swelling of the right side of his tongue, an unusual manifestation of angioedema, which typically involves bilateral swelling of orofacial structures. Accurate and early identification of this complication affords the opportunity for early, potentially life-saving intervention during the acute episode and also cessation of the treatment, reducing the risk of recurrence in the future.

This case is one of only a few reported in English-language medical literature and the first from Africa, suggesting either rarity or under-reporting. The case contributes to the understanding of ACEi-induced angioedema, particularly in Africa where hypertension is prevalent and ACEi is commonly used.

### Congenital lingual cysts [^112WsLkt]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Congenital lingual cysts are rare congenital tumors of the oropharynx, which should be suspected when the tongue appears enlarged by a mass. Prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound allows for optimal management at the time of delivery because the mass can obstruct the airways. Surgical treatment is indicated only if the cyst enlarges and hinders feeding or breathing; otherwise, it can sometimes spontaneously regress, so surgery is done a few months after birth.

### Clinical practice guideline: Evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^114WGu6w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective: Neck masses are common in adults, yet the underlying etiology is often elusive. While the majority of neck masses in children result from infections, persistent neck masses in adults frequently indicate neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms overwhelmingly surpass other etiologies for adult neck masses. An asymptomatic neck mass might be the initial or sole clinical manifestation of head and neck cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland cancer. Evidence underscores that adult neck masses should be presumed malignant until proven otherwise. Timely diagnosis of a neck mass, especially due to metastatic HNSCC, is critical since delays adversely impact tumor staging and prognosis.

Despite significant advancements in diagnostic modalities over recent decades, delays in diagnosis remain prevalent. Currently, only one evidence-based clinical practice guideline exists to aid clinicians in assessing adult neck masses. Furthermore, available information is often fragmented, disorganized, or concentrated on specific etiologies. Although literature exists on the diagnostic accuracy of individual tests, guidance on the rational sequencing of tests in clinical care is sparse. This guideline seeks to provide a coherent, evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to evaluating neck masses, aiming to enable prompt diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

Purpose: The primary aim of this guideline is to promote the efficient, effective evaluation of neck masses in adults.

### Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome in childhood: A challenge in differential diagnosis and treatment [^112Zh536]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Facial palsy and orofacial swelling in childhood represent a challenge in differential diagnosis for paediatricians and dermatologists. One possible entity, Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS), is a rarity in childhood. We describe a 9-year-old girl with the diagnosis of MRS who had episodic swelling of the upper lip and complete peripheral facial palsy, associated with herpes and bacterial infections. Therapeutic options for MRS in childhood are limited. Our patient benefited from a 2-month course of prednisolone 1 mg kg⁻¹ daily. We review previously published cases of MRS in childhood and discuss the differential diagnosis of orofacial swelling and facial palsy, as well as treatment options in children.

### Thyroglossal duct pathology and mimics [^115sygnV]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

In the evaluation of anterior neck masses in children and young adults, thyroglossal duct anomalies are at the top of the differential diagnosis. Subsequent diagnostic imaging, starting with an initial ultrasound examination followed by definitive CT and MR examinations, assists in diagnosing and assessing the anatomical extent and complications, as well as in pretreatment planning. Additionally, knowledge of the embryologic course of the thyroid improves diagnostic accuracy. Critical anatomical landmarks of thyroglossal duct anomalies and ectopic thyroid tissue include the foramen cecum at the tongue base, the hyoid bone, the thyroid cartilage, and the strap musculature.

This article aims to review the common and variant forms of thyroglossal duct anomalies. The anatomy of the embryologic descent of the thyroid gland will first be reviewed, followed by the imaging characteristics of thyroglossal duct cysts and ectopic thyroid tissue. Variant forms and complications of thyroglossal duct cysts will also be reviewed. To strengthen the diagnostic accuracy of thyroglossal duct anomalies, similarly appearing cystic anterior neck masses will be discussed with a focus on key differentiating features.

- **Anatomy and embryology**: The thyroglossal duct is a transient, epithelial-lined midline channel that serves as the path of descent of the thyroid primordium from the foramen cecum, located at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and posterior third of the tongue, down to the thyroid cartilage, where definitive thyroid formation occurs. The inferior portion of the duct may develop into the pyramidal lobe.

### Acute abscess of the base of the tongue: a rare but important emergency [^117W8fRg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Acute posterior lingual abscess is rare but may potentially compromise the airway acutely. Lingual abscesses call for prompt and aggressive management because they are potentially life-threatening infections. It is crucial to differentiate between anterior lingual abscess (the most common) and posterior third lingual abscess.

- **Case report**: A young man who experienced the beginnings of dyspnea and total aphagia presented to the emergency department. A posterior lingual abscess was identified on a computed tomography scan.

- **Discussion**: Multi-antimicrobial therapy is the cornerstone of treatment. Surgical drainage is also of critical importance for preventing deeper spread of the infection.

- **Conclusion**: We present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians and head and neck surgeons of the clinical findings of acute abscess of the base of the tongue, which can be difficult to diagnose clinically. Imaging of the oral cavity and pharynx is the key to the diagnosis and choosing the best surgical strategy.

### Tongue swelling in the recovery room: A case report and discussion of postoperative angioedema [^117UJoU2]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

We present a case of potentially life-threatening postoperative swelling of the tongue and oropharynx that developed in the postanesthesia care unit in a patient taking lisinopril. The principal treatment of angioedema is the discontinuation of the precipitating agent and airway management. Patients with swelling limited to the face and oral cavity may only require monitoring. However, those with swelling in the floor of the mouth, tongue, and supraglottic or glottic areas should have their airway secured by tracheal intubation immediately. Early intubation in patients displaying these characteristics may decrease the incidence of emergent surgical airways. Angioedema is self-limiting, and the swelling usually resolves spontaneously in two to three days. Proper identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema requiring a timely airway intervention may reduce mortality, and recognition of its self-limiting course can prevent unnecessary tracheostomy.

### ESCMID rapid guidelines for assessment and management of long COVID [^1132mkzF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for long COVID, specifically in terms of differential diagnosis, the ESCMID 2022 guidelines recommend excluding other serious or life-threatening conditions. This includes prior overlooked conditions such as malignancy and complications of acute COVID-19, like thromboembolic events, myopericarditis, and encephalitis, before diagnosing long COVID in symptomatic patients. Physicians should evaluate for other conditions guided by symptoms, signs, and additional tests obtained at their discretion.

### Kaposi sarcoma at the base of the tongue in a renal transplant patient [^114QnZfn]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Clinically, Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) strongly resembles certain vascular lesions, including haemangiomas, lymphangiomas, arteriovenous malformations, ecchymosis, low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and bacillary angiomatosis. It may resemble pyogenic granuloma or peripheral giant cell proliferation when present on the alveolar ridge.

From the differential diagnostic perspective, pathologies that should be considered include well-differentiated angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, arteriovenous malformations, Kaposiform haemangioendothelioma, spindle cell haemangioendothelioma, and bacillary angiomatosis.

Given the wide range of differential diagnoses that can be confused with oral Kaposi's sarcoma (OKS), an accurate clinical history and biopsy are necessary to ascertain a precise diagnosis of KS and distinguish it from other lesions.

### Therapeutic response to thalidomide in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome: a case report [^112XzhhC]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by a triad of symptoms: orofacial swelling, relapsing facial palsy, and a fissured tongue. A differential diagnosis must be made with other granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis and oral Crohn disease; however, the histologic findings of noncaseating, sarcoidal granulomas support the diagnosis of MRS.

- **Results**: Many therapeutic modalities have been described for this disease. In this case report, we present a patient with MRS treated with thalidomide due to the identification of tumor necrosis factor alpha in the lesion by immunohistochemical analysis. This is the first reported detection of tumor necrosis factor alpha in an MRS lesion and the first reported use of thalidomide to treat this clinical condition.

### Glossal abscess as a complication of tongue-base suspension surgery [^113dNmZD]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately 60 cases of tongue abscess have been reported in the English-language literature over the past 30 years. We report what we believe is the first case of a glossal abscess that arose as a complication of tongue-base suspension surgery. The patient was a 31-year-old man who presented with a several-day history of odynophagia, tongue swelling, voice changes, and increased snoring. Two years earlier, he had undergone a tongue-base suspension procedure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a tongue abscess. During peroral incision and drainage, a knotted 0 Prolene suture was discovered within the abscess cavity. The suture was removed, the area was thoroughly irrigated, a drain was placed in the abscess cavity, and the incision was loosely closed. On postoperative day 5, repeat CT revealed resolution of the abscess, and the patient was discharged on oral antibiotics. Although glossal abscess is very rare, physicians should consider it in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with lingual swelling following tongue-base suspension surgery.

### Thyroglossal duct cyst at the base of tongue: The emerging role of transoral endoscopic-assisted surgery [^116EZLjP]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Cystic lesions involving the tongue base are rare and generally present in pediatric patients, encompassing different pathologies such as ranula, lingual ectopic thyroid, thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC), dysontogenetic cysts, benign, and malignant tumors. This paper describes the case of a 19-year-old girl experiencing phonation impairment and mild dysphagia due to limited tongue protrusion and movement. Radiologic examinations revealed a bulky cystic lesion at the base of the tongue with displacement of extrinsic lingual muscles. A minimally invasive transoral removal of the mass was performed with the assistance of an endoscopic system. The histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of intralingual TDC. After 2 years of clinical and radiologic follow-up, no recurrence of the disease was observed, and the patient remained completely asymptomatic. This experience suggests that the endoscopic-assisted transoral removal of intralingual TDC can be a safe and effective alternative to traditional transcervical surgery and transoral robotic surgery, providing very appealing cosmetic results and encouraging functional outcomes in terms of phonation and swallowing. Preoperative radiologic examinations are recommended for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate selection of patients.

### Adolescent tongue base tumour with diagnostic histopathological dilemma [^113pPp9f]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma arising from minor salivary glands at the base of the tongue is rare. Surgical excision of the tumors remains the primary treatment of choice. The prognosis of this tumor depends on optimum clearance of the disease surgically, clinical staging, and histopathological grading. Postoperatively, radiotherapy depends on the grading and histopathological features of the tumor. Long-term follow-up is a must to detect early recurrences of oropharyngeal tumors. In our case, the tumor was removed by the transoral route because it was a limited tumor and for better postoperative functional outcomes. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were advised to address the perineural invasion and residual tumor of the base of the tongue region.

### Focal myositis of the tongue presenting as macroglossia [^111rhCL5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Focal myositis (FM) is a benign localized inflammatory process of unknown aetiology, often presenting as a rapidly enlarging soft-tissue mass that evolves into a localized lesion. It is most frequently mistaken for a neoplasm. Histologically, FM is characterized by marked myopathic changes of the muscle fibers, lymphocytic infiltration, and interstitial fibrosis. We describe a case of focal myositis of the tongue and review this rare condition.

Symmetrical lipomatosis of the tongue is an extremely rare condition; as of the time of writing, only eight cases have been reported in the literature. We present an extremely rare case of intramuscular lipomatosis of the tongue in a 67-year-old male. The present case is unique due to its infiltrating nature and the extension of the lesion. A glossectomy was performed to reduce the size of the tongue and for diagnostic purposes. The literature is reviewed, and clinical characteristics, pathology, and surgical treatment are discussed.

### A hemangioma on the floor of the mouth presenting as a ranula [^116xyBvP]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

A painless, bluish, submucosal swelling on one side of the floor of the mouth usually indicates the presence of a ranula. Rarely, such swelling may be caused by an inflammatory disease process in a salivary gland, a neoplasm in the sublingual salivary gland, a lymphatic nodular swelling, or embryologic cysts. We report a patient with swelling in the floor of her mouth that was clinically diagnosed as a ranula. During surgery, suspicion arose that it was a vascular tumor and, upon histologic testing, the swelling was confirmed to be a hemangioma. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a hemangioma presenting as a ranula.

First, the initial biopsy suggested a diagnosis of granulation tissue-type capillary haemangioma based on the histological morphology. One week later, a radical resection of the mass in the left tongue base and mouth floor was successfully completed. The tumour was highly vascularised and demarcated from the surrounding tissues with focal slight adhesion. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery under general postoperative treatment for approximately 22 days.

### Intermittent facial swelling [^112kKmWs]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Intermittent facial swelling is an unusual presentation in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis may include a variety of causes. The most common differential diagnosis is angio-oedema. However, more serious conditions such as superior vena caval obstruction must not be ignored. This case report presents a patient who was investigated in the hospital for two weeks (across two admissions) with intermittent facial swelling. He presented to the emergency department for a third admission and was diagnosed with superior vena caval obstruction secondary to metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma. He underwent emergency endovascular stenting; however, he died within a few weeks.

### Clinicopathological analysis of extraneural sporadic haemangioblastoma occurring in the tongue [^117JGCiK]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Differential diagnosis**: Histologically, haemangioblastoma consists of vast capillary blood vessels, so it is frequently confused with vasculogenic diseases such as haemangioma, haemangioendothelioma, and haemangiosarcoma. However, three main characteristics could facilitate the diagnosis: (1) the lack of stromal cells, (2) clear or microvacuolated cytoplasm, and (3) specific immunohistochemistry markers. The most distinguishing morphological feature of haemangioblastoma is the presence of numerous lipid-containing vacuoles, appearing in the typical clear-cell morphology, resembling metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC).

Patients with VHL-associated haemangioblastoma are prone to consolidate RCC, adding to the complexity of this differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry is useful for distinguishing haemangioblastoma from RCC. PAX2(+) or PAX8(+) combined with α-inhibin (−) enhances the diagnosis of metastatic ccRCC, while the opposite profile supports the diagnosis of haemangioblastoma. Furthermore, ccRCC with tongue metastasis is fairly rare, and the follow-up of this patient shows no evidence or signs of lesions in other sites.

### Japanese clinical practice guidelines for vascular anomalies 2017 [^112CvgC8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Is surgical resection effective for LM of the tongue? Surgical resection is effective for reducing the size of the lesion and alleviating symptoms and functional impairment. However, total resection is often difficult, and careful decision-making is required due to the possibility of complications and recurrence.

- **Strength of recommendation**: 2 (weak).
- **Evidence**: D (very weak).

While the tongue is one of the frequent sites of LM, the lesion often extends widely over the neck rather than being localized to the tongue. LM of the tongue not only causes cosmetic problems, such as protrusion from the mouth and bleeding, but can also occupy the oropharyngeal cavity. This results in functional issues such as difficulty in closing the mouth, speaking, respiratory disturbances, and impairment of oral food intake. These conditions are typically treated in departments such as plastic surgery, oral surgery, otorhinolaryngology, and pediatric surgery.

LM of the tongue can be treated by surgical resection or sclerotherapy. A comprehensive evaluation of individual cases is necessary, considering the distribution of the lesion in the tongue, involvement of other areas, cyst components, and vascular distribution. Additionally, general information, such as the risk of complications and recurrence related to each treatment option, is critical for informed decision-making.

### Thyroglossal duct cyst: An unusual presentation [^116DAGTY]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Most thyroglossal duct cysts are located at or very close to the midline. They generally manifest as painless neck swellings, and they move on protrusion of the tongue and during deglutition. We describe a case of a thyroglossal duct cyst that was unusual in that the cyst was located far from the midline, it did not move on protrusion of the tongue, and it was associated with symptoms of dysphagia and extensive neck swelling that mimicked a colloid goiter.

### Update on endoscopic management of lingual thyroglossal duct cysts [^114bACz2]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Thyroglossal duct cysts (TGDC) are uncommon congenital midline neck masses arising from tubal remnants of embryologic thyroid descent. A rare variant of TGDC can present in the central tongue base and is named lingual TGDC (LTGDC). Left untreated, LTGDC may present with life-threatening airway obstruction. TGDC require surgery for cure; however, the surgical approach to LTGDC has not been fully discussed. This study was designed to examine the incidence, clinical features, and surgical management of LTGDC.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Methods**: Retrospective chart review of patients from a pediatric tertiary care institution diagnosed with lingual TGDC from 1997 to 2008.

- **Results**: One hundred eighty-nine patients underwent surgical excision of TGDC, of which 16 (8.5%; mean age, 3 years) presented with lingual TGDC alone. Most lingual TGDC were discovered incidentally, although seven patients (44%) presented with moderate to severe upper airway obstruction. Endoscopic transoral excision was performed in each case. This included suspension laryngoscopy with electrocautery, electrocautery, and cold dissection, or a combination of microdebridement and electrocautery. Most patients were intubated electively overnight for airway protection. All patients recovered without complication and have shown no evidence of recurrence (median follow-up, 3.7 years). Two LTGDC cases were revisions of prior surgeries (marsupialization and an open procedure) performed at outside hospitals.

- **Conclusions**: Although rare, LTGDC frequently present as a prominent issue in patients.

### A large swelling of the tongue [^113V1ugu]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Hyalinising clear cell carcinoma (HCCC) is an infrequent, distinct histological subtype of clear cell adenocarcinoma encountered in minor salivary glands, which can be confused with a variety of clear cell-rich tumors. The entity of HCCC should be considered in patients presenting with well-circumscribed, longstanding nodular enlargement without any other significant abnormality. HCCC is often difficult to diagnose due to its unusual presentation. This report presents a male patient who reported a two-month history of a large swelling on the tongue. The clinical, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the diagnosis of HCCC.

### Intramuscular lipoma of the tongue masquerading as angioedema [^117CrrPi]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In most cases, the diagnostic evaluation of angioedema is challenging, as there are many possible etiologies. We report a case of an infiltrating lipoma of the tongue that masqueraded as angioedema. The patient, a 68-year-old man, presented with tongue swelling that had followed a waxing and waning course over a 6-month period. Physical examination showed a diffusely enlarged tongue with no discrete mass. A laboratory evaluation for angioedema was unremarkable. After the patient's condition did not respond to treatment with antihistamines and oral prednisone, a further workup was initiated. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck and computed tomography of the oral cavity revealed only diffuse enlargement of the tongue. The patient underwent a tongue biopsy, which identified the cause of the swelling to be an infiltrating lipoma of the tongue. Clinicians should be aware that other causes of tongue swelling may mimic angioedema.

### Lingual thyroid in a young female: role of imaging [^112XHswL]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old girl presented with dysphagia and a feeling of fullness in the throat. On examination, a midline smooth, rubbery, and reddish mass was observed at the base of the tongue, which moved with deglutination and protrusion of the tongue. A thyroid function test was within normal limits. Ultrasonography revealed the absence of the thyroid gland in its normal position, with a smooth-contoured, round-shaped nodular mass at the tongue base displaying internal vascularity. The mass was hyperdense and homogeneously enhancing on post-contrast. A clinical diagnosis of ectopic lingual thyroid was made based on the ultrasonography and CT scan features.

### Paediatric submental epidermoid cyst [^1163115M]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A young girl presented with an insidious onset, gradually increasing midline submental swelling of 1-year duration and pain on swallowing for 6 months. Ultrasonography of the neck suggested a hypoechoic cystic swelling of the submental region between the muscles of the floor of the mouth, with no increased vascularity. An extraoral surgical enucleation was performed, and a postoperative biopsy suggested an epidermoid cyst. Epidermoid cysts of the submental region are extremely rare, and any midline head and neck lesion in children requires critical examination and evaluation to avoid complications. Here, we present a rare case of a paediatric submental epidermoid cyst along with its clinical features and management.

### Thyroglossal duct pathology and mimics [^116RYvHF]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Thyroglossal duct cysts arise if a portion of the thyroglossal duct persists, following cycles of infection and/or inflammation due to its lining with secretory epithelium. These cysts can form anywhere along the duct, with approximately 65% occurring at the infrahyoid level. Histologically, the cyst is composed of an epithelial lining, either squamous or pseudostratified ciliated columnar, with or without ectopic thyroid gland tissue. As secretions and debris accumulate, suprahyoid cysts can enlarge, penetrate the floor of the mouth, and descend into the anterior neck, leading to symptoms that result in clinical presentation. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common non-odontogenic cyst in the neck and the most prevalent pediatric cystic neck anomaly, making them significant to identify.

On imaging, suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cysts typically appear as midline simple or complex cystic structures, whereas infrahyoid cysts are usually paramedian. CT imaging reveals a smooth, thin-walled hypoattenuating mass. On MRI, the lesion presents high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, contingent on the proteinaceous or hemorrhagic content. Ultrasound usage, particularly in pediatric evaluation, shows a well-circumscribed anechoic to hypoechoic structure with posterior through transmission and potential internal debris.

### Recurrent lingual abscess in a child [^115MRfxb]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 14-month-old boy who developed a swelling of the tongue accompanied by fever, dyspnea during sleep, and dysphagia. An anterior lingual abscess was identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Subsequently, he developed four recurrent lingual abscesses. Pediatricians should be aware of this problem because it can be a life-threatening condition.

### Tongue base schwannoma presenting with dyspnea [^112VVrdF]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor arising from Schwann cells, with an exact etiology that remains unknown. Tongue base schwannoma is a remarkably rare form of schwannoma. Although it often presents with dysphagia and swelling, it may cause obstructive airway problems as its size increases. Since it affects all age groups, its differential diagnosis typically includes congenital, infectious masses, and benign/malignant neoplasia of vascular and mesenchymal origin. In this study, the authors report on a 43-year-old patient with tongue base schwannoma, and they also review the cases reported in the literature over the last 60 years in terms of mass size, primary presenting complaint, and surgical techniques preferred in the studies.

### Floor of mouth schwannoma mimicking a salivary gland neoplasm: A report of the case and review of the literature [^113RRqvX]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Schwannomas, or neurilemmomas, are slow-growing, benign, and often firm lumps that are typically painless. They are extremely rare in the oral cavity, with the tongue and the palate being the most common intraoral sites. This is a case report of such a pathology in the floor of the mouth. We present a case of a 28-year-old female patient with a 2-month history of swelling in the floor of the mouth. Upon clinical examination, the swelling was non-tender and appeared firm. An ultrasound of the lesion was performed, which revealed a well-defined, rounded, and low reflective soft tissue mass. Following an MRI scan and surgical excision of the lesion, a definitive diagnosis of schwannoma was made. The presence of schwannoma in the oral cavity is unusual. Based on the literature and the presented case, it should be considered a differential diagnosis until final histopathological confirmation.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to rare tongue lipoma [^114EL2di]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Lipomas are benign soft tissue tumors composed of mature adipocytes, commonly found in subcutaneous tissues. Despite their prevalence in various body regions, they are relatively rare in the oral and maxillofacial regions. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging characteristics, as well as the treatment outcomes, of 57 patients diagnosed with lipoma. Among these, 42 cases (73.7%) were located in the oral-maxillofacial and head-neck regions, predominantly in areas with relatively abundant adipose tissue, including the facial/cheek area, parotid region, submental/submandibular area, and neck.

In addition, this study presents a rare case of tongue lipoma in a 57-year-old male, highlighting the clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and treatment approach. The patient presented with a painless mass on the left side of the tongue that had gradually increased in size over 5 months. Physical examination revealed a firm, well-defined, moderately mobile mass measuring approximately 3.0×1.5 cm. Imaging, including enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, suggested a diagnosis of lipoma, leading to surgical excision. The excised mass was yellowish, encapsulated, and soft. Intraoperative frozen section biopsy confirmed it as a fat-derived tumor consistent with a lipoma, and postoperative pathological examination further identified it as a spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma. The patient experienced a smooth recovery without complications, with normal tongue function restored.

This case underscores the significance of including lipoma in the differential diagnosis of tongue masses.

### Base of tongue schwannoma: a case report [^113BkTXw]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Both malignant and benign lesions may be found on the base of the tongue, including metastasis from other sites. Various surgical approaches to the base of the tongue have been described. Here, we report a case of a 26-year-old woman with a schwannoma in the base of the tongue removed through a suprahyoid pharyngotomy approach. The biology and pathology of schwannoma in the oral cavity are discussed. The advantage of the suprahyoid pharyngotomy approach for complete excision of a mass in the base of the tongue is demonstrated.

### Prenatal diagnosis of enteric duplication cyst of the tongue [^116Jt3NY]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2004). Low credibility.

Cysts located on the tongue are rare and usually diagnosed in childhood. Here, we report on the prenatal diagnosis of an unusual cystic malformation of the tongue with heterotopic intestinal tissue, explored using prenatal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The surgical treatment and histological examination of the cyst are also discussed. The prenatal differential diagnoses, as well as the perinatal management of cystic lesions of the tongue, are reviewed.

### Macroglossia and lip edema: A case of paraproteinemia-associated scleredema responsive to intravenous immunoglobulins [^116Vmchg]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: While extracutaneous manifestations of scleredema have been described, such as buccal and parotid involvement, reports of tongue swelling are exceedingly rare. Ulmer et al. published a case of scleredema with tongue, pharyngeal, and esophageal involvement in a 75-year-old male with IgG lambda monoclonal gammopathy and sicca syndrome. Scleredema with tongue swelling can mimic other dermatologic disorders, such as systemic amyloidosis and lipoid proteinosis, which typically present with small lingual papules or ulcerations.

There is no consensus on a therapeutic protocol for the treatment of scleredema. Options for paraproteinemia-associated scleredema (PAS) include thalidomide, which has had limited success, particularly in the setting of IgA monoclonal gammopathy. One report showed successful treatment of PAS with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) after failing thalidomide. Our case further supports the use of IVIg in the management of PAS. Additionally, we recommend adding macroglossia and lip swelling as the initial presenting signs of PAS.

### Spontaneous lingual abscess in an immunocompromised patient [^111ErYS6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Acute lingual abscess is a rare yet life-threatening clinical entity that must be appropriately diagnosed and treated in the emergency department to avoid acute airway compromise. A 68-year-old woman on immunomodulatory medication for rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department with left facial pain and swelling. An anterior lingual abscess was diagnosed on a computed tomographic scan. The most common cause of lingual abscess is direct trauma, although an immunocompromised state is a predisposing risk factor.

Intravenous antibiotics are the primary treatment modality, with consideration given to adjunctive surgical drainage. We present this case to increase awareness surrounding this diagnosis among emergency physicians. Spontaneous lingual abscess should be considered in immunocompromised patients who present to the emergency department with tongue pain and edema, even in the absence of lingual trauma.

### Acute exacerbation of macroglossia leading to necrosis of the anterior third of the tongue [^115V5iar]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Macroglossia is defined as an enlarged tongue that protrudes beyond the teeth or alveolar ridge in the resting position. It may be classified into generalized and localized based on the extent of tongue involvement. Each group can be subdivided into congenital, inflammatory, traumatic, metabolic, and neoplastic lesions [Myer III CM, Hotaling AJ, Reilly JS. The diagnosis and treatment of macroglossia in children. Ear Nose Throat J 1986;65:444–8]. Congenital causes include vascular anomalies such as hemangioma and lymphovenous malformations.

In this case report, we examine a large lymphovenous malformation of the tongue in a 17-month-old child. The child developed an acute exacerbation of macroglossia following trauma, which eventually led to necrosis of the anterior third of the tongue, requiring a partial glossectomy.

### The evolving landscape of salivary gland tumors [^111RgUQW]. CA (2023). High credibility.

The most common presenting symptom of salivary malignancy is a painless parotid or neck mass. Sublingual gland malignancies may present at a late disease stage as a mass in the floor of the mouth. The presence of pain, a rapidly growing mass, facial weakness, or lingual weakness/paresthesias (in the case of sublingual tumors) are ominous signs that usually indicate high-grade malignancy.

It is important to note that the differential diagnoses of a swelling/mass lesion is broad. For this review, we focused on features of key primary salivary gland neoplasms; however, salivary gland involvement by nonneoplastic tumor-like conditions (i.e. nodular oncocytic hyperplasia, necrotizing sialometaplasia, salivary duct cyst, among others), mesenchymal neoplasms, hematolymphoid processes, direct extension of cutaneous malignancies, and metastases can also be observed and should be considered in the differential, depending on the clinical history and presentation, radiologic findings, and laboratory data.

### Angioedema as a predominant symptom of infection [^11498fZh]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Since the cause of the patient's hospitalization was severe, and due to the sustained development of facial swelling, the primary diagnostic investigation focused on ruling out possible causes for angioedema. At presentation, the patient's airway was unaffected, and there was no immediate need for airway protection. The patient remained stable without signs of anaphylaxis and did not develop hives or other skin symptoms. Several allergies were listed by the patient, but despite the potential for an allergic disposition, which was also mirrored by elevated IgE levels, treatment with glucocorticoids did not show any effect, and RAST testing was negative. The clinical symptoms, as well as the treatment resistance to antihistamines and steroids, made allergic, histamine-mediated angioedema unlikely.

There was no history of former episodes of angioedema, and no family members suffered from similar symptoms. On review, the patient had never taken ACE inhibitors, which ruled out ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, and she also denied recent intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or any new medications. Laboratory testing for complement factor C4 and C1-INH was added to rule out undiagnosed hereditary or acquired angioedema. Common causes of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, therefore, seemed equally unlikely.

We considered further differential diagnoses for facial swelling, such as hormonal dysfunctions. Normal thyroid function was not suggestive of myxedema. Cortisol and ACTH levels were within the normal range, thus not supporting Cushing's disease.

### Anatomy and pathology of the masticator space [^1112vqVm]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The pathology of the masticator space includes pseudolesions, inflammatory conditions, vascular lesions, and tumors. Intrinsic tumors of the space can be benign or malignant and arise from the nerves, mandible, or soft tissues. Secondary tumor extension to the masticator space is also common and may occur by direct extension or by perineural tumoral spread.

- **Inflammation**: Infections of the masticator space are more frequent than tumors and are often odontogenic in origin (i.e. tooth extraction, caries with severe gingivitis, etc). Less commonly, infections in this space may extend from an infection arising in the parotid or submandibular glands or a tonsillar abscess. When inflamed, the muscles appear enlarged and enhance in a non-homogeneous manner. Abscesses may be confined to the masticator space or be transpatial, manifesting as well-defined fluid collections surrounded by an irregularly enhancing capsule.

	- A 35-year-old man with an abscess in the masticator space: Axial and reformatted coronal contrast-enhanced CT images show a multiloculated fluid collection (white dots) with a gas bubble (black arrow) and enhancing walls, compatible with an abscess. The cause of the abscess was a tooth infection (white arrow pointing to an empty mandibular dental socket).

- **Vascular anomalies**: Vascular anomalies are separated into two major groups: haemangiomas and vascular malformations. The haemangioma is a true neoplasm and constitutes the most common benign pediatric tumor of the masticator space.

### Thyroglossal duct pathology and mimics [^113CBJcx]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

**Teaching points**: Thyroglossal duct cyst is the most common congenital neck mass. Critical anatomic landmarks of thyroglossal duct anomalies and ectopic thyroid tissue include the foramen cecum at the tongue base, hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and strap musculature. An important differentiating feature of thyroglossal duct cyst is its close association with the posterior aspect of the hyoid bone. Suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cysts are usually midline, while infrahyoid thyroglossal duct cysts may be paramidline. Orthotopic thyroid tissue is absent in 70–80% of patients with lingual thyroid and is therefore an important consideration in preoperative planning.

### A large lingual thyroid extending to the epiglottis [^1159pjeQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 22-year-old man presented to our department with a mass at the base of his tongue. He exhibited a cavernous voice causing a moderate speech disorder and experienced difficulty swallowing. Severe sleep problems associated with apnea were also reported. A fibreoptic laryngoscopic examination revealed a large 4×5 cm vascular mass extending from the base of the patient's tongue to his epiglottis, covering the epiglottis. Thyroid scintigraphy showed only thyroid tissue present at the base of the tongue.

Surgery was initiated transorally under the guidance of a rigid endoscope. However, as the mass extended to the epiglottis, a transhyoid approach was adopted. At a 3-month follow-up, the patient was symptom-free. Electrocautery-assisted resection under the guidance of a rigid endoscope can reliably be used in the surgery of a lingual thyroid. A transhyoid approach, however, offers a better view and aids in achieving haemostasis.

### Lingual osseous choristoma causing odynophagia in a young female [^115KLcm7]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Given that lingual osseous choristomas are most commonly located in the posterior midline at the foramen cecum, it is crucial to exclude a lingual thyroid. Other differentials for a posterior tongue mass include a thyroglossal duct cyst and benign tumors such as hemangioma, hamartoma, and teratoma, and malignant tumors like sarcomas, salivary gland tumors, and squamous cell carcinoma. Rarely, an ingested fish or animal bone which has become impacted and covered by granuloma formation can mimic a lingual choristoma.

- **Diagnosis and visualization**: Diagnosis is primarily clinical, and laryngoscopy provides better visualization. Imaging studies may be useful prior to operative intervention; however, these are not routine. On magnetic resonance imaging, osseous choristomas are low signal intensity lesions on T1- and T2-weighted images owing to their ossified and calcified nature.

- **Treatment strategies**: Surgical excision is the most common treatment strategy, although potassium titanyl phosphate laser therapy has also been attempted. There are no reported cases of malignant transformation or postoperative recurrence; thus, surgical resection appears to be curative. Our patient was successfully managed with surgical excision, and there is no evidence of postoperative recurrence. Pathology revealed benign bony tissue.

Regarding the enlarged circumvallate papillae, no clear etiology was found, and it resolved after initiation of reflux medications and removal of the osseous choristoma. It is possible that it was secondary to irritation from reflux or the osseous choristoma; however, it might also have been a coincidental finding.

A 29-year-old lady presented with an increasingly swollen tongue three days after commencing oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for flu-like symptoms. Once identified as the cause, her symptoms rapidly improved with antihistamines and discontinuation of Tamiflu. The authors found only one other case in the literature reporting this very rare side effect.

### Ascending and plunging ranula in a pediatric patient [^114EnFTY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

A plunging ranula is a rare phenomenon that represents mucous extravasation extending through or behind the mylohyoid. The mucous dissects the tissue planes inferiorly and usually manifests as a swelling in the submental or submandibular regions. Some plunging ranulas are believed to result from disruption of excretory ducts that originate from the sublingual gland. The currently accepted definitive treatment of a plunging ranula is resection of the ipsilateral sublingual gland and evacuation of the cyst with removal of the pseudocapsule. There have been no reported cases of "ascending" ranulas into the parapharyngeal or pterygomaxillary space. This document presents the first known case that involved an extensive ascending and plunging ranula in a pediatric patient, which recurred despite complete excision of the ranula and sublingual gland. IRB approval was not required per institutional policy on retrospective case reports.

### American Cancer Society head and neck cancer survivorship care guideline [^113Sig6a]. CA (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for salivary gland cancer, specifically in the context of survivorship and rehabilitation (oral and dental care), the ACS 2016 guidelines recommend monitoring patients for swelling of the jaw or jaw pain, which may indicate possible osteonecrosis. Offer conservative treatment, such as broad-spectrum antibiotics and daily saline or aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate irrigations, for early-stage lesions. Refer patients to a head and neck surgeon to consider hyperbaric oxygen therapy for early and intermediate lesions. Debridement of necrotic bone should be performed while undergoing conservative management, or if there is external mandible bony exposure through the skin.

### Clinicopathological significance of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome [^113KpVKZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) classically presents with a triad of orofacial swelling, fissured tongue, and facial palsy, with the oligosymptomatic form being more common. Orofacial swelling is characterized by swollen, reddish-brown, non-pruritic lips and facial edema. Fissured tongue, observed in one-third to one-half of patients, aids in diagnosis. The histological finding of MRS includes non-caseating, sarcoidal granulomas; however, their absence does not exclude the diagnosis. These findings collectively serve as a basis for a thorough investigation into the underlying causes of the MRS symptom complex.

### Recurrent adult-type rhabdomyoma: A rare differential diagnosis of "swellings in the masticatory muscle" [^113SKH6Q]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Rhabdomyomas are rare benign mesenchymal tumors with skeletal muscle differentiation and a predilection for the head and neck area. A 38-year-old man presented with persistent, slowly growing, painless swelling in the left inner cheek for 2½ years. The lesion was detected during a routine dental examination and was initially considered to be a mucocele. The mass was removed via a transoral surgical approach. However, a local recurrence occurred 6 months later, which was again surgically removed. The patient is alive and well 2 months after the last surgery. Adult-type rhabdomyoma is a rare, occasionally recurring, benign mesenchymal tumor that should be included in the differential diagnosis of submucosal swellings in the oral cavity, including the masticatory musculature. Adult-type rhabdomyoma of the cheek and masticatory area are exceptionally rare, with no more than three cases reported at the time of writing.
