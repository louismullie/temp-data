## Question

Pathophysiology of lichen sclerosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of lichen sclerosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching disease framework and whether autoimmunity is central. Then, I should verify the key immune mechanisms including autoantibodies, Th1 polarization, and microRNA changes. Next, I will consider genetic susceptibility, followed by oxidative stress and an emerging microvascular injury paradigm. After that, I need to check environmental triggers and how they interplay with disease initiation. I will then review the histopathology including the "early" and nonsclerotic patterns and correct any misconceptions. Subsequently, I should analyze the link to malignancy, integrate a unified model, and finally extract clinical implications including sex- and age-specific nuances and guideline-based management, making sure to flag evidence strengths and uncertainties as I go [^116tr6H6] [^1121oBLP].

> Let me first confirm the disease framework. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis with a predilection for anogenital skin, and the weight of evidence supports a multifactorial, autoimmune-mediated pathogenesis rather than a single-cause model, with guidelines and reviews converging on immune dysregulation in genetically predisposed hosts as a core theme [^116tr6H6] [^1121oBLP].

> I need to verify the autoimmune signals. Circulating autoantibodies to extracellular matrix protein 1 and, in some reports, to basement membrane zone components have been detected in LS and relate to disease biology, although I should be careful not to overstate causality because these antibodies may be epiphenomena that propagate rather than initiate disease; nonetheless, their presence reinforces an autoimmune phenotype and links tissue injury to sustained immune activation [^113Ziqpq] [^117CLsZP].

> Hold on, I should verify the T-cell axis. Molecular profiling shows a Th1-skewed interferon-γ–driven program with upregulation of IFN-γ–inducible chemokines and receptors, and tissue immunohistochemistry demonstrates infiltrates of CD4+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ cells, while miR-155 is significantly elevated and plausibly amplifies inflammatory circuits; together this indicates a dominant cell-mediated autoimmune response with regulatory counter-signals that appear inadequate to fully restrain inflammation [^114hUwuE].

> Next, I should review genetic susceptibility. There is consistent association with HLA-DQ7 in children and signals for other HLA class II alleles modulating risk, with familial clustering in about a tenth of cases and preliminary exome data suggesting rare variants in immune and regulatory pathways such as CD177, CD200, ANKRD18A, and LATS2 in multiplex families; these findings support an antigen-presentation–centric model with additional polygenic contributions, though I must note these genetic data are limited and require replication [^116AEm9p] [^115xpGDW] [^111yBfr6].

> Let me consider oxidative stress as a mechanistic bridge. Untreated vulvar LS tissue shows increased lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and protein carbonylation with impaired antioxidant defenses, suggesting reactive oxygen species contribute to basal layer injury and antigen exposure; this also provides a biological link to the elevated lifetime risk of anogenital squamous cell carcinoma seen in LS cohorts, which I should keep in mind for downstream surveillance implications [^113Ziqpq] [^111jUSjt] [^115b4tJy].

> I will now examine the microvascular injury hypothesis. Emerging pathology work describes superficial vascular dropout, endothelial injury, and thickened microvascular basement membranes with deposition of complement membrane attack complex, raising the possibility that complement-mediated vasculopathy and type I interferon signaling contribute to ischemic sclerosis; I need to emphasize this is an evolving paradigm that complements, rather than replaces, the autoimmune framework and requires further validation [^115Q7Uzk].

> But wait, what about environmental triggers that could prime or perpetuate disease. Clinical observations and pediatric urology experience support a Koebner-like isomorphic response after mechanical or surgical trauma, chronic occlusive urine exposure especially in boys with foreskin occlusion, and a moist frictional microenvironment; in contrast, infectious etiologies such as Borrelia remain unproven and hormonal theories have largely receded, all of which suggest that barrier injury and irritant exposures act as permissive cofactors on a background of immune susceptibility [^1133ySdP] [^113KFEqx] [^115pd4Py] [^111sVSX7].

> Next, I should review histopathology along the disease course. Classic LS shows hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy or acanthosis, interface change, and homogenized upper dermal collagen with a lichenoid infiltrate, whereas early biopsies can be subtle and overlap with other lichenoid or spongiotic processes; now, I initially thought "early LS" implied a reliable temporal staging, but wait, let me reconsider, because recent analyses argue that so-called nonsclerotic LS is a pattern diagnosis without a consistent correlation to duration or activity, and that up to a third of biopsies from clinically obvious LS may be nondiagnostic, underscoring the need for clinicopathologic correlation and longitudinal reassessment [^1133My6x] [^112Pgi4N] [^113SzMtJ] [^115dbged].

> I should double-check the link to malignant transformation. Chronic Th1 inflammation, repetitive injury, and oxidative DNA damage in LS create a microenvironment that can foster HPV-independent squamous carcinogenesis, with observational data supporting an increased risk and expert reviews emphasizing that the mechanism is likely multifactorial rather than a single mutational pathway, which reinforces the imperative for sustained disease control and vigilance for neoplasia [^112Zm9PF] [^111jUSjt].

> Now, let me integrate these strands into a coherent model. A plausible sequence is genetic susceptibility, HLA-mediated antigen presentation, and environmental triggers that injure the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, exposing self-antigens and driving autoantibody generation and complement activation; a Th1-polarized T-cell response, amplified by miR-155 and perhaps compounded by microvascular injury and ischemia, culminates in dermal sclerosis and architectural change, while persistent oxidative stress and inflammation confer carcinogenic potential over time [^1121oBLP] [^114hUwuE] [^113Ziqpq] [^115Q7Uzk].

> I need to ensure I cover sex-specific and pediatric nuances. In women, the autoimmune diathesis is stronger with notable associations to thyroid disease and other autoimmune conditions, while in men, occlusive urine exposure and foreskin microenvironment are prominent and circumcision can be curative when disease is limited to prepuce and glans; in children, female to male ratios narrow and importantly, contrary to older assumptions, most girls with active LS at puberty do not remit and often require maintenance therapy into adolescence [^116rEZ21] [^114U2Ehc] [^116AEm9p] [^111tj2kN].

> Let me translate pathophysiology into management principles. Ultra-potent or potent topical corticosteroids are first-line to suppress the Th1-driven inflammation and reverse histopathologic activity, with proactive maintenance considered particularly in women to prevent flare and scarring, while topical calcineurin inhibitors may help when steroids are insufficient or contraindicated; for boys with disease limited to foreskin and glans, complete circumcision is recommended, and in carefully selected women with symptomatic adhesions or phimosis, limited procedures combined with perioperative anti-inflammatory therapy can restore function, all coupled with long-term surveillance for neoplasia and attention to triggers such as urine exposure and friction [^116UREav] [^116ZawHT] [^117PyZzR] [^114yKoxf] [^114U2Ehc] [^116aEvkQ] [^111sVSX7].

> Hold on, I should verify areas of uncertainty and avoid overreach. Photodynamic therapy and UVA1 phototherapy have been proposed for refractory cases, but evidence is limited and mixed across recommendations, so if considered, they should be reserved for specialist settings after standard therapies fail; likewise, several systemic and topical agents lack supportive data and should not be used outside trials, which aligns with guideline cautions and helps prevent ineffective or harmful interventions [^113D3myU] [^115gzr2t] [^115MesNW] [^116tr6H6] [^113PYorJ].

> Finally, I should confirm the broader context and research gaps. Much of the mechanistic evidence is observational or derived from small cohorts, the microvascular and interferonopathy themes are emerging and need prospective validation, and classification challenges around nonsclerotic patterns persist; prioritization efforts emphasize etiologic clarification, prevention of malignancy, and optimization of long-term management, reminding me to pair evidence-based therapy with careful follow-up and patient education while we await higher-quality data [^113WM5ZU] [^112Pgi4N].

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is driven by **autoimmune T-cell–mediated inflammation** [^114hUwuE] [^116rEZ21], characterized by a strong Th1 cytokine signature and frequent ECM1 autoantibodies [^114hUwuE] [^117CLsZP], especially in genetically predisposed individuals (notably HLA-DQ7) [^115xpGDW]. Chronic inflammation leads to **dermal sclerosis and atrophy** via fibroblast activation, excess collagen deposition, and loss of elastic fibers [^1133My6x], while oxidative stress [^113Ziqpq] and microvascular injury [^115Q7Uzk] amplify tissue damage. Mechanical trauma, urine exposure, and incontinence are key triggers [^111sVSX7] [^113DdK1Y]; persistent inflammation with p53 dysregulation underlies the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma [^1121oBLP].

---

## Immune dysregulation and autoimmunity

- **T-cell–mediated inflammation**: LS shows a dense dermal infiltrate of CD4+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ cells [^114hUwuE], with a Th1 cytokine milieu (IFN-γ, CXCL9/10/11, CCL4/5) and upregulated miR-155 [^114hUwuE], supporting an autoimmune phenotype [^116rEZ21].

- **Autoantibodies**: ECM1 autoantibodies are common [^113Ziqpq] and may contribute to matrix disruption and sclerosis [^117CLsZP].

- **Genetic predisposition**: HLA-DQ7 is enriched in LS, especially in prepubertal girls, indicating genetic susceptibility [^115xpGDW] [^111yBfr6].

---

## Chronic inflammation and fibrosis

Chronic inflammation drives **fibroblast activation**, leading to excess collagen deposition and loss of elastic fibers [^1133My6x], producing dermal sclerosis and atrophy [^1121oBLP]. Concurrent **oxidative stress** — with elevated lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA/protein damage alongside impaired antioxidant defenses — amplifies tissue injury and fibrosis [^113Ziqpq].

---

## Microvascular injury

Key features include **microvascular changes** — endothelial necrosis, basement membrane thickening, and C5b-9 deposition [^115Q7Uzk] — which indicate complement-mediated vascular injury contributing to ischemia and fibrosis [^1121oBLP].

---

## Environmental and mechanical factors

Environmental and mechanical factors include **mechanical trauma** — friction, scratching, and urine exposure [^113DdK1Y] — that can trigger or worsen LS via the Koebner phenomenon [^1133ySdP]. Chronic moisture and urine contact from **incontinence** is also a recognized trigger, particularly in females [^111sVSX7].

---

## Malignant transformation

In LS, **squamous cell carcinoma risk** is increased [^1121oBLP] due to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress [^113Ziqpq], and p53 dysregulation.

---

LS pathophysiology reflects **autoimmune inflammation** in a genetically susceptible host, with fibrosis, oxidative stress, microvascular injury, and environmental triggers converging to drive chronic disease and increase malignancy risk.

### Influence of treatments on prognosis for vulvar lichen sclerosus: Facts and controversies [^112Zm9PF]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory dermatosis with a predilection for the anogenital skin. Vulvar LS can be a debilitating disease, causing pruritus and pain, with the potential for atrophy, scarring, and significant functional impairment. Recently, many advances have been made regarding the etiology and natural history of the disease process; however, much debate still exists regarding the most advantageous medical and surgical management of this disorder.

In an effort to provide a comprehensive review of vulvar LS literature, the following three controversies will be discussed:

- **Optimal disease treatment**: Ultra-potent topical corticosteroids (TCSs) are the first-line treatment for vulvar LS, while topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) remain second-line agents for patients for whom TCS treatment resulted in incomplete resolution of symptoms or adverse events. Due to the relapsing nature of the disease, long-term maintenance therapy is often required.

- **Theories behind LS's oncogenicity and treatments for minimizing malignancy**: Recent advances have contributed to the understanding of the association between LS and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). While the exact mechanism responsible for LS-associated SCC is not known, immune dysregulation and inflammation may play an important role. Therefore, successful treatment of LS should be directed towards alleviation of symptoms and reversal of the underlying histopathologic changes.

- **The value of surgical treatment for LS**: Patients with LS-associated malignancy, as well as those with other severe manifestations, may require surgical intervention.

### Treatment algorithm for the comprehensive management of severe lichen sclerosus in boys based on the pathophysiology of the disease [^1133ySdP]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Low credibility.

It is estimated that approximately one out of 200 boys has the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus (LS), previously referred to as BXO (balanitis xerotica obliterans). Severe progressive disease is rare; however, mismanagement of urethral tissues may contribute to progression of LS.

- **Study design**: The literature regarding the management of severe lichen sclerosus was reviewed alongside our management of seven patients, aged six to ten years, with severe lichen sclerosus who required surgical intervention. These patients were identified out of a busy pediatric practice that saw 5507 patients during the four-year span. Based on the pathophysiology of lichen sclerosus, urethral anatomy, and our management, an algorithm was developed for medical and surgical management.

- **Results**: All patients received initial medical treatment with topical steroids. Three patients underwent urethral mobilization and serial biopsy. One of these patients with severe disease required a second distal urethral mobilization. Three patients were treated with circumcision, and one is responding well to topical steroids after complex reconstruction. None developed postoperative urethral disease.

- **Discussion**: Lichen sclerosus affects squamous epithelium but can extend to unaffected tissue if traumatized via the Koebner phenomenon. There are no randomized control trials for the management of the disease; thus, appropriate early management with avoidance of urethral dilation or incision may prevent extension down the urethra that can lead to severe stricture disease.

### Lichen sclerosus: A review and practical approach [^111jUSjt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic dermatitis predominantly found in the anogenital area. It can be found in patients of any age group, sex, or race, but it is most commonly present in Caucasian peri- or postmenopausal women. Although the etiology of LS remains uncertain, an autoimmune process is believed to underlie this condition. With many cases going unreported, its incidence is still unknown. There is no cure for LS, but treatment offers control of the condition.

- **Reasons for treating LS**: There are three reasons for treating LS: relief of symptoms and discomfort; prevention of any or further anatomical changes; and a theoretical prevention of malignant transformation.

Although many treatments have been suggested to treat LS over the years, only potent or ultra-potent corticosteroids remain as the treatment of choice. After initial therapy, some patients might only use corticosteroids as needed, while others may require twice-weekly maintenance therapy. There is no place for surgery in uncomplicated LS. Surgery should be limited exclusively to patients with malignancy and to correct scarring secondary to the disease. Lichen sclerosus is associated with a 4–6% risk of squamous cell carcinoma, making long-term follow-up essential in these patients.

### Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of lichen sclerosus [^113Ziqpq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology, which can be associated with secondary malignancies. Recent evidence supports an autoimmune basis for this disorder, as demonstrated by autoantibodies to extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM-1). The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to autoimmunity and carcinogenesis are poorly understood.

- **Objectives**: We hypothesized that oxidative stress, which has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and malignant disorders, contributes to these processes in LS.

- **Methods**: Skin biopsies from 16 patients with untreated, histologically confirmed vulval LS were examined immunohistochemically using antibodies against the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenale, and against the oxidative DNA damage marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Protein carbonyls, as markers of protein oxidation, were visualized using the dinitrophenylhydrazone method. Expression of antioxidant enzymes was investigated. Normal vulval tissue from 16 subjects served as control.

- **Results**: In vulval LS tissue, a significant increase of lipid peroxidation products was found, particularly within the basal cell layers of the epidermis, thus colocalizing with ECM-1. Oxidative DNA damage was detected throughout LS biopsies. Intriguingly, protein oxidation was significantly increased within the dermis of LS lesions, indicating oxidative protein damage in the areas of sclerosis and inflammation. The enzymatic antioxidant defense in LS was found to be significantly disturbed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113KFEqx]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory, mucocutaneous disorder affecting genital and extragenital skin. LS is a debilitating disease, causing itch, pain, dysuria, restriction of micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest an autoimmune-induced disease in genetically predisposed patients, moving away from a significant impact of hormonal factors. Preceding infections may play a provocative role, with the involvement of Borrelia remaining controversial. Trauma and an occlusive moist environment may act as precipitating factors.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids remain at the forefront of LS treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are discussed as alternatives for patients who have failed therapy with ultrapotent corticosteroids or have a contraindication for corticosteroid use. Topical and systemic retinoids may be useful in selected cases. Phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS are potential options in rare cases refractory to previously mentioned treatments. Surgery is limited to addressing scarring that leads to functional impairment. In men, circumcision is effective in the majority of cases, yet recurrences have been described.

Anogenital LS is associated with an increased risk for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis. This review updates the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management of LS affecting both female and male genitals, as well as extragenital LS.

### Does longer duration of corticosteroid treatment improve clearance in vulvar lichen sclerosus? Results from a single centre, comparative, open label study [^116AyTAc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The ideal treatment for vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) should aim at inducing relief of symptoms, reversing signs, and preventing further anatomical changes. Adherence to long-term treatment was also shown to prevent progression towards cancer. Based on the immunological pathophysiology of VLS, high-potency topical corticosteroids represent the first-line treatment in the active phase of the disease. There is strong evidence that potent and ultra-potent corticosteroids have an excellent effect on both symptom control and, although to a lesser extent, on the reversal of clinical signs. This evidence is largely based on trials of 12-week duration, which is the conventional duration of trials assessing the effectiveness of topical treatments in the active phase of the disease.

Despite the significant improvement in symptoms and signs, a recent retrospective study highlighted that complete cure of VLS occurs in a minority of patients treated with 12-week therapies. This means that, at treatment completion, most patients may still have substantial residual disease, with possible negative effects on their well-being and quality of life. In this regard, one might wonder if treatment courses longer than the conventional duration may provide therapeutic advantages and increase the chance of complete clearance.

The present study assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of a 24-week treatment with a potent corticosteroid. A comparison was also made with the treatment outcomes achieved with a standard 12-week duration.

### Lichen sclerosus [^115b4tJy]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic skin condition that presents numerous challenges to clinicians. It affects men, women, and children, typically occurring in the anogenital area. The clinical signs may be confused with those observed in cases of sexual abuse in children. The underlying cause remains unknown; however, there is a strong association with autoimmune disorders, and immunogenetic studies have identified a link with HLA DQ7.

Patients experience significant morbidity due to persistent symptoms, physical scarring, and psychosexual damage. Support groups may be beneficial for some patients. Potent topical corticosteroids have demonstrated effectiveness. There is a 5% incidence of squamous cell carcinoma, necessitating biopsy of all suspicious lesions. The impact of topical corticosteroids on the risk of malignancy is unclear, as there is potential for triggering latent human papillomavirus infections.

A multidisciplinary approach to care is essential. Ideally, all patients should attend a dedicated clinic and be offered long-term monitoring.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^116AEm9p]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**: A total of 1780 articles were retrieved. After screening based on titles and abstracts, full texts of 300 publications were read. Eighty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The references in these articles were checked for relevant studies, yielding one additional publication, resulting in 90 included publications. These articles were subsequently categorized into the following categories based on focus: epidemiology, clinical presentation, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis.

- **Epidemiology**: Data on the epidemiology of pediatric lichen sclerosus (LS) are limited. The true prevalence is difficult to estimate considering that many patients are asymptomatic, unaware, misdiagnosed, or hesitant to report their condition. The incidence of pediatric LS (0–20 years old) in the general population is estimated at 0.04%-0.06%, compared with 0.1%-0.6% in adults. In adulthood, the incidence ratio for LS in women relative to men is higher (from 6:1 to 10:1), whereas in children, the female-to-male ratio is 1:1.7.

	The estimated prevalence of LS in girls aged 2–16 years is 1:900, with a mean age of onset of 6.6 years. Girls aged 0–19 years comprise 4.1% of females with LS. In boys aged 0–14 years, the incidence is estimated at 1:200, with most cases found in 9–11 years old (mean age at onset 8.6 years).

### The surgical management of lichen sclerosus of the glans penis: Our experience and review of the literature [^115mj8Qe]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) of the glans penis is a chronic, progressive, scleroatrophic inflammatory process of unknown etiology affecting the glans penis, prepuce, and urethra, which may lead to severe impairment of sexual and urinary function.

- **Aims**: To report our experience of surgical management of LS of the glans penis.

- **Main outcome measures**: Complications, patient satisfaction, cosmesis, resolution of pain and pruritus, and postoperative sexual function were recorded retrospectively.

- **Methods**: The surgical outcome of 31 patients who underwent resurfacing of the glans penis using skin grafting for the management of genital LS in our institute is reported.

- **Results**: After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, 26 patients (84%) were fully satisfied with cosmetic and functional results, and 71% of them have resumed sexual activity.

- **Conclusions**: Resurfacing of the glans penis represents a simple and reproducible technique for the management of LS, yielding excellent functional and cosmetic results.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^114T64e9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Systemic retinoids have been used in the past with considerable success in severe vulvar LS, but in women of childbearing age, the teratogenic risk limits their use. Surgery should be limited to patients with associated malignancy or to patients who need correction of functionally restricting, scarring processes. Phototherapy and PDT are possible third-line therapies in cases resistant to the aforementioned treatments. Genital LS is associated with scarring and an increased risk for vulvar and penile SCC. Long-term follow-up and ongoing suppressive treatment are mandatory.

### An autoimmune phenotype in vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus: a Th1 response and high levels of microRNA-155 [^114hUwuE]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus are T-cell-mediated chronic skin disorders. Although autoimmunity has been suggested, the exact pathogenesis of these disorders is still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the molecular and immunological mechanisms critical to the pathogenesis of vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus. By using gene expression profiling and real-time RT-PCR experiments, we demonstrated a significantly increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, CXCR3, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCR5, CCL4, and CCL5) specific for a Th1 IFNγ-induced immune response.

In addition, BIC/microRNA-155 (miR-155) — a microRNA involved in regulation of the immune response — was significantly upregulated in lichen sclerosus and lichen planus (9.5- and 17.7-fold change, respectively). Immunohistochemistry showed a significant T-cell response, with pronounced dermal infiltrates of CD4(+), CD8(+), and FOXP3(+) cells.

In conclusion, these data demonstrate an autoimmune phenotype in vulvar lichen sclerosus and lichen planus, characterized by increased levels of Th1-specific cytokines, a dense T-cell infiltrate, and enhanced BIC/miR-155 expression.

### Lichen sclerosus: Review of the literature and current recommendations for management [^115igr6h]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review was to examine the literature on the clinical presentation, etiology, natural history, and medical and surgical management of lichen sclerosus in men.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, and other electronic databases spanning from 1950 to 2006, using keywords such as "lichen sclerosis", "balanitis xerotica obliterans", and "urethral stricture". This search yielded 1,268 sources with the terms "lichen sclerosus" or "balanitis xerotica obliterans". Ultimately, 68 peer-reviewed articles and 2 book chapters were selected for review.

- **Results**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, lymphocyte-mediated skin disease first described in 1887, with a preference for the anogenital area in both men and women. Significant progress has been made regarding the epidemiology, natural history, and histological features of this condition over the last century, including a notable association with squamous cell carcinoma. The medical and surgical management techniques for this disorder continue to be refined. Biopsy of the initial lesion for definitive diagnosis and long-term follow-up of affected patients are essential components of managing lichen sclerosus.

- **Conclusions**: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, debilitating condition that may advance to cause significant voiding complications. A biopsy is advised for all patients suspected of having lichen sclerosus to exclude squamous cell carcinoma. Ongoing research is necessary to enhance the prevention, understanding, and management of this condition.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^112Pgi4N]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

In summary, critical appraisal of studies in children and adults does not support a reliable link between dermal features and disease duration or activity. Duration of disease is difficult to ascertain in the clinical setting due to non-help-seeking, delay in diagnosis, and the variable presence, nature, and onset of symptoms. The meaning of the term "early LS" is vague and subject to different interpretations, providing a source of confusion for clinicians and patients. Replacement of this term with categorization into one of four pattern groups may alleviate these problems and encourage thoughtful clinicopathologic correlation.

- **Categorization of NSLS**: The varied appearances of NSLS may be grouped into four categories according to epithelial thickness and dermal collagen characteristics. Each pattern carries its own histopathologic differential diagnosis, but there is insufficient evidence to correlate these with clinical appearance, disease duration, or neoplastic risk.

- **Lichenoid dermatitis**: This is the most common pattern and displays an atrophic to mildly acanthotic epithelium, basal layer degeneration, lymphocytosis, an upper dermal band-like lymphocytic infiltrate, and normal collagen appearance (Figure 1). The infiltrate varies from scant to dense. There are no features specific to classic LP or the border of erosive LP, such as wedge-shaped hypergranulosis or spiky rete ridges. Likewise, cases lack the erosion and absent rete ridges often seen with regenerative or degenerative erosive LP. In addition to LP, the differential diagnosis for lichenoid dermatitis includes graft versus host disease.

In specific circumstances related to lichen sclerosus, particularly concerning pediatric male patients, the EADV 2015 guidelines recommend performing surgery of the meatus if necessary, such as in cases of stenosis. A follow-up should be obtained at 6 months post-circumcision, with careful investigation of the meatus and glans. Urethral surgery should be reserved for special cases, such as hypospadia.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^115xpGDW]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Genetic background and risk factors**: Several factors suggest that lichen sclerosus (LS) is an autoimmune disease with a genetic predisposition. In 11–12% of LS cases, a positive family history was reported, supporting a genetic component. Most genetic studies have been conducted in adults, though several case-control studies found HLA-DQ7 (HLA-DQ-B1*301/04/09/10) in 50–66% of prepubertal girls with LS compared with 25–31% in controls. Furthermore, LS is frequently seen in patients with Turner syndrome, with a prevalence of 17.3%. In boys, molecular evidence of specific gene expression patterns was found in congenital phimosis associated with LS, which is comparable with the existing literature on adult LS.

The association between LS and autoimmune disease is well-established in women but less so in men. In girls, the most common concomitant autoimmune diseases reported are vitiligo, thyroid disease, localized scleroderma, alopecia areata, and rheumatic diseases. One case series on three girls suggested a possible association with celiac disease. Intriguingly, HLA-DRB113 is more prevalent in LS patients without autoimmune disease compared with LS patients with autoimmune disease, suggesting a protective role of HLA-DRB113 against autoimmune diseases in the presence of LS. Baldo et al. detected circulating basement membrane zone protein antibodies in girls with LS. Other factors associated with LS in children include a history of urinary tract symptoms and urinary incontinence in girls, an atopic constitution in both girls and boys, and obesity in boys.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^113SzMtJ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

- **Summary and recommendations**:
	- Nonsclerotic LS refers to a pathologic situation in which there are clinical and microscopic features to suggest LS but dermal sclerosis is absent. Nonsclerotic LS always has a histopathologic differential diagnosis, so it requires clinical correlation to confirm a diagnosis of LS. Nonsclerotic lichenoid reactions may be grouped into one of four categories with a comment if LS is favored.

	- If clinical features are consistent with LS and the pathology is nonspecific, the assigned diagnosis remains LS. When the pathologist includes nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus (NSLS) in the differential diagnosis but clinical features are not specific, the diagnosis remains unclear. In cases with skin abnormality, it is often appropriate to manage with topical corticosteroids, serial photography, and follow-up; the diagnosis may become apparent over time in the context of evolving clinical findings, extragenital or vaginal involvement, and response to treatment.

### Childhood onset vulvar lichen sclerosus does not resolve at puberty: A prospective case series [^111tj2kN]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

When vulvar lichen sclerosus occurs in prepubertal children, it is widely believed that it is likely to remit at puberty. However, when it occurs in adult women, it is accepted that remission is unlikely and that untreated or inadequately treated disease may be complicated by significant disturbance of vulvar architecture and, less commonly, squamous cell carcinoma.

Our database reveals 18 girls who developed lichen sclerosus prior to puberty who are now adolescents or young adults. Twelve have remained under surveillance, and the other six patients have been lost to follow-up. We report a prospective series of these 12 patients. Three patients have achieved complete remission sustained for three or more years, all prior to menarche. Nine patients, or 75% of the cohort, who still had active lichen sclerosus at puberty continue to require maintenance therapy after menarche. Of the 12, six have had significant disturbance of vulvar architecture.

The concept that prepubertal lichen sclerosus resolves at puberty would appear not to be true in the majority of patients. Even when diagnosed early and treated effectively, childhood onset lichen sclerosus may be complicated by distortion of vulvar architecture.

### Population-level retrospective study associating lichen sclerosus with autoimmune dermatologic and rheumatologic conditions [^116rEZ21]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that commonly involves the anogenital region in women and is speculated to have an autoimmune pathogenesis. Previous studies have reported an association with human leukocyte antigen constellations, and LS has been linked to several other autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disease, morphea, psoriasis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Herein, we performed a population-level retrospective study to evaluate the association between LS and other autoimmune conditions.

We retrospectively identified our cohort using TriNetX, a global health research network. Within TriNetX, the United States Collaborative Network incorporates data from 60 health care organizations with over 104 million patients. Data were extracted in December 2023. International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) code L90.0, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, was used to identify cases. Though ICD-10 codes cannot differentiate between genital and extragenital LS, LS most frequently affects the vulva. Therefore, ICD-10 code N95, postmenopausal atrophic vaginitis, was used to identify the control cohort, as this is a common vulvar diagnosis without a known autoimmune disease association. Diagnoses prior to the use of ICD-10 codes were mapped using General Equivalence Mappings. Only female patients were included. Patients with a diagnosis of LS were excluded from the control cohort. Cohorts were matched by age and race/ethnicity, resulting in a 1:1 propensity score.

### Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of lichen sclerosus: A systematic review [^1121oBLP]. Urology (2020). High credibility.

The objective of this systematic review is to enhance understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms, urologic manifestations, and treatment options for genital lichen sclerosus (LS).

- **Materials and methods**: The Medline/PubMed and Embase databases were systematically reviewed to identify relevant publications on LS. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, references were assessed for their relevance to the pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment of LS through title and abstract reviews by two independent reviewers, resulting in 186 articles for assessment.

- **Results**: This review examines the contemporary understanding of the epidemiology and histology of LS. We detail the three hypotheses concerning the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to disease presentation: infectious etiology, primary immune dysregulation, and the isotraumatopic response. We summarize the available biological evidence supporting each hypothesis, providing context for understanding LS morbidity and potentially inspiring new research avenues. For clinicians, the disease's clinical presentation, including its risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, is reviewed. Medical and surgical treatment options are also discussed.

- **Conclusion**: LS remains a potentially insidious disease that can lead to debilitating urinary and sexual dysfunction. Cross-disciplinary research should focus on earlier detection and the development of more effective and durable treatments. The precise cause of LS remains unknown.

It is recommended that women with vulvar lichen sclerosus be followed in specialist clinics where there is difficulty with symptom control or clinical evidence of localized skin thickening. Follow-up is also advised for women who have previously been treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, whether arising in lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, or in instances where the pathologist expresses concern and is unable to provide a definitive diagnosis of differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.

### Multicentre, phase II trial on the safety and efficacy of topical tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of lichen sclerosus [^114yKoxf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease causing significant sclerosis, atrophy, and pruritus. Treatment remains unsatisfactory, with potent corticosteroids being the most effective therapy.

- **Objectives**: To conduct a multicentre, phase II trial to assess the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus ointment 0.1% for the treatment of lichen sclerosus, with a follow-up period of 18 months at 10 university and teaching hospitals in Germany and Austria.

- **Methods**: Eighty-four patients (49 women, 32 men, and three girls) aged between 5 and 85 years with long-standing, active lichen sclerosus (79 with anogenital and five with extragenital localization) were treated with topical tacrolimus ointment 0.1% twice daily for 16 weeks. Computerized analysis of the lesional area was performed. The primary endpoint was clearance of active lichen sclerosus. Secondary endpoints were time to optimal response, reduction of sclerosis, and duration of remission.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint (clearance of active lichen sclerosus) was reached by 43% of patients at 24 weeks of treatment. Partial resolution was reached in 34% of patients. Maximal effects occurred between week 10 and 24 of therapy. Treatment led to a significant reduction of the total lesional area (P < 0.01) and a significant decline in the total symptom score (P < 0.005). Symptoms (e.g. itching) and findings (erythema, erosions, and induration) showed significant improvement. No serious adverse events were observed. There were three (9%) recurrences during the follow-up period.

- **Conclusions**: Topical tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is a promising treatment for lichen sclerosus, demonstrating significant efficacy and safety in achieving symptom relief and lesion clearance over the course of treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: An update [^115pd4Py]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The etiology of lichen sclerosus (LS) has not yet been adequately explained; however, there is increasing evidence that autoimmune mechanisms play a pathogenetic role. A genetic susceptibility to LS appears to exist, and the chronic irritant effects of urinary contact are suggested to be provocative. No infectious agent has been consistently linked to LS.

- **Autoimmunity**: In common with many autoimmune diseases, LS is more prevalent in female patients. A large study of 350 women with LS revealed that 21.5% had one or more autoimmune-related diseases, 21% had a family history of autoimmune disease, and 42% had autoimmune antibodies. The most common autoimmune diseases in this group were autoimmune thyroiditis (12%), alopecia areata (9%), vitiligo (6%), and pernicious anemia (2%). These disorders should be considered in patients with LS. In an LS cohort of 190 women, Cooper et al. found that 28% had one or more associated autoimmune diseases compared with 9% of 230 control patients. Thyroid disease was the most prevalent autoimmune disorder, occurring in 16% of the LS cohort versus 8% of controls. Birenbaum and Young found that the prevalence of thyroid disease in 211 women with biopsy-proven LS was 30%. In comparison, in the general population of Scotland, Leese et al. observed in 2001 an overall prevalence of thyroid dysfunction of 3.8%. Female patients showed a prevalence of 6.4%, and male patients showed a prevalence of 1.1%.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^117CLsZP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The etiology of lichen sclerosus (LS) is still unknown. Evidence supports an autoimmune etiology in genetically predisposed patients, as patients with LS and their relatives often have more autoimmune-related disorders and antibodies than controls. Conditions such as thyroid disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, and pernicious anemia should be considered in a patient diagnosed with LS. The detection of autoantibodies to extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) and to basement membrane zone (BMZ) components suggests that autoimmunity to these components might contribute to the pathogenesis of LS. However, these antibodies, rather than being causative and involved in the initiation, might result from damage to the BMZ and contribute to the disease's progression. An infectious etiology has been proposed but never definitively confirmed, with the role of B. burgdorferi remaining unclear. Hormonal influences do not seem to play a major role.

LS may lead to scarring and destruction of the normal genital architecture. In a high proportion of affected individuals, both women and men, LS causes sexual dysfunction.

The diagnosis of LS is usually clinical, but in clinically unclear cases, a histologic examination is required. Although classic histologic findings will confirm the diagnosis, a nonspecific histology does not rule out LS; the clinicopathologic correlation is pivotal. Patients under follow-up need a biopsy in the case of a persistent area of hyperkeratosis, erosion, or erythema; a warty or nodular lesion; an area resistant to adequate treatment; unclear pigmentation; and if a second-line therapy is considered.

### Vulvar basal cell carcinoma in a patient with long-standing lichen sclerosus [^116R8urE]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Discussion

SCC is by far the most common cancer affecting the vulva, accounting for 90% of all vulvar malignancies. The association between LS and SCC is well established. The mechanism of the carcinogenic progression from LS to SCC is not clearly elucidated but is thought to be related to high cell turnover in the setting of chronic irritation.

In contrast, BCC is extremely rare in the perianal and genital regions with an estimated prevalence of less than 1%. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, fair skin, and advancing age are known risk factors for the development of BCC. However, the pathophysiology of BCC development in non–sun-exposed regions remains unknown. Vulvar BCC develops most commonly in middle-aged to elderly women (average age, 73 years) and tends to present with a large, often ulcerated lesion (average size, 1.95 cm). Associations between genital BCC and preceding immunosuppressive therapy, chronic irritation, pelvic radiation, and prior trauma have been reported. To our knowledge, there are very few cases of BCC arising in a foci of LS.

The potential pathogenic role of tacrolimus in this case remains unclear. LS compromises the skin barrier, potentially allowing tacrolimus to penetrate and accumulate in the epidermis and dermis, where it is theorized to impede DNA repair and decrease apoptosis of keratinocytes, leading to abnormal cell differentiation. Oral calcineurin inhibitors confer an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer in organ transplant recipients. However, the literature has not definitively correlated topical calcineurin inhibitors with an increase in this risk.

Lichen sclerosus in childhood seems to develop in a similar fashion in both sexes, though the clinical approach is often different partly due to the division of care according to the patient's sex. Follow-up is crucial to avoid future complications. More collaborative research is needed to improve understanding of the course of LS and to establish an advanced management plan for children.

### Genomic profiling of vulvar lichen sclerosus patients shows possible pathogenetic disease mechanisms [^111yBfr6]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) is known to occur in families, suggesting a genetic link. Genomic profiling of patients with vulvar LS was investigated to find underlying pathogenetic mechanisms, with the hope that targeted therapies and future clinical research will arise.

- **Methods**: Two unrelated families with vulvar LS were investigated using whole-exome sequencing. Five affected sisters from one family were compared with their unaffected paternal aunt (unaffected control). A mother-daughter pair from a second affected family was compared with the first family. The results of the sequencing were compared with population-specific allele frequency databases to prioritize potential variants contributing to vulvar LS development.

- **Results**: Germ-line variants in four genes were identified as likely to be deleterious to proper protein function in all of the seven affected patients but not in the unaffected control. The genes with variants included CD177 (neutrophil activation), CD200 (inhibitory signal to macrophages), ANKRD18A (ankyrin repeat protein, epigenetic regulation), and LATS2 (co-repressor of androgen signaling).

- **Conclusions**: Although many providers may see a mother and daughter with vulvar LS, this condition is rarely seen in multiple family members who are available for genetic testing. This is the first report to detail genomic profiling related to a familial association of vulvar LS.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^114z2jTj]. Pediatric dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Studies concerning pediatric lichen sclerosus are limited, and, at the time of writing, there have been no studies comparing the course of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls. We sought to examine all publications on boys and girls with lichen sclerosus and assess and compare epidemiology, symptoms and signs, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis.

A systematic search was performed in the Embase, Medline, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria were information on children ages 0–18 years and a clinical or histologic diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. Literature from 1985 to 2021 was reviewed.

A total of 1780 articles were retrieved from the search, of which 90 articles were eligible for inclusion. Boys and girls present similarly on many aspects; nonetheless, treatment and follow-up are approached differently.

Though the clinical approach is often different, lichen sclerosus in boys and girls demonstrates many similarities. More research is needed, especially on follow-up, to gain a better understanding of the course of lichen sclerosus and establish an advanced management plan for children.

### Lichen sclerosus: A C5B-9 mediated chronic microvascular injury syndrome potentially reflective of common adult comorbidities [^115Q7Uzk]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a cutaneous disease of unknown etiology that often involves the vulva or foreskin but can also affect extragenital sites. Regardless of the anatomic site, the histomorphology and presumably the pathogenesis are similar. A clue to the pathophysiology of LS may lie in its frequent association with morphea, particularly when occurring in an extragenital context.

In our experience, a striking feature evident in established lichen sclerosus (LS) is superficial vascular dropout, where residual vessels exhibit endothelial cell necrosis and microvascular basement membrane zone thickening. This thickening reflects antecedent episodes of microvascular injury. We sought to understand the pathophysiology underlying these distinct vascular changes to shed light on the pathogenesis of LS. We examined 44 cases of LS from 2019 to 2021 and were able to obtain past medical histories in 34 of those cases.

The predominant focus of pathological assessment was on microvascular changes. We assessed the role of C5b-9 mediated vascular injury in the pathogenesis of vasculopathy and enhanced type I interferon signaling in vessels, given the morphologic similarities to select interferonopathy syndromes, namely fibrosing dermatomyositis and Kohlmeier-Degos disease. We examined the expression of CMV DNA and protein based on prior observations from an earlier study that isolated early protein expression in the microvasculature within the setting of LS and scleroderma. From a clinical perspective, the most striking association was an…

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^1133My6x]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

In the early stages of lichen sclerosus (LS), not only the symptoms and clinical signs but also the histologic picture may be uncharacteristic. The histologic features in early LS are quite subtle and may overlap with those seen in psoriasis or lichen planus (LP), with luminal hyperkeratosis and hypergranulosis of the adnexal structures, mild irregular, occasionally psoriasiform acanthosis, and focal basement membrane thickening. Early dermal changes include subepithelial edema, homogenized collagen, and dilated blood vessels immediately under the basement membrane. The lymphocytic infiltrate can be lichenoid or interstitial with epidermal lymphocyte exocytosis and lymphocytic/lymphohistiocytic vasculitis. Serial sections are sometimes necessary.

The classic histologic features of more advanced uncomplicated LS are hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy with flattening of the rete ridges, vacuolar interface changes, loss of elastic fibers, and hyalinization of the lamina propria with an underlying lymphocytic infiltrate. However, prominent acanthosis may be a feature, particularly in vulvar LS. In a study of 121 cases of vulvar LS, changes in lichen simplex chronicus or spongiotic dermatitis, dermal eosinophils, and a frequent absence of atrophy have been documented. Vulvar LS cases presenting with eosinophilic spongiosis, marked lymphocyte exocytosis, dermal eosinophils, and excoriations showed a poor symptomatic response to treatment, possibly due to a superimposed allergic contact dermatitis. Patch testing is recommended for these individuals.

### Pediatric vulvar lichen sclerosus: A survey of disease course [^1122zrvA]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of lichen sclerosus (LS) in the female pediatric population, focusing on patient age, treatment type and duration, and remission. A retrospective chart review identified female pediatric patients (0–18 years of age) diagnosed with LS between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2020, at the University of North Carolina Dermatology and/or Obstetrics and Gynecology Departments. Patients were then contacted via telephone for follow-up interviews consisting of a series of questions regarding patient age, symptom onset, time of diagnosis, treatment, and symptoms.

Of the 128 patients identified, 61 consented and participated in follow-up interviews. At the time of study follow-up, 55 out of 61 (90%) participants reported that their symptoms had improved. Patients reported using a variety of treatments, with medium- to high-potency topical steroids being the most common. At the time of follow-up, 53 out of 61 (87%) patients reported being asymptomatic, of whom 37 out of 53 (70%) were not using any form of maintenance therapy. Those who achieved symptom resolution did so at an average age of 8.4 years. There was no significant difference in age between asymptomatic patients receiving maintenance therapy and those receiving no maintenance therapy. There was a positive correlation between the duration of LS treatment and time in remission (P < .001). Increased patient age at the time of follow-up also correlated positively with time in remission.

Indications for biopsy

International guidelines and consensus statements vary regarding biopsy recommendations for suspected lichen sclerosus (LS) in adults. However, there is consensus to obtain tissue when there is concern for neoplasia, diagnostic uncertainty, or inadequate response to potent topical corticosteroids. The preferred biopsy site is the most abnormal area, sparing the periclitoral region, posterior fourchette, and anus when possible. In children, biopsy requires sedation and occurs when there is a diagnostic dilemma or another indication for surgery.

Lichen sclerosus may be comorbid with other vulvar dermatoses, including contact dermatitis, lichen planus (LP), vitiligo, and psoriasis. It may be complicated by superinfection with Candida albicans, dermatophytes, and herpes simplex virus. Human papillomavirus-related diseases also manifest on a background of LS as condyloma, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and human papillomavirus-related squamous cell carcinoma. Each of these conditions may necessitate a biopsy and complicate histopathologic assessment. For example, sclerosis disappears in 57% of cases with comorbid high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and LS, and florid inflammation from mycosis may obscure basal layer changes.

Histopathology

Lichen sclerosus shows a diversity of pathologic appearances across the epidermis and dermis. Epithelium varies from atrophic to acanthotic; rete ridges may be absent, reduced, irregular, or psoriasiform. Infiltrate may be sparse to dense, and abnormal collagen may be focal to diffuse and edematous, hyalinized, and fibrotic.

### Should we always biopsy in clinically evident lichen sclerosus [^115dbged]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to review cases of clinically diagnosed lichen sclerosus (LS) and to compare the histological features found on biopsy to clinical features seen on examination.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients attending a specialist vulval service between 2013 and 2015 with a clinical diagnosis of LS. Patients in whom there was clinical diagnostic uncertainty or those with features of lichen planus or lichen planus/LS overlap were excluded. We determined the proportion of these patients who underwent vulval biopsy and reviewed their histology.

- **Results**: One hundred fifteen charts were reviewed. Sixty-nine (69/115, 60%) had a firm diagnosis of established LS, and of these, 39 (39/69, 56.5%) had a biopsy performed in the previous 5 years. Thirteen (13/39, 33.3%) of these biopsies fell short of a diagnosis of LS histologically with some suggestive but nondiagnostic and some showing nonspecific features.

- **Conclusions**: Reliance on biopsies solely to establish or exclude the diagnosis of LS is inadvisable. A good level of knowledge of the characteristic clinical features is imperative among gynecologists, dermatologists, and general practitioners.

### Future research priorities for lichen sclerosus - results of a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership [^113WM5ZU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory genital skin condition affecting men, women, and children. Long-term complications include loss of normal anatomy from scarring and malignant transformation. Uncertainties exist about the cause, diagnosis, and management of LS. For example, the aetiology is contested; evidence suggests that chronic irritation by occluded urine is important in males. However, autoimmune mechanisms are proposed in females. Genetic associations are suggested in both sexes. Existing evidence on which to make recommendations about management and the prevention of malignancy is generally of poor quality.

We conducted a Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) from June 2017 to July 2018 using James Lind Alliance (JLA) methodology. The aim was to identify future research priorities about the causes, diagnosis, management, and prevention of LS in men, women, and children. This research letter details the key findings; a full detailed report is available in the public domain.

The protocol was written prospectively and made publicly available. The steering group, chaired by a JLA independent adviser, included seven patient representatives (five patients, one parent of a child with LS, one patient support organization representative), seven health professionals (five dermatologists, one gynaecologist, and one nurse), and three researchers/administrators. From September to October 2017, we conducted the first of two online surveys using SurveyMonkeyTM. These surveys, available in English, were promoted by partner organizations and social media.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vulvar lichen sclerosus: An update for dermatologists [^113MdKLw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus is an important skin disease that is common in women in their 50s and beyond; however, it can also affect females of any age, including children. If not treated, it has the potential to cause significant and permanent scarring and deformity of the vulvar structure. In addition, if untreated, it is associated with a 2–6% lifetime risk of malignant squamous neoplasia of the vulva. Lichen sclerosus has been considered a difficult-to-manage condition; however, both serious complications can potentially be prevented with early intervention with topical corticosteroid, suggesting that the course of the disease can be treatment-modified.

Regarding medical management for lichen sclerosus, more specifically with respect to agents with no evidence for benefit, the EADV 2015 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the following topical treatments in patients with LS:

- **Topical vitamin E in vulvar LS**: The evidence does not confirm its efficacy.
- **Human fibroblast lysate cream**: Lacks sufficient supporting evidence.
- **Topical TRPM8 agonist icilin**: Insufficient evidence for benefit.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^113DdK1Y]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory mucocutaneous disorder affecting both genital and extragenital skin. LS leads to debilitating symptoms, including itching, pain, dysuria, restricted micturition, dyspareunia, and significant sexual dysfunction in both women and men. Recent findings increasingly suggest an autoimmune-induced etiology in genetically predisposed individuals, moving the focus away from hormonal factors. Preceding infections may act as triggers, with a controversial role for Borrelia. Trauma and a moist, occlusive environment might precipitate the condition.

Potent and ultrapotent topical corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of treatment. In cases where patients do not respond to ultrapotent corticosteroids or have contraindications, topical calcineurin inhibitors are considered as alternatives. Topical and systemic retinoids may be beneficial in selected cases. Phototherapy for extragenital LS and photodynamic therapy for genital LS are potential treatments for cases unresponsive to conventional therapies. Surgery is mainly limited to addressing scarring that causes functional impairment. In men, circumcision is frequently effective, although recurrences are reported. There is an association between anogenital LS and an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva or penis.

This review provides an update on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, histopathology, pathogenesis, and management strategies for LS of the female and male genitals, as well as extragenital locations.

Most cases of lichen sclerosus (LS) have characteristic clinical features, so biopsy is not required to establish the diagnosis. When LS is evident on examination, clinicians may elect to perform a biopsy to document the diagnosis before embarking on long-term treatment and suppression. Less commonly, examination findings yield a differential diagnosis that includes LS and other dermatoses, so clinicians may undertake biopsy to clarify the diagnosis. In either circumstance, a nondiagnostic biopsy result may instill doubt in patients and health practitioners about the diagnosis of LS and the need for treatment and follow-up. It also shifts the diagnostic process back to clinician judgment and observation of patient progress over time.

The histopathologic diagnosis of LS is straightforward in most cases, consisting of a lichenoid tissue reaction combined with stromal sclerosis. The lichenoid tissue reaction is one of six major dermatopathologic reaction patterns and involves a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate accompanied by basal layer degeneration. Sclerosis is a pathologic term for fine cross-linked collagen fibers forming a pink "ground glass" appearance in the upper dermis. In contrast, fibrosis is the replacement of thin collagen fibers with thick ones. The term "lichenoid dermatitis" provides a working diagnosis for the situation of clinical features suggestive of LS and/or lichen planus (LP) and histopathology showing a lichenoid tissue reaction lacking specific features of LS or LP.

Regarding the medical management of lichen sclerosus, particularly in the context of managing co-occurring infections, the EADV 2017 guidelines recommend administering a combination of corticosteroids with antibiotics and antifungals. This can include agents such as gentamicin or fusidic acid, along with nystatin or azole antifungals, or an alternative preparation for a short period to treat secondary infections in patients with vulvar lichen sclerosus.

### Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Unraveling a clinical conundrum [^113ZmRDs]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Vulvar lichen sclerosus is a chronic, progressive inflammatory dermatosis that predominantly affects postmenopausal women but can also present in premenopausal individuals. It can cause significant scarring, leading to anatomical distortion, urinary dysfunction, and impaired quality of life. The author describes a case of a woman in her late 30s with extensive vulvar involvement of lichen sclerosus, resulting in introital stenosis, dyspareunia, and painful micturition. The patient was managed with a combination of topical steroids and systemic immunosuppressants, followed by surgical intervention using a Singapore flap for vaginal reconstruction. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis, individualized treatment approaches, and long-term follow-up in managing severe vulvar lichen sclerosus.

### Vulval lichen sclerosus and lichen planus [^111pgfHC]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) and lichen planus (LP) are both immunologically mediated diseases with a preference for the genitalia. The basic principles of management for vulval LS and vulvovaginal LP are similar, involving an explanation of the disease, emphasizing its chronic nature, and outlining treatment options. The main difference between the two conditions is that LP tends to involve mucous membranes, including the mouth and vagina, which are rarely affected in LS.

First-line treatment for LS is a super-potent topical corticosteroid ointment, which has a high response rate. Erosive vulvovaginal LP is more challenging to treat; second-line therapies include topical calcineurin inhibitors and systemic agents. There is limited evidence for systemic treatments for both conditions. The risk of vulval squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is increased in both LP and LS, and it is not known how treatment affects this risk. We recommend teaching self-examination and conducting longitudinal evaluations.

### Nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus: Definition of a concept and pathologic description [^111TuWiS]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2023). Low credibility.

Tension exists in the literature regarding the relationship between dermal features in lichen sclerosus (LS) and the interval between disease initiation and tissue sampling. Some authors assign the label "early LS" to cases with subtle or absent sclerosis; others document that duration of disease does not predict collagen appearance. Likewise, extensive fibrosis with minimal infiltrate has been termed "burnt-out LS" and described as a late feature usually seen in elderly patients, but fibrosis may be seen throughout the age spectrum. Extrapolations of disease duration from histopathologic appearance complicate interpretation of the scant literature on nonsclerotic lichen sclerosus (NSLS).

This review aims to describe the clinicopathologic problem of clinically diagnosed LS accompanied by a tissue specimen suggesting LS but lacking sclerosis and provides a classification approach.

### Comparison of lichen sclerosus in boys and girls: A systematic literature review of epidemiology, symptoms, genetic background, risk factors, treatment, and prognosis [^111ANSnw]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS), first described by Breisky in 1885 and Hallopeau in 1887, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that predominantly affects the anogenital region. LS is relatively common in postmenopausal women, with an estimated prevalence between 1:1000 and 1:60. In men, LS seems less common, with the reported ratio between men and women varying from 1:10 to 1:6. Although the disease is well-documented in adults, less is known regarding LS in children. Furthermore, many publications address LS in either boys or girls, but not both. Therefore, we aim to assess the literature on LS in both boys and girls.

LS has been known by various synonyms, such as white spot disease, kraurosis vulvae, and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus vulvae, or, in men, balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO). For consistency, in this review, we uniformly use the term lichen sclerosus.

### Vulvar lichen sclerosus: Pathophysiology and treatment [^116ZTUXo]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic disorder affecting the skin and mucosal surfaces, most commonly observed on the female genital skin, but it can also occur on other areas of the body. This condition can affect individuals of any age group, although it is more frequently seen in elderly women. The exact cause of lichen sclerosus remains unknown; however, reports of family members suffering from this disorder suggest a potential genetic link. Additionally, an autoimmune connection has also been proposed.

Currently, ultra-potent topical corticosteroids constitute the preferred medical treatment. Other treatments have been utilized, including testosterone, progesterone, tacrolimus, surgery, and phototherapy. It is advisable to reserve surgical intervention for symptomatic cases that do not respond to multiple medical treatments, as surgery has a high recurrence rate. Notably, in women with vulvar lichen sclerosus, the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva approaches 5%, necessitating close surveillance by both healthcare providers and patients.

This review covers the history, clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment of lichen sclerosus of the vulva, as well as its implications for pregnancy and sexual function. Additionally, it discusses issues specific to children affected by lichen sclerosus.
