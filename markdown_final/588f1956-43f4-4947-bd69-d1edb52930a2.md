## Question

Disseminated mycobacterium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in people with HIV, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about epidemiology and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the clinical presentation and differential. Next, I will review diagnostic confirmation and specimen strategy. After that, I need to check initial treatment regimens, drug interactions, and escalation criteria. I will then examine ART timing and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Finally, I should confirm prophylaxis indications, treatment duration and discontinuation criteria, monitoring and failure definitions, and special populations, and close with a concise algorithm summary.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and risk profile so I don't miss the clinical context. Disseminated MAC classically occurs with advanced HIV immunosuppression, typically CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mm3, and incidence has plummeted in the modern ART era to less than 2 per 1,000 person-years among people in care, largely due to immune recovery with effective ART, though late presenters remain at risk and disease can still occur despite suppressive ART, albeit less commonly and often with different phenotypes [^116YZFE3] [^111R7E94].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical presentation before jumping to testing. Early symptoms are nonspecific and may precede mycobacteremia by weeks, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, with laboratory clues such as anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase; hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are common on exam or imaging, and localized syndromes can emerge in patients on ART with immune recovery, sometimes reflecting IRIS rather than ongoing dissemination [^112gaiTn] [^114jqkHr] [^112iTRdc].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic gold standard and specimen strategy. A confirmed diagnosis requires isolation of MAC from a normally sterile site, with blood cultures being the most sensitive and minimally invasive modality, yielding positivity in more than 90% of disseminated cases; bone marrow has lower yield if blood cultures are negative, and species identification should be performed using molecular methods or biochemical testing, while susceptibility testing to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended because clinical response correlates with macrolide susceptibility [^116Zkn8F] [^117MS1cV] [^111xJFGc].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating colonization with disease. Detection of MAC in respiratory or gastrointestinal specimens may represent colonization and can precede dissemination, but routine screening or preemptive treatment of colonization is not recommended; diagnosis should be anchored to sterile-site cultures or compelling histopathology plus clinical correlation, and I should double-check for alternative diagnoses like TB, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and lymphoma when the picture is atypical [^116Zkn8F] [^117NfC5j].

> Next, I should review initial treatment and confirm the backbone. Initial therapy must include at least two active agents to prevent resistance, with clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily plus ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily as the preferred regimen; azithromycin 500–600 mg daily plus ethambutol 15 mg/kg daily is an acceptable alternative when clarithromycin is contraindicated due to interactions or intolerance, and I should confirm susceptibility testing on all isolates to guide therapy and detect resistance early [^113QkLvL] [^116hJbSe] [^113n6Q7j].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said high-dose clarithromycin might be better, but I should correct that. Clarithromycin doses greater than 1 g/day are associated with increased mortality and should not be used, so I need to keep the dose at 500 mg twice daily and adjust for drug interactions, particularly with protease inhibitors that can raise clarithromycin levels, prompting dose reduction or a switch to azithromycin, which lacks CYP-mediated interactions [^117Cm8GA] [^113n6Q7j].

> Let me consider when to escalate therapy beyond two drugs. In settings of advanced immunosuppression with CD4 less than 50 cells/mm3, high mycobacterial burden suggested by blood cultures with greater than 2 log10 CFU/mL, or absence of effective ART, adding a third or fourth agent can be considered; reasonable options include rifabutin 300 mg daily, a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin 500 mg daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, or an injectable aminoglycoside such as amikacin 10–15 mg/kg IV daily or streptomycin 1 g IV/IM daily, recognizing that randomized data supporting these additions come from the pre-modern ART era and that rifabutin has complex interactions requiring careful review [^111qUqjb] [^116JccoE] [^1173P6mh].

> I should confirm ART timing because this is easy to misjudge. ART should be started as soon as possible after diagnosing disseminated MAC, ideally within 2 weeks, and can be initiated simultaneously with antimycobacterial therapy in ART-naive patients with advanced immunosuppression; I need to screen for and manage drug–drug interactions, especially with rifamycins and macrolides, and coordinate regimen adjustments to maintain HIV suppression while treating MAC [^117VxTHj] [^117Cm8GA].

> But wait, what if symptoms flare after starting ART. I need to check for IRIS, which can present as paradoxical worsening with focal lymphadenitis, pneumonitis, or other localized syndromes in the absence of mycobacteremia; initial management is with NSAIDs, and if symptoms persist, a short course of systemic corticosteroids at prednisone-equivalent 20–40 mg daily for 4–8 weeks can be used, with close monitoring and consideration of surgical drainage for refractory nodes [^112MCjou] [^114mswYa] [^112iTRdc].

> Next, I should review primary prophylaxis indications so I don't overprescribe. Primary prophylaxis is not recommended for adults who immediately initiate effective ART regardless of CD4 count, but it is indicated for those with CD4 less than 50 cells/mm3 who are not on ART, remain viremic on ART, or have no options for fully suppressive ART; preferred agents are azithromycin 1,200 mg weekly or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, with rifabutin 300 mg daily as an alternative when macrolides are not tolerated, and I must obtain blood cultures to exclude active disease before starting to avoid resistance from inadvertent monotherapy [^117Nc18n] [^116tZGdu] [^114GMy1b].

> I should double-check treatment duration and discontinuation criteria. The minimum treatment duration is 12 months, and therapy can be discontinued only after at least 6 months of sustained CD4 recovery above 100 cells/mm3 on effective ART while the patient remains asymptomatic; if immune reconstitution is inadequate or ART fails, chronic maintenance therapy should continue, and if the CD4 count later falls below 100 cells/mm3, secondary prophylaxis should be restarted [^115GbwRX] [^1174gzf2] [^115tPe4D].

> Let me verify monitoring and how to define treatment failure. Clinical improvement is expected within 2–4 weeks, and if there is no response by 4–8 weeks or mycobacteremia persists, I should repeat blood cultures and obtain susceptibility testing, then construct a new multidrug regimen with at least two new active agents based on results; options include rifabutin, a fluoroquinolone, an injectable aminoglycoside, or investigational agents such as bedaquiline, tedizolid, linezolid, or omadacycline, while avoiding clofazimine and not continuing macrolides in the face of resistance [^111pep1M] [^111yTao5] [^114mswYa].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric considerations because thresholds and evidence differ. In children, disseminated MAC is diagnosed by culture from blood or sterile sites, with blood cultures highly sensitive; treatment should be coordinated with a pediatric infectious diseases specialist, typically using clarithromycin plus ethambutol with consideration of adding rifabutin in select cases, and secondary prophylaxis can be discontinued after at least 12 months of therapy if the child is asymptomatic, on stable ART, and has sustained CD4 recovery above age-specific thresholds, with lifelong prophylaxis reserved for those with continued immunosuppression [^114RYuvH] [^116NUuvt] [^112XYv1k].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I don't overlook localized disease. In people with HIV on suppressive ART and higher CD4 counts, isolated pulmonary or focal MAC disease may occur and should be managed per ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA pulmonary NTM guidelines, typically with a three-drug macrolide-based regimen for 12 months beyond culture conversion, reserving inhaled liposomal amikacin for refractory disease and avoiding routine use of injectables unless disease is severe or macrolide resistance is present [^116YW3xW] [^114webs9].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the practical algorithm. Suspect disseminated MAC in advanced HIV with compatible systemic symptoms, obtain blood cultures and susceptibility testing, start clarithromycin plus ethambutol promptly while initiating ART within 2 weeks, add rifabutin or a fluoroquinolone or an injectable aminoglycoside for severe immunosuppression or high burden, treat for at least 12 months and discontinue only after sustained CD4 above 100 cells/mm3 for 6 months on effective ART with no symptoms, monitor clinically and microbiologically at 4–8 weeks, and manage IRIS with NSAIDs and short-course steroids if needed, adjusting therapy based on culture results and tolerability throughout [^113QkLvL] [^117VxTHj] [^115GbwRX].

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is a severe, systemic infection in advanced HIV (CD4 < 50) [^116YZFE3] and other immunocompromised hosts, presenting with fever, night sweats, weight loss, diarrhea, and organomegaly [^112gaiTn]. Diagnosis requires **blood cultures** [^116Zkn8F] or isolation from sterile sites, with species identification and susceptibility testing [^117MS1cV]. Treatment is **combination therapy** with a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) plus ethambutol for at least 12 months [^113QkLvL] [^115GbwRX], with rifabutin or a fluoroquinolone added in severe cases [^111qUqjb]; ART should be started promptly [^117VxTHj] and coordinated to avoid drug interactions [^117Cm8GA]. Primary prophylaxis is indicated for HIV patients with CD4 < 50 not on effective ART [^117Nc18n], and therapy can be discontinued after sustained immune recovery (CD4 > 100 for ≥ 6 months) [^115tPe4D]. Prognosis is poor without ART [^114mLMnG] but improves markedly with immune reconstitution [^113QohGA].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **HIV infection**: Disseminated MAC is strongly associated with advanced HIV infection, particularly when CD4+ T-cell counts fall below 50 cells/mm³ [^116YZFE3].
- **Other immunocompromised states**: Patients with inherited or acquired immunodeficiencies, transplant recipients, and those receiving immunosuppressive therapies are also at increased risk [^1163HgPX].
- **Environmental exposure**: MAC organisms are ubiquitous in the environment, including water, soil, and dust, and infection is thought to occur through inhalation or ingestion [^1154fGHb].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Disseminated MAC presents with **nonspecific systemic symptoms** and multi-organ involvement [^112gaiTn]:

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and malaise are common [^114jqkHr].
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption are frequent due to intestinal involvement [^112gaiTn].
- **Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy**: These are common physical findings [^114jqkHr].
- **Laboratory abnormalities**: Anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and other liver enzyme abnormalities are typical [^112gaiTn].

---

## Diagnosis

Definitive diagnosis of disseminated MAC requires **isolation of the organism** from normally sterile sites, such as blood, bone marrow, or lymph nodes [^116Zkn8F]. Blood cultures are the most sensitive and minimally invasive method, with more than 90% of patients with disseminated MAC having positive blood cultures [^117MS1cV]. Species identification and susceptibility testing, particularly for macrolides, are essential to guide therapy and detect resistance [^117MS1cV].

---

## Treatment

Treatment of disseminated MAC involves **combination antimicrobial therapy** to prevent resistance and improve outcomes:

- **First-line therapy**: Clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily plus ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily is the preferred regimen [^113QkLvL].
- **Alternative therapy**: Azithromycin 500–600 mg orally daily plus ethambutol 15 mg/kg orally daily is recommended when clarithromycin is not tolerated or drug interactions are a concern [^111zZvsC].
- **Addition of rifabutin**: Adding rifabutin 300 mg orally daily may be considered in severe cases or when the mycobacterial burden is high, although drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy must be carefully managed [^116JccoE].
- **Duration**: Therapy should continue for at least 12 months and can be discontinued if the patient remains asymptomatic and has sustained CD4+ T-cell recovery above 100 cells/mm³ for at least 6 months on effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) [^115GbwRX].

---

## Role of antiretroviral therapy (ART)

ART is critical in the management of **disseminated MAC**. Immune reconstitution resulting from **effective ART** significantly improves outcomes and reduces recurrence. ART should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 2 weeks of starting MAC therapy, and coordinated to manage drug interactions, particularly with **rifamycins and macrolides** [^117VxTHj] [^117Cm8GA].

---

## Prophylaxis

Primary prophylaxis is recommended for HIV-infected individuals with **CD4+ T-cell counts below 50 cells/mm³** who are not receiving effective ART. Azithromycin 1,200 mg orally once weekly or clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily are preferred prophylactic agents. Prophylaxis can be discontinued once effective ART is established and immune recovery is sustained [^117Nc18n] [^114GMy1b].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with immune status and adherence to therapy. Without ART, **disseminated MAC** is associated with **high mortality** and significant morbidity [^114mLMnG]. With effective ART and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, prognosis improves substantially, though **recurrence** can occur if immune suppression persists or therapy is interrupted [^113QohGA].

---

## Complications

Disseminated MAC can lead to **severe complications**, including chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, hepatic dysfunction, and bone marrow suppression. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may occur upon initiation of ART, requiring careful management with anti-inflammatory therapy and close monitoring [^112MCjou].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **early initiation of ART**, immune preservation, and adherence to prophylactic regimens in high-risk patients. Environmental exposure avoidance is not practical due to the ubiquity of MAC organisms, but general hygiene and infection control measures are advisable [^114zdK1i].

---

Disseminated MAC is a severe opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with advanced HIV. Diagnosis relies on **culture from sterile sites**, and treatment requires **combination antimicrobial therapy** with close coordination of ART. Prognosis is poor without immune recovery but improves significantly with effective ART and adherence to therapy.

Background

Advanced HIV disease (AHD) is increasing, with late presentation accounting for half of newly diagnosed people with HIV (PWH) in Europe. Mortality in late-presenting PWH remains high, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, among other opportunistic infections, presents several diagnostic and treatment challenges that lead, ultimately, to a poor clinical outcome.

Objectives

We aimed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of disseminated MAC disease (dMACd) in PWH.

Sources

We performed a review of original articles, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed.

Content

We reviewed and discussed the most challenging steps in the management of PWH with AHD and dMACd: the current epidemiology in the era of effective antiretroviral treatment; clinical presentation and interpretation of symptoms in the context of other opportunistic infections and immune reconstitution; diagnosis, sampling, and timing to reach a definitive diagnosis; prophylaxis, treatment options, and indications for discontinuing MAC treatment; future perspectives; and the role of rifamycins in the treatment of dMACd.

Implications

Despite the widespread availability of effective antiretroviral treatment, dMACd still represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in PWH with AHD. Residual challenges are mainly related to the difficulties and timing required to reach a definitive diagnosis, and the discussion regarding the role of rifamycins in the treatment of dMACd is still open.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116YZFE3]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — epidemiology in people with HIV is marked by environmental ubiquity of MAC organisms and typical occurrence with profound immunosuppression, with CD4 T lymphocyte cell counts < 50 cells/mm3. In the era before effective antiretroviral therapy, M. avium was the etiologic agent in > 95% of people with HIV with advanced immunosuppression who acquired disseminated MAC disease, and an estimated 7% to 12% of adults with HIV have been previously infected with MAC. Historically, the incidence of disseminated MAC disease ranged from 20% to 40% in people with advanced immunosuppression without effective ART or chemoprophylaxis, whereas in the modern ART era the overall incidence has declined to < 2 cases of MAC as the first opportunistic infection per 1,000 person-years for individuals in care, even among those not receiving effective ART. The mode of infection is thought to be through repeated inhalation or ingestion via the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract; household or close contacts do not appear to be at increased risk, and person-to-person transmission is unlikely. Beyond a CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3, factors associated with increased risk include ongoing HIV viral replication despite ART, previous or concurrent opportunistic infections, reduced in vitro lymphoproliferative immune responses to M. avium antigens, and genetic predisposition in some populations.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) diagnosis in HIV — A confirmed diagnosis of disseminated MAC disease is based on compatible clinical signs and symptoms coupled with the isolation of MAC from cultures of blood, lymph fluid, bone marrow, or other normally sterile tissue or body fluids, although data suggest that bone marrow cultures have low yield for detection of MAC in this setting, particularly if blood cultures are negative. Species identification should be performed using molecular techniques, polymerase chain reaction-based assays, whole-genome sequencing, high-performance liquid chromatography, or biochemical tests. Other ancillary studies provide supportive diagnostic information, including acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of tissue, radiographic imaging, or other studies aimed at isolating organisms from focal infection sites. Although isolated pulmonary MAC disease is not often observed in people with advanced HIV-associated immunosuppression, occasionally MAC disease may be limited to the lung in people with HIV who are virologically suppressed on ART. Diagnostic criteria for disease limited to the lung in this setting should follow those established by the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA joint guideline, which include pulmonary clinical signs and symptoms, exclusion of other alternative diagnoses, nodular or cavitary disease on lung imaging, and a positive culture for MAC from at least two sputum specimens or at least one bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy sample. Detection of MAC organisms in the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract may represent colonization of these sites and may be a harbinger of disseminated MAC infection.

### Mycobacterium avium complex in patients with HIV infection in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy [^112DeQLy]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2004). Medium credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is a common complication of late-stage HIV-1 infection. Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the rate of MAC infection has declined substantially, but patients with low CD4 cell counts remain at risk. Among patients in the Johns Hopkins cohort with advanced HIV disease, the proportion developing MAC has fallen from 16% before 1996 to 4% after 1996, with a current rate of less than 1% per year. Factors associated with developing MAC include younger age, no use of HAART, and enrollment before 1996. Prophylaxis with azithromycin or clarithromycin is recommended for all patients with CD4 counts less than 50 cells/mL. Optimum treatment for disseminated MAC includes clarithromycin and ethambutol, and another investigation suggests that the addition of rifabutin might reduce mortality. Both prophylaxis and treatment of disseminated MAC can be discontinued in patients who have responded to HAART, and specific guidelines for withdrawing treatment have been published. Although HAART has altered the frequency and outcome of MAC infection, it remains an important complication of AIDS.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115GbwRX]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — preventing recurrence in people with HIV and disseminated disease specifies a minimum treatment duration and CD4 thresholds tied to discontinuation of therapy. People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should be treated for a minimum duration of 12 months (AII), and the CD4 count should be maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months before discontinuing MAC treatment. If initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not result in immune reconstitution, people with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should continue chronic maintenance therapy (AII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — epidemiology and risk factors in people with HIV include that, prior to effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), M. avium was the etiologic agent in > 95% of disseminated cases, and an estimated 7% to 12% of adults have previously contracted MAC, with no environmental exposure or behavior consistently linked to subsequent risk. Transmission is thought to occur via inhalation, ingestion, or inoculation through the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract; household or close contacts do not appear to be at increased risk, and person-to-person transmission is unlikely. Disease typically occurs with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 50 cells/mm3, with incidence of disseminated disease of 20% to 40% in advanced immunosuppression without effective ART or chemoprophylaxis; in the modern ART era, incidence has declined to < 2 cases of MAC as the first opportunistic infection (OI) per 1,000 person-years for individuals in care. Additional risk factors include plasma HIV RNA levels > 1,000 copies/mL, ongoing viral replication despite ART, previous or concurrent OIs, and reduced in vitro lymphoproliferative responses to M. avium antigens.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1174gzf2]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — disseminated in people with HIV: People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should be treated for a minimum duration of 12 months (AII). Shorter duration of treatment may be considered depending on the degree of immunologic recovery following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (CIII); the CD4 count should be maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months before discontinuing MAC treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112gaiTn]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) clinical manifestations in people with HIV — In people with HIV with advanced immunosuppression who are not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), MAC disease generally presents as a disseminated, multi-organ infection, although localized disease may also be seen. Early symptoms may be minimal and can precede mycobacteremia or positive tissue cultures by several weeks. Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities particularly associated with disseminated MAC disease include anemia and elevated liver alkaline phosphatase levels, and hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy may be identified on examination or imaging. Localized MAC disease occurs more often in people with HIV on suppressive ART with increased CD4 counts than in people with HIV not on ART, with localized syndromes including lymphadenitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, and central nervous system infection; localized syndromes may also be manifestations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111R7E94]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease — occurrence despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy is noted, as MAC disease still can occur in people with HIV on suppressive ART and the clinical presentation may differ from untreated HIV. In one retrospective case series, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease occurred in nine virologically suppressed individuals — seven with pulmonary disease only and two with extrapulmonary disease — and MAC was the most common pathogen, isolated in 19 of the 34 cases; those with extrapulmonary disease were younger and had higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts at diagnosis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117Nc18n]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) primary prophylaxis — indications: Primary prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease is not recommended for adults and adolescents with HIV who immediately initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART), regardless of CD4 count (AII). People with HIV who have CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 and who are not receiving ART, remain viremic on ART, or have no options for a fully suppressive ART regimen should receive chemoprophylaxis against disseminated MAC (AI). Before prophylaxis is initiated, disseminated MAC disease should be ruled out by clinical assessment and, if appropriate based on that assessment, by obtaining a blood culture for MAC. MAC prophylaxis should be delayed until results are available to avoid exposing patients to monotherapy and the attendant risk of drug resistance (AI).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117VxTHj]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation with disseminated MAC in people with HIV: ART should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of MAC disease, preferably at the same time as initiation of antimycobacterial therapy in people with HIV and disseminated MAC disease who are not receiving effective ART (BIII). ART is recommended as soon as possible to reduce the risk of further AIDS-defining OIs and to further improve the response to antimycobacterial therapy in the setting of advanced immunosuppression (BIII); if ART has already been initiated, it should be continued, and regimens should be modified when there is any potential for an adverse drug–drug interaction(s) between the antiretroviral (ARV) and antimycobacterial drugs (BIII). People with HIV will need continuous antimycobacterial treatment until ART results in sustained immune reconstitution, as indicated above (CD4 count maintained above 100 cells/mm3 for at least 6 months).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111pep1M]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Managing treatment failure in disseminated MAC defines failure as the absence of a clinical response with persistence of mycobacteremia (or persistently positive tissue cultures from other sites) after 4 to 8 weeks of treatment, and repeat testing of MAC isolates for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended for people with HIV whose disease relapses after an initial response to treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prevention in children with HIV notes that MAC is ubiquitous, available information does not support specific recommendations regarding exposure avoidance, and person-to-person transmission is not believed to be common. Although detection of MAC in stool or the respiratory tract may precede disseminated disease, no data demonstrate a correlation between initiating prophylaxis at those sites and reduced risk of disseminated MAC. The most effective way to prevent disseminated MAC in children with HIV infection is to preserve immune function through use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Children with HIV infection who have advanced immunosuppression should be offered prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease according to the CD4 count thresholds for children, and before prophylaxis is initiated in at-risk children, disseminated MAC disease must be ruled out, which includes obtaining a blood culture for MAC.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — clinical manifestations in advanced immunosuppression often present as disseminated, multi-organ infection in people not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with early symptoms that may be minimal, can precede detectable mycobacteremia by several weeks, and may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities associated with disseminated disease include anemia and elevated liver alkaline phosphatase levels; hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy may be found on examination or imaging, and localized disease can produce other focal findings. In people receiving and responding to ART with an increase in CD4 cell counts, localized manifestations have been reported more often, including cervical, intraabdominal or mediastinal lymphadenitis, pneumonitis, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, or central nervous system infection. Localized syndromes may also reflect immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is recognized as a systemic inflammatory syndrome clinically indistinguishable from active MAC infection with bacteremia generally absent; MAC-associated IRIS can occur as "unmasking" IRIS in subclinical MAC or "paradoxical" IRIS in those with previously established MAC disease.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — diagnosis relies on compatible clinical signs and symptoms coupled with isolation of MAC from sterile-site cultures, with species identification using molecular techniques or biochemical tests; ancillary studies (acid-fast bacilli smear and culture of stool or tissue biopsy material and radiographic imaging) provide supportive information. Detection of MAC organisms in the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract may represent colonization and may be a harbinger of disseminated infection, and routine screening of respiratory or GI specimens and pre-emptive treatment for MAC is not recommended because no data are available regarding efficacy of treating asymptomatic colonization with clarithromycin, azithromycin, rifabutin, or other drugs alone or in combination.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) treatment in HIV — initial treatment should consist of two or more antimycobacterial drugs to prevent or delay the emergence of resistance (AI), with clarithromycin the preferred first agent (AI); azithromycin can be substituted for clarithromycin when drug interactions or intolerance preclude its use (AII). Testing MAC isolates for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is recommended for all people with HIV. Ethambutol is the recommended second drug for the initial treatment of MAC disease (AI), and some clinicians would add rifabutin as a third drug (CI); randomized trials completed before effective antiretroviral therapy found that adding rifabutin to clarithromycin and ethambutol improved survival and reduced emergence of drug resistance in individuals with AIDS and disseminated MAC disease, but whether similar results would be observed with effective ART has not been established. Some experts would recommend adding a third or fourth drug in high‑risk settings such as advanced immunosuppression (CD4 count < 50 cells/ mm3), high mycobacterial loads (> 2 log10 colony-forming units/ mL of blood), and/or the absence of effective ART (CIII); options include a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin (CIII) or an injectable agent such as amikacin or streptomycin (CIII).

Nontuberculous mycobacterial disease in HIV-infected persons most often causes disseminated disease, with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium kansasii accounting for the majority of disseminated cases; disseminated MAC typically presents with fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain with possible lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and/or splenomegaly, and diagnosis requires isolation of the organism from blood, lymph node, bone marrow, or other sterile sites; immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs commonly with mycobacterial infections and MAC-IRIS most frequently presents with focal lymphadenitis, with other manifestations including pneumonitis, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin and soft tissue abscesses, and central nervous system involvement, with absence of mycobacteremia; treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and prednisone for moderate to severe cases, and occasionally surgical drainage of affected nodes; M. kansasii is less common than TB or MAC, more often causes pulmonary than extrapulmonary/disseminated disease, and presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, and weight loss with radiographic findings including alveolar and interstitial infiltrates, thin-walled cavities, nodules, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy.

14.1 Clinical Studies in Patients with Advanced HIV Infection for the Prevention and Treatment of Disease Due to Disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC)

[see Indications and Usage (1)]

Prevention of Disseminated MAC Disease

Two randomized, double-blind clinical trials were performed in patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mcL. The first trial (Study 155) compared azithromycin (1,200 mg once weekly) to placebo and enrolled 182 patients with a mean CD4 count of 35 cells/mcL. The second trial (Study 174) randomized 723 patients to either azithromycin (1,200 mg once weekly), rifabutin (300 mg daily), or the combination of both. The mean CD4 count was 51 cells/mcL. The primary endpoint in these trials was disseminated MAC disease. Other endpoints included the incidence of clinically significant MAC disease and discontinuations from therapy for drug-related side effects.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) chronic maintenance therapy (secondary prophylaxis) — regimens and stop/restart rules: Chronic maintenance therapy uses the same as treatment regimens. Criteria for discontinuing chronic maintenance therapy (All) are completed at least 12 months therapy, no signs and symptoms of MAC disease, and sustained (> 6 months) CD4 count > 100 cells/mm3 in response to ART.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in children with HIV — secondary prophylaxis and discontinuation criteria are as follows: Children with a history of disseminated MAC and continued immunosuppression should receive lifelong prophylaxis to prevent recurrence (strong, low), and secondary prophylaxis typically consists of continued multidrug therapy used in treatment of disease; some experts recommend discontinuation of therapy in children with HIV infection who meet all of the following: aged ≥ 2 years and have completed ≥ 12 months of treatment for MAC; remain asymptomatic for MAC; receiving stable ART; and have sustained (≥ 6 months) CD4 count recovery well above the age-specific target for initiation of primary prophylaxis, i.e., > 100 cells/mm3 for children aged ≥ 6 years [strong, low] and > 200 cells/mm3 for children aged 2 to < 6 years [weak, very low].

Preventing recurrence and stopping secondary prophylaxis in disseminated MAC — People with HIV and disseminated MAC disease should continue chronic maintenance therapy (AII) unless ART results in immune reconstitution. The risk of MAC recurrence is low after at least a 12-month MAC treatment course when patients remain asymptomatic with respect to MAC signs and symptoms and sustain an increase in CD4 count to > 100 cells/mm3 for ≥ 6 months after initiation of ART; in this setting, it is reasonable to discontinue maintenance therapy (AI). Reintroducing chronic maintenance therapy or secondary prophylaxis may be indicated for those without a fully suppressive ART regimen who have a decline in CD4 count to levels consistently below 100 cells/mm3 (BIII).

### Disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria in HIV-infected patients, Oregon, USA, 2007–2012 [^116JR7SA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and are increasingly implicated in human diseases worldwide. Disseminated NTM infections are seen exclusively among immunocompromised hosts, including those with AIDS. Historically, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) has been among the most common AIDS-presenting diagnoses, with a 49% case-fatality rate at 1 year. After 1987, the number of reported disseminated NTM infections grew with the prevalence of AIDS; in 1990, between 15% and 24% of US residents with AIDS had disseminated NTM (primarily MAC).

After the US Public Health Service formally recommended prophylaxis for MAC prevention in 1993 and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became widespread in 1996, disseminated MAC in HIV patients declined. Incidence estimates of 10,000 cases/100,000 person-years in 1992 declined to 250 cases/100,000 person-years in 2007 in the United States; however, patient populations studied were limited to those established in specialty HIV care. Modern-day population-based estimates are lacking. Having access to statewide NTM isolates and HIV case reporting, we sought to generate a population-based estimate of disseminated NTM disease incidence among patients infected with HIV in Oregon, USA.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Preventing disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — primary prophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease is not recommended for adults and adolescents with HIV who immediately initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) (AII), and people with HIV who are not receiving ART or who remain viremic on ART but have no current options for a fully suppressive ART regimen should receive chemoprophylaxis against disseminated MAC disease if they have CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 (AI). Primary MAC prophylaxis, if previously initiated, should be discontinued in adults and adolescents who are continuing on a fully suppressive ART regimen (AII), and two randomized, placebo-controlled trials and observational data have demonstrated that people with HIV taking ART can discontinue primary prophylaxis with minimal risk of developing MAC disease. In an analysis of 369 people with HIV with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 while on ART and followed for at least six months, the overall incidence of MAC disease was 0.6 per 100 person-months, with no MAC among 71 persons on ART who were virologically suppressed at baseline, including 41 not receiving primary prophylaxis; another study enrolled 157 people with HIV with at least one CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3 and found that the incidence of MAC disease was not statistically significantly different between those receiving primary prophylaxis and those not (3.4 per 100 person-years versus 0.8 per 100 person-years), with no differences in achieving a CD4 count > 100 cells/mm3 or viral suppression within 12 months. In each of these studies, plasma HIV RNA level > 1,000 copies/mL was the principal risk factor for developing MAC disease regardless of MAC prophylaxis.

### A study of discontinuing maintenance therapy in human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex: AIDS clinical trial group 393 study team [^116XSu2E]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The present nonrandomized prospective study evaluated whether antimycobacterial therapy for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) could be withdrawn from human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects who experienced immunologic recovery while receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Eligible subjects had received macrolide-based therapy for least 12 months, were asymptomatic for MAC, had received HAART for at least 16 weeks, and had CD4+ T cell counts > 100 cells/microL. Forty-eight subjects were enrolled, with a median CD4+ T cell count of 240 cells/microL at the time of discontinuation of MAC therapy. Forty-seven subjects remained MAC free, whereas 1 subject developed localized MAC osteomyelitis. The median duration of follow-up while not receiving therapy was 77 weeks, and the incidence of MAC infection was 1.44/100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.04–8.01). Withdrawal of anti-MAC therapy appears to be safe in patients who have been treated with a macrolide-based regimen for at least 1 year and have an immunologic response on HAART.

### Successful discontinuation of therapy for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection after effective antiretroviral therapy [^113QohGA]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is associated with improvement or resolution of several HIV-associated opportunistic infections. Although prophylaxis against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection may be successfully discontinued after a favorable response to HAART, the 1999 guidelines from the U.S. Public Health Service/Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend continuing therapy for disseminated M. avium complex infection, regardless of the response to HAART.

Objective

To examine the outcome among patients with disseminated M. avium complex infection whose antimycobacterial therapy was discontinued after a favorable response to HAART.

Design

Retrospective chart review between May 2000 and May 2001.

Setting

13 Canadian HIV clinics.

Patients

52 HIV-infected adults (43 men; mean age, 37.3 years) in whom successful antimycobacterial therapy for disseminated M. avium complex infection was discontinued after a favorable virologic response to HAART.

Measurements

Survival, survival free of disseminated M. avium complex infection, and CD4(+) cell count responses.

Results

At the time of diagnosis of disseminated M. avium complex infection, the median CD4(+) cell count was 0.016 × 10⁹ cells/L, and the median plasma HIV RNA level was 90 000 copies/mL (plasma HIV RNA levels were available for only 21 patients). The patients received a median of 32 months of antimycobacterial therapy that included ethambutol plus either clarithromycin or azithromycin. When antimycobacterial therapy was discontinued, the median CD4(+) cell count was 0.23 × 10⁹ cells/L and the median plasma HIV RNA level was less than 50 copies/mL. A median of 20 months after discontinuation of antimycobacterial therapy, only 1 patient had developed recurrent M. avium complex disease (37 months after stopping antimycobacterial therapy). This patient had stopped HAART 2 months earlier because of uncontrolled HIV viremia. Twenty months after stopping antimycobacterial therapy, the other 51 patients had a median CD4(+) cell count of 0.288 × 10⁹ cells/L; 34 (67%) had undetectable plasma HIV RNA levels, and 8 (15%) had plasma HIV RNA levels of 50 to 1000 copies/mL.

Conclusions

Discontinuation of successful disseminated M. avium complex therapy after a successful response to HAART is safe and reduces patients' pill burdens, potential drug adverse effects, drug interactions, and costs of therapy.

### Localized osteomyelitis due to Mycobacterium avium complex in patients with human immunodeficiency virus receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy [^115igkv7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We describe 3 patients who developed atypical manifestations of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection > 10 months (range, 3–16 months) after attaining sustained CD4(+) T cell counts of > 100 cells/microL while receiving antiretroviral therapy and not receiving MAC prophylaxis. The common features of these cases include the degree of immune reconstitution, the unusual locations of the infections, and the absence of a systemic inflammatory response. The low rate of these unusual MAC infections does not warrant continuation of primary or secondary prophylaxis after presumed immune reconstitution.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) epidemiology and rationale against primary prophylaxis — among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and not receiving MAC prophylaxis, the incidence of primary MAC disease was 0.74 per 1,000 person-years (IQ range 0.68 to 0.80). These data suggest that primary MAC prophylaxis provides no additional benefit in patients started on effective ART that results in viral suppression. Additional arguments against primary MAC prophylaxis include increased cost, adverse effects of prophylaxis drugs, and the risk that, in those who might develop "unmasking MAC IRIS" after starting ART, monotherapy for MAC prophylaxis may result in acquired drug resistance in those with active MAC disease.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in people with HIV — monitoring of response and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) management — specifies that a repeat blood culture for MAC should be obtained 4 weeks to 8 weeks after initiating antimycobacterial therapy only in people with HIV who do not have a clinical response to their initial treatment regimens, with improvement in fever and a decline in mycobacterial burden expected within 2 weeks to 4 weeks after starting appropriate therapy; for IRIS, people with HIV on ART who develop moderate-to-severe symptoms should receive initial treatment with non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (CIII), and if symptoms do not improve, short-term (4 weeks–8 weeks) systemic corticosteroid therapy at doses equivalent to 20 to 40 mg of oral prednisone daily has been successful in reducing symptoms and morbidity (CII).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117MS1cV]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in children with HIV — diagnosis is established by culture, with MAC definitively diagnosed by isolation of the organism from blood or sterile-site biopsy, and blood cultures being sensitive and minimally invasive as > 90% of individuals with disseminated MAC have positive blood cultures. Multiple mycobacterial blood cultures over time may be required, greater blood volume increases yield, and use of a radiometric broth medium or lysis-centrifugation culture technique can enhance recovery from blood. After growth, MAC isolates can be identified by nucleic acid probes or by high-performance liquid chromatography of mycolic acid patterns, though availability of the latter may be limited to high volume laboratories. Histology showing macrophage-containing acid-fast bacilli is strongly indicative, but culture is essential to differentiate nontuberculous mycobacteria from M. tuberculosis, determine the infecting nontuberculous mycobacterium, and perform drug-susceptibility testing; susceptibility testing to clarithromycin or azithromycin is most useful because clinical response correlates with macrolide susceptibility. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction platforms for rapid identification and susceptibility testing are currently only available in research laboratories, and detection of MAC in stool or the respiratory tract does not have evidence that initiating prophylaxis at these sites reduces risk of disseminated MAC.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in HIV — companion drugs and escalation criteria note that "Ethambutol is the recommended second drug for the initial treatment of MAC disease (AI)" based on trials showing lower relapse. Escalation options state: "Rifabutin can be used as a third drug (CI) with or without a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) (CIII), or an injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or streptomycin) (CIII) can be used as a fourth drug" when severe disease, high mortality risk, likely resistance, or specific high-risk settings apply, including "advanced immunosuppression (CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3), high mycobacterial loads (> 2 log10 colony-forming units/mL of blood), or the absence of effective ART (CIII)". Evidence includes "One randomized clinical trial" where adding rifabutin to clarithromycin plus ethambutol improved survival and "two randomized clinical trials" where it reduced resistance, although "These studies were completed before the availability of effective ART" and it is "not… established" whether results apply with effective ART.

### Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, 1985–2000 [^114mLMnG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex disease remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. From 1985 through 2000, we studied 1458 consecutive patients at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, with disseminated M. avium complex disease. There was a peak of 198 patients in the 1995, which decreased to 66 patients in 2000. In 1997, significantly more patients than in 1991 or 1994 were female (P < .001) or black (P < .001) and significantly fewer had acquired human immunodeficiency virus through homosexual contact (P < .001). In 1997, 50 (51%) of 99 of patients acquired M. avium complex disease despite receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis, but 32 (89%) of 36 patients did not adhere to the prophylaxis regimen. The median duration of survival of patients in 1991 was 110 days, whereas in 1994 it was 185 days, and in 1997 it was 339 days (P < .001). Prolonged survival was associated with receiving therapy that included clarithromycin and receiving combination antiretroviral therapy that included a protease inhibitor.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) treatment failure — definition and management is described as follows: MAC treatment failure is defined as the absence of clinical response and the persistence of mycobacteremia after 8 to 12 weeks of treatment. Repeat susceptibility testing of MAC isolates is recommended, and a new multidrug regimen of two or more drugs not previously used should be administered. Drugs that should be considered for this scenario include rifabutin, amikacin, and a quinolone, and data suggest injectable agents such as amikacin or streptomycin may be additional considerations.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116tZGdu]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) primary prophylaxis — primary prophylaxis is not recommended for adults and adolescents who immediately initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART) (AII). Indications for primary prophylaxis are CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3 AND not receiving ART or remains viremic on ART or has no options for a fully suppressive ART regimen (AI). Before primary prophylaxis is initiated, disseminated MAC disease should be ruled out by clinical assessment, and if appropriate, by obtaining a blood culture for MAC (AII), and if blood culture is obtained, prophylaxis should be delayed until results are available to avoid exposing patients to monotherapy and the attendant risk of drug resistance (AII). Preferred therapy options are azithromycin 1,200 mg PO once weekly (AI), clarithromycin 500 mg PO twice daily (AI), or azithromycin 600 mg PO twice weekly (BIII). Alternative therapy is rifabutin 300 mg PO daily (BI) in people who cannot tolerate azithromycin or clarithromycin; dose adjustment of rifabutin may be necessary based on drug–drug interactions, and active TB should be ruled out before starting rifabutin to avoid monotherapy in the setting of active TB. If previously initiated, primary prophylaxis should be discontinued if the patient is continuing on a fully suppressive ART regimen (AI). During pregnancy, if ART is immediately initiated, then primary prophylaxis for MAC disease is not recommended (AIII), and when primary prophylaxis is required because of the absence of effective ART, azithromycin is the preferred agent (BIII).

### Managing Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease with a little help from my friend [^115vDpbE]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease is complicated, frequently unsuccessful, and frustrating to patients and clinicians. The initial treatment effort may not be directed solely at MAC infection, rather it is often initiating airway clearance measures for bronchiectasis. The next important steps are deciding who to treat and when to initiate therapy. Definitive or unambiguous guidance for these decisions is often elusive. The evidence supporting the current macrolide-based regimen for treating MAC lung disease is compelling. This regimen has been recommended in consensus nontuberculous mycobacterial treatment guidelines from 1997, 2007, and 2020, although clinician compliance with these recommendations is inconsistent. Understanding the idiosyncrasies of MAC antibiotic resistance is crucial for optimal antibiotic management. As a corollary, the importance of avoiding development of macrolide resistance due to inadequate therapy cannot be overstated. An inhaled liposome amikacin preparation is now approved for treating refractory MAC lung disease and holds promise for an even broader role in MAC therapy. Surgery is also an important therapeutic adjunct for selected patients. Microbiologic recurrences due either to new infection or treatment relapse/failure are common and require the same level of rigorous assessment and clinical judgment for determining their significance as initial MAC isolates. In summary, treatment of patients with MAC lung disease is rarely straight forward and requires familiarity with multiple factors directly and indirectly related to MAC lung disease. The many nuances of MAC lung disease therapy defy simple treatment algorithms; however, with patience, attention to detail, and perseverance, the outcome for most patients is favorable.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (management of disseminated M. avium complex disease), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering any of the following options as the third or fourth drug:

- rifabutin 300 mg PO daily, adjusting the dose based on drug-drug interactions, if needed

- a fluoroquinolone, such as levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily

- injectable aminoglycoside, such as amikacin 10–15 mg/kg IV daily or streptomycin 1 gm IV or IM daily.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113n6Q7j]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in HIV — initial treatment recommendations emphasize that "Initial treatment of MAC disease should consist of two or more antimycobacterial drugs… (AI)". "Clarithromycin (AI) or azithromycin (AII) are preferred first agents", with azithromycin acceptable when interactions or intolerance preclude clarithromycin (AII). High-dose clarithromycin " > 1 g/day… should not be used (AI)" due to increased mortality. Susceptibility testing to clarithromycin or azithromycin "is recommended for all people with HIV", and resistance during prophylaxis has been documented: "In three randomized clinical trials… clarithromycin-resistant isolates were reported in 29% and 58%… and azithromycin-resistant isolates were recovered from 11%". More advanced immunosuppression at prophylaxis initiation and longer prophylaxis duration are associated with higher clarithromycin resistance at failure.

TREATMENT STRATEGIES

Studies of the natural history of NTM-PD provide insight on disease progression. In 1 study of 488 patients who met the ATS/IDSA diagnostic criteria for MAC-PD and were treatment-naive, approximately 62% progressed, resulting in treatment initiation within 3 years of diagnosis, while approximately 24% remained stable and untreated. Of those who remained stable, sputum cultures spontaneously converted to negative in approximately 52%. In another study of 551 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for MAC-PD, approximately 59% progressed and received treatment within 3 years of diagnosis, 41% remained stable requiring no treatment, and 52% of the stable patients had spontaneous sputum conversion.

Several risk factors are associated with progression of MAC-PD and initiation of treatment (Table 3). Patient factors include young age, male sex, low body mass index, and having comorbidities. Elevated inflammatory markers, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia are among the laboratory risk factors. Patients with fibrocavitary and/or more extensive disease are more likely to have disease progression. Not only the bacterial load but also the species of Mycobacterium are associated with progression of NTM. For example, M. intracellulare might be more pathogenic than M. avium.

Abstract

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous in the environment and an important cause of disease. The most common species causing pulmonary disease are members of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) can be chronic, debilitating, costly, and associated with a high mortality. However, MAC diagnoses are often delayed due to the nonspecific presentation of MAC-PD and radiological findings that overlap with other pulmonary diseases. Patients with risk factors and who meet the diagnostic criteria — which include clinical, radiological, and microbiologic criteria — should be considered for treatment. Diagnosis requires 2 or more positive sputum cultures or 1 bronchoscopic specimen culture. The recommendation for those who are treated is a 3-drug regimen including macrolide, rifamycin, and ethambutol that is continued for 12 months beyond sputum culture conversion to negative. MAC-PD is difficult to treat, with frequent drug-related side effects and suboptimal treatment outcomes. Refractory and recurrent disease is common, leading to lifelong follow-up of patients. There are limited treatment options for patients with macrolide-resistant or refractory disease. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is recommended for treatment-refractory patients whose cultures remain positive after 6 months of guideline-based therapy. Among the research priorities to improve patient outcomes and quality of life are developing new, more rapid diagnostic tests, investigating biomarkers associated with disease progression, and identifying new drugs and routes of administration as well as new, shorter, and better-tolerated regimens.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium Complex (MAC) in children with HIV — secondary prophylaxis discontinuation: There are no randomized clinical trials in children on discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis. Some experts recommend discontinuation of therapy in children with HIV who meet all the following criteria: aged ≥ 2 years and have completed ≥ 12 months of treatment for MAC; remain asymptomatic for MAC; receiving stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) not requiring change for virologic or immunologic failure; and have sustained (≥ 6 months) CD4 count recovery well above the age-specific target for initiation of primary prophylaxis (as in adults, > 100 cells/mm3 for children aged ≥ 6 years [strong, low], and > 200 cells/mm3 for children aged 2 to < 6 years [weak, very low]). Multidrug secondary prophylaxis should be reintroduced if the CD4 count falls below the age-related threshold.

Background

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is a common complication of advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease and is an independent predictor of mortality and shortened survival.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at preventing MAC infection in adults and children with HIV infection.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library (search date December 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different strategies for preventing MAC infection in HIV-infected individuals.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility and quality, and extracted data. Where data were incomplete or unclear, a third reviewer resolved conflicts and/or trial authors were contacted for further details. Development of MAC infection and survival were compared using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The quality of evidence has been assessed using the GRADE methodology.

Main Results

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials: There was no statistically significant difference between clofazimine and no treatment groups in the number of patients that developed MAC infection (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.80). Rifabutin (one study; RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67), azithromycin (three studies; RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.74) and clarithromycin (one study; RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.58) were more effective than placebo in preventing the development of MAC infection. There was no statistically significant difference between those treated with clofazimine (one study; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.41 to 2.32), rifabutin (one study RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.05), azithromycin (three studies, pooled RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.32) and placebo in number of reported deaths. One study found that the risk of death was reduced by 22% in patients treated with clarithromycin compared to those treated with placebo (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.96). Monotherapy vs. monotherapy: Patients treated with clarithromycin (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.89) and azithromycin (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89) were 40% less likely to develop MAC infection than those treated with rifabutin. There was no statistically significant difference between those treated with clarithromycin (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15), azithromycin (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24) and rifabutin in the number of reported deaths. Combination therapy versus monotherapy: There was no statistically significant difference between patients treated with a combination of rifabutin and clarithromycin and those treated with clarithromycin alone (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.20); and those treated with combination of rifabutin and azithromycin and those treated with azithromycin alone (RR 0.59; 95% CI 1.03). Patients treated with a combination of rifabutin plus clarithromycin were 56% less likely to develop MAC infection than those treated with rifabutin alone (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.69). Patients treated with a combination of rifabutin plus azithromycin were 65% less likely to develop MAC infection than those treated with rifabutin alone (RR 0.35; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.59). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of reported deaths in all the four different comparisons of prophylactic agents.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited data, azithromycin or clarithromycin appeared to be a prophylactic agent of choice for MAC infection. Further studies are needed, especially direct comparison of clarithromycin and azithromycin. In additions, studies that will compare different doses and regimens are needed.

Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in HIV — macrolide dosing and antiretroviral interactions specify that doses of clarithromycin > 1 g/day have been associated with increased mortality and should not be used (AI); protease inhibitors (PIs) can increase clarithromycin levels so clarithromycin dose adjustment or switching clarithromycin to azithromycin may be necessary, and because azithromycin metabolism is not affected by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, azithromycin can be used safely in the presence of PIs, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or integrase inhibitors without concerns about drug interactions.

### Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease in patients without HIV infection [^114zz98P]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is ubiquitous. It is found in various freshwater and saltwater sources around the world, including hot water pipes. Although the organism was identified in the 1890s, its potential to cause human disease was only recognized 50 years later. Only a minority of people exposed to the organism will acquire MAC lung disease, usually those with underlying lung disease or immunosuppression. MAC may, however, cause progressive parenchymal lung disease and bronchiectasis in patients without underlying lung disease, particularly in middle-aged and elderly women. Preliminary data suggest that the interferon-gamma pathways may be deficient in elderly women with MAC lung disease. Other groups of patients who are more likely to harbor MAC in their lungs include patients with a cystic fibrosis or an abnormal alpha(1)-antiproteinase gene and patients with certain chest wall abnormalities. Treatment results continue to be disappointing, and the mortality of patients with MAC lung disease remains high. A PubMed search identified 38 reports of the treatment of MAC lung disease. Apart from the British Thoracic Society study, the only published controlled investigation, the studies published since 1994 have included a macrolide, either clarithromycin or azithromycin, usually in combination with ethambutol and a rifamycin. If success is defined as eradication of the organism without relapse over a period of several years after treatment has been discontinued, the reported treatment success rate with the macrolide containing regimens is approximately 55%. The prolonged treatment period, side effects, and possibly reinfection rather than relapse are responsible for the high failure rate.

### Emergence of disseminated infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria in non-HIV-infected patients, including immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients in a university hospital in Taiwan [^1163HgPX]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although disseminated nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection has been increasingly reported in patients with AIDS, this condition is still considered rare in non-HIV-infected patients.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of non-HIV-infected patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from January 1997 to December 2004 to search for epidemiological trends in disseminated NTM infection. Data analyzed included etiology, demographic characteristics, underlying disease, initial symptoms and signs, treatment, and outcomes.

Results

Disseminated NTM infections occurred in 15 non-HIV-infected patients during the study period. The mean age of these patients was 51 years (range 13–80). Among these patients, eight were males, and eight had various immunocompromised conditions. Fever was an initial presentation in 12 patients (80%). Diagnosis was made by positive blood (seven patients) or bone marrow culture (five patients) in the majority (73%) of patients. Infectious etiologies included Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in eight, rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) in four and Mycobacterium kansasii in three. The mean time from initial presentation to initiation of anti-NTM therapy was 130 days (ranged from 9 days to 17 months). Mortality was highest in patients with M. kansasii (100%), followed by RGM (25%) and MAC (12.5%).

Conclusions

Although disseminated NTM infection is an emerging condition among patients without HIV infection, it is a condition which is associated with immune deficiency. A high level of clinical suspicion should be maintained for avoiding delayed diagnosis, especially in patients with underlying immunosuppression. Blood culture might play an important role in the early diagnosis of disseminated NTM disease. Early diagnosis can lead to appropriate diagnosis and reduce mortality.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Two randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Study 023 and Study 027) compared rifabutin (300 mg/day) to placebo in patients with CDC-defined AIDS and CD4 counts ≤ 200 cells/µL. These studies accrued patients from 2/90 through 2/92. Study 023 enrolled 590 patients, with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 42 cells/µL (mean 61). Study 027 enrolled 556 patients with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 40 cells/µL (mean 58).

Endpoints included the following:

MAC bacteremia, defined as at least one blood culture positive for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria.
Clinically significant disseminated MAC disease, defined as MAC bacteremia accompanied by signs or symptoms of serious MAC infection, including one or more of the following: fever, night sweats, rigors, weight loss, worsening anemia, and/or elevations in alkaline phosphatase.
Survival.

MAC Bacteremia

Participants who received rifabutin were one-third to one-half as likely to develop MAC bacteremia as were participants who received placebo. These results were statistically significant (Study 023: p < 0.001; Study 027: p = 0.002).

In Study 023, the one-year cumulative incidence of MAC bacteremia, on an intent to treat basis, was 9% for patients randomized to rifabutin and 22% for patients randomized to placebo. In Study 027, these rates were 13% and 28% for patients receiving rifabutin and placebo, respectively.

Most cases of MAC bacteremia (approximately 90% in these studies) occurred among participants whose CD4 count at study entry was ≤ 100 cells/µL. The median and mean CD4 counts at onset of MAC bacteremia were 13 cells/µL and 24 cells/µL, respectively. These studies did not investigate the optimal time to begin MAC prophylaxis.

Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease

In association with the decreased incidence of bacteremia, patients on rifabutin showed reductions in the signs and symptoms of disseminated MAC disease, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, anemia, and hepatic dysfunction.

Survival

The one-year survival rates in Study 023 were 77% for the group receiving rifabutin and 77% for the placebo group. In Study 027, the one-year survival rates were 77% for the group receiving rifabutin and 70% for the placebo group.

These differences were not statistically significant.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) continues to be a challenging problem in some patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite the availability of potent chemotherapeutic agents. The use of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy has shown promise in vitro, but there is currently limited supportive clinical evidence [Kemper CA, Bermudez LE, Derenski SC. Immunomodulatory treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex bacteraemia in patients with AIDS by use of recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

Refractory MAC-PD

Patients with MAC-PD should have several sputum cultures performed during their treatment course. The Nontuberculous Mycobacteria Network European Trials Group (NTM-NET) consensus panel defined treatment failure as "the re-emergence of multiple positive cultures or persistence of positive cultures with the causative species from respiratory samples after ≥ 12 months of antimycobacterial treatment while the patient is still on treatment". However, waiting for 12 months to consider someone to have failed treatment could result in further unnecessary disease progression if something could be done earlier in the course of therapy to improve treatment.

Several studies provide evidence to suggest that we can determine who is likely to fail treatment much earlier than 12 months into therapy. In a study of 180 patients treated with standard therapy for MAC-PD, 83% of patients had sputum conversion to culture-negative. The change from baseline to month 3 in semiquantitative sputum culture score was highly predictive of subsequent sputum culture status at 12 months as well as treatment success. Others have shown that culture conversion by 6 months predicts culture status at 12 months. A study of 470 treatment-naive patients with MAC-PD found that 76% achieved culture conversion to negative within 12 months of treatment. Of those patients, 94% were culture-negative within 6 months of treatment. For the 24% of patients who did not achieve culture conversion to negative at 12 months, 93% did not have negative culture conversion at 6 months. Accordingly, patients who have not converted their culture by 6 months of therapy are unlikely to do so, and such patients are considered to have "treatment-refractory" disease. Together, these studies strongly suggest that culture status or change in semiquantitative cultures in the first 6 months of therapy is predictive of subsequent response to therapy.

This multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 clinical trial compared the safety and efficacy of 3 clarithromycin-containing combination regimens for the treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A total of 160 eligible patients with bacteremic MAC disease were randomized to receive clarithromycin with either ethambutol (C+E), rifabutin (C+R), or both (C+E+R) for 48 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, the proportion of subjects with a complete microbiologic response was not statistically significantly different among treatment arms: the proportion was 40% in the C+E group, 42% in the C+R group, and 51% in the C+E+R group (P = 0.454). The proportion of patients with complete or partial responses who experienced a relapse while receiving C+R (24%) was significantly higher than that of patients receiving C+E+R (6%; p = 0.027) and marginally higher than that of patients receiving C+E (7%; p = 0.057). Subjects in the C+E+R group had improved survival, compared with the C+E group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.23–0.83) and the C+R group (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.26–0.92).

### Mycobacterium avium complex: addressing gaps in diagnosis and management [^111sRbSE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

NTM includes many species that are ubiquitous in the environment. The principal causative species for NTM-PD are members of MAC. Several groups in multiple countries have documented the increasing incidence of MAC-PD. Not all patients with risk factors and who meet the criteria for MAC-PD require treatment initially, but most will at some point during the course of their disease. Those with bronchiectasis require pulmonary hygiene and treatment of other comorbidities while the decision whether to treat the MAC infection is being made. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin) and amikacin is recommended for MAC disease. A 3-drug macrolide-containing regimen is recommended as the initial regimen, which is administered for 12 months beyond culture conversion to negative. A thrice-weekly regimen is recommended for patients with noncavitary disease, and a daily regimen for those with cavitary disease or in those undergoing retreatment. Intravenous amikacin is recommended for patients with macrolide-resistant or cavitary disease. Patients with refractory disease should be considered for ALIS if their sputum cultures have not converted to negative by 6 months. Patient education, active monitoring, and management strategies are important for improving patient adherence and tolerance to ALIS treatment. Surgery might be helpful in selected patients. Ongoing research for additional treatment options is critical, as outcomes in patients with macrolide-resistant MAC-PD are poor.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) treatment — use of rifabutin as a third agent in children with HIV: Some experts would add rifabutin as a third drug to clarithromycin plus ethambutol, particularly in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and in the presence of high mycobacterial counts, but drug interactions should be checked carefully and more intensive toxicity monitoring may be warranted (strong, very low). Other experts recommend against using this third agent in children because of rifabutin's increased cytochrome P450 activity, which leads to increased clearance of other drugs such as protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), with potential for increased toxicity; the absence of data in children precludes extrapolating adult rifabutin dosing recommendations to children with HIV undergoing treatment for disseminated MAC.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria:

Mycobacterial Infections (1.2)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. (1.3)

1.2 Mycobacterial Infections

Prophylaxis of Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) Disease

Azithromycin tablets, taken alone or in combination with rifabutin at its approved dose, are indicated for the prevention of disseminated MAC disease in persons with advanced HIV infection [see Dosage and Administration (2)]

Treatment of Disseminated MAC Disease

Azithromycin tablets, taken in combination with ethambutol, are indicated for the treatment of disseminated MAC infections in persons with advanced HIV infection [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)]

1.3 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Induction of disseminated Mycobacterium avium in simian AIDS is dependent upon simian immunodeficiency virus strain and defective granuloma formation [^116WikTr]. The American Journal of Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most common disseminated bacterial disease in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus. Although murine models of disseminated MAC exist, they are primarily based on underlying genetic susceptibilities and cannot adequately address the complex interactions that occur between host, mycobacteria, and immunosuppressive lentivirus. To address this problem we have developed an experimental system to co-inoculate rhesus macaques with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and a clinical M. avium isolate that results in a disease virtually identical to that observed in human cases. Using this experimental system we have found that the development of disseminated MAC is dependent on viral strain. Animals co-infected with SIVmac251 and M. avium developed progressive disease, whereas control animals and animals inoculated with closely related viruses (SIVmac239 and SIVmac239MER) developed self-limiting infections. The ability of animals infected with SIVmac239 or SIVmac239MER to eliminate mycobacterial disease was independent of viral load and CD4 T-cell number but was correlated with the size and composition of microgranulomas. This work establishes a novel primate model of disseminated MAC in the context of immunosuppressive lentiviral infection and advances our understanding of why human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients are remarkably sensitive to the development of mycobacterial disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116YW3xW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pulmonary or localized organ MAC disease in people with HIV with higher CD4 counts and full ART suppression: Following the ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guidelines would be reasonable in such settings, with an initial three-drug regimen containing a macrolide and ethambutol for macrolide-susceptible pulmonary MAC disease and addition of an aminoglycoside, which in refractory cases can be given as inhalation suspension, if cavitary or severe bronchiectatic disease is present or if macrolide resistance is suspected. Injectable aminoglycosides should generally be avoided except in refractory disease when other alternative agents are not available or tolerated, and additional drugs with in vitro activity against clinical isolates of MAC include bedaquiline, tedizolid, linezolid, and omadacycline; these might also be considered in people with refractory MAC disease.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111yTao5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease — salvage and drug-selection guidance in people with HIV emphasizes susceptibility-guided, multidrug therapy with at least two new active agents and avoidance of ineffective or harmful drugs. Results of susceptibility testing should be used to construct a new multidrug regimen, and the regimen should consist of at least two new drugs to which the isolate is susceptible; options include rifabutin, fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), an injectable aminoglycoside (amikacin or streptomycin), or possibly bedaquiline, tedizolid, linezolid, or omadacycline. Continuing clarithromycin or azithromycin despite resistance is not recommended (BIII), clofazimine should generally not be used (AI), and optimization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an important adjunct to second-line or salvage therapy for those with unsuccessful initial treatment or drug-resistant disease (AIII). Although anecdotal reports suggest potential benefit, adjunctive immunomodulators have not been thoroughly studied and data are insufficient to support a recommendation for routine use except in familial immunodeficiencies associated with increased risk of MAC disease.

CLINICAL STUDIES

Two randomized, double-blind clinical trials (Study 023 and Study 027) compared MYCOBUTIN (300 mg/day) to placebo in patients with CDC-defined AIDS and CD4 counts ≤ 200 cells/µL. These studies accrued patients from 2/90 through 2/92. Study 023 enrolled 590 patients, with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 42 cells/µL (mean 61). Study 027 enrolled 556 patients with a median CD4 cell count at study entry of 40 cells/µL (mean 58).

Endpoints included the following:

MAC bacteremia, defined as at least one blood culture positive for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria.
Clinically significant disseminated MAC disease, defined as MAC bacteremia accompanied by signs or symptoms of serious MAC infection, including one or more of the following: fever, night sweats, rigors, weight loss, worsening anemia, and/or elevations in alkaline phosphatase.
Survival.

MAC Bacteremia

Participants who received MYCOBUTIN were one-third to one-half as likely to develop MAC bacteremia as were participants who received placebo. These results were statistically significant (Study 023: p < 0.001; Study 027: p = 0.002).

In Study 023, the one-year cumulative incidence of MAC bacteremia, on an intent to treat basis, was 9% for patients randomized to MYCOBUTIN and 22% for patients randomized to placebo. In Study 027, these rates were 13% and 28% for patients receiving MYCOBUTIN and placebo, respectively.

Most cases of MAC bacteremia (approximately 90% in these studies) occurred among participants whose CD4 count at study entry was ≤ 100 cells/µL. The median and mean CD4 counts at onset of MAC bacteremia were 13 cells/µL and 24 cells/µL, respectively. These studies did not investigate the optimal time to begin MAC prophylaxis.

Clinically Significant Disseminated MAC Disease

In association with the decreased incidence of bacteremia, patients on MYCOBUTIN showed reductions in the signs and symptoms of disseminated MAC disease, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, anemia, and hepatic dysfunction.

Survival

The one-year survival rates in Study 023 were 77% for the group receiving MYCOBUTIN and 77% for the placebo group. In Study 027, the one-year survival rates were 77% for the group receiving MYCOBUTIN and 70% for the placebo group.

These differences were not statistically significant.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) diagnosis in children with HIV uses the same procedures as in adults, and MAC is definitively diagnosed by isolation of the organism from blood or from biopsy specimens from normally sterile sites. Blood cultures are a sensitive and minimally invasive technique, as > 90% of individuals in whom MAC is diagnosed have positive blood cultures, and multiple mycobacterial blood cultures over time may be required to yield a positive result. Yield is influenced by blood volume, radiometric broth medium or lysis-centrifugation can enhance recovery, nucleic acid probes for MAC are commercially available, and high-performance liquid chromatography may only be available at high volume laboratories. Histology showing macrophage-containing acid-fast bacilli is strongly indicative but culture is essential; testing for susceptibility to clarithromycin or azithromycin is most useful, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction testing platforms are currently only available in research laboratories.

### Azithromycin dihydrate [^116bK4Un]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Disseminated MAC Disease

One randomized, double - blind clinical trial (Study 189) was performed in patients with disseminated MAC. In this trial, 246 HIV - infected patients with disseminated MAC received either azithromycin 250 mg daily (N = 65), azithromycin 600 mg daily (N = 91), or clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day (N = 90), each administered with ethambutol 15 mg/kg daily, for 24 weeks. Blood cultures and clinical assessments were performed every 3 weeks through week 12 and monthly thereafter through week 24. After week 24, patients were switched to any open - label therapy at the discretion of the investigator and followed every 3 months through the last follow - up visit of the trial. Patients were followed from the baseline visit for a period of up to 3.7 years (median: 9 months). MAC isolates recovered during treatment or post-treatment were obtained whenever possible.

The primary endpoint was sterilization by week 24. Sterilization was based on data from the central laboratory, and was defined as two consecutive observed negative blood cultures for MAC, independent of missing culture data between the two negative observations. Analyses were performed on all randomized patients who had a positive baseline culture for MAC.

The azithromycin 250 mg arm was discontinued after an interim analysis at 12 weeks showed a significantly lower clearance of bacteremia compared to clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day. Efficacy results for the azithromycin 600 mg daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day treatment regimens are described in the following table:

The primary endpoint, rate of sterilization of blood cultures (two consecutive negative cultures) at 24 weeks, was lower in the azithromycin 600 mg daily group than in the clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day group.

Sterilization by Baseline Colony Count

Within both treatment groups, the sterilization rates at week 24 decreased as the range of MAC cfu/mL increased.

### Mycobacterium avium complex: addressing gaps in diagnosis and management [^116hbTMe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW/STATEMENT OF NEED

Respiratory infections with mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), one of the most common pathogens of nontuberculous mycobacterium pulmonary disease (NTM-PD), have been steadily increasing. Five-year survival of patients with MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) also remains poor. In addition, diagnoses are often delayed due to the nonspecific presentation of MAC-PD and radiological findings that overlap with other pulmonary diseases. Further precluding optimal MAC-PD treatment, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of NTM is more than 12 years old and does not include the recent approval of liposomal amikacin for inhalation (LAI). LAI has demonstrated significant benefit in patients with MAC-PD refractory to conventional care.

The program, Mycobacterium Avium Complex: Addressing Gaps in Diagnosis and Management, will provide infectious disease and pulmonology clinicians with the most current evidence-based recommendations to support timely diagnoses and treatments of patients with MAC-PD.

### Role of ethambutol and rifampicin in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex pulmonary disease [^116QYmbo]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease is increasing globally, with the most common pathogen being Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) species. MAC is a ubiquitous organism commonly found in water, dirt, and soil but can cause serious pulmonary diseases in some people. M. avium and M. intracellulare are the most well-known pathogens, but other MAC such as M. arosiense, M. bouchedurhonense, M. chimaera, M. colombiense, M. marseillense, M. timonense, M. vulneris, and M. yongonense can also cause pulmonary diseases.

Treatment for MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) requires consideration of clinical and/or radiographical deterioration and usually comprises a multidrug regimen including macrolide, ethambutol, and rifampicin, with varying success. A recent systematic review reported that the three-drug regimen (macrolide, ethambutol, and rifampicin) with occasional use of an injectable agent could cure MAC-PD in 57% of patients.

The recommendation of such a combination is based on previous studies about disseminated MAC disease in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The efficacy of macrolide among MAC-PD patients is well established, but macrolide monotherapy can induce microbiological resistance. Therefore, companion drugs such as ethambutol or rifampicin are used. Nevertheless, the individual effectiveness of these two drugs in patients without AIDS is not proven with clinical studies. Considering the long-term use of medication and possible adverse events, recognizing the most efficacious accompanying drug is necessary.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the roles of ethambutol and rifampicin in the treatment of MAC-PD in adult patients.

### Discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis against disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection and toxoplasmic encephalitis [^11357nJU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

We retrospectively studied outcomes for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus who received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and had stopped receiving secondary prophylaxis against toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) or disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. Nineteen patients had a history of TE, and 26 had a history of disseminated MAC infection. The median duration of secondary prophylaxis was 27 months, and the median duration of HAART before discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis was 22 months. Median CD4(+) cell counts at the time of cessation of secondary prophylaxis against TE or disseminated MAC infection were 404 and 105 cells/mm(3), respectively. Plasma virus load was undetectable in 68% of the patients who had a history of TE and in 31% of patients who had a history of disseminated MAC infection. Patients were followed up for a median of 29 months after discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis; no relapses occurred in patients with a history of TE, and 3 relapses occurred in patients with a history of disseminated MAC infection (incidence, 4 relapses per 100 person-years).

Chronic therapy with 1,200 mg weekly regimen

The nature of adverse reactions seen with the 1200 mg weekly dosing regimen for the prevention of Mycobacterium avium infection in severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients were similar to those seen with short-term dosing regimens [see Clinical Studies (14)]

Chronic therapy with 600 mg daily regimen combined with ethambutol

The nature of adverse reactions seen with the 600 mg daily dosing regimen for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex infection in severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients were similar to those seen with short term dosing regimens. Five percent of patients experienced reversible hearing impairment in the pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of disseminated MAC in patients with AIDS. Hearing impairment has been reported with macrolide antibiotics, especially at higher doses. Other treatment-related adverse reactions occurring in > 5% of subjects and seen at any time during a median of 87.5 days of therapy include: abdominal pain (14%), nausea (14%), vomiting (13%), diarrhea (12%), flatulence (5%), headache (5%), and abnormal vision (5%). Discontinuations from treatment due to laboratory abnormalities or adverse reactions considered related to study drug occurred in 8 of 88 (9.1%) of subjects.

### Recommendations on prophylaxis and therapy for disseminated… [^111PYAaq]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

If disseminated MAC develops, a treatment regimen containing clarithromycin or azithromycin and at least one other agent is recommended. Diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis for HIV-infected children follow similar guidelines. INTRODUCTION Mycobacterium avium complex causes disseminated disease in up to 40% of patients with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States, producing fever, sweats, weight loss, and anemia. In these studies, rifabutin was shown to reduce the frequency of MAC bacteremia by approximately 50%. On December 23, 1992, the Food and Drug Administration issued the first approval for a prophylactic drug targeted against MAC. Prophylactic Regimens Rifabutin, 300 mg by mouth daily, is recommended for the patient's lifetime unless disseminated MAC develops, which would then require multiple drug therapy.

Although other drugs, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, have laboratory and clinical activity against MAC, none has been shown in a prospective, controlled trial to be effective and safe for prophylaxis. Blood cultures should be performed in patients with symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities compatible with mycobacterium infection. Blood cultures are not routinely recommended for asymptomatic persons, even for those who have CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/uL. Therapy of Disseminated MAC Although studies have not yet identified an optimal regimen or confirmed that any therapeutic regimen produces sustained clinical benefit for patients with disseminated MAC, the Task Force concluded that the available information indicated the need for treatment of disseminated MAC. Microbiologic response, as assessed by blood culture every 4 weeks during initial therapy, can also be helpful in interpreting the efficacy of a therapeutic regimen.

Most patients who ultimately respond show substantial clinical improvement in the first 4–6 weeks of therapy. Elimination of the organisms from blood cultures may take somewhat longer, often requiring 4–12 weeks. VIII International Conference on AIDS: Amsterdam, The Netherlands, July 19–24, 1992: PoB 3087.

### Recommendations on prophylaxis and therapy for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex for adults and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency virus… [^114z7B7t]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

If disseminated MAC develops, a treatment regimen containing clarithromycin or azithromycin and at least one other agent is recommended. Diagnosis, therapy, and prophylaxis for HIV-infected children follow similar guidelines. INTRODUCTION Mycobacterium avium complex causes disseminated disease in up to 40% of patients with human immunodeficiency virus in the United States, producing fever, sweats, weight loss, and anemia. Disseminated MAC characteristically affects patients with advanced HIV disease and peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/uL. Effective prevention and therapy of MAC has the potential to contribute substantially to improved quality of life and duration of survival for HIV-infected persons. Two randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies were recently conducted to study the use of rifabutin for the prevention of disseminated MAC, as defined by positive blood culture.

In these studies, rifabutin was shown to reduce the frequency of MAC bacteremia by approximately 50%. On December 23, 1992, the Food and Drug Administration issued the first approval for a prophylactic drug targeted against MAC.

### Treatment of refractory disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus infection with interferon gamma therapy… [^113j3iQX]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

A 60-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with disseminated Mycobacterium abscessus infection. Her disease had been refractory to conventional antibiotic therapy and she continued to develop painful suppurating abscesses on her trunk and extremities. Her infection followed treatment for essential thrombocytosis, which was diagnosed in September 1993. On initial presentation to our service, the patient had numerous large, fluctuant dusky-red to violaceous, tender nodules distributed over her trunk and extremities. Some lesions had a purulent, yellowish exudate. Deep incisional biopsy of one of the nodules was performed, which again showed suppurative and granulomatous inflammation with evidence of acid-fast organisms on Fite stain. Multiple Mycobacterium abscessus cutaneous abscesses on the abdomen unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. Therapeutic challenge Treatment of disseminated M abscessus infection refractory to antibiotic therapy. Solution.

After her first month of treatment, she reported feeling better than she had ever felt during the past 1-year period. She was able to return to her household chores, which she had not been able to perform for approximately 1 year. Moreover, she experienced a dramatic improvement in her cutaneous lesions, with a significant reduction in pain and discharge. After her initial rapid response, improvement was slowly sustained with continued evidence of resolution of her cutaneous abscesses. However, auditory monitoring showed evidence of aminoglycoside-related otic toxicity and her antibiotic regimen was adjusted to include only imipenem and clarithromycin. Resolution of cutaneous abscesses 7 months following the addition of systemic interferon gamma therapy. Comment. Conventional treatment of disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection involves the use of combination antibiotics selected by in vitro susceptibility testing.

Despite the selection of agents with potent in vitro activity, patients often show minimal improvement, despite prolonged treatment courses. The reason for the lack of responsiveness is unclear but likely involves the intracellular component of infection providing a barrier to antibiotic penetration. Moreover, the importance of host factors, such as immunomodulatory mechanisms, cannot be overlooked as an important contribution to the resolution of infection. This is supported in our patient by her continued improvement, despite the need to discontinue aminoglycoside treatment. Her remaining antibiotic regimen consisted only of clarithromycin, which had previously been ineffective alone, and imipenem, which was of only intermediate activity in the in vitro susceptibility testing.
