## Question

Work up for miscarriages?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the workup for miscarriages, specifically how to distinguish sporadic from recurrent pregnancy loss and what evidence-based evaluation to pursue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining when a workup is indicated versus when reassurance is appropriate. Then, I should verify the core components of the evaluation and which tests are truly evidence-based. Next, I will examine controversies and low-yield tests to avoid. After that, I should consider special populations and timing nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and close with counseling points and prognosis, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the threshold for evaluation, because I need to ensure we do not overtest after a single loss. Sporadic miscarriage is common and most often due to chromosomal abnormalities, so routine workup is not recommended after one early pregnancy loss; instead, we provide reassurance and address modifiable risks, reserving evaluation for recurrent pregnancy loss, which most contemporary guidelines define as two or more clinically recognized losses before 20–24 weeks, with some societies historically using three losses for epidemiology but accepting two for clinical evaluation, and I should double-check that this aligns with ASRM, ESHRE, and RCOG positions, which it does [^cf49feec] [^4bf232a4] [^b5b521b0] [^a7d0d6c8].

> Wait, let me verify the core components that consistently appear across high-credibility guidelines, because I should not overextend beyond what is evidence-based. The universal elements include: antiphospholipid syndrome screening with lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, and anti–β2-glycoprotein I; assessment of uterine anatomy, preferably with 3D transvaginal ultrasound; thyroid function testing with TSH and anti–TPO antibodies; and parental peripheral karyotyping, with the caveat that some guidelines frame karyotyping after two losses while others emphasize it more strongly after three, though the yield is about 2–5% for balanced rearrangements and can change reproductive counseling and options, so I should present this nuance transparently [^a4806810] [^a86b5b18] [^89c5ca49] [^87662bbf] [^8b9d4378] [^84d0617a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thrombophilia beyond APS. I initially thought inherited thrombophilia testing might be broadly indicated, but I should correct that. Routine screening for inherited thrombophilias such as factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A, protein C, protein S, and antithrombin is not recommended in RPL absent additional risk factors, and major guidelines advise against it outside research or specific contexts, so I need to ensure I do not order these tests reflexively [^bb7394ec] [^8df2e758] [^04fff0cb] [^5257b275].

> I need to check the role of products-of-conception testing because this can change the trajectory of the workup. Chromosomal analysis of miscarriage tissue, ideally with microarray, can explain a large fraction of losses and, when aneuploidy is found, may obviate further parental testing; guidelines increasingly recommend POC testing on the third and subsequent losses and on any second-trimester loss, and modeling suggests that integrating POC microarray with standard workup can explain more than 90% of cases, which is a meaningful diagnostic yield to discuss with patients [^0d5b492b] [^9c6224f6] [^5a908280].

> Let me consider endocrine and metabolic testing beyond thyroid, and I should confirm what to avoid. Prolactin is reasonable only if there are clinical features of hyperprolactinemia, and routine ovarian reserve, luteal phase defect, PCOS panels, androgens, LH, fasting insulin/glucose, or homocysteine are not recommended in the routine RPL workup; likewise, MTHFR polymorphism testing should not be ordered, and vitamin D, while commonly deficient, lacks guideline support for routine testing in RPL, so I should counsel on lifestyle modification without ordering these labs reflexively [^2ed22827] [^2e04bbd9] [^d8bb3399] [^04fff0cb].

> Next, I should review immunologic testing, and I need to be careful not to overpromise. Routine immunologic screening such as ANA, HLA typing, NK cell assays, or cytokines is not recommended outside research settings; exceptions include considering HLA class II in Scandinavian patients with secondary RPL after a male birth for prognostic purposes, and even ANA is framed as optional for explanatory purposes rather than as a standard test, so I should avoid these unless there is a specific indication or research context [^10bec10f] [^0b11477d] [^2e07a576].

> I will now examine infectious etiologies, and I should confirm that we do not overtest here. There is no evidence that routine infection screening for organisms like Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Listeria, CMV, or HSV reduces RPL recurrence, so testing is not recommended unless there is a clinical suspicion or exposure history, and antibiotics should not be used empirically for RPL [^b18cd813].

> But wait, what if the losses are second trimester or there is suspected cervical insufficiency. I should double-check cervical assessment guidance. In patients with one or more second-trimester losses or suspected cervical weakness, serial transvaginal cervical length surveillance is reasonable, and history-indicated or ultrasound-indicated cerclage may be considered based on history and cervical length, aligning with ACOG and SOGC recommendations, so I need to tailor this to obstetric history and ultrasound findings rather than apply it broadly [^bc943d09] [^cb94b266] [^6f6b70d1].

> Let me think about male partner evaluation, and I should verify the strength of evidence. ASRM/AUA recommend considering karyotyping and sperm DNA fragmentation testing in couples with RPL, acknowledging that evidence for improving outcomes is limited; RCOG notes insufficient evidence for routine treatment of male factors, so I should frame this as optional and discuss the uncertain benefit while recognizing that some couples prioritize a comprehensive evaluation [^d302b9c4] [^10c91873] [^62569cf3].

> I should confirm imaging nuances for uterine anomalies, because misclassification can misdirect management. 3D transvaginal ultrasound is preferred for detecting congenital uterine anomalies, with 2D ultrasound as an alternative when 3D is unavailable, and MRI can be reserved when ultrasound is nondiagnostic or complex abnormalities require delineation; I need to ensure I do not overcall subtle findings without corroboration [^a86b5b18] [^89c5ca49] [^0bb86be9].

> Next, I should review special populations and timing, and I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. In patients with second-trimester losses, inherited thrombophilia testing may be considered selectively, ideally in research or when there is additional thrombotic risk, whereas in patients with early recurrent losses it remains discouraged; in patients over 35 or with rapidly successive losses, I should maintain a lower threshold for evaluation after two losses given age-related aneuploidy and potential cumulative risk, while still adhering to guideline frameworks [^cc82fc84] [^a7d0d6c8].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical algorithm so it is actionable. After two clinically recognized losses, obtain APS serologies, uterine anatomy assessment with 3D TVUS when available, TSH with anti–TPO antibodies, and consider parental karyotyping, with POC testing on the third loss or any second-trimester loss; if POC reveals aneuploidy, further parental testing is often unnecessary, whereas euploidy prompts completion of the standard workup, and if a balanced rearrangement is found, discuss reproductive options including PGT or donor gametes with realistic success rates [^a4806810] [^a86b5b18] [^87662bbf] [^0d5b492b] [^84d0617a].

> I need to ensure counseling is balanced and evidence-based. Even after a thorough evaluation, up to half of couples will have unexplained RPL, yet the prognosis for live birth remains favorable, often exceeding 50–60% depending on maternal age and parity, so I should emphasize hope while also addressing mental health needs and offering supportive care, ideally within dedicated RPL services, to mitigate anxiety and depression that are common in this population [^493015ab] [^a7d0d6c8] [^fe64d072] [^4c37106c].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have not omitted modifiable lifestyle and obstetric risk counseling, because this meaningfully affects outcomes and patient agency. Advise smoking cessation, alcohol avoidance, weight optimization, and folic acid supplementation, and in women with early pregnancy bleeding and a history of prior miscarriage, consider vaginal micronized progesterone to improve live birth probability, while reserving anticoagulation for confirmed APS rather than using it empirically in unexplained RPL [^3949f72b] [^03d56a0e] [^b257c881].

The workup for miscarriage should be **individualized** based on whether the loss is sporadic or recurrent, and on maternal age and clinical context. For a **first miscarriage**, offer supportive care and counseling; routine testing is not indicated unless there are specific risk factors or maternal age ≥ 35 years. For **recurrent pregnancy loss (≥ 2 losses)** [^4bf232a4], perform a structured evaluation: parental karyotyping [^8b9d4378]; antiphospholipid antibody testing (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-β2-glycoprotein I) [^a4806810]; uterine cavity assessment (3D transvaginal ultrasound [^a86b5b18] or saline infusion sonohysterography) [^99fbcf1d]; thyroid function (TSH, free T4, anti-TPO) [^87662bbf]; and consider products-of-conception genetic testing [^0d5b492b]. Avoid routine testing for inherited thrombophilia [^8df2e758], MTHFR, NK cells, or endocrine panels (e.g. prolactin, androgens) unless clinically indicated [^2e04bbd9] [^2ed22827]. Provide psychological support and preconception counseling for all patients [^fe64d072] [^821c9d4e].

---

## Definitions and classification

Miscarriage is the **spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks' gestation** [^b5b521b0]. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined as **two or more clinically recognized pregnancy losses** [^4bf232a4]; some guidelines still use three losses for epidemiologic purposes, but two is acceptable for clinical evaluation [^4bf232a4].

---

## Initial evaluation

### Clinical history

A detailed clinical history is essential and should include:

- **Obstetric history**: Number of losses, gestational age, circumstances, prior live births, pregnancy complications.
- **Medical history**: Chronic illnesses, autoimmune disorders, endocrine disorders, thrombophilia, surgical history.
- **Family history**: Miscarriages, congenital anomalies, genetic disorders, thrombophilia.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, alcohol, caffeine, occupational exposures, stress.

---

### Physical examination

Perform a **general physical exam** to assess BMI, signs of endocrine or autoimmune disease, and a pelvic exam to evaluate uterine size, shape, and adnexal masses [^notfound].

---

## Recommended investigations

### First miscarriage (sporadic)

Routine investigations are **generally not recommended** after a single first-trimester miscarriage, as most are due to chromosomal abnormalities [^cf49feec]. Provide **supportive care, counseling, and reassurance** regarding the high likelihood of future success [^821c9d4e].

---

### Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL)

After two or more losses, a **structured evaluation is recommended**:

| **Category** | **Recommended investigations** |
|-|-|
| Genetic | - Parental karyotyping (both partners) [^8b9d4378] <br/> - Products of conception (POC) genetic testing (microarray or karyotype) if available [^0d5b492b] [^5a908280] |
| Anatomical | - 3D transvaginal ultrasound [^a86b5b18] <br/> - Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) [^99fbcf1d] <br/> - Hysteroscopy if indicated [^99fbcf1d] |
| Immunological | - Antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG/IgM, anti-β2-glycoprotein I) [^a4806810] [^dba814ce] |
| Endocrine | - Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4, anti-TPO antibodies) [^87662bbf] [^16d558fd] <br/> - Consider prolactin if symptoms of hyperprolactinemia [^2ed22827] |
| Infectious | - Not routinely recommended unless clinically indicated [^b18cd813] |
| Thrombophilia | - Not routinely recommended unless indicated (e.g. personal/family VTE, second-trimester losses) [^8df2e758] [^bb7394ec] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years)**: Consider earlier evaluation after two losses due to increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities [^notfound].
- **Second-trimester losses**: Emphasize anatomical assessment and consider cervical insufficiency evaluation [^6f6b70d1].
- **Unexplained RPL**: Provide psychological support and consider empirical treatments (e.g. progesterone) in select cases [^fe64d072] [^d7a38f46].

---

## Psychological support and counseling

Miscarriage and RPL are associated with **significant psychological distress** [^4c37106c]. Provide **counseling, support groups, and mental health referrals** as needed [^821c9d4e].

---

## Preconception counseling and management

Preconception counseling should address **modifiable risk factors** (smoking, alcohol, weight, caffeine), review **chronic conditions**, and discuss **genetic counseling** if indicated. Management should be **individualized** based on identified causes, including surgical correction of uterine anomalies, anticoagulation for APS, and endocrine management [^a7d0d6c8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First miscarriage**: Supportive care, no routine testing [^cf49feec].
- **RPL (≥ 2 losses)**: Structured evaluation (genetic, anatomical, immunological, endocrine) [^890f52f1].
- **Avoid routine testing**: Inherited thrombophilia, MTHFR, NK cells, infections unless indicated [^8df2e758] [^d8bb3399] [^2f2b03ee] [^b18cd813].
- **Provide psychological support**: Counseling and support groups [^fe64d072] [^821c9d4e].
- **Individualize management**: Based on identified causes and patient preferences [^03d56a0e].

---

The workup for miscarriage should be **guided by the number of losses, maternal age, and clinical context**, focusing on evidence-based tests and avoiding unnecessary investigations. Supportive care and counseling are essential for all patients, with individualized management for those with identified causes.

### Recurrent miscarriage clinics [^b593530b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

A recurrent miscarriage clinic offers specialist investigation and treatment of women with recurrent first- and second-trimester miscarriages. Consultant-led clinics provide a dedicated and focused service to couples who have experienced at least two prior miscarriages. The best treatment strategy for couples with recurrent miscarriage is to discuss a treatment plan for a future pregnancy. Evidence-based up-to-date guidelines are required to reduce ineffective management of recurrent miscarriage couples, including overdiagnostics and underdiagnostics. Scientific research is necessary to study the effectiveness of new interventions, to study patient preferences, and to evaluate health care and costs or other outcomes.

### Review of current guidelines for recurrent pregnancy loss: new strategies for optimal evaluation of women who may be superfertile [^9c6224f6]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The current evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology are compared and contrasted in this review. The clinical use of either of these guidelines will result in a probable diagnosis for only half of the affected patients. New strategies for a full evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss incorporating 24- chromosome microarary on the products of conception offer more explanations for patients and caregivers. This new algorithm should decrease the use of empiric, unproven treatments. Combining the results of genetic testing on the miscarriage tissue with the conventional diagnostic tests has made it possible to explain the etiology of pregnancy loss in more than 90% of the cases. This cost-saving strategy can decrease the emotional distress and frustration for both couples and physicians when it comes to management of recurrent pregnancy loss.

### Evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss [^a7d0d6c8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects approximately 5% of couples. Although RPL definitions vary across professional societies, an evaluation after a second clinically recognized first-trimester pregnancy loss is recommended. Good quality evidence links parental chromosomal rearrangements, uterine anomalies, and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) to RPL. In contrast, the relationship between RPL and other endocrine, hematologic, and immunologic disorders or environmental exposures is less clear. Anticoagulant therapy and low-dose aspirin are recommended for patients with RPL who have also been diagnosed with APS. Vaginal progesterone supplementation may be considered in patients experiencing vaginal bleeding during the first trimester. Surgical correction may be considered for patients with RPL in whom a uterine anomaly is identified. Evaluation and management of additional comorbidities should be guided by the patient's history rather than solely based on the diagnosis of RPL, with the goal of improving overall health to reduce complications in the event of pregnancy. Most people with RPL, including those without identifiable risk factors, are expected to achieve a live birth within 5 years from the initial evaluation. Nevertheless, clinicians should be sensitive to the psychological needs of individuals with this condition and provide compassionate and supportive care across all stages.

### Recurrent pregnancy loss: evaluation and treatment [^67cbde81]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial condition. Approximately half of patients with RPL will have no explanation for their miscarriages. De novo chromosome abnormalities are common in sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. Testing for embryonic abnormalities can provide an explanation for the miscarriage in many cases and prognostic information. Regardless of the cause of RPL, patients should be reassured that the prognosis for live birth with an evidence-based approach is excellent for most patients. The authors review current evidence for the evaluation and treatment of RPL and explore the proposed use of newer technology for patients with RPL.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^4bf232a4]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) — definition, prevalence, and evaluation thresholds — recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a distinct disorder defined by two or more failed clinical pregnancies, while clinically recognized pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 15–25% of pregnancies. It is estimated that fewer than 5% of women will experience two consecutive miscarriages and only 1% experience three or more. For determining whether evaluation for RPL is appropriate, pregnancy is defined as a clinical pregnancy documented by ultrasonography or histopathological examination, and ideally a threshold of three or more losses should be used for epidemiological studies while clinical evaluation may proceed following two first-trimester pregnancy losses. Self-reported losses by patients may not be accurate, and in one study only 71% of self-reported clinical pregnancy losses could be verified in hospital records.

### Recurrent pregnancy loss [^b5b521b0]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss is a distressing pregnancy disorder experienced by ~2.5% of women trying to conceive. Recurrent pregnancy loss is defined as the failure of two or more clinically recognized pregnancies before 20–24 weeks of gestation and includes embryonic and fetal losses. The diagnosis of an early pregnancy loss is relatively straightforward, although progress in predicting and preventing recurrent pregnancy loss has been hampered by a lack of standardized definitions, the uncertainties surrounding the pathogenesis and the highly variable clinical presentation. The prognosis for couples with recurrent pregnancy loss is generally good, although the likelihood of a successful pregnancy depends on maternal age and the number of previous losses. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be caused by chromosomal errors, anatomical uterine defects, autoimmune disorders and endometrial dysfunction. Available treatments target the putative risk factors of pregnancy loss, although the effectiveness of many medical interventions is controversial. Regardless of the underlying aetiology, couples require accurate information on their chances of having a baby and appropriate support should be offered to reduce the psychological burden associated with multiple miscarriages. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of recurrent pregnancy loss and evaluate novel diagnostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.

### Recurrent miscarriage: evidence to accelerate action [^03d56a0e]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Women who have had repeated miscarriages often have uncertainties about the cause, the likelihood of recurrence, the investigations they need, and the treatments that might help. Health-care policy makers and providers have uncertainties about the optimal ways to organise and provide care. For this Series paper, we have developed recommendations for practice from literature reviews, appraisal of guidelines, and a UK-wide consensus conference that was held in December, 2019. Caregivers should individualise care according to the clinical needs and preferences of women and their partners. We define a minimum set of investigations and treatments to be offered to couples who have had recurrent miscarriages, and urge health-care policy makers and providers to make them universally available. The essential investigations include measurements of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, thyroid function, and a transvaginal pelvic ultrasound scan. The key treatments to consider are first trimester progesterone administration, levothyroxine in women with subclinical hypothyroidism, and the combination of aspirin and heparin in women with antiphospholipid antibodies. Appropriate screening and care for mental health issues and future obstetric risks, particularly preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth, will need to be incorporated into the care pathway for couples with a history of recurrent miscarriage. We suggest health-care services structure care using a graded model in which women are offered online health-care advice and support, care in a nurse or midwifery-led clinic, and care in a medical consultant-led clinic, according to clinical needs.

### Genetic evaluation and counseling of couples with recurrent miscarriage: recommendations of the National Society of Genetic Counselors [^8280eebc]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this document is to provide recommendations for genetic evaluation and counseling of couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM). The recommendations are the opinions of the multidisciplinary Inherited Pregnancy Loss Working Group (IPLWG), with expertise in genetic counseling, medical genetics, maternal fetal medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, cytogenetics, and coagulation disorders. The IPLWG defines RM as three or more clinically recognized consecutive or non-consecutive pregnancy losses occurring prior to fetal viability (< 24 weeks gestation). These recommendations are provided to assist genetic counselors and other health care providers in clinical decision-making, as well as to promote consistency of patient care, guide the allocation of medical resources, and increase awareness of the psychosocial and cultural issues experienced by couples with RM. The IPLWG was convened with support from the March of Dimes Western Washington State Chapter and the University of Washington Division of Medical Genetics. The recommendations are U.S. Preventive Task Force Class III, and are based on clinical experiences, review of pertinent English-language published articles, and reports of expert committees. This document reviews the suspected causes of RM, provides indications for genetic evaluation and testing, addresses psychosocial and cultural considerations, and provides professional and patient resources. These recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of medical management, nor does the use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. The professional judgment of a health care provider, familiar with the circumstances of a specific case, should always supersede these recommendations.

### Evidence-based investigations and treatments of recurrent pregnancy loss [^a789d35e]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To give an overview of currently used investigations and treatments offered to women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and, from an evidence-based point of view, to evaluate the usefulness of these interventions.

Design

Ten experts on epidemiologic, genetic, anatomic, endocrinologic, thrombophilic, immunologic, and immunogenetic aspects of RPL discussed methodologic problems threatening the validity of research in RPL during and after an international workshop on the evidence-based management of RPL.

Conclusion(S)

Most RPL patients have several risk factors for miscarriage, and an extensive investigation for all major factors should always be undertaken. There is an urgent need for agreement concerning the thresholds for detecting what is normal and abnormal, irrespective of whether laboratory tests or uterine abnormalities are concerned. A series of lifestyle factors should be reported in future studies of RPL because they might modify the effect of laboratory or anatomic risk factors. More and larger randomized controlled trials, including trials of surgical procedures, are urgently needed, and to achieve this objective multiple centers have to collaborate. Current meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of treatments of RPL are generally pooling very heterogeneous patient populations and treatments. It is recommended that future meta-analyses look at subsets of patients and treatment protocols that are more combinable.

### Sporadic miscarriage: evidence to provide effective care [^3949f72b]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

The physical and psychological effect of miscarriage is commonly underappreciated. The journey from diagnosis of miscarriage, through clinical management, to supportive aftercare can be challenging for women, their partners, and caregivers. Diagnostic challenges can lead to delayed or ineffective care and increased anxiety. Inaccurate diagnosis of a miscarriage can result in the unintended termination of a wanted pregnancy. Uncertainty about the therapeutic effects of interventions can lead to suboptimal care, with variations across facilities and countries. For this Series paper, we have developed recommendations for practice from a literature review, appraisal of guidelines, and expert group discussions. The recommendations are grouped into three categories: (1) diagnosis of miscarriage, (2) prevention of miscarriage in women with early pregnancy bleeding, and (3) management of miscarriage. We recommend that every country reports annual aggregate miscarriage data, similarly to the reporting of stillbirth. Early pregnancy services need to focus on providing an effective ultrasound service, as it is central to the diagnosis of miscarriage, and be able to provide expectant management of miscarriage, medical management with mifepristone and misoprostol, and surgical management with manual vacuum aspiration. Women with the dual risk factors of early pregnancy bleeding and a history of previous miscarriage can be recommended vaginal micronised progesterone to improve the prospects of livebirth. We urge health-care funders and providers to invest in early pregnancy care, with specific focus on training for clinical nurse specialists and doctors to provide comprehensive miscarriage care within the setting of dedicated early pregnancy units.

Conclusion

While many clinicians perform investigations recommended by the ESHRE, we also identified considerable discrepancies. Clinicians tend to rely more on guidelines published by national societies. To limit practice variation and thereby delivering care up to maximum standards, it is necessary that efforts of both overarching societies such as the ESHRE and local societies are collaborating in implementation of up-to-date guidelines. Using implementation strategies to improve guideline adherence will ultimately lead to better care delivered to RPL patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Early pregnancy loss (EPL), defined as a nonviable, intrauterine pregnancy with either an empty gestational sac or a gestational sac containing an embryo or fetus without fetal heart activity within the first 12 6/7 weeks of gestation, occurs in ∼20% of all clinically recognized pregnancies. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is defined by ≥ 2 failed clinical pregnancies, and affects 2%–4% of couples. It is well established that chromosomal anomalies account for 50%–70% of EPL, but even in RPL, random aneuploidy is the single most common etiology, accounting for > 50% of cases. While commonly considered, parental balanced chromosomal rearrangement (such as translocations) leading to unbalanced rearrangements as a cause of pregnancy loss, are detected in only about 4% of RPLs. Cases of RPL with no chromosomal anomalies may be due to maternal conditions such as autoimmune or endocrine diseases congenital or acquired uterine cavity defects, etc. Understanding the etiology of RPL can potentially guide future management to achieve a successful pregnancy.

The RPL workup recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) includes parental karyotyping; screening for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti‐β2 glycoprotein; uterine cavity assessment; and screening for thyroid or prolactin abnormalities. However, given that most RPL are due to random aneuploidy, it is not surprising that in most cases no cause is detected. It has therefore been suggested that chromosomal analysis in products of conception (POCs) should be used to guide RPL workup. If this demonstrates a random aneuploidy, further testing is obviated, which may result in cost‐savings. It was recently reported that combining the ASRM work‐up with POC microarray would lead to identification of an explanation for the miscarriage in 91.8% of RPL cases. Regrettably, the availability of POC has recently declined due to medical management of miscarriage which has superseded surgical evacuation.

Unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss

As recommended by the ASRM, screening for recurrent pregnancy loss should include the evaluation of the chromosome karyotype, antiphospholipid antibody positivity, TSH, HbA1C, and prolactin levels, and anatomical factors. These tests can only explain the well-established or possible risk factors of RPL in 42.42% (333/785) of patients. Compared to the examination recommended by the ASRM, 87.52% (687/785) of patients have abnormal screening results of the risk factors included in this study (excluding abnormalities in MTHFR polymorphisms, vitamin D levels, and endometrial receptivity).

### Antiphospholipid antibodies: a major advance in the management of recurrent abortion [^02f78369]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss is a vexing problem facing many couples and doctors. Repetitive losses affect 2–5% of couples and specific causes are identified in only approximately 50% of patients. Many changes have occurred in this field over the past 20 years and the technology available for the workup of patients has improved. However, the diagnostic yield and pregnancy outcomes of patients with recurrent abortion have not improved significantly over the last two decades. In this regard, the identification of aPL as a new and treatable cause of recurrent abortion represents the major advance in the subject over the past 20 years.

### Diagnostic factors identified in 1020 women with two versus three or more recurrent pregnancy losses [^afdecb7c]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the frequency of abnormal results for evidence-based diagnostic tests differed among women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) based on the number of prior losses (n = 2, 3, or ≥ 4) and to determine whether abnormal results for additional investigative diagnostic tests differed in prevalence among women with different numbers of pregnancy losses.

Design

Single-center, retrospective study.

Setting

Patients with RPL at a private practice.

Patient(S)

One thousand twenty women who had two or more consecutive spontaneous pregnancy losses with the same partner.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Frequencies of abnormal results for evidence-based diagnostic tests considered definite or probable causes of RPL (karyotyping for parental chromosomal abnormalities; pelvic sonohysterography, hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy for uterine anomalies; immunological tests for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies; thrombophilic tests for the factor V Leiden mutation; and blood tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and fasting blood glucose). We also measured the frequency of abnormal results for nine additional investigative tests in the same patients (antiphosphatidyl serine antibodies, microbial infection, midluteal P, PRL, functional protein C activity, functional protein S activity, antithrombin activity, fasting homocysteine and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms, and factor II mutation).

Result(S)

The prevalence of abnormal results for evidence-based and investigative diagnostic tests did not differ among women with different numbers of pregnancy losses.

Conclusion(S)

Evaluation of all couples with two, three, or more consecutive miscarriages is recommended.

### Recurrent miscarriage [^4c37106c]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Many human conceptions are genetically abnormal and end in miscarriage, which is the commonest complication of pregnancy. Recurrent miscarriage, the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies, affects 1% of couples trying to conceive. It is associated with psychological morbidity, and has often proven to be frustrating for both patient and clinician. A third of women attending specialist clinics are clinically depressed, and one in five have levels of anxiety that are similar to those in psychiatric outpatient populations. Many conventional beliefs about the cause and treatment of women with recurrent miscarriage have not withstood scrutiny, but progress has been made. Research has emphasised the importance of recurrent miscarriage in the range of reproductive failure linking subfertility and late pregnancy complications and has allowed us to reject practice based on anecdotal evidence in favour of evidence-based management.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^84d0617a]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss — structural chromosomal abnormalities and reproductive options are characterized as follows: In the evaluation of RPL, parents should undergo peripheral karyotyping in order to detect any balanced structural chromosomal abnormalities, with balanced reciprocal translocations and Robertsonian translocations observed in about 2%–5% of couples with recurrent miscarriage. When a partner has a structural genetic abnormality, options include preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for specific translocations with transfer of unaffected embryos, or donor gametes. In systematic reviews, live birth rates were estimated to be between 31%–35% per cycle for IVF/PGD and cumulative live birth rates were 55%–74% for natural conception/medical management, and there are insufficient data demonstrating that IVF/PGD improves live birth rate in RPL with a structural genetic abnormality. Based on limited cytogenetic data, 36%–39% of pregnancies in couples with recurrent pregnancy loss associated with a structural genetic factor have an unbalanced structural rearrangement.

### Timing of diagnostic workups in Chinese population with recurrent pregnancy loss: a cross-sectional study [^a11ef747]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D may regulate the process of metamorphosis and the implantation of embryos at the maternal–fetal interface by appropriately promoting inflammatory responses, and many retrospective studies have shown that vitamin D supplementation can increase live birth rates. Vitamin D deficiency, however, is common among women of childbearing age in China. Li et al. found that up to 70% of pregnant women had vitamin D deficiency, with only 1.6% achieving normal vitamin D levels. Our study suggests that vitamin D concentrations are normal in only 3% of patients. Although there are still no guidelines or recommendations regarding vitamin D supplementation for all women of reproductive age, vitamin D supplementation is required for the vast majority of the population based on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

Fifty to 60% of URSA cases have been reported in the literature. In this study, 57.58% of patients were diagnosed with URSA based on the ASMR's recommended evaluation for RPL. While it has not yet been demonstrated that many of the tests included in this study are associated with RPL, the rate of URPL diagnosis was 12.48% in this study. Propescu et al. found that 24 chromosome microarray analysis of pregnancy loss tissue combined with ASRM assessment of pregnancy loss accounts for almost 95% of cases of recurrent pregnancy loss. Both our findings suggest that URPL patients may represent a much smaller proportion of the overall population with RPL than the incidence of more than 50% reported in prior studies.

Overall, this study comprehensively demonstrated and compared the rate of a variety of abnormal diagnostic workup results associated with RPL among individuals with two and three or more pregnancy losses in Northeast China. We found that the rate of abnormal results in the Chinese RPL population is high. Meanwhile, among all the diagnostic tests, only the rate of abnormal anatomical factors, endometrial polyps and obesity were significantly higher in people with three or more pregnancy losses than in people with two pregnancy losses. Due to the similarity in the majority of etiological screening results between the two groups, it may be more reasonable to start etiological screening after two pregnancy losses instead of waiting for the patient to experience a third pregnancy loss. Our results provide new evidence for the timing of screening, and further research is required to confirm the need for some controversial tests regarding the screening of RPL.

### Exercise and pregnancy loss… [^1ed3ef00]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is there an association between exercise and first- to mid–second-trimester pregnancy loss. Evidence-Based Answer Regular exercise for up to seven or more hours per week is not associated with increased rates of miscarriage in the first to mid-second trimesters. Patients may continue bending and lifting at work, because these activities are not associated with increased first-trimester miscarriage rates. Work that requires frequent crouching may be associated with increased miscarriage rates. Evidence Summary A large six-year prospective cohort study of 90, 270 women in Denmark compared exercise duration and miscarriage rates at four gestational ages. 3 It found no significant relationship with miscarriage in any group.

One prospective cohort study found no relationship between miscarriage rates and bending or lifting or total hours worked. The authors did not categorize the gestational age at miscarriage, or the other two cohort studies by type. A prospective cohort study of 5, 144 women in California found no relationship between bending, amount of lifting, or hours worked and miscarriage during the first trimester. 4 Investigators measured total time working, amount of standing and bending at work, hours spent doing housework or yard work, and amount of lifting objects more than 15 lb at work or at home. No physical activity measure was associated with an increased miscarriage rate.

A retrospective analysis of a cohort of 1, 427 Chinese women textile workers demonstrated that work with light and moderate physical activity was associated with a lower risk of miscarriage than sedentary work. 6 Women employed in jobs requiring frequent crouching had an increased risk of miscarriage, although investigators did not specify gestational age at time of miscarriage.

### Etiology and diagnostic approach of recurrent miscarriage at a reference center in bucaramanga, Colombia [^d3cdccf3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the etiologies of recurrent miscarriage in our hospital and whether its diagnostic approach followed the recommendations of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines published in 2012 and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2011.

Methods

This was a retrospective study. The medical records of 158 patients diagnosed with recurrent miscarriage between 2013 and 2018 at Santander University Hospital were reviewed. The Institutional Review Board of HUS approved the study in May 2020.

Results

The most common etiologies identified were protein S deficiency, thrombophilia, and cervical insufficiency, with incidence rates of 25.9%, 10.7%, and 3.8%, respectively. Moreover, the most frequently requested diagnostic tests were for protein S, protein C, and anti-phospholipid IgG. Abnormal results for protein S were obtained in 49% of the patients, whereas lupus anticoagulant was abnormal in 12.8%, and Factor V Leiden gene mutations in 8.5% of the patients. Three substantial deviations from the recommended diagnostic approach for recurrent miscarriage by international guidelines were identified in our population: the lack of request for cytogenetic analysis of pregnancy tissue, request for cytogenetic analysis for the parents in only 0.6% of the study sample, and the request for imaging tests to assess uterine anatomy in only 6.3% of the studied population. Both the ASRM and NICE guidelines were only partially followed with a combined adherence rate of 66.5%.

Conclusion

The diagnostic approach for recurrent miscarriage poses important clinical challenges when compared to the recommendations of international guidelines. Therefore, the development of a local recurrent miscarriage assessment protocol is proposed in our institution.

### Timing of diagnostic workups in Chinese population with recurrent pregnancy loss: a cross-sectional study [^7e945bf5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With a prevalence ranging from 1 to 2% worldwide, recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is devastating for women who desire to have children. For patients with RPL, while the risk of many obstetric complications is increased, the negative emotions and mental harm caused by pregnancy loss should not be underestimated. However, because of the differences in regional medical levels and populations, the definition of RPL varies among different institutions. The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) defines RPL as pregnancy loss that occurs two or more times before 24 weeks of pregnancy. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) defines RPL as the loss of pregnancy determined by ultrasound or histology after two or more pregnancies without the need for continuity. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) defines RPL as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies. In China, there are no specific guidelines regarding the definition, diagnostic workup and treatment of RPL at present. A currently released expert consensus recommends the diagnostic workup should take place after two pregnancy losses based on a meta-analysis in which most studies only included non-Chinese patients.

In addition to the heterogeneity of definitions affecting people's research on RPL, the diversity and complexity of its risk factors have also increased the difficulty for scholars to conduct investigations. Well-established risk factors include parental chromosomal abnormalities, anatomical abnormalities, endocrine disorders (thyroid dysfunction, glucose abnormality and obesity), and acquired thrombophilia. Possible risk factors include endocrine disorders (hyperprolactinemia, Polycystic ovary syndrome), inherited thrombophilia, psychological factors, and environmental and nutritional factors. These factors have been investigated by many investigators, but most research has focused on one or several abnormalities, which often fail to explain the comprehensive cause of a patient's pregnancy loss. Given the heterogeneity of definitions, the lack of evidence in China and the incompleteness of previous studies, a comprehensive etiological study is required to investigate the proportions and roles of a variety of confirmed or possible risk factors of RPL. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate the rates of abnormal diagnostic test resul t s in the Chinese RPL population, describing and comparing the rates in the populations with 2 and 3 or more pregnancy losses, thus demonstrating the prevalence of various abnormalities in patients with RPL and providing evidence for determining the timing of screening.

### Preconceptional evaluation of women with recurrent pregnancy loss: the additional value of assessing vascular and metabolic status [^3e058685]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a heterogeneous condition and a devastating complication of early pregnancy affecting approximately 1 in 50 couples who are trying to conceive. Although there is no consensus on its definition, the diagnosis of RPL is considered after two or more consecutive pregnancy losses from the time of conception until 24 weeks of gestation, according to most guidelines, such as that of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology. Although a few conditions have been causatively linked to the occurrence of RPL, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, uterine malformations and parental chromosomal aberrations, the exact pathophysiology is still elusive and a majority of RPL cases remains without an identifiable cause. In addition, several risk factors such as increasing maternal age, smoking, alcohol use, overweight and stress have been associated with the prevalence and prognosis of RPL. Next to these associated conditions and risk factors, the number of previous pregnancy losses is relevant to the definition of RPL and the prediction of live birth in subsequent pregnancies. However, the contribution of the number of previous pregnancy losses to understanding the pathophysiology of RPL remains unclear. It is clear that the current diagnostic workup is not sufficient enough and new factors involved in this adverse obstetric complication are very desirable.

Women with obstetric complications, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes have been shown to have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) later in life. Leading the American Heart Association to update its guidelines in 2011 to incorporate obstetric complications as risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease in women. Moreover, women with RPL have an increased risk of ischemic stroke mortality and a twofold higher risk of coronary heart disease later in life. Hypotheses have been proposed for the association between RPL and CVD. First, a joint underlying genetic, thrombogenic, metabolic or immune defect may contribute to both RPL and CVD. The genetic predisposition to RPL is suggested by the finding that a positive family history of CVD is associated with a 1.6 higher risk of RPL. Second, RPL itself could trigger or augment a cascade of inflammatory responses or other mechanisms causing endothelial dysfunction, that could lead to CVD if persistent.

### When is a pregnancy nonviable and what criteria should be used to define miscarriage? [^73e61ca9]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

In 2011, the first systematic review of the evidence behind the diagnostic criteria for miscarriage was published. It states, "findings were limited by the small number and poor quality of the studies", and concluded that further studies were, "urgently required before setting future standards for the accurate diagnosis of early embryonic demise". This implies that data used to define criteria to diagnose miscarriage are unreliable. The 2011 Irish Health Service executive review into miscarriage misdiagnosis highlighted this issue. In parallel to these publications a multicenter prospective study was published examining cut-off values for mean sac diameter (MSD) and embryo size to define miscarriage. The authors also published evidence on expected findings when ultrasonography is repeated at an interval. This led to guidance on diagnostic criteria for miscarriage in the UK changing. These new criteria state miscarriage be considered only when: an empty gestation sac has an MSD of ≥ 25 mm (with no obvious yolk sac), or embryonic crown rump length ≥ 7 mm (the latter without evidence of fetal heart activity). If in doubt, repeating scans at an interval is emphasized. It is axiomatic that decisions about embryonic viability must not be open to doubt. So it is surprising how little evidence exists to support previous guidance. Any clinician working in this area knows of women being wrongly informed that their pregnancy has failed. This cannot be acceptable and guidance in this area must be "failsafe".

### Classic and cutting-edge strategies for the management of early pregnancy loss [^9090f701]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

There are few conditions in medicine associated with more heartache to patients than recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The management of early RPL is a formidable clinical challenge for physicians. Great strides have been made in characterizing the incidence and diversity of this heterogeneous disorder, and a definite cause of pregnancy loss can be established in more than half of couples after a thorough evaluation. In this review, current data are evaluated and a clear roadmap is provided for the evaluation and treatment of RPL.

### Physical activity, physical exertion, and miscarriage risk in… [^07868e83]. stacks.cdc.gov (2010). Low credibility.

Physical Activity, Physical Exertion, and Miscarriage Risk in Women Textile Workers in Shanghai, China 2010/05/01 By Camp JE; Checkoway, Harvey; De Roos AJ;. Description: BACKGROUND: Strenuous occupational physical activity and physical demands may be risk factors for adverse reproductive outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective study in the Shanghai, China textile industry study collected women's self-reported reproductive history. Occupational physical activity assessment linked complete work history data to an industry-specific job-exposure matrix. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated by multivariate logistic regression for the first pregnancy outcome and utilized generalized estimating equations to consider all pregnancies per woman. RESULTS: Compared with women employed in sedentary jobs, a reduced risk of miscarriage was found for women working in jobs with either light or medium physical activity during the first pregnancy and over all pregnancies. Frequent crouching was associated with elevated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Light/medium occupational physical activity may have reduced miscarriage risk, while specific occupational characteristics such as crouching may have increased risk in this cohort.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Analysis design

A decision‐analytic model was developed in Microsoft Excel to compare the clinical and economic outcomes associated with various clinical evaluation pathways for RPLs. The goal of all testing pathways was to identify a possible etiology for RPL that can be used to guide further workup and clinical management.

2.2 Four testing pathways were compared

1) Current ASRM RPL workup pathway (Figure S1a): All RPL cases receive parental karyotyping; screening for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti‐β2 glycoprotein; uterine cavity assessment; and screening for thyroid or prolactin abnormalities, in parallel.
2) POC microarray pathway (Figure S1b): All RPL cases undergo POC collection and chromosomal microarray analysis. POC is commonly collected via dilation and curettage (D&C) and rarely via chorionic villi sampling (CVS), as it requires access to a specialist and is highly dependent on patient preference. Therefore, CVS is not considered in the analysis. Euploid cases receive the recommended ASRM RPL workup without parental karyotyping. Cases with fetal large unbalanced rearrangements (> 7–10Mb) receive parental karyotyping, without any other extensive RPL work‐up. Cases with aneuploidy receive no further workup.
3) POC karyotyping pathway (Figure S1c): This pathway is similar to the POC microarray pathway, except that POC chromosomal analysis is performed by karyotyping. In this scenario, cases with fetal unbalanced rearrangement due to Robertsonian translocations or large reciprocal rearrangements (> 7–10Mb usually) can be differentiated from random aneuploidy and would receive parental karyotyping.
4) cfDNA pathway (Figure S1d): All RPL patients undergo blood sampling for genome‐wide cfDNA testing. As in the POC microarray/karyotyping pathway, cases with no aneuploidy receive the recommended ASRM RPL workup without parental karyotyping. Parental karyotyping is performed only in cases with large unbalanced rearrangements (> 7–10Mb). Aneuploid cases receive no further workup.

Due to the limited accessibility of biopsy samples for repeat testing, cases with failed microarray, karyotype, and cfDNA analysis are considered as having no result and receive the recommended ASRM RPL workup.

### Evaluation and treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss: a committee opinion [^cbf2c11b]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) — suspected causes and screening are summarized as follows: Cytogenetic causes list 2–5 with recommended screening of balanced reciprocal translocations; antiphospholipid (aPL) syndrome is 8–42 (mean, 15) with recommended screening of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgG or IgM antibody, and anti-β2 glycoprotein I; and anatomic factors are 1.8–37.6 (mean, 12.6) with recommended screening of hysterosalpingography and sonohysterography, while hormonal/metabolic screening lists prolactin, TSH, and hemoglobin A1c and environmental/occupational/personal habits are assessed by history. Supportive scientific evidence includes IgG and IgM antibodies and aPL testing for other phospholipids and β2 glycoprotein I. Controversial scientific evidence includes IgG or IgM anti-annexin A5, anti-factor XII, anti-prothrombin, IgA aPLs; uterine fibroids and polyps; polycystic ovary syndrome and insulin resistance, luteal phase progesterone; and bacterial vaginosis and endocervical infections. The Not recommended column lists ANA, antithyroid antibodies; cervical incompetence; circulating CD16− NK cells; and for environmental factors, not related to recurrent pregnancy loss.

Obstetric risk factor assessment — initial evaluation — emphasizes that many conditions can adversely impact the outcome of a pregnancy, potentially placing the patient and fetus at risk for complications, and as part of the initial evaluation, the primary obstetric provider must assess for certain risk factors early in the pregnancy because interventions, monitoring, and education throughout the pregnancy can have a positive impact on outcomes.

### Prevalence and clinical, social, and health care predictors of miscarriage [^ed3630ff]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Spontaneous abortion, also known as early pregnancy loss and miscarriage, typically occurs in the first trimester of gestation. Depending on the data source, these losses are estimated to occur in 10–25% of clinically-recognized pregnancies in developed countries. Approximately 50% of early-term miscarriages are attributed to chromosomal abnormalities – "random numeric chromosome errors" – which influences the conventional wisdom that early-term pregnancy losses occur at random, and that all women are at risk. However, other maternal (and sometimes paternal) characteristics have been identified as risk factors, particularly for recurrent miscarriages, including clinical, social, behavioral, and health factors.

Reliable statistics on both the population prevalence and distribution of these losses early in pregnancy are challenging to estimate. The loss may occur before the woman knows she was pregnant and whether a woman seeks medical attention will depend on the accessibility of services, severity of symptoms, and the woman's circumstances. Published estimates range from 5% to 52% of pregnancies, with the bulk of the estimates between 13 and 30%. This variation is due in part to small samples, as well as different populations and time periods under study (e.g. upward trends over time are partly due to to increased awareness of pregnancy). In prospective studies, estimates are affected by the specificity and sensitivity of different methods and assays used to detect pregnancy and when in their menstrual cycle or gestation women are enrolled in the study. Retrospective studies use diagnostic codes to identify miscarriages among hospitalized women and interview data for non-hospitalized women, where recall bias can be a particular challenge. Using existing, population-level data that includes both inpatient and outpatient health care utilization may be a cost-effective way to estimate the prevalence of these events.

Early pregnancy loss — suggestive but not diagnostic findings should prompt re-evaluation rather than definitive diagnosis. Criteria considered suggestive are listed in Table 1, and slow fetal heart rate (less than 100 beats per minute at 5–7 weeks of gestation) and subchorionic hemorrhage are associated with early pregnancy loss but should not be used to make a definitive diagnosis; these findings warrant further evaluation in 7–10 days.

### Identifying discrepancies between clinical practice and evidence-based guideline in recurrent pregnancy loss care, a tool for clinical guideline implementation [^e5820c92]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent Pregnancy Loss (RPL) is defined as the loss of two pregnancies before 24th week gestation. Despite extensive investigations, RPL remains unexplained in more than half of couples. This affects couples' psychological health and their quality of life. Therefore, an important role is preserved for the managing physician, to support and guide these couples through the many investigations and treatments.

In previous studies we have shown that although national and international guidelines exist, protocols still vary. This high level of practice variation might lead to patients seeking care in various (inter)national centers, and be offered more extensive investigations and treatments.

In the Netherlands, the RPL guideline was published in 2007 by the Dutch Society for Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (NVOG). In the meantime, new evidence has been published regarding definition, investigations and treatments. Therefore, the guideline is in need of revision, which is currently conducted based on the ESHRE guideline. This ESHRE guideline is developed based on up-to-date evidence with a strict guideline development methodology. To make sure that clinicians will adhere to recommended investigations and treatments, different strategies to implement evidence-based guidelines are suggested. One of the suggested strategies is to audit the current performance of health care providers. In this study we therefore conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey on current clinical management of RPL patients across all 107 obstetric- and gynecology practices in the Netherlands, and compared the results with the most recent evidence-based guideline developed by the ESHRE.
