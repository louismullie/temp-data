## Question

What are the most common causes of anemia in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common causes of anemia in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how anemia is defined and why adult prevalence patterns differ by age and sex. Then, I should verify the dominant global cause and its subtypes. Next, I will examine the "one-third triad" seen in older adults and the role of chronic kidney disease and inflammation. After that, I need to check for less common but important etiologies and the burden of unexplained anemia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical hierarchy and highlight diagnostic implications and caveats, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting estimates along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and definitions, because I need to ensure we are using consistent thresholds. Anemia is typically defined by WHO as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in adult men and less than 12.0 g/dL in nonpregnant women, though some geriatric literature supports a single threshold of less than 13.0 g/dL in older adults, and contemporary guidance emphasizes using the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory, which can vary by age, sex, and ancestry, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize thresholds across all groups [^114qkjXC] [^112abv88] [^116SeqRE] [^114hvtVQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about prevalence without anchoring to the highest-quality burden data. Globally, anemia affects roughly one-third of the population, and iron deficiency remains the dominant cause, accounting for about half of anemia cases worldwide; however, I should double-check that this "half" estimate reflects both absolute and functional iron deficiency and that it varies by region and population, with over-attribution to iron deficiency in some settings due to limited diagnostics, so I will keep that caveat in mind [^115LH3LE] [^112emXBc] [^1159mjTY].

> Next, I should review the "one-third triad" characteristic of anemia in older adults, because this is central to adult etiologies in high-income settings. Approximately one-third of anemia in older adults is due to nutritional deficiencies, one-third to anemia of chronic disease or chronic kidney disease, and one-third remains unexplained after appropriate evaluation; I need to ensure I cite contemporary reviews that explicitly state this distribution and note that multifactorial combinations are common, which can blur simple categorization [^114qkjXC] [^112abv88].

> I will now examine nutritional deficiencies, starting with iron deficiency, since it is the most common cause of anemia worldwide and remains prevalent in adults. Absolute iron deficiency arises from chronic blood loss, especially gastrointestinal bleeding in men and postmenopausal women, and from impaired absorption due to atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, or bariatric surgery; functional iron deficiency occurs when iron is present in stores but unavailable due to hepcidin-driven restriction, often in inflammatory states; I should confirm that recent US data show absolute iron deficiency in about 14% and functional iron deficiency in about 15% of adults, and that guidelines emphasize confirming iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation before attributing cause, recognizing that ferritin behaves as an acute phase reactant [^111vsMJh] [^116mQBMR] [^115bHVQo].

> Wait, let me verify the gastrointestinal malignancy signal in iron deficiency anemia, because this drives urgency of evaluation. In adult men and postmenopausal women with new iron deficiency anemia, gastrointestinal malignancy is a leading concern, and guidelines recommend timely bidirectional endoscopic evaluation when no obvious source is identified; I should confirm that dual pathology occurs in a minority but is not rare, reinforcing the need for complete upper and lower GI assessment in appropriate patients [^115bHVQo] [^116yAa5W] [^115nNc4m].

> Next, I should review anemia of chronic disease and anemia of chronic kidney disease, since these are major contributors in adults, particularly older adults. Anemia of inflammation is typically normocytic and driven by cytokine-mediated iron sequestration and impaired erythropoiesis, with hepcidin playing a central role; CKD-related anemia reflects relative erythropoietin deficiency compounded by iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and its likelihood rises as eGFR falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and especially below 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; I need to ensure I note that functional iron deficiency is common in CKD and that management often requires IV iron and, when indicated, ESAs with careful targets to avoid harm [^117Bn4Sx] [^1148K2kY] [^112AGZ78].

> But wait, what if no cause is found after a thorough evaluation in an older adult. Unexplained anemia of aging accounts for a substantial fraction of cases, with estimates up to one-third in some series, and even mild decrements in hemoglobin correlate with worse mobility, cognition, and mortality; I should confirm that current criteria remain by exclusion and that emerging data implicate stem cell senescence, low basal erythropoietin production, and clonal hematopoiesis in a subset, though therapeutic options remain limited pending further research [^112abv88] [^115NWJD9] [^114ndj5Z].

> I need to check for other important etiologies that, while less common, are clinically significant and sometimes treatable. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies remain relevant, particularly in older adults with atrophic gastritis or poor intake; myelodysplastic syndromes and clonal cytopenias increase with age and can present with macrocytosis or cytopenias; hemolytic anemias, including autoimmune hemolysis and inherited membranopathies or enzyme deficiencies, should be considered when indices or smear suggest hemolysis; and chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer frequently drive anemia of inflammation with or without absolute iron deficiency [^114qkjXC] [^111GgRy5] [^117Bn4Sx].

> Let me reconsider the global picture to avoid overgeneralizing from high-income settings. While iron deficiency dominates globally, the relative contributions of chronic disease, CKD, hemoglobinopathies, and infectious etiologies vary by geography; for example, malaria and sickle cell disease contribute substantially in sub-Saharan Africa, and thalassemia syndromes are prominent in parts of South Asia, so I should acknowledge that the "one-third triad" is most descriptive of older adults in high-income countries rather than all adults worldwide [^112emXBc] [^111tk2g8].

> I should double-check the diagnostic implications, because identifying the cause guides urgency and modality of therapy. A systematic approach includes CBC with indices, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, iron studies with ferritin and transferrin saturation, renal function, and inflammatory markers, followed by targeted testing such as B12 and folate, hemolysis labs, and, when indicated, endoscopy or hematology referral; I need to ensure I note that a brisk hemoglobin rise after iron therapy supports absolute iron deficiency even when ferritin is equivocal, and that CKD-specific iron thresholds differ from non-CKD populations, which affects interpretation and treatment selection [^113HMPXu] [^114J4SK1] [^113N8GG9].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final hierarchy clearly. Globally, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in adults, encompassing both absolute and functional forms, with gastrointestinal blood loss and malabsorption as key drivers in many settings; in older adults, anemia is commonly distributed across nutritional deficiencies, anemia of chronic disease or CKD, and unexplained anemia of aging, each accounting for roughly one-third; less common but important causes include B12 and folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndromes, hemolytic anemias, and malignancy; multifactorial combinations are frequent, so a structured, reference-aware evaluation is essential to avoid premature closure and to align treatment with the true underlying causes [^115LH3LE] [^114qkjXC] [^112abv88].

---

The most common causes of anemia in adults are **iron deficiency** (chronic blood loss, malabsorption, poor intake) [^115LH3LE], **chronic disease/inflammation** (CKD, cancer, autoimmune disease) [^112ekgeq], and **nutritional deficiencies** (B12, folate) [^114qkjXC]. Iron deficiency is the leading cause globally [^112emXBc] and in older adults, with **CKD and chronic inflammation** also common [^114qkjXC]; in younger women, **menstrual blood loss** is frequent [^1159a5aK]. Unexplained anemia of aging is common in the elderly [^112abv88] and often multifactorial [^114qkjXC]. Evaluation should include CBC, iron studies, renal function, and targeted testing based on clinical context [^115bHVQo].

---

## Iron deficiency anemia (IDA)

Iron deficiency anemia is the **most common cause of anemia worldwide** [^115LH3LE], accounting for approximately 50% of anemia cases [^115LH3LE]. It results from inadequate iron supply relative to demand, leading to impaired hemoglobin synthesis and microcytic, hypochromic anemia [^1165NARa].

---

### Causes of iron deficiency anemia

- **Chronic blood loss**: Gastrointestinal bleeding (peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease) [^116yAa5W] and menstrual blood loss are common sources [^1159a5aK].

- **Malabsorption**: Celiac disease, bariatric surgery, and Helicobacter pylori infection can impair iron absorption [^111vsMJh].

- **Inadequate dietary intake**: Poor nutrition, restrictive diets, and lack of iron-rich foods contribute to iron deficiency [^111vsMJh].

- **Increased demand**: Pregnancy, lactation, and rapid growth increase iron requirements [^112WHdxv].

---

## Anemia of chronic disease (ACD)

Anemia of chronic disease, also known as anemia of inflammation, is the **second most common cause of anemia in adults** [^112ekgeq]. It is characterized by normocytic or mildly microcytic anemia associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, malignancies, and chronic infections [^117Bn4Sx].

---

### Pathophysiology of ACD

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: Elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha increase hepcidin production, leading to iron sequestration and reduced availability for erythropoiesis [^notfound].

- **Reduced erythropoietin production**: Chronic inflammation suppresses erythropoietin synthesis and erythroid proliferation [^notfound].

- **Shortened red blood cell lifespan**: Inflammatory mediators increase erythrophagocytosis and hemolysis [^notfound].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

Nutritional deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, are **significant causes of anemia in adults** [^114qkjXC]. These deficiencies result in macrocytic anemia due to impaired DNA synthesis and erythroid maturation [^115u8PZ8].

---

### Vitamin B12 deficiency

- **Dietary insufficiency**: Strict vegan diets lacking animal products [^notfound].

- **Malabsorption**: Pernicious anemia, gastrointestinal surgery, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth [^notfound].

- **Medications**: Proton pump inhibitors and metformin can impair B12 absorption [^notfound].

---

### Folate deficiency

Folate deficiency arises from **poor dietary intake** — especially with alcoholism or restrictive diets — and from **malabsorption** due to celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and anticonvulsants can also impair folate metabolism [^notfound].

---

## Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Chronic kidney disease is a **major cause of anemia in adults**, particularly in older populations [^114qkjXC]. CKD-related anemia is primarily due to erythropoietin deficiency and iron dysregulation [^1148K2kY].

---

### Pathophysiology of CKD-related anemia

- **Erythropoietin deficiency**: Reduced renal production of erythropoietin impairs erythropoiesis [^1148K2kY].

- **Iron deficiency**: Functional and absolute iron deficiency due to impaired iron utilization and chronic blood loss [^113N8GG9].

- **Uremic toxins**: Accumulation of uremic toxins suppresses erythroid proliferation and survival [^notfound].

---

## Unexplained anemia of aging (UAA)

Unexplained anemia of aging is a common entity in older adults, accounting for approximately one-third of anemia cases in this population [^112abv88]. It is characterized by mild, normocytic anemia without identifiable underlying causes after thorough evaluation [^114ndj5Z].

---

### Potential mechanisms of UAA

Potential mechanisms include **hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction** — age-related impairment of stem cell function and erythropoietin responsiveness — and chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to anemia via cytokine-mediated pathways. Hormonal changes, including androgen deficiency, may also contribute [^114qkjXC].

---

## Hemolytic anemia

Hemolytic anemia results from increased red blood cell destruction, leading to a compensatory increase in erythropoiesis [^112WHdxv]. It can be classified as **intrinsic or extrinsic** [^111GgRy5].

---

### Intrinsic hemolytic anemia

Intrinsic hemolytic anemia includes **hereditary disorders** such as hereditary spherocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and sickle cell disease [^notfound]. Acquired intrinsic hemolytic anemia includes paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and enzyme deficiencies [^notfound].

---

### Extrinsic hemolytic anemia

Extrinsic hemolytic anemia includes **immune-mediated hemolysis** — autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), transfusion reactions, and drug-induced hemolysis — and non-immune causes such as mechanical hemolysis (heart valves, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia), infections (malaria, babesiosis), and toxins [^notfound].

---

## Bone marrow disorders

Bone marrow disorders impair erythropoiesis, leading to anemia [^113hS5xH]. Common causes include **myelodysplastic syndromes** — clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with ineffective erythropoiesis — and aplastic anemia, characterized by bone marrow failure and hypocellularity. Hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma also suppress normal erythropoiesis [^111M66xJ].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A systematic approach is essential to identify the **underlying cause of anemia** in adults [^115BrY5w]:

- **History and physical examination**: Identify symptoms, risk factors, chronic diseases, medication use, and family history [^113HMPXu].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), iron studies (ferritin, transferrin saturation), renal function tests, vitamin B12 and folate levels, hemolysis markers, and bone marrow examination if indicated [^117Fk92E].

- **Specialized tests**: Endoscopy for gastrointestinal bleeding, genetic testing for hemoglobinopathies, and imaging studies as appropriate [^116yAa5W].

---

The most common causes of anemia in adults include iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies (vitamin B12, folate), chronic kidney disease, unexplained anemia of aging, hemolytic anemia, and bone marrow disorders. A **comprehensive evaluation** and targeted diagnostic approach are essential to identify the underlying cause and guide appropriate management [^115u8PZ8].

Abstract

With the global growing older adult population, clinicians face the common, yet complex challenge of how to evaluate and manage anemia in this population. Older age predisposes to common causes of anemia such as nutritional deficiencies, inflammatory disorders, chronic kidney disease, and hematologic malignancies. Failure to diagnose and appropriately manage anemia may result in decreased quality of life, impaired cognition, impaired mobility, and increased mortality. Anemia diagnosis in older adults presents a diagnostic conundrum because anemia may have a single cause, may be multifactorial, or may have no apparent cause even after an extensive evaluation. We believe a systematic approach to diagnosis ensures appropriate testing and avoids the pitfall of undertreatment and overtreatment. In this article we present our recommended approach through common scenarios for the management of anemia in the older adult.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^112abv88]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Anemia is prevalent in men and women over the age of 65 years and becomes progressively more common with age. Anemia is associated with reductions in functional capacity and quality of life, as well an increased risk of death from all causes. Roughly one third of anemia in older patients is unexplained (UAA). Although the WHO diagnostic thresholds for anemia are most frequently used, evidence supports the use of a single criterion of Hb < 13 g/dl in both older men and postmenopausal women. Even mild anemia (Hb 11.0–12.9) is associated with poor clinical outcomes, lower QOL, and elevated mortality. Although UAA is currently diagnosed by exclusion of identifiable causes for anemia, the diagnostic criteria for UAA are clearly defined, and the UAA patient population experiences significant functional decline, morbidity, and mortality. In part due to the lack of consensus on the etiology of UAA, treatment options are extremely limited at present. Novel therapies are currently in development for the treatment of this highly prevalent condition. Finally, we strongly recommend routine assessment of functional capacity and quality of life in all older patients by healthcare providers, particularly those suffering from anemia, using standardized tools that will help to identify functional deficits and changes in functional capacity in older patients with anemia.

Introduction

Anemia is common in older adults and increases with advancing age. In the United States, up to 17% of individuals aged > 65 years experience anemia. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of < 12.0 g/dL for women and of < 13.0 g/dL for men. This WHO definition of anemia is a population-based threshold, which may not fully capture clinically relevant changes in hemoglobin. Older adults who do not meet the WHO definition of anemia may still experience declines in hemoglobin that are associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. In older adults, approximately a third of anemia cases are due to nutritional deficiencies, a third are due to anemia of chronic diseases [anemia of inflammation (ACI) (also called anemia of chronic disease) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD)], and a third of cases are unexplained anemia of aging (UAA). As the older adult population continues to grow around the world, a concomitant rise in older-adult anemia suggests clinicians will benefit from a systematic approach to anemia management in older patients.

Causes of anemia in older adults

Definitive determination of a cause of anemia in older adults is difficult; furthermore, anemia may be multifactorial. Potential reasons why anemia is more common in older adults compared with younger adults, are because of hallmarks of aging such as hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion, cellular senescence, and dysregulated nutrient sensing. Older adults are more likely to develop gastrointestinal disorders leading to blood loss and malabsorption that may be compounded by anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents as well as a decline in nutrient intake. Chronic inflammation can be related to established comorbid illnesses (eg, rheumatoid arthritis [RA] and advanced cancer) and to some extent from aging alone. Inflammation leads to dysregulation in iron metabolism and a blunted hematopoietic response to erythropoietin (EPO). There is also a decline in nephron size and number that occurs with age that results in reduced EPO production in individuals with CKD. Age-associated decline in testosterone levels can have negative effects on erythropoiesis, thus, increasing the risk of anemia in older men. Undiagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloid precursor conditions such as clonal cytopenia of unknown significance (CCUS) are increasingly recognized as potential causes of anemia.

### The global burden of anemia [^117754VN]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is an important cause of health loss. We estimated levels and trends of nonfatal anemia burden for 23 distinct etiologies in 188 countries, 20 age groups, and both sexes from 1990 to 2013. All available population-level anemia data were collected and standardized. We estimated mean hemoglobin, prevalence of anemia by severity, quantitative disability owing to anemia, and underlying etiology for each population using the approach of the Global Burden of Disease, Injuries and Risk Factors 2013 Study. Anemia burden is high. Developing countries account for 89% of all anemia-related disability. Iron-deficiency anemia remains the dominant cause of anemia.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^1159a5aK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^115NWJD9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to 15% of people aged 60 and over are anemic, and the prevalence of anemia increases with age. In older men and women, anemia is associated with increases in the risk of death and all-cause hospitalization, poor functional capacity, quality of life, and depression.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the literature describing anemia in aging populations, focusing on the specific diagnostic criteria of anemia and potential causes in older men and women. Even after extensive etiologic workup that involves careful medical history, physical examination, laboratory measurements, and additional studies such as bone marrow biopsy, anemia of aging is unexplained in up to 40% of older patients with anemia. As a result, treatment options remain limited.

Conclusions

The prevalence of unexplained anemia of aging (UAA; also called unexplained anemia of the elderly, UAE), its deleterious impacts on health, physical function, and quality of life, and the lack of effective treatment or therapy guidelines represent a compelling unmet clinical need. In this review and consensus document, we discuss the scope of the problem, possible causes of UAA, diagnostic criteria, and potential treatment options. Because even mild anemia is strongly linked to poor clinical outcomes, it should receive clinical attention rather than simply being considered a normal part of aging.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^116mQBMR]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency among adults in the US?

Findings

This cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of 8021 US adults estimated that absolute iron deficiency affects 14% and functional iron deficiency affects 15% of adults in the US. Absolute iron deficiency most often affects young women, whereas functional iron deficiency affects women and men of all ages.

Meaning

These findings suggest that absolute and functional iron deficiency represent common public health problems, and further research on the role of functional iron deficiency in adverse health outcomes and on iron deficiency screening strategies is needed.

### Epidemiology of anemia in the elderly: information on diagnostic evaluation [^1158bUiP]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

A rise in the aging population has been predicted, and, as a result, it is expected that the incidence of age-related health conditions will also increase. Although common in the elderly, anemia is often mild and asymptomatic and rarely requires hospitalization. However, untreated anemia can be detrimental, because it is associated with increased mortality, poor health, fatigue, and functional dependence and can lead to cardiovascular and neurological complications. Several factors have been suggested to cause anemia in this population, for example, blood loss or chronic disease. In some cases, the cause is unknown. It has been suggested that this is a result of the presence of comorbid conditions that can mask the symptoms of anemia. Therefore, appropriate diagnosis and management strategies of anemia in the elderly need to be identified, particularly because anemia may indicate the presence of other serious diseases.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^11426WUb]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

3 The Challenges in Estimating the Global Burden of Anemia

Estimating the burden imposed by anemia is not a trivial task. The difficulties in reliably quantifying its consequences stem from complex challenges related to its diagnosis. As previously mentioned, anemia is multifactorial and can result from various causes. These can often be hard to differentiate, making accurate diagnosis challenging, especially in developing countries. Also, multiple types of anemia can occur simultaneously, often presenting with similar symptoms, making it challenging to distinguish and accurately attribute the specific causes of anemia on a global scale. Achieving this requires more comprehensive, high‐quality data to understand and quantify the contributions of different underlying causes across diverse populations.

Over‐attribution to iron deficiency anemia, the most common type of anemia, is an important issue, often due to its status as a default diagnosis in regions with limited diagnostic resources and its high prevalence as a primary etiology in many populations. Analyses often rely on iron deficiency, while only about half of anemia cases globally are due to it, leading to misdiagnosis and misclassification. Therefore, assessing anemia should involve testing various biomarkers (e.g. ferritin and retinol) with different sensitivities and specificities. This "biomarker complexity" is further heightened and compounded by interactions with factors like inflammation, nutrient deficiencies, and pregnancy, especially in developing countries, where multiple types of anemia can coexist.

Does anemia have adverse effects in older adults?

There have been several studies highlighting the clinical relevance of anemia in older adults. Mild anemia has been associated with poor physical performance, lower muscle strength, and depression and is independently associated with increased mortality. Anemia also increases the risk of falls and hospitalizations and can lead to a decline in activities of daily living and decreased quality of life (QOL). Even in high-functioning older adults, anemia is associated with a 4-fold increase in risk for impaired executive function. In a large population-based study, anemia was associated with impaired health-related QOL and poor survival in older adults aged ≥ 60 years but not in younger adults. In addition, women with hemoglobin levels between 12 and 13 g/dL (above the WHO definition of anemia) also experienced lower health-related QOL. As we have few anemia corrective therapies, evidence that treating mild anemia or UAA attenuates these outcomes is limited.

The objective of this article is to present a case-based approach to management of anemia in the older adult population.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^117Legtq]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^114ZYX35]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Anemia at older age: etiologies, clinical implications, and management [^113hS5xH]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is quite frequently diagnosed in older individuals and is a key indicator of various reactive and clonal conditions. Many underlying diseases, like myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), develop preferentially in elderly individuals. The prevalence of anemia at older age is increasing, and this is mainly attributable to more frequently applied diagnostics and demographic changes in our societies. The etiology of anemia at older age is complex and ranges from bone marrow failure syndromes to chronic kidney disease, and from nutritional deficiencies to inflammatory processes including inflammaging in immunosenescence. In a smaller number of cases, no clear-cut etiology is identified. These patients are referred to as unexplained anemia or idiopathic cytopenia of unknown significance. In others, somatic mutations in leukocytes are found, but diagnostic criteria for MDS or other hematologic diseases are not fulfilled, a condition termed clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance. Management of anemias at older age depends on (1) the severity of the anemia, (2) underlying condition(s), and (3) patient-related factors, including comorbidities. Even a mild anemia may substantially affect physical and cognitive capacities and quality of life. An underestimated aspect is that because of age-related changes, organ function such as erythropoietin production in the kidney may become suboptimal. Management and treatment of anemia in older patients often require a multidisciplinary approach and detailed investigations of organ function. In this article, we review current concepts around anemias at older age, with special emphasis on etiologies, clinical implications, and innovative concepts in the management of these patients.

### Evaluation of anemia [^115u8PZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^116BQgD7]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Not so benign haematology: anaemia of the elderly [^117KoYiR]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, are experiencing a change in demographics resulting in the largest proportion of adults over 65years of age that our health systems have ever experienced. As such, haematologists must be prepared to evaluate and treat anaemia in a more complicated patient population, but sufficient evidence-based guidelines are lacking. Critical next steps that must be taken to ensure the best care of this population include the determination of appropriate haemoglobin concentrations for older adults in light of age, gender, race, and comorbidities; the development of interventional trials that address physical performance outcomes in addition to haemoglobin targets; and translational studies which address the molecular pathogenesis of anaemia in older adults with the most advanced scientific approaches.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^115nNc4m]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

1. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

2. IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia affects about a third of the global population and is a major cause of morbidity worldwide. Iron deficiency is one of the dominant causes, and the resulting anaemia (iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)) has a point prevalence of 2%–5% among adult men and postmenopausal women in the developed world.

IDA is the most common form of anaemia seen in primary care in the UK. It is estimated to account for more than 57 000 emergency admissions to UK hospitals each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) more than £55 million per annum.

While menstrual loss is commonly the cause of IDA in premenopausal women, IDA in adult men and postmenopausal women is often due to chronic blood loss from the GI tract. IDA may be the first presenting manifestation of colonic or oesophago-gastric carcinoma, highlighting the importance of swift and complete investigation. There are however many other recognised causes of IDA (table 1) including malabsorption (most commonly from coeliac disease (CD) in the UK), poor dietary intake, blood donation, gastrectomy and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). IDA is often multifactorial, and dual pathology (ie, significant disease in both upper and lower GI tract) is found in 1%–10% of cases — this should be particularly considered in the older patient.

Table 1
Pathological disorders associated with iron deficiency anaemia

IDA may present in primary care, or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and historically the management of IDA was often suboptimal — with investigation being slow, inadequate or incomplete. Over recent years, however, the recognition that IDA may reflect serious underlying GI pathology has resulted in increasing involvement of gastroenterology services. IDA may now account for 10% or more of all gastroenterology referrals, and a typical district hospital unit in the UK with a catchment of 250 000 may have in excess of 400 IDA referrals per annum.

### Anemia in older adults [^117Fk92E]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Anemia in the elderly: a public health crisis in hematology [^114LcoPR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Over 3 million people in the United States aged 65 years and older are anemic. This condition is associated with significant functional impairment and, perhaps, increased mortality. In March 2004, the American Society of Hematology (in conjunction with the National Institute of Aging) convened a "blue ribbon" panel of twenty physicians who are experts on various aspects of this topic. This paper highlights important consensus concepts resulting from that meeting. In particular, four areas of thought are shared. First, the epidemiology of anemia in the elderly is reviewed, including its definition, its expression in different racial groups, and its wide-ranging manifestations. Second, the pathophysiology of anemia in the elderly is reviewed as pertains to three general etiological categories (nutritional, chronic diseases, and so-called "unexplained" anemias). Particular emphasis is given to pathophysiologic mechanisms of anemia that are potentially unique to this age group. Third, a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of anemia for this patient population for the practicing hematologist is provided. Finally, the public health implications of anemia in the elderly for key stakeholder constituencies will be discussed in the oral presentation.

UNEXPLAINED ANEMIA IS PREVALENT IN AGING POPULATIONS

Anemia, defined by the World Health Organization criteria as circulating hemoglobin (Hb) < 12 g/dl in women and < 13 g/dl in men, is common among individuals over the age of 60. The prevalence of anemia increases with age and is particularly common among the oldest and most frail: in a retrospective study of more than 19,000 hospital patients, the incidence of anemia rose from 15% at the ages of 64–69 to 37% in those over aged 90 (Figure 1). Many anemia cases have no clear underlying cause, a population that we will refer to as unexplained anemia of aging (UAA).

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^112emXBc]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is a comprehensive effort to systematically measure the causes and risk factors of death and disability. Anaemia-specific manuscripts relating to the 2010 and 2013 GBDs have previously been published. Other studies examining trends in anaemia burden at the global level have often been limited to particular demographic groups (eg, children or women of reproductive age), geographies (eg, low-income settings), or specific underlying causes (eg, iron deficiency), and therefore do not capture the full extent of the anaemia burden. For example, 2022 WHO estimates present anaemia burden among children aged 6–59 months and women aged 15–49 years from 2000 to 2019. In this context, the GBD provides an ideal framework to comprehensively quantify the prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends of anaemia burden across all geographies, demographics, and causes. To estimate total anaemia prevalence, we used individual-level and tabulated survey and report data from the Global Health Data Exchange, identified using the keywords "anemia" and "hemoglobin", supplemented with sources from the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System, a comprehensive database including measurements of haemoglobin concentration and anaemia prevalence collected from systematic reviews of scientific literature databases; WHO regional and country offices; other research, governmental and non-governmental organisations; and manual searches of non-indexed journals. Inclusion criteria were quantitative measurement of haemoglobin concentrations in either a population-based sample or a group judged to adequately represent the sex, age groups, and location of the study.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, this study presents the most up-to-date and complete estimates of global anaemia burden, covering 204 countries and territories, 25 age groups, and male and female sexes from 1990 to 2021. We provide a comprehensive account of anaemia prevalence, associated years lived with disability, and the trends in these values, including an examination of underlying causes of anaemia and associations with Socio-demographic Index. We have improved on previous estimates through the addition of numerous data sources, enhanced data processing algorithms for pregnancy adjustment, and revised modelling techniques to strengthen estimates in locations and populations in which data are sparse. Our causal attribution models included additional causes of anaemia, amended methods for estimating cause-specific anaemia burden, and optimised redistribution algorithms to account for the varied effect of different diseases on haemoglobin concentrations.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^115LH3LE]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^114vL6Nn]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^111vsMJh]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### Anemia in older persons [^113nzN75]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia in older persons is commonly overlooked despite mounting evidence that low hemoglobin levels are a significant marker of physiologic decline. Using the World Health Organization definition of anemia (hemoglobin level less than 13 g per dL [130 g per L] in men and less than 12 g per dL [120 g per L] in women), more than 10 percent of persons older than 65 years are anemic. The prevalence increases with age, approaching 50 percent in chronically ill patients living in nursing homes. There is increasing evidence that even mild anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Anemia warrants evaluation in all older persons, except those at the end of life or who decline interventions. About one third of persons have anemia secondary to a nutritional deficiency, one third have anemia caused by chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease, and one third have unexplained anemia. Nutritional anemia is effectively treated with vitamin or iron replacement. Iron deficiency anemia often is caused by gastrointestinal bleeding and requires further investigation in most patients. Anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic kidney disease may respond to treatment of the underlying disease and selective use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. The treatment of unexplained anemia is difficult, and there is little evidence that treatment decreases morbidity and mortality, or improves quality of life. Occasionally, anemia may be caused by less common but potentially treatable conditions, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome.

### Addressing anemia in high-altitude populations: global impact, prevalence, challenges, and potential solutions [^111tk2g8]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults suffering from anemia often experience symptoms like weakness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and reduced productivity in daily activities and work. Among older adults, anemia is known as a risk factor for hospitalization, poor surgical outcomes, and increased all‐cause mortality. This has been particularly observed when moderate to severe anemia is present. Due to these varied causes, pathological anemia prevalence significantly varies by geography: the highest rates can be found in regions such as western sub‐Saharan Africa (47.4%) and South Asia (43.0%), where conditions like malaria and hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease in sub‐Saharan Africa, and thalassemia syndromes in South Asia, are common. These conditions shorten the lifespan of red blood cells, contributing to the higher prevalence of anemia. In South America, anemia presents a variable burden: in countries like Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Honduras, and Argentina, anemia was classified as a mild public health problem, with prevalence rates ranging from 7.6% to 18.7%. In Guatemala, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Bolivia, anemia was considered a moderate public health issue, with prevalence between 21.4% and 38.3%. Panama and Haiti reported the highest prevalence rates at 40.0% and 45.5%, respectively, classifying anemia as a severe public health concern in these countries. In contrast, regions like Australasia and Western Europe have much lower prevalence rates, around 5.7% and 6.0%, respectively.

Persistent high anemia burden, particularly among women of reproductive age and young children, emphasizes the urgent need for a renewed focus on accurately measuring its prevalence and underlying causes. Since these groups include individuals with "physiological anemia" that does not require intervention, it is necessary to develop methods to distinguish "physiological anemia" from "pathological anemia" or "true anemia".

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^116sFVnc]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Anaemia as defined using WHO criteria is common in older people living in the community, and is higher in the older old and black people. It is particularly common amongst nursing home residents and older people admitted to hospital. The presence of anaemia is associated with a worse prognosis, with increases in morbidity and mortality. Predicted demographic changes will increase the burden and underline the need to understand more about anaemia in older people.

### Prevalence and outcomes of anemia in geriatrics: a systematic review of the literature [^1131fDBN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common concern in geriatric health, but its exact incidence and prevalence are unclear. Several studies have addressed this issue with discrepant results. Estimates of anemia prevalence reported in the articles reviewed here range from 2.9% to 61% in elderly men and from 3.3% to 41% in elderly women. This variability is related to a number of factors, including the setting of the study, the health status of the subject population, and the criteria used to define anemia. The criteria set by the World Health Organization (WHO) — hemoglobin level < 120.0 g/L for women and < 130.0 g/L for men — are most frequently, but not universally, used. Even so, their appropriateness in older populations may be questioned. Most existing reports indicate that elderly men have higher rates of anemia than do elderly women, but the threshold values are, in general, higher for men than for women. Incidence of anemia rises with age; some studies report a particularly notable increase in prevalence of anemia in the oldest subjects, those ≥ 85 years of age. Whereas anemia is associated with symptoms ranging from weakness and fatigue to increased falls and depression, and in severe cases can lead to congestive heart failure, few studies have systematically examined functional, clinical, and economic outcomes or patient satisfaction in the elderly with anemia. Future directions for research on anemia should include a more detailed examination of the importance of aging or age-related diseases on the pathogenesis of anemia, an assessment of the importance of anemia on outcomes such as physical function and cognitive function, and an analysis of whether impairments associated with anemia are amenable to correction by improving hemoglobin concentration.

### Prevalence, years lived with disability, and trends in anaemia burden by severity and cause, 1990–2021: findings from the global burden of disease study 2021 [^111BnFAy]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

This study has a number of limitations. First, data availability varied considerably by age and sex. Although comparatively many haemoglobin surveys exist for children older than 6 months and women of reproductive age, data are much sparser for younger children, adult males, and males and females older than 60 years. In addition, high-quality data at more granular levels to inform subnational estimation, including those subnational locations included in this analysis, are comparatively sparse. Second, WHO anaemia definitions are not available for children younger than 6 months, so we imputed thresholds based on median haemoglobin concentrations for older children; this probably imparted additional uncertainty in burden estimates beyond what is presented. Third, in our causal analysis, we assumed a linear cause-specific haemoglobin shift for any starting haemoglobin value, and we assumed that the shape of the population haemoglobin distribution was constant, which might not capture the true variation in cause-specific effects on haemoglobin distributions across geography and cause. Fourth, because the amount of data available to inform haemoglobin shifts varied substantially by cause (appendix pp 18–25) we were not able to capture uncertainty in the shifts themselves. Fifth, the assumption that each anaemia case has only a single underlying cause, although reflecting a sparsity of data to inform the interplay between diseases, nonetheless is a limitation in that many people with anaemia are likely to have multiple comorbid conditions contributing to their anaemia. Additional data on the combined effects of comorbid conditions on haemoglobin concentrations are needed to fully account for the multiple causes underlying many cases of anaemia. Finally, we were unable to capture all potential causes of anaemia in our causal analysis, owing to an absence of either estimates of disease prevalence or associated haemoglobin shifts. These potential causes include cancers, injuries, some micronutrient deficiencies (eg, folate and cobalamin), causes of inflammation not already captured in this analysis, and drug reactions. In addition, we had to estimate some causes as residual causes, again because either cause prevalence estimates or haemoglobin shifts were not available; this includes dietary iron deficiency, the largest cause of anaemia in our analyses.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^111FSCEk]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^11693D6F]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

Discussion of case 4

When older adults are evaluated for anemia, certain features such as systemic symptoms and severe anemia may suggest more significant underlying causes such as hereditary red cell disorders. In a prospective study evaluating causes of unexplained anemia in a cohort of predominantly (69%) African American older adults aged ≥ 65 years, 4.6% had thalassemia trait, and 2.2% had a hemolytic condition. In clinical practice, patients can present at any age with uncommon causes of anemia such as undiagnosed SCD, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A thorough medical and family history, review of symptoms, and peripheral blood smear will help determine whether additional workup for inherited or acquired red cell disorders is indicated.

Membranopathies such as hereditary spherocytosis may go undiagnosed until older age if they cause infrequent or no major hemolytic episodes.

In patients with MCV of < 80 fL and no iron deficiency, a diagnosis of thalassemia is highly likely. β-globin disorders can be confirmed with hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. The presence and type of α-globin mutation can be confirmed with α-globin gene sequencing. Typically, no treatment is required for thalassemia trait.

SCD is the most common severe inherited blood disorder in the United States. SCD is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene that leads to vaso-occlusion, thus causing complications such as strokes, renal disease, cardiopulmonary complications, and accelerated functional decline. There are several variants of SCD with hemoglobin SS being the most common. Individuals with hemoglobin-SC or sickle-β + –thalassemia variants are more likely to go undiagnosed for decades because they have fewer complications early in life, have a relatively higher hemoglobin level (usually 10–12 g/dL), and have a longer life expectancy compared with individuals with hemoglobin SS.

Older adults with SCD may develop progressive anemia due to both SCD and age-associated changes such as CKD, stem cell exhaustion due to a lifetime of hemolysis, and increased RBC turnover. Hematologic malignancies are also more common in individuals with SCD compared with the general population, and clonal hematopoiesis may also be more common in adults with SCD, occurring at an earlier age.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^116WGHKd]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The world population is ageing; in 2000 there were 600 million people aged 60 or over, and it is estimated that this figure will double by 2025, and more than triple to 2 billion by 2050. Between 2007 and 2027 the number of people aged 65 years or older in England alone is predicted to increase by 200,000 each year, rising from eight to 12 million over that 20-year period. In the United States numbers aged 65 years or older are predicted to rise from 37 million in 2006 to 63 million by 2025.

The "oldest old", often defined as those aged 85 or older, show the largest increase in numbers. By 2066 it is anticipated that there will be almost a third of a million people aged 100 years or older, in a population of 70 million in the UK. In the United States the prediction is for a third of a million over the age of 100 years by 2020.

This demographic change has obvious implications for individuals and society. It will impact particularly on healthcare provision, especially as longer life does not necessarily mean more years enjoyed in good health. It becomes increasingly important to highlight common medical problems in older people, especially if their extent and potential significance are not generally recognised. We suspected that anaemia might be one such problem.

Anaemia is often defined in terms of the WHO criteria, established in 1968. The WHO definition of anaemia is a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration < 130 g/L in men, and < 120 g/L in women. There has been debate about the use of these values, and in particular, whether they should be used to define anaemia in older people, but there is no widely accepted alternative definition of anaemia in this age group.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^11544GJD]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and burden of disease worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA-for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss. Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel. IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease- with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians. This document is a revision of previous British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, updated in the light of subsequent evidence and developments.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

### Normal and pathological erythropoiesis in adults: from gene regulation to targeted treatment concepts [^111JKNxS]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Classification of anemia: novel aspects and etiologies

In general, anemia can be classified based on the regenerative capacity of the bone marrow (hypo- or hyper-regenerative), the red cell volume (micro-, normo- or macrocytic), the etiology (bleeding, deficiency-induced, hemolytic, renal, inflammation-related, neoplastic, aplastic, others) and the dynamics with which anemia develops (acute, chronic). – For each specific form of anemia, an extensive amount of published data has accumulated during the past few decades. A detailed description is beyond the scope of this article. There are also special variants of anemia that develop typically in the context of certain physiological conditions such as pregnancy or advanced age. In these cases, the primary question is whether anemia is indicative of an undetected pathology and whether and when (at what thresholds) anemia can indeed be diagnosed. For example, in pregnant women, a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL is still considered to be within the normal range by the World Health Organization (WHO). In elderly individuals, however, any decrease of hemoglobin below 'normal' is considered an anemia. On the other hand, there is an ongoing discussion about the definition of anemia in the elderly and related hemoglobin thresholds.– When no evidence of an underlying condition is found after a thorough investigation of all relevant organs and potential etiologies, the condition is termed cytopenia (anemia) of unknown significance (ICUS-A). Thus, the diagnosis of ICUS-A implies that a detailed investigation of the bone marrow, with histological, morphological (cytological), immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular studies, was performed without conclusive evidence of the presence of MDS or any other underlying bone marrow neoplasm. In this regard it is worth noting that next-generation sequencing may sometimes reveal more or less specific mutations which may lead to re-classification of ICUS-A cases into either clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance or low-risk MDS, respectively. – Other differential diagnoses to ICUS-A include anemia of chronic disease (inflammation-associated anemia), hemodilution, renal anemia, copper deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency. – In some elderly patients with ICUS-A, inadequately low levels of erythropoietin are found even though the excretory function of the kidney is normal. In such cases, the aged kidney may be responsible for low erythropoietin production. Another equally important contributor to low red cell and erythropoietin production in elderly (otherwise healthy) people may be an age-related decrease in the production of hypophyseal and other essential hormones, resulting in a decreased supply of testosterone. However, unless an additional pathology (co-morbidity) is also present, these individuals have only mild anemia and are free of symptoms. As mentioned, it remains uncertain as to whether all these elderly individuals should indeed be diagnosed as having overt anemia.

### Iron deficiency anemia in women across the life span [^114QnEQf]. Journal of Women's Health (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a global health issue with disproportionately high prevalence in women. In addition to being an independent risk factor for decreased quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality, anemia in women has been linked to unfavorable outcomes of pregnancy and other issues for children born to anemic women. Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia in many populations. Guidelines recommend proactive screening for anemia, particularly in the preoperative setting. Once anemia is diagnosed, treatment should be based on etiology (most commonly, iron deficiency followed, in order of prevalence, by inflammation or chronic disease). Iron supplementation (oral and intravenous) offers safe and effective treatment for anemia associated with iron deficiency. Anemia of chronic disease may be more challenging to treat, and attention must be given to the underlying disease, along with use of hematinic agents. Given its enormous impact on the health and well-being of women and the availability of simple and effective treatment options, anemia should never be left unmanaged.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: a review of diagnosis, investigation and management [^113qL1qP]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common form of anaemia worldwide. In men and postmenopausal women the commonest cause of IDA is blood loss from lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, making it a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Causes of IDA relate either to blood loss or iron malabsorption. After confirmation with laboratory tests, gastrointestinal evaluation is almost always indicated to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy. Specific patient groups such as premenopausal women, patients with low-normal ferritin and iron-deficient patients without anaemia may need an individualized approach. A small proportion of patients have recurrent or persistent IDA despite negative standard endoscopies. These patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding usually require evaluation of the small bowel with capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy. Treatment should involve prompt iron replacement plus diagnostic steps directed towards correcting the underlying cause of IDA. Oral iron replacement is cheap and effective, but parenteral (intravenous) therapy may be required due to intolerance, noncompliance or treatment failure with oral therapy.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^114M6UDR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^112Vtput]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^1136D9zS]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

These results confirm that anaemia, as defined by the WHO criteria, is common in older people, affecting 1 in every 7 or 8 over-65s living in the community. Even using more stringent definitions of haemoglobin less than 120 g/L or 110 g/L, anaemia affects 1 in 12 to 1 in 15 older people in the community. In nursing homes, or in older people admitted to hospital, anaemia will be even more common, affecting almost 1 in 2. Higher prevalence occurs at greater age, and in black people.

These broad assertions have limitations. Firstly we have chosen to use the WHO criteria for defining anaemia because they are the most commonly reported. Threshold values are to some extent arbitrary, and WHO values are in the range of haemoglobin levels where the number of individuals captured changes rapidly. Choosing slightly different thresholds can considerably alter the number defined as anaemic. While we recognise the limitations of using thresholds, we have used WHO criteria because that is what is reported in the literature and because they do appear to be relevant, correlating with clinical outcomes.

We know, furthermore, that electronic searching for observational studies identifies fewer than half of studies, so that other methods have to be employed. While we examined bibliographies extensively, it is likely that some information was not identified by our searches. Though we limited our inclusion criteria to studies with at least 100 individuals, Table 1 demonstrates that small studies contributed little to the overall numbers, which were dominated by five studies of more than 5,000 individuals. Overall there was information on prevalence for almost 86,000 individuals, over 60% of whom were in these large studies. This justifies excluding prevalence studies with fewer than 100 subjects; non-inclusion of even 100 trials with fewer than 100 subjects would have contributed a maximum of 10% more to the total, and we found that 50% of the studies included with the smallest numbers actually contributed 8% to the total.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112s5t2z]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Iron deficiency is the leading cause of anemia during pregnancy. According to survey data from 1999 to 2006, overall estimated prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy is near 18% and increases across the 3 trimesters of pregnancy (from 6.9% to 14.3% to 28.4%). An estimated 5% of pregnant persons have iron deficiency anemia.

Objective

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with and without anemia on maternal and infant health outcomes in asymptomatic pregnant persons.

Population

Asymptomatic pregnant adolescents and adults.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined. The USPSTF also concludes that the current evidence is insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms of iron supplementation in asymptomatic pregnant persons on maternal and infant health outcomes cannot be determined.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in pregnant persons to prevent adverse maternal and infant health outcomes.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^113UYAze]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### How I treat renal anemia [^1148K2kY]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication of kidney disease. When severe, it causes symptoms that can be debilitating. The course of anemia tends to track the decline in kidney function, with prevalence increasing in more advanced disease. Although the most common cause is relative erythropoietin deficiency, other factors such as reduced iron availability contribute to the pathobiology. In this review, we use cases to explore the surprising complexity of decision-making in management of renal anemia.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^112sB6Gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^117SD2fW]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

In general, haemoglobin levels are lower in older than in younger people. The reasons for this are not completely understood. It is unclear whether haemoglobin falls in older people because this is a feature of normal ageing, or whether it is always pathological, even if underlying conditions cannot be identified. In an individual patient it may be that some decline in haemoglobin occurs as part of normal ageing, but that disease may also contribute to the development of anaemia.

Anaemia of chronic disease, or anaemia of chronic inflammation, is the term associated with some chronic medical conditions, such as chronic renal disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Older people who suffer such chronic conditions might be expected to be anaemic, just as younger patients are. However, it is not always appreciated that older patients who suffer other medical problems, for example cognitive impairment, have a worse prognosis if they are also anaemic. It is not surprising that anaemia is associated with heart failure or myocardial infarction or death, but the reasons underlying the association between anaemia and other morbidity are less tangible.

We report on the prevalence of anaemia in cohorts of older people in the general population.

### Molecular basis of inherited microcytic anemia due to defects in iron acquisition or heme synthesis [^1165NARa]. Haematologica (2009). Low credibility.

Microcytic anemia is the most commonly encountered anemia in general medical practice. Nutritional iron deficiency and beta thalassemia trait are the primary causes in pediatrics, whereas bleeding disorders and anemia of chronic disease are common in adulthood. Microcytic hypochromic anemia can result from a defect in globin genes, in heme synthesis, in iron availability or in iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These microcytic anemia can be sideroblastic or not, a trait which reflects the implications of different gene abnormalities. Iron is a trace element that may act as a redox component and therefore is integral to vital biological processes that require the transfer of electrons as in oxygen transport, oxidative phosphorylation, DNA biosynthesis and xenobiotic metabolism. However, it can also be pro-oxidant and to avoid its toxicity, iron metabolism is strictly controlled and failure of these control systems could induce iron overload or iron deficient anemia. During the past few years, several new discoveries mostly arising from human patients or mouse models have highlighted the implication of iron metabolism components in hereditary microcytic anemia, from intestinal absorption to its final inclusion into heme. In this paper we will review the new information available on the iron acquisition pathway by developing erythrocytes and its regulation, and we will consider only inherited microcytosis due to heme synthesis or to iron metabolism defects. This information could be useful in the diagnosis and classification of these microcytic anemias.

### Is there an established hemoglobin target range for patients undergoing chronic dialysis? [^111JNYV2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) remains a common approach in managing anemia of CKD. The 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in CKD suggests avoiding ESA therapy use to maintain Hb level above 11.5 g/dL. However, optimal Hb target range in adult patients undergoing chronic dialysis remains unknown. Clinical studies suggest risks associated with normalization of Hb levels in adult patients with CKD. In this article, we briefly review some of these studies and the concerns associated with higher Hb targets in this patient population. We also suggest a target Hb range for adult chronic dialysis patients receiving ESAs. It is currently undetermined if this target Hb range would apply to newer agents that are being studied for anemia management in this population.

### Diagnosis and management of anaemia of chronic disease: current status [^112ekgeq]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia of chronic disease is the second most common form of anaemia worldwide, and is seen in a variety of inflammatory, infective and malignant diseases. Functional iron deficiency is fundamental to the pathogenesis of the anaemia, and the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role. Diagnosis may be difficult, but new automated red cell indices, algorithms for detection of functional iron deficiency, and assays for hepcidin levels are being developed. Management of the causative disease process will usually improve haemoglobin levels, but where this is not possible, erythropoietic stimulating agents are often used, although there are still concerns about potential adverse effects, especially thromboembolism. There is increasing evidence that supplemental iron given parenterally can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Inhibitors of hepcidin, and various inflammatory modulators show promise for the future.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^116yAa5W]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) present the official recommendations and highlight epidemiology, physiology, and evaluation considerations. U.S. epidemiology is detailed: In the United States in 1999–2000, 2% of men aged 16–69 years, 12% of women aged 12–49 years, and 9% of women aged 50–69 years were iron deficient, and 4% of women aged 20–49 years and 3% of women aged 50–69 years had IDA. The overall prevalence of IDA in North America in 2010 was estimated at 2.9%. Iron physiology notes that the normal total body iron content varies between 300 and 1,000 g and that about 1–2 mg of iron is lost daily through desquamation of skin and enteric cells or through minor blood loss. Gastrointestinal malignancy is the most serious potential cause, and in most adults without an obvious source of blood loss, evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract for a source of chronic blood loss or malabsorptive process is indicated. There is significant practice variability in the initial gastrointestinal evaluation of IDA. The next update for these guidelines is anticipated 3 years from publication (2023).

### Prevalence of anaemia in older persons: systematic review [^116zv3rT]. BMC Geriatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ageing populations will impact on healthcare provision, especially since extra years are not necessarily spent in good health. It is important to identify and understand the significance of common medical problems in older people. Anaemia may be one such problem. We report on the prevalence of anaemia in cohorts of elderly people in the general population. The presence of anaemia is associated with a worse prognosis for both morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Electronic searching and reference lists of published reports were used to identify studies that reported on prevalence of anaemia in cohorts of at least 100 individuals predominantly aged 65 years and over living in developed countries, together with criteria used to define anaemia. Studies of anaemia prevalence in specific disease groups or published before 1980 were excluded. Prevalence data for the entire cohort, for men and women separately and for different age bands were extracted.

Results

Forty-five studies contributed data. Thirty-four studies (n = 85,409) used WHO criteria to define anaemia. The weighted mean prevalence was 17% (3–50%) overall, and 12% (3–25%) in studies based in the community (27, n = 69,975), 47% (31–50%) in nursing homes (3, n = 1481), and 40% (40–72%) in hospital admissions (4, n = 13,953). Anaemia prevalence increased with age, was slightly higher in men than women, and was higher in black people than white. Most individuals classified as anaemic using WHO criteria were only mildly anaemic.

Conclusion

Anaemia, as defined by WHO criteria, is common in older people living in the community and particularly common in nursing home residents and hospital admissions. Predicted demographic changes underline the need to understand more about anaemia in older people.

### Anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age in low-and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2018 [^112WHdxv]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Main

Anemia occurs when the number of healthy red blood cells is insufficient to meet the body's physiological needs for oxygen delivery to the brain, heart, muscles and other vital tissues. Hemoglobin is the primary oxygen-carrying molecule within red blood cells, so anemia is most typically measured in terms of hemoglobin content of the blood rather than red blood cell volume. Anemia can reduce cognitive and physical capacities and is associated with reduced economic productivity, and increased morbidity and all-cause mortality. Maternal iron deficiency can lead to adverse pregnancy and newborn outcomes, including stillbirth, low birth weight and infant mortality, and anemia in pregnancy has been suggested as a potential marker of increased risk of major hemorrhageand a risk factor for maternal death.

Causes of anemia can be divided into three non-mutually exclusive pathways: blood loss, increased red blood cell destruction and inadequate red blood cell production. Blood loss can be acute due to events such as injuries, maternal hemorrhage or surgery, or it can be chronic, due to conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders, helminthic infections, bleeding disorders or abnormal uterine bleeding. Increased red blood cell destruction happens either as a consequence of abnormal red blood cell structure, such as in thalassaemia or sickle cell disease, or because of external mechanical, immune or infectious factors. Inadequate production of red blood cells can happen when the bone marrow itself is depressed, such as in HIVor some malignancies; because there are hormonal imbalances, such as with chronic inflammation; or due to increased demand (such as during pregnancy), nutrient malabsorption or inadequate supply of red blood cell building blocks, such as protein, iron, vitamin A, folate or vitamin B-12 (ref.) Iron deficiency is often thought of as the most common cause of anemia, which is true but also misleading, because absolute and/or functional iron deficiency can arise as a consequence of any of the three pathways and, therefore, as a consequence of multiple different causes. Women of reproductive age (WRA; ages 15–49 years) are at particularly increased risk of iron deficiency and, therefore, anemia, compared to men, due to physiological changes such as menstruation (blood loss pathway), pregnancy (inadequate production pathway due to increased demand) and bleeding in childbirth. Additionally, unequal household food allocation can make WRA vulnerable to anemia as they might not have access to iron-rich foods.

### Association of anemia with mobility capacity in older adults: a Korean nationwide population-based cross-sectional study [^11413Z8v]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common condition in older adults and is due to multiple factors. Over 10% of adults aged ≥ 65 years have anemia, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Anemia is caused by nutritional deficiency in one third of these individuals, by chronic illness, including renal insufficiency, in another third, and by undetermined factors in another third. Anemia in older adults is associated with various negative health outcomes, including reduced quality of life, depressive mood and fatigue, falls, frailty, impairment in ADL, cognitive impairment, and increased mortality.

Anemia may reduce muscle oxygenation, consequently affecting muscle strength and quality and, therefore, physical performance including mobility capacity. Given the importance of physical performance for health outcomes and quality of life in older adults, and the fact that anemia is both common in older adults and easily discovered in the usual primary care setting, it is important to examine the association between anemia and physical performance. Studies assessing the association between functional decline in mobility and anemia in older adults have shown that anemia is associated with impaired standing balance, slower gait speed, slower chair standing, decreased muscle strength including, handgrip and knee extensor strengths, and multidimensional loss of function.

Anemia is an enormous problem worldwide that is worse in the developing countries but by no means lacking in developed countries. Women and children are disproportionately affected. Nutritional anemias, mainly caused by a lack of iron and folate, are largely correctable by dietary improvement, but this socioeconomic change may not be readily achieved. The inherited disorders, the hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias, in their heterozygous forms are beneficial to the affected populations. Prevention of the homozygous forms and the serious diseases that result can only be addressed by education. These conditions are seen in all types of medical practice ranging from neonatology to geriatrics and public health and are an ongoing concern to all physicians.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^111wbP4h]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm³ (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^112oTzg6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

Anemia in COPD is frequent with a reported prevalence of 7.5% to 34%, and people with COPD and anemia are generally older with more frequent cardiometabolic comorbidities, greater dyspnea, worse quality of life and airflow obstruction, reduced exercise capacity, an increased risk of severe exacerbations and higher mortality. Anemia due to chronic disease is the most common type seen in COPD, followed by iron deficiency anemia, and is mainly related to chronic systemic inflammation and impaired iron utilization, and other possible reversible factors should be investigated including use of long-term oxygen, theophylline, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor inhibitors, renal dysfunction, and androgens. Although anemia has been established as an important comorbidity in COPD, optimal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in these patients have not yet been defined, and it is also unclear whether its correction alters outcomes; however, hemoglobin assessment is advisable, particularly in more severely affected patients, and if anemia is diagnosed, a systematic search for a treatable cause is recommended in accordance with appropriate clinical guidelines.

### How I approach iron deficiency with and without anemia [^111AjXVY]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia remains a common referral to the pediatric hematology-oncology subspecialist. Improved understanding of iron homeostasis, including the effects of the regulatory hormone hepcidin, recent adult and pediatric clinical trial data, as well as the availability of safer formulations of intravenous iron, have resulted in additional considerations when making treatment recommendations in such patients. Young children and adolescent females remain the most commonly affected groups, but children with complex medical or chronic inflammatory conditions including comorbid gastrointestinal disorders also require special consideration.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to patients with comorbidities, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- functional iron deficiency is a common contributory factor to the anemia associated with advanced CKD

- IDA is a common manifestation of IBD, particularly when the disease is active

- iron deficiency is common in chronic HF and is often multifactorial.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

### Anemia of inflammation [^117Bn4Sx]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia of inflammation (AI, also called anemia of chronic disease) is a common, typically normocytic, normochromic anemia that is caused by an underlying inflammatory disease. It is diagnosed when serum iron concentrations are low despite adequate iron stores, as evidenced by serum ferritin that is not low. In the setting of inflammation, it may be difficult to differentiate AI from iron deficiency anemia, and the 2 conditions may coexist. Treatment should focus on the underlying disease. Recent advances in molecular understanding of AI are stimulating the development of new pathophysiologically targeted experimental therapies.

### Unexplained anemia of aging: etiology, health consequences, and diagnostic criteria [^114ndj5Z]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES OF MILD ANEMIA

These studies demonstrate that anemia is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality in older men and women. It is important to note that these risks are also present for patients on the mild end of the anemia spectrum. Awareness of these clinical consequences is particularly important because of the high prevalence of mild anemia among patients with anemia. The vast majority of UAA cases (91.7%) are classified as mild (Hb ≥ 10 g/dl), with most patients presenting with hypoproliferative anemia with normocytic indices. Moreover, the proportion of patients with anemia that can be classified as mild (Hb ≥ 10 g/dl) increases with age (Figure 1).

Relative to age‐matched nonanemic people, patients with mild anemia experience declines in mobility and physical performance. Moreover, mild anemia is prospectively associated with clinically relevant outcomes such as risk of hospitalization and all‐cause mortality(Table 3). Mortality increases steadily as Hb declines: in women over 65, Hb of 11 g/dl is associated with significantly greater mortality than the low‐normal WHO cutoff of 12 g/dl; conversely, women with Hb of 14 g/dl experienced a 24% reduction in mortality relative to patients below the cutoff. The significant differences in mortality risk among people near the threshold for anemia diagnosis strongly implies that the overall health consequences of anemia cannot be attributed to individuals with severely low Hb.

TABLE 3
Mild anemia increases hospitalization and mortality

Among both male and female participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, baseline Hb status was strongly associated with health‐related outcomes, and a decrease in Hb over 3 years was associated with decline in cognitive function. The authors concluded that reduced blood Hb was present in many older patients who were at elevated risk for adverse outcomes but who would not have been identified as anemic according to the WHO criteria.

Together, these associations with poor clinical outcomes indicate that mild anemia should receive clinical attention rather than simply being considered a normal part of aging.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1149vZHG]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^115BAdNV]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale for clinical practice guidelines for anaemia of CKD

Guideline 1.1 - Evaluation of chronic anaemia - Screening for anaemia

We suggest that haemoglobin (Hb) levels should be routinely measured to screen for anaemia:

At least annually in people with CKD G3
At least twice a year in people with CKD G4–5 not on kidney replacement therapy (2B)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Guideline 1.2 - Evaluation of anaemia - Haemoglobin level

We recommend that all people with chronic anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease should be investigated for the cause and possible treatment, irrespective of the grade of kidney disease or requirement for kidney replacement therapy if:

Their haemoglobin (Hb) levels are less than 110 g/L (less than 105 g/L if younger than 2 years), or they develop symptoms attributable to anaemia. This is to ensure the correct diagnosis and management of anaemia. (1 A)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Guideline 1.3 - Evaluation of anaemia - Kidney function

We suggest that CKD should be considered as a possible cause of anaemia when the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is < 60 ml/min/1.73m². It is more likely to be the cause if the GFR is < 30 ml/min/1.73m² (< 45 ml/min/ 1.73m² in people with diabetes) and no other cause, e.g. blood loss, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, is identified. (2B)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

Guideline 1.4 - Evaluation of anaemia - Erythropoietin measurement

We recommend that measurement of erythropoietin levels should NOT routinely be considered for the diagnosis or management of anaemia for people with CKD. (1 A)

Rationale

Please see 2017 clinical practice guidelines for rationale, no significant change since then.

### New onset pancytopenia in adults: a review of underlying pathologies and their associated clinical and laboratory findings [^111M66xJ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Abstract Pancytopenia is regularly encountered in hematology practice, yet there exist few published assessments of the frequencies of various etiologies, and these frequencies exhibit substantial geographic variation. We reviewed bone marrow specimens from pancytopenic adults to determine the most common etiologies and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Of 132 patients with no history of hematolymphoid neoplasia, no prior bone marrow study for pancytopenia and no recent cytotoxic chemotherapy, 64% had clonal hematopoietic disorders. Most common were myeloid processes: 26% of patients had acute myeloid leukemia, and 17% had myelodysplasia. Less common were lymphoid neoplasms such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (6%), hairy cell leukemia (5%) and precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4%). Among non-clonal cases, the most common specific diagnoses were aplastic anemia (5%), megaloblastic anemia (2%) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related changes (2%). Clonal diagnoses were associated with more severe cytopenias than non-clonal cases. Circulating nucleated erythroid precursors, immature granulocytes and blasts were seen more frequently in clonal cases. Nearly two-thirds of cases of new onset pancytopenia in adults in our North American practice setting have a clonal etiology, with myeloid neoplasms being most common. Blood counts and peripheral smear findings can provide insights into the likelihood of a clonal etiology.

### The science and practice of micronutrient supplementations in nutritional anemia: an evidence-based review [^113gMevi]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Nutritional anemia is the most common type of anemia, affecting millions of people in all age groups worldwide. While inadequate access to food and nutrients can lead to anemia, patients with certain health status or medical conditions are also at increased risk of developing nutritional anemia. Iron, cobalamin, and folate are the most recognized micronutrients that are vital for the generation of erythrocytes. Iron deficiency is associated with insufficient production of hemoglobin. Deficiency of cobalamin or folate leads to impaired synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid, proteins, and cell division. Recent research has demonstrated that the status of copper and zinc in the body can significantly affect iron absorption and utilization. With an increasing number of patients undergoing bariatric surgical procedures, more cases of anemia associated with copper and zinc deficiencies have also emerged. The intestinal absorption of these 5 critical micronutrients are highly regulated and mediated by specific apical transport mechanisms in the enterocytes. Health conditions that persistently alter the histology of the upper intestinal architecture, expression, or function of these substrate-specific transporters, or the normal digestion and flow of these key micronutrients, can lead to nutritional anemia. The focus of this article is to review the science of intestinal micronutrient absorption, discuss the clinical assessment of micronutrient deficiencies in relation to anemia, and suggest an effective treatment plan and monitoring strategies using an evidence-based approach.

### Erythropoietin plus iron versus control treatment including placebo or iron for preoperative anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^117PBVBw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 30% of adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery suffer from preoperative anaemia. Preoperative anaemia is a risk factor for mortality and adverse outcomes in different surgical specialties and is frequently the reason for blood transfusion. The most common causes are renal, chronic diseases, and iron deficiency. International guidelines recommend that the cause of anaemia guide preoperative anaemia treatment. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) with iron supplementation has frequently been used to increase preoperative haemoglobin concentrations in patients in order to avoid the need for perioperative allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative rHuEPO therapy (subcutaneous or parenteral) with iron (enteral or parenteral) in reducing the need for allogeneic RBC transfusions in preoperatively anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid Embase, ISI Web of Science: SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S, and clinical trial registries WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov on 29 August 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared preoperative rHuEPO + iron therapy to control treatment (placebo, no treatment, or standard of care with or without iron) for preoperatively anaemic adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery. We used the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of anaemia: haemoglobin concentration (g/dL) less than 13 g/dL for males, and 12 g/dL for non-pregnant females (decision of inclusion based on mean haemoglobin concentration). We defined two subgroups of rHuEPO dosage: 'low' for 150 to 300 international units (IU)/kg body weight, and 'high' for 500 to 600 IU/kg body weight.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected data from the included studies. Our primary outcome was the need for RBC transfusion (no autologous transfusion, fresh frozen plasma or platelets), measured in transfused participants during surgery (intraoperative) and up to five days after surgery. Secondary outcomes of interest were: haemoglobin concentration (directly before surgery), number of RBC units (where one unit contains 250 to 450 mL) transfused per participant (intraoperative and up to five days after surgery), mortality (within 30 days after surgery), length of hospital stay, and adverse events (e.g. renal dysfunction, thromboembolism, hypertension, allergic reaction, headache, fever, constipation).

Main Results

Most of the included trials were in orthopaedic, gastrointestinal, and gynaecological surgery and included participants with mild and moderate preoperative anaemia (haemoglobin from 10 to 12 g/dL). The duration of preoperative rHuEPO treatment varied across the trials, ranging from once a week to daily or a 5-to-10-day period, and in one trial preoperative rHuEPO was given on the morning of surgery and for five days postoperatively. We included 12 trials (participants = 1880) in the quantitative analysis of the need for RBC transfusion following preoperative treatment with rHuEPO + iron to correct preoperative anaemia in non-cardiac surgery; two studies were multiarmed trials with two different dose regimens. Preoperative rHuEPO + iron given to anaemic adults reduced the need RBC transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.80; participants = 1880; studies = 12; I² = 84%; moderate-quality evidence due to inconsistency). This analysis suggests that on average, the combined administration of rHuEPO + iron will mean 231 fewer individuals will need transfusion for every 1000 individuals compared to the control group. Preoperative high-dose rHuEPO + iron given to anaemic adults increased the haemoglobin concentration (mean difference (MD) 1.87 g/dL, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.49; participants = 852; studies = 3; I² = 89%; low-quality evidence due to inconsistency and risk of bias) but not low-dose rHuEPO + iron (MD 0.11 g/dL, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.69; participants = 334; studies = 4; I² = 69%; low-quality evidence due to inconsistency and risk of bias). There was probably little or no difference in the number of RBC units when rHuEPO + iron was given preoperatively (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.05; participants = 1420; studies = 6; I² = 2%; moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision). There was probably little or no difference in the risk of mortality within 30 days of surgery (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.63; participants = 230; studies = 2; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision) or of adverse events including local rash, fever, constipation, or transient hypertension (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28; participants = 1722; studies = 10; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence due to imprecision). The administration of rHuEPO + iron before non-cardiac surgery did not clearly reduce the length of hospital stay of preoperative anaemic adults (MD -1.07, 95% CI -4.12 to 1.98; participants = 293; studies = 3; I² = 87%; low-quality evidence due to inconsistency and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests that preoperative rHuEPO + iron therapy for anaemic adults prior to non-cardiac surgery reduces the need for RBC transfusion and, when given at higher doses, increases the haemoglobin concentration preoperatively. The administration of rHuEPO + iron treatment did not decrease the mean number of units of RBC transfused per patient. There were no important differences in the risk of adverse events or mortality within 30 days, nor in length of hospital stay. Further, well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required to estimate the impact of this combined treatment more precisely.

### Absolute and functional iron deficiency in the US, 2017–2020 [^112kTtQT]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron plays an important role in many biological functions. Absolute iron deficiency results from a severe reduction or absence of iron stores. Functional iron deficiency occurs in the presence of adequate iron stores but insufficient iron availability (thus, it is not a true deficiency of body stores). Although most research has focused on adverse outcomes among people with iron deficiency and anemia, iron deficiency affects nonerythropoietic tissue, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, in the absence of anemia. Iron deficiency has been associated with restless leg syndrome, decreased physical capacity, impaired neurocognitive function, heart failure, all-cause mortality, and other adverse outcomes independent of anemia.

Infants and children, people of childbearing potential, and people with certain conditions, such as anemia, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure, have high rates of iron deficiency. The prevalence of iron deficiency outside these groups and the potential underlying causes remain unclear. Moreover, the prevalence of functional iron deficiency has not been determined. Iron deficiency can be prevented or treated through dietary interventions or nonprescription iron supplements, but the current use of nonprescription iron supplements and dietary iron intake and iron deficiency prevalence have not been studied. These estimates are needed to identify populations at risk of iron deficiency–related adverse outcomes, inform screening recommendations, and establish research priorities. We estimated the prevalence of absolute and functional iron deficiency and iron supplement use in the US from 2017 to 2020 across age, sex, and comorbidity categories.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^113N8GG9]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease

Anaemia is a frequent complication of CKD. CKD is a potential cause for anaemia in anyone with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m 2. As the prevalence of anaemia increases with deteriorating renal function, CKD is especially likely to be the cause of anaemia when the GFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73m². The investigation and management of anaemia in CKD is a complex area, and readers are advised to consult specific guidelines relevant to UK practice published by NICE and the Renal association for more detailed recommendations.

The causes are anaemia in CKD are multifactorial. Iron deficiency is a major element, but multiple other mechanisms (eg, haemolysis, plasma cell dyscrasias) may also contribute towards the development of anaemia, hence the requirement for detailed haematological investigation. The causes of iron deficiency in CKD are also multifactorial. Renal failure itself contributes, but this may also be compounded by reduced iron intake, reduced iron absorption and blood loss via either the GI tract or other routes such as dialysis and phlebotomy.

Assessment of iron deficiency in CKD can be difficult. Measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation may be helpful, but the interpretation of results is not the same as in patients who do not have CKD. Specifically, absolute iron deficiency in CKD has been defined as transferrin saturation ≤ 20%, with SF ≤ 100 µg/L (in predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients) or ≤ 200 µg/L (in haemodialysis patients).

Patients with CKD may of course also have GI pathology underlying their confirmed iron deficiency. The decision about the need for endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract in CKD can be difficult, and should ideally be made in conjunction with a nephrologist. However, the majority of CKD patients with confirmed IDA warrant GI investigation as long as they are fit enough to undergo these procedures.

The management of iron deficiency in the context of CKD is beyond the scope of these guidelines and is discussed in detail elsewhere. Treatment is usually initiated and monitored by the nephrology team. In brief, oral iron replacement may be tried in patients who are predialysis. However, intravenous IRT is required if this is not tolerated or ineffective, or if dialysis has been commenced. Other treatments for anaemia such as erythropoietin may also be needed, but these should be managed by the nephrology team.

### Anemia at the end of life: prevalence, significance, and causes in patients receiving palliative care [^114wk9Si]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

While data exist on the prevalence and causes of anemia in defined groups of the elderly, information on palliative care patients is limited. Compared to actively treated oncology patients, for whom anemia treatment has demonstrated improved quality of life and symptom alleviation, studies of treatment outcomes in palliative care patients are limited. Knowledge of the extent and causes of anemia in palliative care patients is needed, as correction of anemia in these patients could potentially improve their physical, emotional, and cognitive functioning. In the present study, clinical data and blood test results of 105 patients meeting specific eligibility criteria were examined to estimate the prevalence of anemia and investigate its causes. Ninety-five (90.5%) patients had advanced cancer. Based on World Health Organization criteria, anemia was found in 77% of men (Hb < 130 g/l) and 68.2% of women (Hb < 120 g/l). The diagnosis was anemia of chronic disease in 76.7% of women and 46.8% of men. Patients with prostate cancer had a significantly lower mean Hb level (P = 0.007) and more evidence of bone metastases (P = 0.0007) than those with other cancers. Neutrophil hypersegmentation, suggesting occult folate deficiency, was present in 28.6% of patients, being more common in those with major weight loss (58.3%) than those with moderate (37%) or mild/no weight loss (26%) (P = 0.019). The findings suggest that anemia is highly prevalent in the palliative care setting. Although anemia of chronic disease is most common, occult folate deficiency may be more prevalent than previously suspected. The findings suggest that a low serum folate level is an insensitive marker of occult folate deficiency. A randomized controlled trial of folic acid treatment is proposed.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline and clinical practice recommendations for anemia in chronic kidney disease: 2007 update of hemoglobin target [^115oVjDG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI anemia — study quality grading (Table 14) classifies individual studies as A, B, or C. Category A is described as, "Least bias; results are valid. A study that mostly adheres to the commonly held concepts of high quality, including the following: a formal study; clear description of the population and setting; clear description of an appropriate reference standard; proper measurement techniques; appropriate statistical and analytic methods; no reporting errors; and no obvious bias". Category B is "Susceptible to some bias, but not sufficient to invalidate the results. A study that does not meet all the criteria in category above. It has some deficiencies but none likely to cause major bias". Category C is "Significant bias that may invalidate the results. A study with serious errors in design or reporting. These studies may have large amounts of missing information or discrepancies in reporting".

### Anemia and anemia correction: surrogate markers or causes of morbidity in chronic kidney disease? [^112UTSei]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Observational studies have shown a strong positive correlation between the severity of anemia and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This observation was initially taken to imply that adverse outcomes in CKD are caused by anemia. However, the assumption of causality ignores the possibility that anemia and adverse outcomes might be unrelated and that both are caused by underlying inflammation, oxidative stress and comorbid conditions. Randomized clinical trials of anemia correction have revealed an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients assigned to normal, rather than subnormal, hemoglobin targets. As a result, correction of anemia is now considered potentially hazardous in patients with CKD. Notably, individuals who did not reach the target hemoglobin level in the clinical trials, despite receiving high doses of erythropoietin and iron, experienced a disproportionately large share of the adverse outcomes. These observations point to overdose of erythropoietin and iron, rather than anemia correction per se, as the likely culprit. This Review explores the reasons for the apparent contradiction between the findings of observational studies and randomized clinical trials of anemia treatment in CKD. I have focused on data from basic and translational studies, which are often overlooked in the design and interpretation of clinical studies and in the formulation of clinical guidelines.

### Anemia in children with chronic kidney disease [^112jXAo9]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Anemia is a common comorbidity in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This condition is associated with multiple adverse clinical consequences and its management is a core component of nephrology care. Increased morbidity and mortality, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and decreased quality of life have been associated with anemia of CKD in children. Although numerous complex factors interact in the development of this anemia, erythropoietin deficiency and iron dysregulation (including iron deficiency and iron-restricted erythropoiesis) are the primary causes. In addition to iron supplementation, erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) can effectively treat this anemia, but there are important differences in ESA dose requirements between children and adults. Also, hyporesponsiveness to ESA therapy is a common problem in children with CKD. Although escalating ESA doses to target increased hemoglobin values in adults has been associated with adverse outcomes, no studies have demonstrated this association in children. The question of appropriate target hemoglobin levels in children, and the approach by which to achieve these levels, remains under debate. Randomized, controlled studies are needed to evaluate whether normalization of hemoglobin concentrations is beneficial to children, and whether this practice is associated with increased risks.

Lay summary

Anaemia is a commonly diagnosed complication among people suffering with chronic kidney disease. If left untreated, it may affect quality of life. There are several causes for anaemia in this population. As the kidney function deteriorates, together with medications and dietary restrictions, people with chronic kidney disease may develop iron deficiency, resulting in reduction of iron supply to the bone marrow (which is the body organ responsible for the production of different blood elements). People with chronic kidney disease may not be able to use their own body's iron stores well and hence, many people, particularly those receiving haemodialysis, may need additional iron treatment, usually provided by injection.

With further weakening of kidney function, people with chronic kidney disease may need additional treatment with a substance called erythropoietin which drives the bone marrow to produce its own blood. This substance, which is naturally produced by the kidneys, becomes relatively deficient in people with chronic kidney disease. These people will eventually need treatment with erythropoietin or similar products that are given by injection.

Over the last few years, several iron and erythropoietin products (synthetic products and those stimulating the body's own erythropoietin) have been licensed for treating anaemia in people with chronic kidney disease. In addition, several publications discussed the benefits of each treatment and possible risks associated with long term treatment. The current guidelines provide advice to health care professionals on how to screen people with chronic kidney disease for anaemia, which people to investigate for other causes of anaemia, when and how to treat people with different medications, how to ensure safe prescribing and monitoring of treatment and how to diagnose and manage complications associated with anaemia and the drugs used for its treatment.

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^114hvtVQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia usually vary between men and women, although this distinction has been challenged. Thresholds can also vary in children and during pregnancy. Haemoglobin concentrations can be lower in African, or Asian populations, but it is unclear whether this discrepancy reflects clinically significant genetic conditions affecting red cells, undefined clinical illnesses, or a different underlying baseline driven by non-clinical genetic variation.

WHO has recognised the need for further evidence for haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia, including the influence of genetic factors (both carrier states for rare genetic conditions such as thalassaemias and haemoglobinopathies, and the role of genetics in overall variation), in order to update global guidelines. Here, we present an analysis utilising multiple large-scale datasets in ethnically diverse populations that included sufficiently detailed clinical and laboratory parameters to enable post-hoc assembly of reference populations of healthy individuals without discernible risk factors for anaemia, in which the fifth centile of haemoglobin distribution can be estimated across the lifecycle. Additionally, we summarised ancestry-specific allele frequencies and effects on haemoglobin concentrations of genetic polymorphisms and structural variants identified through existing large-scale, multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We aimed to provide a rationale for a set of thresholds that can be applied globally for clinical and population use.

### Iron therapy for preoperative anaemia [^1122uQn3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative anaemia is common and occurs in 5% to 76% of patients preoperatively. It is associated with an increased risk of perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion, longer hospital stay, and increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of anaemia. Oral and intravenous iron therapy can be used to treat anaemia. Parenteral iron preparations have been shown to be more effective in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure and postpartum haemorrhage due to rapid correction of iron stores. A limited number of studies has investigated iron therapy for the treatment of preoperative anaemia. The aim of this Cochrane Review is to summarise the evidence for iron supplementation, both enteral and parenteral, for the management of preoperative anaemia.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of preoperative iron therapy (enteral or parenteral) in reducing the need for allogeneic blood transfusions in anaemic patients undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

We ran the search on 30 July 2018. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic and Embase (Ovid), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), PubMed, and clinical trials registries, and we screened reference lists. We ran a top-up search on 28 November 2019; one study is now awaiting classification.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared preoperative iron monotherapy to placebo, no treatment, standard care or another form of iron therapy for anaemic adults undergoing surgery. We defined anaemia as haemoglobin values less than 13 g/dL for males and 12 g/dL for non-pregnant females.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors collected data and a third review author checked all collected data. Data were collected on the proportion of patients who receive a blood transfusion, the amount of blood transfused per patient (units), quality of life, ferritin levels and haemoglobin levels, measured as continuous variables at the following predetermined time points: pretreatment (baseline), preoperatively but postintervention, and postoperatively. We performed statistical analysis using the Cochrane software, Review Manager 5. We summarised outcome data in tables and forest plots. We used the GRADE approach to describe the quality of the body of evidence.

Main Results

Six RCTs, with a total of 372 participants, evaluated preoperative iron therapy to correct anaemia before planned surgery. Four studies compared iron therapy (either oral (one study) or intravenous (three studies)) with no treatment, placebo or usual care, and two studies compared intravenous iron therapy with oral iron therapy. Iron therapy was delivered over a range of periods that varied from 48 hours to three weeks prior to surgery. The 372 participants in our analysis fall far short of the 819 required - as calculated by our information size calculation - to detect a 30% reduction in blood transfusions. Five trials, involving 310 people, reported the proportion of participants who received allogeneic blood transfusions. Meta-analysis of iron therapy versus placebo or standard care showed no difference in the proportion of participants who received a blood transfusion (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.70; 4 studies, 200 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Only one study that compared oral versus intravenous iron therapy measured this outcome, and reported no difference in risk of transfusion between groups. There was no difference between the iron therapy and placebo/standard care groups for haemoglobin level preoperatively at the end of the intervention (mean difference (MD) 0.63 g/dL, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.34; 2 studies, 83 participants; low-quality evidence). However, intravenous iron therapy produced an increase in preoperative postintervention haemoglobin levels compared with oral iron (MD 1.23 g/dL, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.65; 2 studies, 172 participants; low-quality evidence). Ferritin levels were increased by intravenous iron, both when compared to standard care ((MD 149.00, 95% CI 25.84 to 272.16; 1 study, 63 participants; low-quality evidence) or to oral iron (MD 395.03 ng/mL, 95% CI 227.72 to 562.35; 2 studies, 151 participants; low-quality evidence). Not all studies measured quality of life, short-term mortality or postoperative morbidity. Some measured the outcomes, but did not report the data, and the studies which did report the data were underpowered. Therefore, uncertainty remains regarding these outcomes. The inclusion of new research in the future is very likely to change these results.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of iron therapy for preoperative anaemia does not show a clinically significant reduction in the proportion of trial participants who received an allogeneic blood transfusion compared to no iron therapy. Results for intravenous iron are consistent with a greater increase in haemoglobin and ferritin when compared to oral iron, but do not provide reliable evidence. These conclusions are drawn from six studies, three of which included very small numbers of participants. Further, well-designed, adequately powered, RCTs are required to determine the true effectiveness of iron therapy for preoperative anaemia. Two studies are currently in progress, and will include 1500 randomised participants.

### Anemia and diabetes [^113gjwAd]. American Journal of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

World Health Organization statistics identify 150 million people with diabetes mellitus worldwide and suggest that this figure may double by 2025. In countries with a western lifestyle, the number of patients admitted for renal replacement therapy with diabetes as a co-morbid condition has increased significantly up to three to four times in a period of 10 years. Diabetes and renal failure are thus tightly linked diseases, and so is anemia. However, whether anemia may be worsened and/or directly, at least in part, caused by diabetes is not clearly elucidated yet. In this article, we review the prevalence, pathophysiology and consequences of anemia in diabetic patients.
