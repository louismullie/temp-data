## Question

6 year old female, fever 103, normal lung sounds, no sore throat, normal strep, flu, covid, rsv testing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating a 6-year-old girl with isolated high fever, normal lung exam, and negative rapid testing for strep, influenza, COVID-19, and RSV. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate illness severity and whether she is "toxic" or unstable. Then, I should verify the pretest probabilities and limitations of the negative rapid tests. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis, including occult bacterial sources and atypical viral or noninfectious causes. After that, I need to outline a targeted diagnostic workup and management plan, including when to escalate to chest radiography or broader testing. Finally, I should consider special entities like MIS-C and define clear return precautions and follow-up intervals, ensuring I double-check that each step aligns with guideline-based care and the child's age and vaccination status.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and stability. A 6-year-old with fever to 103°F and an otherwise normal exam is most consistent with a viral illness, but I should not jump to conclusions because serious bacterial infection can occasionally present subtly in this age group; I need to ensure she is well-appearing, with normal perfusion, hydration, and mental status before proceeding down an outpatient pathway [^1124saku]. Hold on, I should verify that the absence of respiratory signs does not fully exclude pneumonia; in children, chest findings can be subtle, and radiographic pneumonia may be present even with a normal lung exam, so I must keep a low threshold for imaging if other risk features emerge [^1117hVcg] [^113NWVeq].

> Next, I should review the negative rapid tests and their implications. Wait, let me verify the performance characteristics and timing. Rapid antigen tests for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 have imperfect sensitivity, especially early or late in disease, and a negative result does not definitively exclude infection; molecular testing (PCR) is more sensitive, and repeating or upgrading testing can be reasonable if pretest probability is high or symptoms persist. For strep, a negative RADT in children should be backed up by culture when clinical suspicion remains, and testing is generally not recommended when viral features predominate or in children under 3 years unless risk factors exist, so a negative RADT here lowers but does not eliminate GAS pharyngitis if the history evolves [^114Md5zD] [^111vEpTV]. For RSV, routine testing is not recommended in uncomplicated bronchiolitis-like presentations, and a negative test does not exclude other viral etiologies; I should also remember that RSV circulation patterns vary and can occur off-season, so epidemiology matters [^112GBteK] [^113YajCn].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis. Most likely is a viral syndrome with isolated fever, given the normal exam and negative initial tests; common culprits include adenovirus, human coronaviruses (e.g. NL63), parainfluenza, enteroviruses, and early COVID-19, all of which can present with fever alone initially and evolve over the next 24–48 hours [^notfound] [^114HqjfC]. But wait, what if this is an occult bacterial infection? In children 2–24 months, fever without source raises concern for UTI, otitis media, or pneumonia; in a 6-year-old, UTI is less likely but still possible, especially in girls, and pneumonia without focal lung findings can occur, so I should screen for urinary symptoms, ear pain, and evolving respiratory signs before concluding "viral only" [^1124saku] [^1117hVcg]. I should also consider early viral myocarditis or pericarditis if fatigue, chest pain, or exertional intolerance emerge, and keep MIS-C on the radar if fever persists beyond several days with systemic features or laboratory evidence of inflammation, typically 2–6 weeks after COVID-19 exposure even with prior negative testing [^114HqjfC].

> Let me think about the immediate workup. I should double-check that basic outpatient labs are reasonable if fever persists beyond 48–72 hours or if the child appears ill: CBC with differential, CRP or ESR, and urinalysis with culture if urinary symptoms are present or if fever persists without a source, given the nontrivial risk of UTI even in older children and the potential to change management [^1124saku] [^1124saku]. If cough, tachypnea, hypoxia, high fever beyond 48 hours, or focal chest findings develop, I should obtain a chest radiograph because occult pneumonia is a key concern and radiography has the best yield when guided by clinical predictors in this age group [^1117hVcg] [^113NWVeq]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-ordering imaging; in a well-appearing child without respiratory signs, routine chest radiography is low yield and should be avoided [^1117hVcg].

> Next, I should review viral testing strategy. If symptoms persist or local epidemiology supports it, I should upgrade to PCR-based testing for influenza and SARS-CoV-2, and consider a multiplex respiratory panel to detect other viruses such as adenovirus, parainfluenza, or human coronaviruses; I need to ensure that testing will actually change management or counseling before ordering it [^117JZF1Y]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to repeat COVID-19 antigen testing now, but given the high false-negative rate early in disease, repeating antigen testing too soon may not help; PCR is the preferred modality if suspicion remains, and I should align repeat testing with symptom chronology and exposure risk rather than repeating antigen indiscriminately.

> I should confirm the management plan. Supportive care remains first-line: weight-based acetaminophen or ibuprofen, hydration, and close observation for new symptoms; I need to ensure caregivers know to return promptly for respiratory distress, persistent vomiting, altered mental status, rash, limb or abdominal pain, or fever beyond 5–7 days without improvement [^1124saku]. I should avoid empiric antibiotics in the absence of a bacterial source, reserving them for documented bacterial infection or clear clinical progression suggesting bacterial disease; this aligns with antimicrobial stewardship principles and reduces unnecessary treatment [^115wij95]. If influenza is confirmed and the child is high risk or severely ill, oseltamivir can be considered within 48 hours of symptom onset; otherwise, antivirals are not routinely indicated in mild, uncomplicated viral illness [^117QQUns].

> But wait, what if fever persists beyond several days with systemic features or laboratory evidence of inflammation? I need to check for MIS-C by assessing for multisystem involvement, obtaining inflammatory markers, and considering cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography if criteria are met; serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 can assist in the diagnosis of MIS-C when PCR is negative but exposure is plausible, though diagnosis remains clinical and exclusionary [^116JSLDm] [^114e8vnz]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not over-calling MIS-C; the threshold for evaluation should be lower with persistent high fever and systemic features, but alternative diagnoses must be reasonably excluded before labeling MIS-C [^116JSLDm].

> I should double-check return precautions and follow-up. Caregivers should seek urgent care for respiratory distress, persistent vomiting or dehydration, new rash, severe limb or abdominal pain, altered consciousness, or fever persisting beyond 5–7 days; a scheduled recheck within 24–48 hours is prudent if symptoms are unchanged or evolving, especially if new focal findings develop [^1124saku]. If fever persists beyond 72 hours without a source, I should reconsider the differential, repeat the exam, and escalate testing as indicated, including chest radiography and targeted labs, to avoid missing occult bacterial infection or evolving viral disease [^1124saku].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis is a viral illness with isolated high fever, but I need to ensure I do not prematurely close on that conclusion; negative rapid tests reduce but do not eliminate COVID-19, influenza, or strep, and occult bacterial sources such as UTI, otitis media, or early pneumonia remain on the table if symptoms persist or new findings arise. A stepwise approach — supportive care now, selective repeat PCR-based viral testing if symptoms persist, urinalysis if fever continues without source, and chest radiography if respiratory signs or high fever beyond 48 hours develop — balances diagnostic yield with stewardship and safety, with MIS-C in mind if fever persists with systemic features [^1124saku] [^117JZF1Y] [^113NWVeq] [^116JSLDm].

The most likely diagnosis is a **viral illness** (e.g. adenovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, or early COVID-19) given the high fever, normal lung exam, and negative strep, flu, COVID-19, and RSV tests [^1124saku]. Consider **UTI** or **occult pneumonia** if fever persists beyond 3–5 days or if new symptoms develop. Initial workup should include CBC, CRP, and urinalysis; obtain a chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms or persistent fever occur. Management is supportive with antipyretics and hydration; antibiotics are not indicated unless a bacterial source is identified. Advise close follow-up within 24–48 hours if fever persists or new symptoms arise.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Viral infections

- **Adenovirus or enterovirus**: Can cause high fever with minimal respiratory symptoms and normal lung exam [^notfound].
- **Human metapneumovirus**: Presents with fever and mild respiratory symptoms; may not be detected on standard panels.
- **Early COVID-19**: Can present with isolated fever before other symptoms; initial tests may be falsely negative [^1159xWio] [^111WcKBv].

---

### Bacterial infections

- **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: Common in children with fever without localizing signs; consider urinalysis and culture [^116JKXz2].
- **Occult pneumonia**: Normal lung exam does not exclude pneumonia; consider chest radiograph if fever persists or respiratory symptoms develop [^113NWVeq].
- **Bacteremia**: Rare but serious; consider if fever persists beyond 3–5 days without a source.

---

### Other considerations

Other considerations include **MIS-C**, which presents 2–6 weeks after COVID-19 with persistent fever and multisystem involvement; this child lacks the typical features at present [^114HqjfC]. Drug fever is unlikely without recent medication exposure.

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| CBC, CRP | Routine | Assess for infection/inflammation |
| Urinalysis, urine culture | Fever ≥ 48 hours without source | Evaluate for UTI [^116JKXz2] |
| Chest radiograph | Persistent fever ≥ 3–5 days or new respiratory symptoms | Evaluate for occult pneumonia [^113NWVeq] |
| Repeat COVID-19 PCR | Persistent fever or new symptoms | Early COVID-19 may be initially negative [^111WcKBv] [^116oDkMQ] |
| Blood culture | Fever ≥ 5 days without source or ill appearance | Evaluate for bacteremia |

---

## Management plan

Management is **supportive care** with antipyretics (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) and hydration. Antibiotics are not indicated unless a bacterial source is identified. Provide close follow-up within 24–48 hours if fever persists or new symptoms develop.

---

## Prognosis and follow-up

Prognosis is **excellent** for a well-appearing, immunocompetent child with likely viral illness. Follow-up should include reassessment within 24–48 hours if fever persists or new symptoms develop, with a low threshold for further testing.

---

The most likely diagnosis is a **viral illness**; if fever persists beyond 3–5 days or new symptoms develop, evaluate for UTI, occult pneumonia, or other bacterial infections.

Case presentation

A previously healthy two-year-old girl was transferred to our tertiary care center from her pediatrician's office in acute respiratory distress. Her symptoms began six days before arrival with nasal congestion, sore throat, non-productive cough and fever; her oral intake and activity level had both decreased, as well. Her two siblings had recently recovered from mild upper respiratory infections, presumed to be due to a viral infection. The patient also complained to her parents of pain in the ribs and abdomen. In her pediatrician's office, point of care testing for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) infection were both negative.

Her past medical history was unremarkable. She had been a full term infant who was born by vaginal delivery without complications. She had been diagnosed with RSV infection at eight months of age, and had an uneventful recovery. Her immunizations were up-to-date, and she had no allergies. She lives with mother, father and two siblings, all of whom are non-smokers. The family has no pets, and the family history was unremarkable. In the developmental history, all milestones had been achieved in a normal sequence and time.

On exam, she was initially afebrile: axillary temperature was 36.6°C, respiratory rate and heart rate were 20 breaths/min and 138 beats per minute, respectively and blood pressure was 138/77 mmHg. Height was 36.6″ inches (63% percentile) and weight 16.3 kg (96% percentile). Pulse oximetry was 93% on room air. She was listless. Her head, ear, eyes, nose and throat exam were unremarkable. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. She was tachycardic, but the rhythm was regular, and no murmur was appreciated. Pulmonary examination was notable for diminished breath sounds on the left. Abdominal, neurological, skin and musculoskeletal exam were unremarkable.

Laboratory studies on the day of admission showed leukocytosis, anemia, and decreased albumin (Table 1). A two view chest X-ray was notable for a left lung infiltrate. Low dose screening computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest demonstrated a left upper lobe pneumonia with decreased contrast enhancement of the left upper lobe, concerning for left upper lobe ischemia, and a moderate to large left pleural effusion, but no evidence for empyema or compressive atelectasis of the left lower lobe (Figure 1).

Case presentation

A previously healthy 18-year-old African American female presented to the emergency department (ED) with four days of fever, fatigue, headache, sore throat, odynophagia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Prior to presentation to the ED, she had tested negative for Group A Streptococcus, influenza, mononucleosis, and SARS-CoV-2. She completed her Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 two-dose vaccine series six months ago, and had tested negative (rapid antigen) weekly for 2 months prior to presentation as part of routine screening at her college. She had no known symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the ED, she was afebrile, tachycardic at 127 beats per minute and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 86/53 mmHg. On exam, she had tender bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, trismus, fullness on the left side of her neck, and decreased range of neck motion. Pertinent negatives included no conjunctivitis or rash, and normal lung exam. Her initial workup was significant for leukocytosis, elevated CRP (Table 1), and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Neck commuted tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a retropharyngeal fluid collection (6.1 × 2.7 × 0.5 cm) extending from C1 to C4 (Fig. 1). A diagnosis of retropharyngeal phlegmon was made and IV ampicillin-sulbactam was started in addition to a single dose of dexamethasone for airway edema.

### COVID-19 in 2 persons with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms on a cruise ship, Japan [^117Q8xqf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 2 occurred in a 27-year-old man from South Asia who worked as a kitchen cleaner on the ship. On day 1 of his illness, February 8, he had a fever (38.6°C), sore throat, and cough. His roommate had similar symptoms that started 2 days before. Case-patient 2 reported his symptoms but continued to work. On day 2, he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 but continued to work. On day 3, his fever persisted, so he stayed in his room. By day 4, his symptoms resolved. On day 5, he was told he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and was transferred to Asahi General Hospital. At admission, he had no respiratory or other symptoms. He had no underlying medical conditions and was taking no routine medication. His temperature was 36.0°C; blood pressure, 132/85 mm Hg; pulse, 87 bpm; respirations, 16 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 95% on ambient air. On examination, his throat was bright red without exudates (Appendix Figure 2), lung auscultation was clear, and chest radiographs and blood tests were not clinically significant (Appendix Figure 1, panel B, Table 2). He remained asymptomatic, but on day 8, RT-PCR results were positive; results remained positive on days 12, 14, 18, and 21. His throat redness did not improve, but he did not report throat soreness or discomfort. He never experienced shortness of breath or sputum, and daily lung auscultations were clear.

We describe 2 mild cases of COVID-19 without discernable pneumonia, which could represent the clinical course in young, healthy persons. Worldwide, cases are appearing without apparent epidemiologic links. As the virus spreads, more mild COVID-19 cases are likely, and clinicians should be aware of clinical manifestations in the absence of severe symptoms. Case-patient 2's symptoms rapidly decreased, but detectable viral RNA persisted for > 2 weeks. As of February 27, patients in Japan must have 2 consecutive negative RT-PCR results before they can be discharged. Viral RNA detection does not necessarily indicate infectivity, so we urgently need guidance for detection and management of mild COVID-19 to prepare for a possible pandemic and avoid overwhelming healthcare systems.

In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we are seeing widespread disease burden affecting patients of all ages across the globe. However, much remains to be understood as clinicians, epidemiologists, and researchers alike are working to describe and characterize the disease process while caring for patients at the frontlines. We describe the case of a 6-month-old infant admitted and diagnosed with classic Kawasaki disease, who also screened positive for COVID-19 in the setting of fever and minimal respiratory symptoms. The patient was treated per treatment guidelines, with intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose aspirin, and subsequently defervesced with resolution of her clinical symptoms. The patient's initial echocardiogram was normal, and she was discharged within 48 hours of completion of her intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, with instruction to quarantine at home for 14 days from the date of her positive test results for COVID-19. Further study of the clinical presentation of pediatric COVID-19 and the potential association with Kawasaki disease is warranted, as are the indications for COVID-19 testing in the febrile infant.

COVID-19 data standards — probable acute COVID-19 case requires either antigen detection or defined clinical/epidemiological criteria or a qualifying death certificate, with clinical criteria specifying symptom counts. Permissible value definitions state: "Detection of SARS- CoV-2 by antigen test in a respiratory specimen OR Meets clinical criteria and epidemiological linkage criteria for COVID-19 with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed OR A death certificate that lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as an underlying cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death with no confirmatory laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2". Clinical criteria are listed as: "At least 2 of the following: fever (measured or subjective), chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, congestion, or runny nose OR Any 1 of the following: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, new olfactory disorder, new taste disorder OR Severe respiratory illness with clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia or ARDS". Epidemiological linkage criteria are defined as "close contact, as defined by the CDC (while the person was deemed to be infectious (see infectious period below)), or a member of a risk cohort as defined by public health authorities during an outbreak", and it is noted that "In hospital setting, probable cases have been sometimes identified as PUI".

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^115FqgNe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — hospitalized adults and pediatric predictors show variable accuracy and age-specific features. In hospitalized patients, fever with cough or sore throat had a sensitivity of 43% for patients without asthma and only 20% for asthmatic patients. Infants and young children with influenza may not always have fever and may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms, may present with fever and suspected sepsis, and diarrhea can occur in up to 28% of infants and young children with influenza. In young children 1–5 years, fever > 38°C, chills, headache, malaise, and sore eyes were significantly associated with a positive RT-PCR test result. In pediatric patients, fever (≥ 38°C), headache, cough, and absence of abnormal breathing sounds had a positive predictive value of 57.1%. Among children aged ≤ 5 years, adding rhinorrhea to the fever and cough case definition achieved a better balance between sensitivity (83%) and specificity (47%), and among pediatric outpatients aged ≤ 13 years with respiratory infections, fever was the only reliable predictor of culture-confirmed influenza virus infection.

### Safely returning America to work: part I: general guidance for employers [^113kpPVz]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Preventing infected people from coming to work — screening and testing outlines return-to-work criteria using molecular testing and symptoms. CDC guidance include both test-based and symptom-based strategies to facilitate return to work. Validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the virus is recommended in clinical settings. The test-based strategy requires resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications, improvement in respiratory symptoms, and negative results of a molecular assay for COVID-19 from at least two consecutive nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected 24 hours apart. The symptom-based strategy requires that at least 72 hours have passed since the resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms, and at least 7 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. Infection may persist as positive due to remaining viral fragments, that is, PCR is positive, but the host has stopped shedding viral particles.

### Perspective on the integration of diagnostic algorithms for fever management [^115wij95]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute febrile illnesses (AFIs) are a major public health problem and the reason for most outpatient clinic consultations at primary healthcare centers. The causes of AFIs are usually diverse. Distinguishing between bacterial and viral infectious causes of nonmalarial fever using noninvasive sampling is inherently difficult due to the limited performance of diagnostics, presence of normal flora, and carriage, among other reasons. The challenge is present even in high-income countries but is more magnified in low- and middle-income countries where access to accurate diagnostics is limited. Even with the rollout of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) "test, treat, and track" policy on malaria, cautionary just-in-case antibiotic prescriptions are still common, more so among patients with AFIs who test negative for malaria, children aged < 5 years, and patients who have respiratory tract infections.

This diagnostic uncertainty is a driver of antibiotic prescriptions for AFIs. Unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions contribute to a rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which is a "silent pandemic" that in 2019 alone was associated with 4.95 million deaths globally and caused 1.27 million deaths globally. Strategies to rationalize antibiotic use, reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, and address self-medication are needed to stem the growing problem. The ability to establish a correct diagnosis between viral and bacterial causes of fever is central to this response.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for laryngitis, more specifically with respect to viral testing (influenza, flu season), IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend to consider testing for influenza in patients not at high risk for influenza complications presenting with influenza-like illness, pneumonia, or nonspecific respiratory illness (such as cough without fever) during influenza activity and likely to be discharged home, if the testing result may influence antiviral treatment decisions or reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics, further diagnostic testing, and time in the emergency department, or if the result may influence antiviral treatment or chemoprophylaxis decisions in high-risk household contacts.

### A 29-year-old woman with flu-like symptoms: review of influenza diagnosis and treatment [^117QQUns]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Peaks of seasonal influenza activity occur annually in many countries, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Using the case of Ms R, a 29-year-old woman who presented with acute onset of respiratory symptoms and was evaluated for influenza, considerations regarding symptoms and signs, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of influenza are discussed. Symptoms of influenza can be similar to those of other respiratory viruses, making diagnosis challenging. Laboratory testing should be reserved for patients who are seriously ill or for whom test results may affect management or have public health implications. For most cases of influenza, treatment is supportive and specific antiviral medication is not needed. Annual vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Educating patients on practical steps to reduce the spread of influenza in the community is critical.

RSV illness incidence

Among participants < 5 years, we observed an earlier rise in incidence and higher incidence rates throughout the season compared to other age groups (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similarly, estimated RSV A/B peak monthly incidence rates per 1,000 person-days were higher among children < 5 years (7.74 cases [95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.42, 17.52] for 6 months–1 year; 6.34 [95% CI: 3.60, 11.18] for 2–4 years) compared to children 5–17 years of age (2.65 [95% CI: 1.92, 3.68] for 5–12 years; 0.46 [95% CI: 0.15, 1.43] for 13–17 years) and adults (1.04 [95% CI: 0.69, 1.55]). During the months in which each RSV subtype was detected, the average monthly incidence rates were 2.07 × 10⁻³ (95 CI: 1.54 × 10⁻³, 2.77 × 10⁻³) and 0.39 × 10⁻³ (95% CI: 0.29 × 10⁻³, 0.53 × 10⁻³) per 1000 person-days for RSV A and B, respectively.

RSV illness characteristics

Among all participants, the most frequently reported symptoms were rhinorrhea, cough, and sore throat (Table 2). A higher proportion of participants 6 months–1 year reported shortness of breath (29.17%) compared to participants 2–17 years of age (5.26–6.60%) and adults 18–50 years of age (15.15%). Compared to pediatric participants, adults reported fever (17.17% versus 27.18%), rhinorrhea (86.87% versus 94.17%), and cough (63.64% versus 86.41%) less frequently, but reported sore throat (58.59% versus 35.44%), fatigue (50.51% versus 23.79%), headache (42.42% versus 19.42%), and myalgia (18.18% versus 8.25%) more frequently.

Seven days after the first cycle, the patient was readmitted to the hospital with fever, dry mouth, and right iliac pain, with a maximum temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius. Physical examination showed no congestion or swelling in the throat, slight breathing sounds in both lungs, no obvious dry or wet rales and no obvious tenderness or rebound pain in the entire abdomen. Following abdominal CT scans, no sign of active inflammatory lesion was observed. Results from laboratory blood tests revealed that leukocyte counts were within the conventional normality limits. Both the absolute quantitative count and its corresponding proportion of neutrophils were within the normal range. The hypersensitive C-reactive protein level was raised to 23.9 mg/L. Comprehensive physical examination, CT scans, and laboratory examination still cannot completely rule out fever caused by bacterial infection. The fever subsided after acetaminophen and anti-infective symptomatic treatment with levofloxacin, but dry mouth and fatigue symptoms persisted. Two days later, the patient developed fever again with a maximum temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius, and routine blood tests indicated leukocytes at 0.8 × 10⁹ /l, neutrophils at 0.03 × 10⁹ /l, hemoglobin at 103 g/l, and platelets within the normal range. The patient was given imipenem for preventing infection and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for leukocyte therapy. On the fifth day of hospitalization, the patient developed a rash (Fig. 1), and a re-examination showed neutrophil counts close to 0/mm³, hemoglobin levels at 89 g/l and IL-6 at 28.4 pg/ml. Tests for COVID-19, EBV DNA, respiratory viruses, CMV, rubella, and herpes viruses all returned negative results.

### Clinical predictors and timing of cessation of viral RNA shedding in patients with COVID-19 [^112F11uQ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Molecular detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is key in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been widely used for followup of cases as a proxy for contagiousness. The persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in the context of clinical features and comorbidities is understudied.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 adult symptomatic cases at Mayo Clinic, eventually achieving cessation of viral RNA shedding (CVS), defined as two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at least 24 h apart.

Results

A total of 251 patients were included, median age was 53 years and 59% female. The most common symptoms at diagnosis were cough, myalgia, dyspnea, fever and chills. Myalgia, cough, anosmia, ageusia and sore throat were common at CVS, but fever and dyspnea were not observed. The median time from symptom onset to CVS was 23 days, and did not differ by symptoms. The weekly cumulative CVS rate was 2, 14, 44, 73, 91 and 95% at 1–6 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Cough and fever were associated with a positive PCR test if tested within 2 weeks of symptoms (P < 0.05). Patients with asthma or immunosuppression were less likely to achieve CVS if tested 3 weeks into symptoms (P < 0.04).

Conclusions

The cumulative CVS rate at 3 weeks from symptom-onset is 44% in our entire cohort. The findings of our study highlight the low yield of repeating a SARS-CoV-2 NP PCR test within 21 days of a laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

### COVID-19 and what pediatric rheumatologists should know: a review from a highly affected country [^113MmVGC]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 in children

Regarding the pediatric age, it is now known that COVID-19 related disease is less frequent and less aggressive. In Italy only about 1% of positive cases are under 18 years of age, and no deaths have been recorded before 29 years of age. Numbers collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that children age 1–10 years old represent only 0.9% of COVID-19 cases while children and adolescents age 10–19 years old were 1.2% of the 44,672 confirmed positive subjects.

Dong et al. studied the epidemiologic characteristics of 2143 pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed infection identified from January 16th to February 8th 2020 in China. The authors described an asymptomatic, mild, or moderate course in 94.1% of cases, with 4.4% of patients totally asymptomatic. They considered asymptomatic those children with positive laboratory tests without any clinical signs or symptoms or radiological chest findings, mild those with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection in the absence of auscultatory abnormalities or children with only digestive symptoms, and moderate those with pneumonia, but no obvious hypoxemia. The spectrum of manifestations observed in the pediatric age includes fever (frequently low grade), cough, pharyngeal erythema, tachycardia, and tachypnea, less usually rhinorrhea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. Children may show a coinfection with other viral pneumonia, and in a series of 20 Chinese children eight showed a concomitant infection with influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or cytomegalovirus. The majority of pediatric patients have a normal blood count, with 15% showing leukocytosis and 15% leukopenia. CRP and ESR are also frequently in normal range. Hence, while in adults lymphocyte and platelet counts, CRP, and albumin levels have been proposed as signs for severe infection, in children the potential prognostic value of these indicators is not clear. Chest CT findings are documented in almost half of children, and appear to be similar, but milder when compared to those found in adults. Plain chest X-rays may fail to detect the lesions or may be unable the detail pathologic features.

Finally, the experience on neonates and mother-child transplacental transmission is very limited. Pregnant women can have the typical features of COVID-19 pneumonia present in non-pregnant women, but outcomes in their neonates seem to be favorable. Data obtained from a small group of women with COVID-19 pneumonia in their third trimester of pregnancy do not support an intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission.

### Beyond the usual suspects: neonatal fever and desaturation [^111rdwd7]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a 1-month-old infant admitted with fever, dyspnea, and desaturation after an unmonitored pregnancy in a migrant family. The patient rapidly required mechanical ventilation. Laboratory parameters were markedly elevated, suggesting an infectious etiology.

Methods

The clinical course is described with emphasis on diagnostic challenges, including imaging, laboratory findings, and the stepwise process of differential diagnosis.

Results

After common etiologies were excluded, rarer causes were considered. The final diagnosis was established through integration of clinical assessment, radiological imaging, laboratory data, and microbiological testing.

Conclusion

In neonates with fever and respiratory distress, RSV bronchiolitis is usually the first consideration. If excluded, clinicians must remain alert to less frequent etiologies. This case underscores the importance of a broad differential diagnosis in infants with acute respiratory compromise.

### Utility of respiratory viral testing in the risk stratification of young febrile infants presenting to emergency care settings: a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis [^116p7Cu2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Data synthesis

The primary objective of this research is to analyse the ability of a positive viral test to identify the overall risk of IBI. The secondary objective is to perform a subgroup analysis to investigate how the risk stratification alters based on other symptoms and factors, including (depending on availability of data):

Virus type RSV. Influenza viruses. SARS-CoV-2.
Patient characteristics Well clinical appearance. Biomarkers, including CRP < 20 mg/L and procalcitonin (PCT) < 0.5 ng/mL. Age grouped by < 21 days, 21–28 days and > 28 days.
Identified source of fever (eg, clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis) or FWAS.

FWAS is defined as axillary or rectal temperature ≥ 38°C as recorded in the emergency department or reported from a recording at home (within 24 hours), where it is not possible to identify the source of the fever following clinical assessment including medical history and physical examination.

The primary outcome of the meta-analysis will be diagnostic ORs of having IBI when a positive viral test is obtained compared with a negative test. The corresponding 95% CIs will be determined to allow evaluation of the degree of certainty in the estimates obtained. To provide further clinical value, the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios will also be calculated.

Forest plots will be used to provide a graphical overview of the results and allow a visual inspection of the degree of heterogeneity in the results of the different studies. The overall effect will be calculated as a weighted average of the individual study ORs. The degree of heterogeneity will be investigated using Cochran's Q and Higgins I² statistics and illustrated graphically using funnel plots. Publication bias will be investigated using Egger's test. Bivariate random-effects meta-analysis will be undertaken to account for the anticipated variation in the studies, with the outcomes summarised both in tables and graphically using summary receiver operating characteristic curves. All analysis will be undertaken within R.

Patient and public involvement

The febrile infants patient and public involvement (PPI) group have helped to inform the research question through a series of virtual meetings. They informed us of the importance of an accurate early diagnosis, the distress of painful investigations such as lumbar puncture, their concerns regarding the overuse of antibiotics and their worries about potentially missed serious infection. The febrile infants PPI group will help to produce a lay summary of the study findings.

Association between test positivity and self-reported symptoms

Considering age as a continuous variable (Fig. 3), over 50% of SARS-CoV-2-positives aged 30–70 years reported symptoms consistent with ILI-ECDC, compared to at most ~ 25% in those 30–65 years for ILI-WHO. ILI-ECDC symptoms were also more commonly reported than ILI-WHO amongst those testing positive for RSV or influenza, with ILI-WHO being particularly uncommon amongst RSV-positives, due to low rates of self-reported fever amongst RSV-positives across all ages. Cough and sore throat were amongst the most common symptoms for SARS-CoV-2-positives, with a prevalence of cough > 50% in those over ~ 20 years. However, in the youngest children, cough was almost as common in SARS-CoV-2-negatives as positives, consistent with multiple other causes. Sneezing, fatigue, and headache were other common symptoms amongst SARS-CoV-2-positives (Additional file 1: Fig. S6), with higher rates amongst middle-aged versus younger and older participants. As for SARS-CoV-2-positives, cough, sore throat, sneezing, fatigue and headache were amongst the most commonly reported symptoms for RSV- and influenza-positives, with broadly similar trends across age (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Fig. S7), including most symptoms being more commonly reported amongst middle-aged participants. Most symptoms were more commonly reported in influenza- than RSV-positives, wheezing being the main exception, being more commonly reported in older participants testing positive for RSV than influenza or SARS-CoV-2. However, absolute percentages reporting wheezing were lower than for other symptoms, and confidence intervals were wide.

Note: See Additional file 1: Fig. S6–S7 for the remaining symptoms. Predictions are averaged across time (no smooth for calendar time included in models). The respiratory pilot analysis excluded loss of smell due to the small absolute number of participants reporting this symptom.

CASE

History and Clinical Examination

A previously healthy 2-year-old girl was taken to her primary care physician on day 1 of symptom onset with a fever reaching 40 °C and mild diarrhea. On day 4, she was prescribed cefcapene pivoxil. She was referred to our hospital on day 8 with continued fever. There was no medical history of note, and her immunization history was up to date. There were no pets in the home, and she had no history of allergies. On admission, heart rate was 152 beats/min, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min, blood pressure was 115/98 mm Hg, body temperature was 38.0 °C and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Capillary refill time was normal. On physical examination, her general condition was rather poor. No cough or nasal discharge was noted. There was no conjunctival hyperemia, strawberry tongue or lip redness. Her pharynx was slightly reddened, but no cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. On chest auscultation, breath sounds were normal with no pulmonary rales. No heart murmur was heard. The abdomen was soft on palpation, and bowel peristalsis was normal. There was no redness at the bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination site. Three 3-mm papules were observed on the lower extremities and trunk.

Initial laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell count of 12.7 × 10⁹ /L (normal 4.0–11.9), with 71% granulocytes and 25% lymphocytes, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL (normal 10.9–14.2), platelet count of 313 × 10⁹ /L (normal 180–460), C-reactive protein level of 73.0 mg/L (normal ≤ 3), erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm/60 min (normal), serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 29 U/L (normal 24–50), alanine aminotransferase 11 U/L (normal 9–34), lactate dehydrogenase level of 353 U/L (normal 195–400) and serum creatinine level of 0.25 mg/dL (normal 0.17–0.45). Antigen tests for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and group A streptococcus were negative. Findings on a chest radiograph (X-ray) are shown in Figure 1.

Participants

Hospital admissions at each site were reviewed daily and assessed for eligibility. Hospitalized adults aged 18 years and older with symptoms or signs compatible with acute respiratory illness (ARI) who underwent clinical testing for RSV, SARS-COV-2, or influenza as standard of care were eligible for enrollment. ARI was defined as presence of at least 1 of the following: fever, cough, dyspnea, chest imaging findings consistent with pneumonia, or hypoxemia (ie, an oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry < 92% or supplemental oxygen use for patients without chronic oxygen needs, or escalation of oxygen therapy for patients who receive chronic supplemental oxygen). Nasal specimens were also obtained from enrolled patients and tested at a central laboratory (Vanderbilt University Medical Center) by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Patients with nasal specimens with positive test results for RSV, SARS-CoV-2 or influenza within 10 days of illness onset and 3 days of hospital admission, based on either clinical or central laboratory testing, were included.

### COVID-19 and sickle cell disease [^116oDkMQ]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

The Amsterdam University Medical Centers reported two Hb SS patients who presented with typical acute sickle pain with no accompanying flu-like symptoms. A 24- year-old male presented with acute thoracic pain in the absence of fever or dyspnea; throat and nose swabs were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and the patient received the presumptive diagnosis of a vasoocclusive crisis (VOC) complicated by ACS. He received antibiotic therapy and was discharged home only to return 24 hours later with increasing pain, dyspnea, and fever. Repeat chest imaging demonstrated progression of infiltrates but radiologic findings were not consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. A repeat PCR performed on a sputum sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient received appropriate supportive treatment and had an uneventful recovery. Patient 2, a 20-year-old female presented with an acute pain crisis. She developed transient hypoxia and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 testing was positive. Although CT imaging of the chest did not demonstrate pulmonary abnormalities, she was hospitalized for pain management and never developed respiratory symptoms or fever. We have not been informed if these patients were on hydroxyurea or regular blood transfusion programs.

Although anecdotal, a few important themes emerge from these cases – that COVID-19 might trigger a VOC without the accompanying respiratory manifestations of COVID-19, that ACS is not as common a complication as feared, and that fever was notably absent at presentation in some SCD patients, a feature also noted among 5,700 patients admitted with COVID-19 in New York City.

TABLE 3
Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics among 200 symptomatic patients tested by LIASISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay

Among the 62 patients who tested positive with the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay, the median age was notably lower at 5 years (IQR: 1–12). Lung disease was the most frequently reported comorbidity (22.6%), and the most common presenting symptoms were fever (24.2%) and flu-like symptoms (19.4%). Hospital admission was required for only 6.5% of these patients. The most frequently assigned ED diagnoses among positive cases were viral illness (25.8%) and upper respiratory infection (12.9%; Table 3). Notably, four patients received antibiotic prescriptions, only two of whom had positive group A Streptococcal throat swabs, and two received an antibiotic prescription for lobar pneumonia (and tested positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus with the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay) and acute otitis media (tested positive for HPIV3 with the LIAISON PLEX Respiratory Flex Assay).

In contrast, among the 138 patients who tested negative, the median age was significantly higher at 42 years (IQR: 17–62). This group had a higher prevalence of chronic conditions, with hypertension (39.1%), cancer (31.2%), and immunosuppression (28.3%) being the most reported comorbidities. Hospital admission was more frequent among negative cases, with 20.3% requiring inpatient care. The most documented ED diagnoses in this group included sore throat (8.0%), shortness of breath (6.5%), and fever (5.1%; Table 3).

### Heterogeneity in the evaluation of suspected MIS-C: a cross-sectional vignette-based survey [^115DFRJX]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

MIS-C is a rare but severe sequela of COVID-19 in children; early diagnosis and treatment are critical to reduce or avoid MIS-C morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the number of pediatric illnesses that present with similar symptoms is broad, making it challenging to differentiate MIS-C from other more benign childhood illnesses, as well as distinguish it from bacterial infections and Kawasaki disease. Because of the non-specific presenting symptoms, potential for rapid progression, and the life-threatening nature of MIS-C, there is a low threshold for initiating workup. Our study shows significant heterogeneity amongst providers as to when they initiate MIS-C workup, components of the workup, and how to confirm MIS-C diagnosis.

Given how extensive the MIS-C workup is, it is important to carefully consider which patients warrant an evaluation. Current guidelines, however, lack explicit screening criteria. While the CDC case definition of MIS-C includes fever for at least 24 h, guidelines are unclear on the duration of fever that should generate a workup. This lack of clarity is reflected in our study, where providers were divided when asked about the duration of fever that would prompt them to initiate workup. Additional thought also must be put into excluding other febrile illnesses, such as viral illnesses, bacterial infections, or Kawasaki disease, which can be particularly challenging given the overlapping clinical features.

### Case report: pulmonary leptospirosis misdiagnosed as COVID-19 [^112AJNuw]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

In the French Caribbean island of Martinique, the second COVID-19 pandemic wave occurred between September 1 and December 31, 2020. During this period, 290 patients were treated in our center, a tertiary university hospital.

On December 6, 2020, an 83-year-old woman without significant medical history presented to the emergency room with dyspnea. The patient's symptoms appeared on December 2 (day 1) and included myalgia, arthralgia, and diarrhea. Three days later, she was dyspneic and had a fever, which led her to be admitted to our hospital.

On admission, the patient's body temperature was 38.8°C, with an oxygen saturation at ambient air of 88% and polypnea at 40 cycles/min. The patient was dyspneic when talking or carrying out low-level physical activity. Clinical examination revealed bilateral crackles at the pulmonary bases, with the absence of jaundice, rash, and conjunctival suffusion. Her mental status was deemed normal.

Laboratory exams showed lymphopenia at 140 lymphocytes/mm³, thrombocytopenia at 101,000 thrombocytes/mm³, and a serum creatinine level of 91 µmol/L (normal value, 55 µmol/L). The patient's blood urea nitrogen level was 11.6 mmol/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were at 160 and 62 U/L respectively. Her bilirubin level was normal, C-reactive protein was at 350 mg/L, and B-type natriuretic peptide was normal at 105 pg/mL (Table 1).

Table 1
Patient's blood test and microbiological results during hospitalization

A first SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed on a nasopharyngeal sample on day 5 of symptoms and was negative. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus PCR tests were also negative, as were serum dengue virus RT-PCR and dengue serology. Legionella pneumophila (serogroup I) urinary antigen was equally absent. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed on admission and revealed ground-glass opacities, with a distribution that was bilateral and mixed: peripheral and peri-bronchovascular. About 25% of the lung parenchyma was affected (Figure 1).

Case Presentation

A 38-year-old man presented to the ED complaining of persistent fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea for 7 days. He reported a history of OSA with inconsistent CPAP use, tobacco use of less than one pack per day, and daily e-cigarette use or "vaping". He denied any contact with ill people or recent travels and was up to date on recommended COVID-19 vaccinations. Prior to his presentation, he had been seen at an urgent care facility twice in the last week, where he was given IV fluids and prescribed steroids without improvement.

Well-appearing febrile infants — viral testing developments include rapid viral PCR and multiplex respiratory viral testing that have prompted analyses of effects on risk stratification; although documented respiratory viral infections decrease the risk of invasive bacterial infections (IBIs), it remains unclear how a positive viral test should guide further laboratory evaluation and management, especially in the first month of life, and one study from 2000–2012 did not find a difference in length of stay between infants with or without positive viral test results.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, testing, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to swabbing the throat and testing for GAS pharyngitis by rapid antigen detection test (RADT) and/or culture should be performed because the clinical features alone do not reliably discriminate between GAS and viral pharyngitis except when overt viral features like rhinorrhea, cough, oral ulcers, and/or hoarseness are present. In children and adolescents, negative RADT tests should be backed up by a throat culture.

### Case of COVID-19 in a 5-week-old baby [^111W23P5]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

On 31 December 2019, the first case of COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan. A public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and the first case in Scotland, on 2 March. The effect of COVID-19 appears to be less in the paediatric population and there are fewer cases reported in the literature in comparison to the adult population. Here, we report a case of a previously well 5-week-old infant who presented with fever and increased sleepiness. There was no known contact with any unwell individuals. COVID-19 was identified through a septic screen work up. The infant's course was uneventful and she has made a full recovery. This case highlights the need to have a low index of suspicion in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the need to be vigilant in use of personal protective equipment, even in paediatric patients with subtle symptoms.

Fever in well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years — pneumonia risk predictors guiding chest radiography: Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: In well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]) and no obvious source of infection, physicians should consider obtaining a chest radiograph for those with cough, hypoxia, rales, high fever (≥ 39°C), fever duration greater than 48 hours, or tachycardia and tachypnea out of proportion to fever. Level C recommendations: In well-appearing immunocompetent infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years presenting with fever (≥ 38°C [100.4°F]) and wheezing or a high likelihood of bronchiolitis, physicians should not order a chest radiograph.

### Diagnosis of COVID-19 in children guided by lack of fever and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [^115cEVYX]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study is to test how certain signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 in children predict the positivity or negativity of the SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab in children.

Methods

We review the data of children who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 for a suspected infection. We compared the clinical characteristics of the subjects who tested positive and negative, including the sensibility, positive and negative predictive value of different combination of signs and symptoms.

Results

Of all the suspected infected, 2596 tested negative (96.2%) and 103 tested positive (3.8%). The median age was 7.0 and 5.3 years for the positive and negative ones, respectively. The female to male ratio was ~1:1.3. Fever and respiratory symptoms were mostly reported. Most positive children had a prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects (59.2%). A total of 99.3% of patients without fever nor exposure to the virus proved negative to the SARS-CoV-2 test.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that a child without fever or contact with infected subjects is SARS-CoV-2 negative. If this were to be confirmed, many resources would be spared, with improved care of both COVID-19 and not COVID-19-affected children.

Impact

Key message: lack of fever and exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected people highly predicts a negative results of the SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab in the paediatric population. Added value to the current literature: this is the first article to prove this point.

Impact

reduction of emergency department accesses of children with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection; increased outpatient management of children with cough or other common respiratory symptoms of infancy; sparing of many human and material health resources.

### Deaths attributed to respiratory syncytial virus in young children in high-mortality rate settings: report from child health and mortality prevention surveillance (CHAMPS) [^115LxV5S]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 3.
A. Findings in a newborn with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) determined to be the underlying and only cause of death. The subject was a 22-day-old girl, born in a healthcare facility at 38 weeks' gestation (birthweight, 3400 g) to a mother who was positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and receiving treatment. The newborn was seen at a referral hospital after a week of difficulty breathing; the father refused admission, and the newborn was discharged on antibiotics. She developed a fever, was seen in the clinic, and was again referred for hospital care. She died at home that night. Postmortem testing was negative for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria; blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were also negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing identified RSV in lung tissue and a nasopharyngeal (NP) specimen; the latter also contained Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and rhinovirus. Pathology found mild steatosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, and interstitial pneumonitis in specimens from both lungs. Both images show lung tissue; the arrows in left image indicate multinucleated syncytial cells, and the circle in right image, positive immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in these cells. B, Findings after death caused by a chronic infected ulcer (underlying cause), with subsequent pneumonia caused by S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (morbid causes) and S. aureus sepsis (immediate cause) in a malnourished infant (part 2 contributing cause); RSV was detected but not deemed a cause of death. This subject was a 6-month-old girl born at 36 weeks' gestation (birthweight, 3165 g). She presented with 1 day of cough, fever, lethargy, and decreased milk intake and 2 days of diarrhea. She had been receiving oral and topical medications for an occipital ulcer. At the admission examination, she was hot to the touch, hydrated, and in respiratory distress, with grunting, alar flaring, a respiratory rate of 62/min, and a pulse rate of 178 /min. She was treated with gentamicin and ampicillin but died the following day. S. aureus grew in cultures collected before death from the occipital abscess and blood. The infant's weight and height at postmortem examination were 6.07 kg and 60 cm, respectively (weight-for-age z score, −2.18; weight-for-height z score, −1.5). Results of postmortem tests for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria were negative. S. aureus grew in lung tissue culture. PCR testing detected S. aureus in blood and lung tissue. Lung tissue was also positive for S. pneumoniae. PCR results in an NP swab specimen were positive for RSV, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus; a stool sample was positive for adenovirus 40/41 and Escherichia coli. Liver tissue pathology showed severe large- and small-droplet steatosis. Right and left lung specimens showed severe necrotizing bronchopneumonia (left image), with IHC staining positive for S. aureus (not shown) and S pneumoniae (red staining in right image). C, Findings after death in a child caused by HIV with wasting syndrome (underlying cause), malaria (morbid condition), and E. coli sepsis (immediate cause); severe anemia and polymicrobial pneumonia due to RSV, E. coli, and S. pneumoniae were considered contributing (part 2) causes. The child was a 21-month-old girl admitted to the hospital with a history of cough, fever, vomiting, and rash localized at her mouth, elbows, and buttocks. On examination, she appeared ill and wasted and was febrile. Antemortem diagnoses included severe anemia, severe malaria, pneumonia, and malnutrition; she died on hospital day 11. Postmortem weight and height were 6.7 kg and 82.1 cm, respectively (weight-for-age z score, −4.04; weight-for-height z score, −5.1). At postmortem examination, she appeared malnourished and pale, with healed sacral and trochanteric pressure sores and right elbow sores. HIV testing results were positive; results of testing for tuberculosis and malaria were negative, and a blood culture grew E. coli. PCR testing of blood identified E. coli and Plasmodium falciparum; lung tissues were positive for RSV, cytomegalovirus, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and K. pneumoniae; an NP specimen was positive for RSV, K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, M. catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cytomegalovirus; and a stool sample was positive for E. coli, and Enterovirus. At pathological examination of the liver, extensive large- and small-droplet steatosis and sinusoidal leukocytosis were noted, and results of IHC testing were positive for malaria; bacterial bronchopneumonia and focal interstitial pneumonitis were seen in lung tissue. IHC tests in lung tissuee detected E. coli (left image) and S. pneumoniae (right image).

### Acute cough in outpatients: what causes it, how long does it last, and how severe is it for different viruses and bacteria? [^113opdM8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the symptoms, duration, severity, and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in outpatients.

Methods

Prospective cohort study of adults in US primary or urgent care with a chief complaint of cough and symptoms consistent with LRTI. Baseline data included demographics, signs, symptoms, and PCR for 46 viruses and bacteria. The severity of symptoms reported for ≤ 28 days follow-up via diary and text message. The Bronchitis severity score assessed severity at baseline; overall severity was defined as the area under the symptom severity curve.

Results

Of 718 patients with complete baseline data, 618 had valid PCR results, and 443 were followed until symptoms resolved. Of those with valid PCR, 100 (16.2%) had 1+ viruses detected, 211 (34.1%) had 1+ bacteria, and 168 (27.2%) had both. Symptoms more likely with viral or mixed infection included feverishness (36.7–38.4% vs. 18.5%), chills or sweats (36.0–38.1% vs. 17.9%), being generally unwell (78.2–81.3% vs. 64.9%), and myalgias (42.7–48.2% vs. 28.6%). Coloured sputum (42.9% vs. 23.2–29.5%) was more common with a bacterial infection. The mean duration of cough was 14.7 days with viruses (95% CI: 13.2–16.2), 17.3 with bacteria (95% CI: 15.9–18.6), 16.9 with mixed infection (95% CI: 15.2–18.6), and 18.4 with no detection (95% CI: 16.1–20.8). Overall severity of cough was lower for viral infections (20.9 points, 95% CI: 18.6–23.3) than for other groups (range 24.2–26.3). The most common potential bacterial pathogens were Haemophilus influenza (28.0%), Moraxella catarrhalis (16.2%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.2%), whereas the most common viral pathogens were rhinovirus (17.3%), influenza (12.8%), SARS-CoV-2 (11.5%), and seasonal coronaviruses (8.1%).

Discussion

The mean duration of cough was 16.4 days. Consistent with European studies, the type of infection or potential pathogen was not an important predictor of the duration or severity of LRTI.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^111WcKBv]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — It is important to diagnose the etiology of pneumonia so that treatment can be appropriately targeted, and appropriate strategies put into place to prevent transmission of infectious agents to healthcare providers and other patients. If there is concern about nosocomial acquisition based on local epidemiology, viral testing should be considered at any time during a patient's hospitalization, and viral studies should also be conducted if pneumonia is considered, as viruses may coinfect patients with a bacterial etiology. Multiple viruses can cause pneumonia in febrile ICU patients, including but not limited to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Upper respiratory tract sampling is sufficient for most cases, but in some instances, viruses such as influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 may only be detected in lower respiratory tract samples, such as those obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal tube aspirate. There are many commercial multiplex NAAT panels available for testing respiratory specimens; specific panel compositions vary, and clinicians will likely use the specific panel available at their center, and potential value of panel-based testing was recognized, as testing for viruses one-by-one will likely increase cost and oftentimes it is not clinically clear a priori which virus might be present. Users should be aware that not all potential causes of pneumonia are encompassed by such panels and that it is possible to detect viruses in a febrile ICU patient that are present but are noncontributory to patient's illness. Ideally, viral respiratory NAAT panels should be rapidly performed, with results used to rapidly direct appropriate use of antimicrobials; implementation science studies are needed to demonstrate safety and value of such an approach, and future implementation science studies should also evaluate the value of lower respiratory tract panels that include viruses, bacteria, and fungi, which were not analyzed here.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^117PVT2C]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Case 1.

A 60-year-old man was admitted with hiccups lasting for 3 days. The patient had no fever, cough, sore throat, chest tightness, or shortness of breath. He arrived at the neurology department with a complaint of hiccups. His neurological examination and magnetic resonance images of the head were normal. The patient was then referred to the internal medicine department for a differential diagnosis of hiccups. The patient had no previous history of chronic diseases such as gastrointestinal, neurological, or anxiety disorders; or benzodiazepine or opioid use. He reported no alcohol intake and he was not a smoker. His blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg, his respiratory rate was 24 breaths/min, his heart rate was 96 beats/min, his temperature was 36.7°C, and his arterial oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. He had a regular heart rhythm. ENT and abdominal examinations were normal. There were obvious moist crackles during auscultation of the inferior lobes of the lung. Routine blood test results were as follows: white blood cells, 4.07 × 10⁹ cells/L; neutrophils, 67.7%; lymphocytes, 18.4%; total number of lymphocytes, 0.75 × 10⁹ /L; C-reactive protein (CRP), 50 mg/L; potassium, 4.8 mmol/L; sodium, 142 mmol/L; urea, 38 mg/dL; serum creatinine (Cr), 0.97 mg/dL; D-dimer, 419 ng/mL; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 78 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 33 U/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 272 U/L; ferritin, 761 ng/mL; and troponin, 13.6 pg/mL. Blood tests for rapid detection of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus were all negative. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal.

Diagnostic predictors — radiographic pneumonia among febrile young children: Physician diagnosis had low sensitivity (10% to 50%) and high specificity (90% to 100%). Decreased breath sounds, rales, or tachypnea were predictive with a sensitivity of 94%. Wheezing reduced likelihood; in a Class III study none of the 126 patients aged 2 months to 2 years who presented with wheezing had radiographic pneumonia. Tachypnea and lower chest indrawing predicted radiographic pneumonia with sensitivity of 92% (95% CI 80% to 98%) and specificity 44% (95% CI 40% to 53%). Regarding hypoxia, radiographic pneumonia was found in half of patients with an oxygen saturation of 96% or higher; other studies variably used thresholds including oxygen saturation ≤ 92%, 95%, and 96%, and SpO2 less than 95% did not predict radiographic pneumonia in bronchiolitis, whereas temperature greater than or equal to 38°C (100.4°F) was the only positive predictor.

### Management of fever in infants and children [^115ViT6G]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

There is no question that fever is a source of great consternation for parent and physician alike; however, it is impossible to predict with certainty the outcome of every febrile illness. Inherent in the words diagnostic impression is a degree of uncertainty. The only question remaining is how much uncertainty is in the best interest of the child. Physicians try to use the existing scientific data to best determine the prevalence of disease and outcome. At the same time, they must recognize the limitations of both the data and their ability to be generalized to every population. Everything clinicians do has risks and costs, which they must balance against the incidence of complications and the benefits of testing. To take away clinical judgment makes physicians technicians not clinicians.

### A 7-year-old with persistent fever and cough [^115njMJW]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy, fully immunized 7-year-old girl presented with a 7-week history of daily fevers and a worsening cough with persistently elevated inflammatory markers. Before admission, she had an unrevealing outpatient workup by infectious disease, rheumatology, pulmonology, and otorhinolaryngology for her fever and other symptoms. Multiple courses of antibiotics had no effect, but brief courses of steroids seemed to modestly alleviate her symptoms. At an outside hospital, a computed tomography neck and chest scan revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She was subsequently transferred to the authors' institution. Her examination was notable for a febrile, tired-appearing girl in respiratory distress with a muffled voice and inspiratory stridor. Her laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with left shift, microcytic anemia, and hypoalbuminemia, as well as elevated inflammatory markers, ferritin, and fecal calprotectin. Her peripheral smear, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase were all within normal limits. Infectious study results, including blood and urine cultures, cytomegalovirus serologies, and Bartonella serologies were negative. On the second read of her outside computed tomography imaging, her lymphadenopathy was felt to be nonpathologic. Based on a recommendation by rheumatology, an ophthalmologic examination was obtained, which revealed bilateral anterior uveitis; however, rheumatologic laboratory test results returned negative. Her fevers continued, and inflammatory markers remained elevated despite antibiotics. On day 6 of hospitalization, she developed worsening respiratory distress, necessitating intubation and transfer to the ICU. Repeat laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy revealed severe purulent tracheitis; however, throat cultures remained sterile. Her clinical deterioration without identification of an offending organism prompted additional evaluation for a systemic etiology.

### Fever of unknown origin (FUO) – A call for new research standards and updated clinical management [^115QePFm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Prolonged fever of 38.3°C or higher for at least 3 weeks' duration has been termed fever of unknown origin if unexplained after preliminary investigations. Initially codified in 1961, classification with subgroups was revised in 1991. Additional changes to the definition were proposed in 1997, recommending a set of standardized initial investigations. Advances in diagnosis and management and diagnostic testing over the last 3 decades have prompted a needed update to the definition and approaches. While a 3-week fever duration remains part of the criteria, a lower temperature threshold of 38°C and revised minimum testing criteria will assist clinicians and their patients, setting a solid foundation for future research.

Fever is one of the most common chief complaints for patients in the pediatric emergency department (ED). Most of the time, these patients are diagnosed with a virus and treated with supportive care; however, there are a subset of patients with chronic conditions or special circumstances that require a more thorough approach when they enter the ED with a fever. This article will go into detail about why we must be on high alert when these children present with a fever and how we should approach them medically.

### Severe acute pharyngitis caused by group C Streptococcus [^111CEMN1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adult group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis has a prevalence of approximately 5%. It can present with a broad spectrum of severity.

Case Report

We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with severe Group C streptococcal pharyngitis.

Discussion

She presented with a 9-day history of progressive symptoms, including fever, sore throat, neck swelling, and recent onset of hoarseness. In the 9 days before the emergency room (ER) presentation, the patient had visited the ER twice complaining of a sore throat. At both visits, the physicians performed rapid antigen strep testing. Each time her test was negative and the physicians recommended symptomatic therapy. Her symptoms continued to worsen leading to her repeat presentation. At this time she had severe pharyngitis with markedly enlarged tonsils. Neck CT excluded peritonsillar abscess. Rapid strep testing was again negative, but her throat culture grew group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Conclusion

This presentation illustrates the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating patients with negative rapid strep tests and worsening pharyngitis.

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^113X6UB3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy. Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per uL with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

### Limitations of comprehensive respiratory viral testing in managing young infants with fever [^114j1kNK]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess whether and when comprehensive respiratory viral testing contributes to risk stratification and management of febrile young infants (FYI).

Study Design

Single-center, retrospective cohort study of hospitalized FYI, aged ≤ 90 days (born at term) or ≤ 52 6/7 postmenstrual weeks (born preterm), over a 5-year period. 456 infants with either a positive respiratory viral test result, regardless of diagnostic assay, or a negative respiratory viral test result obtained by comprehensive panel were included in the final analysis. Main outcomes were serious bacterial infection (SBI) rates overall and in specific subsamples, stratified by viral test results. Rates were estimated assuming a binomial distribution, with confidence intervals derived from a normal approximation. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using uncertainty propagation.

Results

Among 456 FYI (mean age 41 days), 70 (15.4%) had SBI, including 6 cases of bacteremia and 1 of meningitis. Infants with a positive viral test result had a SBI rate of 11.9% (42/354), including 2 cases of bacteremia, with significantly lower rates observed only in those testing positive for influenza (6%) and respiratory syncytial virus (4%). Regardless of viral test results, 93% (65/70) of SBI cases had abnormal inflammatory markers or urinalysis. Invasive bacterial infections occurred in both virus-positive (2/354) and virus-negative infants (5/102).

Conclusions

Comprehensive respiratory viral testing appears to have limited value for SBI risk stratification in FYI. It does not seem to support clinical decision-making or replace established risk stratification by inflammatory markers and urinalysis. Targeted testing may represent a more appropriate use of resources.

### The evolving approach to the young child who has fever and no obvious source [^1174Ggsz]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Fever is a common complaint of young children who seek care in the emergency department. Recent advances, such as universal vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, require the review of traditional approaches to these patients. This article discusses newer strategies in the evaluation and management of the young child with fever, incorporating changes based on the shifting epidemiology of bacterial infection.

### ACR appropriateness criteria fever without source or unknown origin-child [^113NWVeq]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The cause of fever in a child can often be determined from history, physical examination, and laboratory tests; infections account for the majority of cases. Yet in 20%, no apparent cause can be found, designated as fever without source (FWS). The yield of chest radiography in children with FWS is low, and it is usually not appropriate. However, in children with respiratory signs, high fever (> 39°C), or marked leukocytosis (≥ 20,000/mm(3)), chest radiography is usually appropriate, as it has a higher yield in detecting clinically occult pneumonia. In newborns with FWS, there is higher risk for serious bacterial infection, and the routine use of chest radiography is controversial. In children with neutropenia, fever is a major concern. In some clinical circumstances, such as after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chest CT scan may be appropriate even if the results of chest radiography are negative or nonspecific, as it has higher sensitivity and can demonstrate specific findings (such as lung nodule and "halo sign") that can guide management. In a child with prolonged fever of unknown origin despite extensive medical workup (fever of unknown origin), diagnosis is usually dependent on clinical and laboratory studies, and imaging tests have low yield. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Results

Subjects

A total of 223 children (male:female 117:106) who were 18 months old during the COVID-19 pandemic were enrolled onto this study. A questionnaire survey was conducted on all participants at 3 years 0 weeks old, and 168 children (male:female 91:77) completed the questionnaire survey, resulting in a response rate of 75.3% (Table I). Although the differences were small, statistically significant differences in age and height were observed between the nonpandemic children (mean age, 18 months 3 days and 36 months 21 days) and the pandemic children (18 months 14 days and 37 months 3 days) (Table I).

Table I
Characteristics of subjects

A total of 81 (male:female 40:41, data not published) and 257 (male:female 132:125; some of these data were used for a previous lung sound analysis study) young children were included as nonpandemic 18-month-olds and 3-year-olds, respectively. A questionnaire survey was conducted on all 81 participants at 3 years 0 weeks old, and 69 infants had survey information completed, resulting in a response rate of 85.2% (Table I).

Confirmation of epidemics of viral infections

On the basis of reports on the number of patients by disease for all ages per sentinel in Yokohama City, trends in RSV, influenza virus, and hand, foot, and mouth disease are shown in Fig E1 in the Online Repository at. In the 18-month period from March 2020, there were no epidemics of respiratory infections. However, from May to July 2021, the Kanto region, including Tokyo, recorded the largest RSV infection to date (Fig E1, arrowhead). In summer 2022, an RSV epidemic was also observed, and these trends were confirmed throughout Japan.

In contrast, influenza virus and hand, foot, and mouth disease epidemics have declined sharply since March 2020, and this trend has continued for more than 2 years. A report from Yokohama City also showed a sharp decrease in the number of people infected with pharyngoconjunctival fever and herpangina during the same period (data not shown). Among pandemic children, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 0.9% in 18-month-olds and 41.1% in 3-year-olds.

§§ Had possible contact with a laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient and were therefore tested.

All 210 persons who were tested were symptomatic: 143 (68%) had subjective fever or a measured temperature ≥ 100.4°F (≥ 38°C), and 189 (90%) had cough or shortness of breath. Upper respiratory tract symptoms (i.e. sore throat, rhinorrhea, or congestion) were common and were present in nine persons who did not have cough or shortness of breath. Thirty persons were reported to test positive for another respiratory viral pathogen, including influenza or respiratory syncytial virus. Forty-two (20%) patients were hospitalized, and four (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. One patient was deceased at the time of notification; testing for this person was negative, and an alternative cause of death was established. Travel-related risk was identified for 148 (70%) persons, 42 (20%) had close contact with ill patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or PUIs, 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks, and two (< 1%) had possible contact with a laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient and were therefore tested.

Among the 210 persons tested, 11 (5%) were found to have 2019-nCoV infection. Nine of these persons had traveled to Wuhan City; two persons had not traveled but had been in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV in the United States. All were symptomatic with fever (subjective or measured) or cough.

### Fever in the pediatric patient [^116rDVDj]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Fever is the most common reason that children and infants are brought to emergency departments. Emergency physicians face the challenge of quickly distinguishing benign from life-threatening conditions. The management of fever in children is guided by the patient's age, immunization status, and immune status as well as the results of a careful physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests and radiographic views. In this article, the evaluation and treatment of children with fevers of known and unknown origin are described. Causes of common and dangerous conditions that include fever in their manifestation are also discussed.

### Hospitalized children with influenza A before, during and after COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study [^115DZ47j]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Sex and age distribution of influenza A cases from 2018 to 2023

The median ages of patients were 3.96 years (IQR, 1.83–6.56) before the COVID-19 pandemic, 4.38 years (IQR, 2.35–6.88) during the pandemic, and 5.66 years (IQR, 3.41–7.70) after COVID-19. Notably, children affected with Flu A virus after the COVID-19 pandemic tended to be older than those before and during the pandemic (Fig. 1). The sex ratio of males to females ranged from 1.28 to 2.17 in the three groups. Fever and cough were identified as the most common symptoms, with the highest number of patients experiencing fever duration ≥ 5 days (60 cases, 30.6%) and had longer hospital stays (3.94 ± 1.64 days) during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, hospitalized children with Flu A virus after the pandemic exhibited more upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, including cough, sore throat, and nasal stuffiness, occurring in 88.3%, 21.2%, and 22.3% of cases, respectively. The clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with Flu A infection before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic were compared, similarities and differences were presented in Table 1.

Moreover, Flu A patients after the pandemic were more likely to BACM (14/349, 4.0%). There was a significant male predominance (12/14, 85.7%) with a median age of 7 years. Muscle pain persisted for an average of 3 days, while the median stay in the hospital was 2 days. These patients were treated conservatively, and all of them recovered without any complications (Supplemental Table 1).

### Respiratory syncytial virus in outpatient children with bronchiolitis: continuous virus circulation during the nonepidemic period [^112ogdhF]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

In France, parents have the choice to visit pediatricians or general practitioners as first-line clinicians for their children. In addition, children < 6 years old can visit free public centers (mother and infant health protection centers) which are mainly for follow-up visits and immunizations than for acute illnesses. About 40% of the visits for children < 1 year old, and 30% for children < 2 years old are by pediatricians. For children < 2 years old, about 65% of the visits are performed by general practitioners. For this study (outpatients respiratory syncytial virus study), children were enrolled by 45 pediatricians from the pediatric and ambulatory research in infectious diseases network between February 9, 2021 and May 2, 2022. These pediatricians were located in 10 of the 13 regions in metropolitan France. Children < 2 years old with a first episode of bronchiolitis were prospectively enrolled after parental written informed consent. As required by the French law, research study participation was only proposed for children with social health insurance. Bronchiolitis was defined as the association of 1 or more symptoms among fever, cough, otalgia, rhinopharyngitis or decrease in appetite with 1 or more symptoms among wheezing, crackles, diminished vesicular murmur and breathing difficulties. For each patient, a single nasopharyngeal swab was taken for triple rapid diagnostic testing for RSV, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. The BioSynex triple test (BioSynex Combo COVID-FLU-RSV BSS test) was used for younger children with small nostrils while for older children, the triple test AAZ (COVID-VIRO ALL IN TRIPLEX; AAZ-LMB) was used. Then, the pediatrician completed an electronic case report form in a secure database. Data on hospitalization were completed at day 0 by the pediatrician who enrolled the patient.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine is efficacious in older adults with underlying medical conditions [^115RoMto]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy Assessments

Surveillance for ARI was done through spontaneous reporting by the participants (starting on day 1 [i.e. day of vaccine/placebo administration]) and through scheduled site staff contacts with the participants (starting on day 31), as previously described. Scheduled contacts (by phone, email, text message, or other means) occurred every 2 weeks during the RSV season and every month between seasons, with a season lasting from 1 October to 30 April in the Northern Hemisphere and from 1 March to 30 September in the Southern Hemisphere. For each suspected ARI, an assessment visit was planned (ideally 48 hours and maximum 6 days after ARI onset), during which the investigator or staff member performed a physical examination, measured body temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation to assess if the ARI met the case definition. If the ARI met the case definition, nasal and throat swabs were obtained by the site staff. Starting from day 31, participants also performed nasal self-swabs (preferably within 48 hours and maximum 5 days after ARI onset). Swabs were used to test for the presence of RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.

ARI was defined as the presence of at least 2 respiratory symptoms or signs or at least 1 respiratory and 1 systemic symptom or sign, lasting for at least 24 hours. LRTD was defined as the presence of at least 2 lower respiratory symptoms or signs (including at least 1 lower respiratory sign) or at least 3 lower respiratory symptoms, lasting for at least 24 hours (Supplementary methods). Upper respiratory symptoms were nasal congestion/rhinorrhea and sore throat; lower respiratory symptoms were new/increased sputum, cough, or dyspnea; lower respiratory signs were new/increased wheezing, or crackles/rhonchi, increased respiratory rate, low/decreased oxygen saturation, and need for oxygen supplementation; systemic symptoms/signs were fever/feverishness, fatigue, body aches, headache, and decreased appetite. All LRTD cases (meeting the case definition or reported by the investigator but not meeting the case definition) that were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to be RSV-associated were reviewed by an external adjudication committee (Supplementary methods). Only cases confirmed as RSV-LRTD by this committee were included in the current analyses.

### Human coronavirus NL63 infection in Canada [^111Yh7o1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The isolation of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) in The Netherlands raised questions about its contribution to respiratory illness. In this study, a total of 525 respiratory specimens, collected in Canada primarily during the winter months of 2001–2002, were tested for HCoV-NL63; 19 tested positive for HCoV-NL63, demonstrating virus activity during January-March 2002. Patients with HCoV-NL63 were 1 month-100 years old (median age, 37 years). The main clinical presentations were fever (15/19), sore throat (5/19), and cough (9/19), and 4 patients were hospitalized. These results provide evidence for the worldwide distribution of HCoV-NL63.

IDSA serologic testing — limited potential uses and test types: The panel identified very few clinical scenarios in which serologic testing may be useful, including assisting in the diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) and using a negative spike antibody test to identify immunocompromised patients who are candidates for immune therapy or to prioritize monoclonal therapies when supplies are limited. When antibody testing is done, the panel makes a weak recommendation for using SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgG/IgM, or total antibodies and against using IgM; IgA tests were not considered because of past poor performance and rare testing in clinical laboratories.

### Clinical policy for well-appearing infants and children younger than 2 years of age presenting to the emergency department with fever [^116JKXz2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Fever in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years — urinary tract infection risk predictors and testing (Level C): Infants and children at increased risk for urinary tract infection include females younger than 12 months, uncircumcised males, nonblack race, fever duration greater than 24 hours, higher fever (≥ 39°C), negative test result for respiratory pathogens, and no obvious source of infection. Although the presence of a viral infection decreases the risk, no clinical feature has been shown to effectively exclude urinary tract infection. Physicians should consider urinalysis and urine culture testing to identify urinary tract infection in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years with a fever ≥ 38°C (100.4°F), especially among those at higher risk for urinary tract infection. Level A recommendations. None specified. Level B recommendations. None specified.

### Pediatric fever [^1124saku]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Pediatric fever is a common complaint in children. The most common cause is self-limited viral infection. However, neonates and young infants are evaluated and treated differently than older, vaccinated, and clinically evaluable children. Neonates should be admitted to the hospital, young infants in the second month of life may be risk stratified, and those deemed low risk on testing may be sent home with close follow-up. Children older than 2 months may be evaluated clinically for signs of bacterial infection that require intervention. Urinary tract infections cause more than 90% of serious bacterial illness in children, and younger children have a higher incidence of infection.

### Heterogeneity in the evaluation of suspected MIS-C: a cross-sectional vignette-based survey [^112HESUV]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is an emerging, rare but severe complication of COVID-19 that can result in life-threatening multisystem organ failure and death. MIS-C develops weeks to months following infection with SARS-CoV-2 and presents with unremitting fever and a constellation of symptoms including rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, edema of the hands/feet, oral mucosal changes, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and neurological symptoms. Cardiac involvement is common; almost half of patients require vasopressor support and 80% require intensive care. Because of the range of clinical presentations and risk for rapid progression, early diagnosis and treatment are key. The pathophysiology of MIS-C is not well understood, but SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia from gastric sources triggering a superantigen-like hyperinflammation post-viral inflammatory process is suggested. The criteria for MIS-C diagnosis established by the Center for Disease Control include patients less than 21 years old presenting with fever (> 38.0℃) for more than 24 h, laboratory evidence of inflammation and multisystem involvement, who require hospitalization, without an alternative diagnosis, and with known infection or exposure to COVID-19 within the four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, no definitive diagnostic test for MIS-C exists.

Guidelines have evolved to aid in the diagnosis of MIS-C, but existing laboratory tests lack specificity. Several professional associations have put forward guidelines for a MIS-C diagnostic approach, including the American College of Rheumatology and the American Academy of Pediatrics. From these guidelines, it is recommended that patients with persistent fever and other accompanying symptoms have lab work performed to look for evidence of inflammation and assess cardiac, renal, hematologic, and hepatic function. Given the potential for rapid progression, there is a low threshold to initiate this workup. These guidelines have significantly changed the standard of care and shifted the paradigm for children who present with 1–2 days of fever. If there is no evidence of bacterial infection, providers would routinely send febrile children home with a diagnosis of a viral illness prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, with the current guidelines, many of these patients now have labs drawn, imaging done, and are admitted to the hospital for monitoring. The laboratory tests obtained are non-specific and difficult to interpret. While certain findings may increase a clinician's suspicion for MIS-C, such as elevated inflammatory or cardiac markers, diagnosis remains challenging, and practitioners face variable degrees of uncertainty.

Regarding preventative measures for rheumatic fever, more specifically with respect to primary prevention, testing, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not test for GAS pharyngitis in < 3 years old pediatric patients because ARF is rare in this age group and the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and the classic presentation of streptococcal pharyngitis are uncommon. Consider testing selected patients of this age group in the presence of risk factors, such as an older sibling with group A streptococcal infection.

### Recurrent flu-like illness with migrating pulmonary infiltrates of unknown aetiology [^116cZF1i]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Migrating pulmonary infiltrates present a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. We report on eight patients (mean age 51 years, range 32–78 years, with a prolonged history of migrating pulmonary infiltrates of unknown aetiology despite a very elaborate search for infectious causes, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or inhalation fever due to occupational or domestic exposure to fungi, or to other environmental causes, and for humoral or cellular immunological incompetence. These patients (one male, seven females) presented with recurrent episodes (mean 6, range 2–13) of a flu-like illness, often with cough, wheezing and pleuritic chest pain, but without systemic involvement. Previous medical histories were unremarkable. There was no relation with smoking habits, occupation, drug use or other possible exposures. Biochemical data were non-specific. There was no peripheral nor pulmonary eosinophilia; total IgE was normal, with negative RASTs and precipitins to a variety of antigens. Cultures and serological tests for bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc were non-contributory. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral migratory pulmonary infiltrates, with a predilection for the middle and lower lung zones, often with a minor-to-moderate pleural effusion. Lung function tests were usually normal; at the most a slight decrease in diffusing capacity was noted in some patients. There was no or only a slight response to antimicrobials; systemic corticosteroids were not given. Further evolution was benign with patients being asymptomatic between the episodes. Despite elaborate investigations, the cause of these 'pneumonias' remains frustratingly unknown.

### Viral and bacterial coinfection of the respiratory tract in a 10-month-old child [^113NRE6W]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 10-month-old child, immunised appropriately for age, presented with a history of cough, vomiting, diarrhoea, increased work of breathing and eye redness for 1week. She was treated for suspected bronchiolitis with supportive oxygen and hypertonic saline nebulisation. In view of continuing fever spikes and persistent oxygen requirement, she was evaluated further. Her inflammatory markers were raised, blood film showed neutrophils left shift with toxic granulations and chest X-ray was suggestive of the right upper lobe segmental atelectasis suggestive of a bacterial infection. Her nasopharyngeal aspirate for multiplex tandem PCR was positive for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and Bordetella species. She was treated with oral clarithromycin for 5 days which improved her symptoms. She was discharged with further follow-up. Coinfection with bacteria or atypical bacteria in children with acute respiratory tract infection is common and this coinfection can induce serious illness.

### Information for pediatric healthcare providers | COVID-19… [^114HqjfC]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

This content provides clinicians and public health professionals with key information and evidence for clinical considerations when diagnosing and managing pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Incubation period and clinical presentation Studies performed during high levels of Omicron variant transmission reported a median incubation period of 3–4 days 1, 2 The most common symptoms of COVID-19 in children are fever and cough, but many children can experience sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache, fatigue, shortness of breath, or gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. 3, 4, 5, 6. Some case studies conducted during high levels of Omicron variant transmission have reported a substantial increase in croup during a decline in the prevalence of all other respiratory viral pathogens known to cause croup 7,
8.

The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children can be similar to those of other infections and noninfectious processes, making symptom-based screening for identification of SARS-CoV-2 in children particularly challenging 9. Severity and underlying medical conditions Most children with SARS-CoV-2 infection experience asymptomatic or mild illness, but some children are at risk of developing severe illness, including hospitalization, admission to an ICU, placement on invasive mechanical ventilation, and death
10. Studies have found that some underlying medical conditions including obesity; diabetes; cardiac, lung, and neurologic disorders; and medical complexity increase the risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 11, 12, 13, 14, and having more than one pre-existing comorbidity is associated with an increased risk of severe illness 12, 15.

Laboratory and radiographic findings In addition to viral testing, many hospitalized and ambulatory patients will be evaluated with laboratory tests and radiographic studies. Many children will have abnormal vital signs and markers of inflammation when hospitalized for COVID-19 16. A study of over 10, 000 hospitalized children found that lower blood pressure, higher heart and respiratory rate, and abnormal markers of inflammation, including D-dimers and ferritin were associated with severe illness in children
16. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children MIS-C generally occurs 2–6 weeks following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it presents with fever, multisystem organ involvement, and elevated laboratory markers of inflammation. Patients with MIS-C are often critically ill, and studies suggest that more than 50% of patients can require ICU admission.
