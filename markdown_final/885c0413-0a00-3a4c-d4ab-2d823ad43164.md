## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which homicide offenses the court should instruct the jury on in a common-law jurisdiction when a man discovers his wife having sex with a neighbor, grabs a gun, and shoots the neighbor dead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prima facie case for murder and whether malice aforethought is present. Then, I should verify whether adequate provocation exists to support voluntary manslaughter. Next, I will examine whether involuntary manslaughter is plausible given the facts. After that, I need to check whether any theory of justification, such as self-defense or defense of others, could apply. Finally, I will synthesize the instruction set and select the best answer choice, making sure I am not overextending beyond what the facts reasonably support.

> Let me first confirm the prima facie case for murder. Under common law, murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, which includes intent to kill, intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, depraved-heart recklessness, or felony murder; here, the defendant intentionally shot and killed the victim, so malice aforethought is present unless negated by a defense or mitigating circumstance, which means murder must be instructed if supported by the evidence [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the possibility of voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter applies when there is adequate provocation that would arouse a sudden heat of passion in a reasonable person, there was no cooling-off period, and there was a causal connection between the provocation and the killing; discovering a spouse in the act of adultery is a classic example of adequate provocation in many common-law jurisdictions, so the jury should be instructed on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser-included offense if the defense presents evidence supporting heat of passion and lack of cooling off [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about involuntary manslaughter. Involuntary manslaughter typically requires either criminal negligence or an unlawful act not amounting to a felony; here, the defendant intentionally used deadly force, so neither criminal negligence nor a mere unlawful act fits the facts, and there is no evidentiary basis for instructing on involuntary manslaughter in this scenario, so I should exclude it from the instruction set [^notfound].

> I need to check whether justifiable homicide is in play. Justification requires a reasonable belief in the need to use deadly force in self-defense or defense of others, or in some jurisdictions defense of habitation; the facts do not show the victim posed a threat of death or serious bodily harm to the defendant or anyone else, nor do they show a home-invasion scenario justifying deadly force, so there is no evidentiary basis to instruct on justifiable homicide here [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize the instruction set. The court should instruct on murder because the evidence supports malice aforethought, and it should also instruct on voluntary manslaughter because discovering adultery can constitute adequate provocation reducing murder to manslaughter if the jury finds heat of passion and no cooling off; involuntary manslaughter and justifiable homicide are not supported by the evidence and should not be instructed, so the correct scope is murder and voluntary manslaughter [^notfound].

> I should double-check the answer choices. Option D matches murder and voluntary manslaughter, which aligns with the analysis; options that include involuntary manslaughter or justifiable homicide overstate what the facts support, and options that omit murder ignore the prima facie case, so D is the best choice [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **D. Murder and voluntary manslaughter**. The court should instruct the jury on murder because the defendant intentionally killed the victim, and on voluntary manslaughter because discovering a spouse in adultery can constitute adequate provocation that reduces murder to manslaughter if the jury finds the defendant acted in the heat of passion without a cooling-off period. Involuntary manslaughter is not supported because there is no evidence of criminal negligence or an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, and justifiable homicide is not supported because there is no evidence of self-defense or defense of others [^notfound].

## Legal analysis

### Murder

Murder is the **unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought**. Malice aforethought includes intent to kill, intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, depraved heart recklessness, or felony murder. Here, the defendant intentionally shot and killed the victim, establishing prima facie murder [^notfound].

---

### Voluntary manslaughter

Voluntary manslaughter is a **lesser-included offense** of murder, defined as an intentional killing committed in the heat of passion due to adequate provocation. Adequate provocation must be such that it would arouse a sudden and intense passion in a reasonable person, causing them to lose self-control. Discovering a spouse in the act of adultery is a classic example of adequate provocation in common law jurisdictions [^notfound]. If the jury finds that the defendant acted in the heat of passion without a cooling-off period, they may reduce the charge from murder to voluntary manslaughter [^notfound].

---

### Involuntary manslaughter

Involuntary manslaughter typically involves an **unintentional killing** resulting from criminal negligence or an unlawful act not amounting to a felony. There is no evidence here of criminal negligence or an unlawful act that would support involuntary manslaughter; the defendant intentionally shot the victim, so this charge is not appropriate [^notfound].

---

### Justifiable homicide

Justifiable homicide occurs when the killing is legally excused, such as in **self-defense** or defense of others. There is no evidence that the defendant reasonably believed he or others were in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, so justifiable homicide is not supported [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The court should instruct the jury on **murder and voluntary manslaughter** because the facts support both the prima facie case for murder and the potential mitigation to voluntary manslaughter based on adequate provocation. Involuntary manslaughter and justifiable homicide are not supported by the evidence and should not be instructed [^notfound].

### Self-manslaughter and the forensic classification of self-inflicted death [^e5b358b2]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2007). Low credibility.

By emphasising the intentions underlying suicidal behaviour, suicidal death is distinguished from accidental death in standard philosophical accounts on the nature of suicide. A crucial third class of self-produced deaths, deaths in which agents act neither intentionally nor accidentally to produce their own deaths, is left out by such accounts. Based on findings from psychiatry, many life-threatening behaviours, if and when they lead to the agent's death, are suggested to be neither intentional nor accidental, with many apparently suicidal behaviours being of this sort, especially the so-called "cries for help". This category may be usefully analogised to the existing legal category of manslaughter.

### COVID-19 amplified racial disparities in the US criminal legal system [^e1aef09d]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

"The Director of the Department of Corrections is authorized to consider early release for individuals with less than one year left to serve while the COVID-19 emergency declaration is in effect. Offenders convicted of a Class 1 felony or a sexually violent offense are not eligible for consideration. The exact number of individuals eligible for early release consideration will change depending on the length of the emergency declaration order. The [Department of Corrections] will identify those that are eligible for consideration using the procedures it has developed to ensure public safety and will notify offenders who are to be released under the early release plan. A diagnosis of COVID-19 is not a release factor.

The following Early Release Criteria will be utilized in considering an incarcerated person for early release pursuant to legislation:
Release Date: The inmate's Good Time Release Date must be calculated and verified in order for the incarcerated to be considered.
Inmate Medical Condition: The inmate's medical condition will be considered.
Offense History: By legislative mandate, early release does not apply to inmates convicted of a Class 1 felony or a sexually violent offense. Consideration for early release will be based on the seriousness of the current offense, in descending order as follows: Non-violent Offense, Felony Weapons Offenses, Involuntary Manslaughter, Voluntary Manslaughter, Robbery, Felony Assault, Abduction, Murder, Sex Offense.
Viable Home Plan: The incarcerated person must have a documented approved home plan to be considered.
Good Time Earning Level: The inmate's current good time earning level must be I or II to be considered.
No Active Detainers: Inmates must have no active detainer to be considered.
No Sexually Violent Predator Predicate Offenses: Inmates convicted of one or more sexually violent offenses established in §37.2–903 of the Code of Virginia are not eligible pursuant to legislation.
Recidivism Risk: Inmates must have a risk of recidivism of medium (5–7) or low (1–4), as identified by the validated COMPAS instrument, to be considered".

### Medical manslaughter: resolving circularity [^6d3e8404]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The legal basis for prosecution and conviction for gross negligence manslaughter has failed to provide prosecutors, judges, and juries with sufficient certainty as to what constitutes the offense in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. It remains to be seen whether 'revised guidance' or a plea for clearer understanding of the elements of the offense of gross negligence manslaughter as set out in the rapid policy review will be a sufficient remedy to allay doctors fears, or whether an entirely new approach is required. If the latter, then founding the charge on the basis of a betrayal of trust between the patient and her doctor may represent a concept that the jury can recognize and empathize with. If a jury can understand a binary decision of betrayal vs nonbetrayal, then the judge's task of direction will be simplified, less ambiguous, providing certainty. At the same time, the Crown Prosecution Service of the UK may find it easier to identify the rare cases of betrayal of trust that merit prosecution. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V; expert opinion.

Patients frequently present to the emergency department (ED) with acute suicidal and homicidal thoughts. These patients require timely evaluation, with determination of disposition by either voluntary or involuntary hospitalization or discharge with appropriate outpatient follow-up. Safety concerns should be prioritized for patients as well as ED staff. Patient dignity and autonomy should be respected throughout the process.

### Externalist argument against medical assistance in dying for psychiatric illness [^29c70b6d]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding terminology, throughout the paper, I use the expression 'psychiatric MAiD' to refer to MAiD for psychiatric illness. However, I will only be discussing the voluntary provision of MAiD, where the patient has requested and consented to the intervention. Involuntary euthanasia, which is widely regarded as morally impermissible and a criminal offence in all jurisdictions, will not be discussed here. And so, whenever I use the expression 'psychiatric MAiD' in this paper, I am only referring to the voluntary provision of MAiD for psychiatric illness.

The Dead of the Irish Revolution identified just two cases where rape or attempted rape was definitely involved in deaths. An alleged rapist, ex-soldier Michael Joseph Murray, was shot by an off-duty soldier in Cork City who heard Margaret O'Sullivan's cries for help at night and confronted him, unintentionally shooting him. The girl's clear evidence was that Murray 'knocked me down & bit my cheek' and was on top of her when the soldier intervened. So familiar was the practice of bobbing that the soldier testified that when he 'first saw something on the ground and heard screams I thought a girl was having her hair cut off. But when I got nearer I could see that a civilian was trying to molest a girl'. A court of inquiry found that Murray was 'attempting to rape one Margaret O'Sullivan an unmarried girl against her will'. The unnamed soldier who inadvertently shot him was later acquitted of manslaughter by a court martial. The second case, the horrific rape and murder of Kate Maher, is discussed in detail below.

The killing by combatants of women for personal reasons

Seven instances have been identified between 1917 and 1921 where women died through the actions of combatants — or in one case at the hands of a person held to be a strong supporter of the independence movement — where there are indications that personal motivations were involved. In all these cases, investigations were clearly affected by the disturbed condition of the country. Furthermore, in six of the seven cases (see table 1) where men were charged with the murder or manslaughter of women, justice was administered by military courts established under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act in August 1920. Such courts, designed for internal military disciplinary purposes and composed of officers most of whom had no legal training and experience, were inherently unsatisfactory in dealing with cases which were essentially civilian in character.

Regulatory recognition orders of these sorts not only prevent unjust prosecutions against health care and emergency relief workers but also offer a rudimentary form of medicine regulation for countries currently lacking it and can serve as a stepping-stone toward instituting a full-blown medicine regulatory authority. In that sense, the Model Law is not strictly about criminalizing bad quality medicines, but also building the regulatory capacity in countries so that good quality medicines eventually become the norm.

### The global prevalence of intimate partner homicide: a systematic review [^fb3ed737]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Homicide is an important cause of premature mortality globally, but evidence for the magnitude of homicides by intimate partners is scarce and hampered by the large amount of missing information about the victim-offender relationship. The objective of the study was to estimate global and regional prevalence of intimate partner homicide.

Methods

A systematic search of five databases (Medline, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy, and Web of Science) yielded 2167 abstracts, and resulted in the inclusion of 118 full-text articles with 1122 estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner homicide after double-blind screening. All studies were included that reported the number or proportion of women or men who were murdered by an intimate partner in a country, province, or town, using an inclusive definition of an intimate partner. Additionally, a survey of official sources of 169 countries provided a further 53 estimates. We selected one estimate per country-year using a quality assessment decision algorithm. The median prevalence of intimate partner homicide was calculated by country and region overall, and for women and men separately.

Findings

Data were obtained for 66 countries. Overall 13·5% (IQR 9·2–18·2) of homicides were committed by an intimate partner, and this proportion was six times higher for female homicides than for male homicides (38·6%, 30·8–45·3, vs 6·3%, 3·1–6·3). Median percentages for all (male and female) and female intimate partner homicide were highest in high-income countries (all, 14·9%, 9·2–18·2; female homicide, 41·2%, 30·8–44·5) and in southeast Asia (18·8%, 11·3–18·8; 58·8%, 58·8–58·8). Adjustments to account for unknown victim-offender relationships generally increased the prevalence, suggesting that results presented are conservative.

Interpretation

At least one in seven homicides globally and more than a third of female homicides are perpetrated by an intimate partner. Such violence commonly represents the culmination of a long history of abuse. Strategies to reduce homicide risk include increased investment in intimate partner violence prevention, risk assessments at different points of care, support for women experiencing intimate partner violence, and control of gun ownership for people with a history of violence. Improvements in country-level data collection and monitoring systems are also essential, because data availability and quality varied strongly across regions.

### Stopping murder by medicine: introducing the model law on medicine crime [^a9756efd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

Although it may sound odd to persons who are not lawyers to base distinctions on intent rather than tangible physical properties, actually this is a bedrock principle of criminal justice. Consider, for example, the distinctions between striking and killing someone while driving a car at the speed limit (accidental homicide), striking and killing them while speeding (negligent homicide), or striking and killing them intentionally (murder). The physical result (death) is the same, but the intent is immensely different, and obviously justice cannot overlook the gradations.

Similarly, the Model Law contains prohibitions and penalties that are calibrated in accordance with intent, so as to distinguish acts that are merely accidental, criminally negligent, or criminally intentional. The Model Law's definitions of "substandard" and "falsified" furnish the cornerstones of that distinction. The definitions are worded broadly enough to cover any sort of medicine: for example, allopathic medicines, traditional medicines, experimental medicines, compounded medicines, and even ingredients of medicines. Part I also contains definitions of "unregistered" medicines, which are those not approved by the local drug regulatory authority, and "counterfeit" medicines, which are those that violate trademark laws (although in this definition counterfeit medicines affect only intellectual property and are not the subject of the Model Law).

Crucially, all these definitions in Part I follow the philosophy of backward compatibility. The Model Law imposes no normative judgment about which medicines are falsified, substandard, unregistered, counterfeit, and so forth, but rather bases that nomenclature on a country's existing rules: for example, a substandard medicine is one that fails to meet the required specifications of the country's medicine regulatory authority. Thus, even if countries use different nomenclature than the Model Law, their existing rules are usually enough to make the nomenclature function, making it easy to implement the Model Law into real law. For example, at least four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (the United States, United Kingdom, China, and France), plus the bulk medicine-exporting country, India, already criminalize wrongful acts involving medicine that are intentional or reckless — which is tantamount to criminalizing falsified medicines and recklessly substandard medicines in the Model Law's nomenclature.

### Stopping murder by medicine: introducing the model law on medicine crime [^c7743b06]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

The iatrogenic pandemic of untreated illness related to falsified and substandard medicines is intolerable, but has a logical explanation: in many countries, inadequate laws make it barely illegal to manufacture or distribute poor-quality medicines. The law hardly punishes those who intentionally or recklessly deal in falsified or substandard medicine, when clearly it should criminalize these perpetrators in proportion to the grievous — even fatal — injury they inflict on public health. To solve this omission, this article presents a new Model Law on Medicine Crime, which countries may freely use as a template for strengthening their national laws. The Model Law includes criminal prohibitions against manufacturing, trafficking, or selling poor-quality medicines; principles for appropriately punishing offenders; special provisions for Internet-based medicine crimes; tools for encouraging whistle-blowers to cooperate with law enforcement; incentives for developing governments to strengthen their drug regulatory capacity; and important exceptions to prevent the law being abused, such as to prevent the prosecution of legitimate medical researchers or to prevent good-quality generic medicines being seized while in transit. The Model Law is discussed and explained and is offered free of charge under a Creative Commons license to any governments wanting to implement it.

Part VI contains rules to guide the administration of justice. These include some pragmatic exemptions to ensure that the Model Law is not abused is ways that are overzealous, disproportionate, or unjust. Most important are the exemptions that forbid prosecutions of persons who commit technical violations of the law, but for understandable reasons, because without pragmatic exemptions the Model Law could be abused to prosecute scientists using placebos in a clinical trial (because placebos are intentionally mislabeled to deceive, which technically makes them falsified), or even patients who stash a few pills of "medicine A" in a bottle labeled "medicine B" for their personal convenience (and who among us has never done that when packing for a business trip or holiday). Importantly, Part VI also forbids prosecutions where the only issue is that a medicine is generic or violates trademarks, and this is to ensure that the Model Law remains a tool for protecting public health and is not turned into a cudgel for enforcing intellectual property (Box 2).

### Italian appeal court: a genetic predisposition to commit murder? [^f1015bff]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

A few months ago, the controversial debate on connection between genetic variants and antisocial behaviour gained renewed prominence after the sentence of an Italian judge who decided to further reduce the prison sentence of a person convicted of murder by 1 year — from 9 to 8 years — because he was found to be a carrier of a few genetic variants thought to be associated with a predisposition to aggressiveness. We discuss the social implication of this view, the lack of evidence of the clinical utility of this test, and in particular the risks of offering susceptibility testing in the context of legal proceedings.

### Deaths due to use of lethal force by law enforcement: findings from the national violent death reporting system, 17 U.S. States, 2009–2012 [^40158a59]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The National Violent Death Reporting System

NVDRS is a state-based surveillance system that links data on violent deaths (e.g. suicide, homicide, legal intervention) from death certificates; coroner/medical examiner reports; and LE reports in an incident-based, confidential data set. Legal intervention deaths, as defined within NVDRS, are fatalities where the victim is killed by a LE officer acting while on duty. c Fatalities resulting from LE action are included without regard to whether the death was intentional or legally justifiable. Data abstractors in each participating state review investigative findings from each data source and abstract information on incident circumstances and characteristics of victims and officers using standardized coding guidance.NVDRS also includes two narratives generated by the state abstractor containing a brief description of the incident based on information from the coroner/medical examiner and LE reports.

Case Identification and Narrative Coding

Cases in the current study originated from statewide data for the 17 states d participating in NVDRS during the study period. All cases classified in NVDRS as legal intervention deaths or homicides in which the perpetrator was an LE officer were selected and narratives were reviewed to ensure they met the NVDRS case definition for legal intervention deaths. In addition to analysis of existing NVDRS variables, case narratives were reviewed and coded by the authors for an additional ten variables developed for the current study. These included:

1 number of civilians killed by victim e in the 24 hours preceding their death;
2 number of officers killed by victim;
3 number of other people killed by officers in the incident;
4 whether officers were injured (by the victim or others involved in the incident);
5 whether the victim had a weapon (including objects used as weapons, such as vehicles, or perceived as weapons, such as toy guns); and
6 whether the victim posed an immediate threat (perceived or actual) to LE or civilians (defined by verbal death threats while armed, use of a weapon against or physical assault of LE/civilian, or physical expression of threats, such as pointing a firearm).

### Separating truth from alternative facts: 37 years of guns, murder, and violence across the US [^fa264bc8]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Gun violence remains a significant public health problem that is both understudied and underfunded, and plagued by inadequate or inaccessible data sources. Over the years, numerous trauma centers have attempted to use local registries to study single-institutional trends, however, this approach limits generalizability to our national epidemic. In fact, even easily accessible, health-centered data from the CDC lack national relevance because they are limited to those enrolled states only. We sought to examine how publicly available law enforcement data from all 50 states might complement our understanding of circumstances and demographics surrounding national firearm death and help forge the first step in partnering law enforcement with trauma centers.

Methods

All homicide that occurred in the US during a 37-year period ending in 2016 was analyzed. Primary data files were obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and comprised the database. Data analyzed included homicide type, situation, circumstance, firearm type, and demographic characteristics of victims and offenders. The proportion of firearm-related homicide was stratified by year and compared over time using simple linear regression.

Results

There were 485,288 incidents of firearm homicide analyzed (64% of 752,935 total homicides). Most victims were male (85%), black (53%), and a mean age of 33 years; offenders were predominantly male (67%), black (39%), and a mean age of 30 years. Fifty-four percent of all homicide involved a single victim and single offender, followed by a single victim and unknown offender(s) (31%); 4% of firearm homicide had multiple victims. Overall, handguns, shotguns, and rifles accounted for 76%, 7%, and 5% of all firearm homicide, respectively; 11% had no firearm type listed and < 1% were other gun or unknown. Linear regression analysis identified a significant increase in the proportion of firearm-related homicide from 61% in 1980 to 71% in 2016 (β = 0.25; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Gun violence represents an ongoing public health concern, with the proportion of firearm homicide steadily and significantly increasing from 1980 to 2016. Homicide data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation can serve to supplement trauma registry data by helping to define gun violence patterns. However, stronger partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and trauma centers are necessary to better characterize firearm type and resultant injury patterns, direct prevention efforts and firearm policy, and reduce gun-related deaths.

### Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking: is medical support ethically justified? [^45afb094]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Thus, there are realistic scenarios (A–C; encouragement, promise, support to continue) in which medical support in the context of VSED fulfils the two critical conditions of suicide assistance, namely sharing the patient's intention to hasten death and the instrumental nature of the medical act for the initiation or completion of the suicidal act. However, medical support that does not concern VSED but rather the withdrawing or withholding of life-sustaining treatment obviously does not constitute assistance in suicide as treatment limitation is distinct from suicide.

### Sexual assault and fatal violence against women during the Irish war of independence, 1919–1921: kate maher's murder in context [^c98b91f8]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Army headquarters in Dublin provided general guidance to the replacement military courts. A court of inquiry, which like a civil inquest should take place within 24 hours of death, need only be convened 'where there is a suspicion that the death is the wilful act or the default of some other person or is self-inflicted'. Courts should consist of at least three officers, at least one of whom should be of field rank (a major or higher). Of the other members, 'where practicable and the nature of the case requires it', one could be an army doctor. Where death occurred in military hospitals, army medical officers conducted postmortems and gave evidence. But in most cases, the requirement for speed meant that the task fell on general practitioners in the locality where the death occurred. This was so irrespective of whether the victims were soldiers, police, rebels or civilians: the rudimentary postmortems on 16 of the ADRIC and RIC men killed in the celebrated — or notorious — Kilmichael ambush in November 1920 were performed by a local doctor whose own son, an RIC inspector, had been shot dead by the IRA weeks previously in another county (n.d.;).

Courts of inquiry were usually composed of a major and two junior officers, often recently commissioned second lieutenants. They could compel witnesses to attend on pain of a fine for failure to do so, but many civilians refused to participate for political reasons or for fear of IRA retribution. Medical personnel were paid to give evidence at the daily rate of £1.1s (a guinea), and received £5.5s.0 'for analysis of any matter or thing of or concerning any dead body', that is, conducting a postmortem. Proceedings were generally open to the public, but all or part of an inquiry could be held in camera to protect the identities of witnesses.

These new responsibilities placed an unwelcome additional burden on the army in disturbed areas. Douglas Wimberley described how as his battalion's adjutant he had to conduct civil registrations of births, deaths and marriages as well as 'all the inquests, of which… there were certainly plenty'. Describing many inquests as 'rather macabre', he recalled one inquiry where an infant had been asphyxiated with a rag.

### Child homicide perpetrators worldwide: a systematic review [^3911c0f9]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

The regional differences found in this study might represent real differences in patterns of child homicideor be a product of differences in the existence, completeness and quality of data for homicides among countries and regions. Data on the victim–perpetrator relationship is often only available if the information is reported. Some murders will never be resolved, which is strongly correlated with the quality of police investigations. In the case of child homicides, in particular, it is estimated that a significant number of child homicides are not recognised as homicides and therefore do not appear in official statistics. Studies on neonaticides, in particular, show that nearly all of them follow concealed pregnancies and lone birthsand that there often are difficulties in distinguishing death due to natural disorders from non-natural causes, especially in cases labelled sudden infant death syndrome. Routine surveillance systems have a poor record to capture homicides due to omission of care or deliberate neglect. Abrahams et al, for example, found in their South African study that a number of mothers abandoned their babies with the intention that they would die or with the hope that they would be found alive. As the motive behind this kind of abandonment is often not known, official statistics often do not capture them as homicides. There are also other limitations to this study. Averaging the proportion of perpetrators of child homicides across years to generate one estimate by country could have led to an overestimation or underestimation of certain types of perpetrator. Vast differences in the definitions of perpetrator categories only allowed crude comparisons across countries. Categorisation of perpetrators into parents, other family members, acquaintances, strangers and unknown did not capture nuances such as, for example, mothers' boyfriends, who were considered as acquaintances as there was a lack of information on whether they were solid family members or casual relationships. The restricted availability of data and age breakdowns also meant that the analysis could not be done for every age group or by gender.

### Firearm homicides of US children precipitated by intimate partner violence: 2003–2020 [^afdc9a74]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) for 2003 to 2020 from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (See Appendix 1 for list of states/jurisdictions included in this study and years of coverage for each). NVDRS is a state-based active surveillance system that captures data on violent deaths in all states/jurisdictions within the United States. Data from death certificates and LE and C/ME reports are entered into the NVDRS Web-based system by trained abstractors and linked into 1 incident record, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. Extensive details on NVDRS methodology can be found elsewhere. Child firearm homicides were defined using the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, underlying cause of death codes X85-Y09, Y87.1for children aged 0 to 17 years and with a weapon type of firearm (defined as a weapon that uses a powder charge to fire a projectile; excludes nonpowder guns such as BB or pellet guns and air or gas rifles). IPV-related was defined as a death that is related to immediate or ongoing conflict or violence between current or former intimate partners, including homicides that are associated with IPV that are not deaths of the intimate partners themselves (eg, a father kills his child[ren] because of conflict with his estranged wife).

### Associations between individual antipsychotics and the risk of arrests and convictions of violent and other crime: a nationwide within-individual study of 74 925 persons [^522ee837]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were criminal arrests for violent crime (e.g. homicide, assault, robbery, arson, any sexual offence, illegal threats, or intimidation) (Sariaslan et al.), drug-related crime and any crime. We also investigated convictions for crime. In separate analyses, to test the extent to which drug-related and other crime outcomes were associated with substance misuse, we examined acute substance intoxication, resulting in either hospitalization or death, as a secondary outcome.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^4ea3f98d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD suicide risk stratification — high acute risk includes "Suicidal ideation with intent to die by suicide and" "Inability to maintain safety independently without external help or support". "Patients will often have a plan for suicide and access to lethal means" and "might have also recently engaged in suicidal SDV (e.g., suicide attempt, preparatory behaviors)". Management states that "Patients typically require psychiatric hospitalization (either voluntary or involuntary) to maintain safety and aggressively target modifiable factors". "Patients must be directly observed on a secure unit and be kept in an environment with limited access to lethal means (e.g., kept away from sharps, cords, tubing, toxic substances)", and "During hospitalization, co-occurring psychiatric symptoms should also be addressed".

### Occupational homicides of law enforcement officers, 2003–2013: data from the national violent death reporting system [^a28a8e46]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The NVDRS is an active, state-based surveillance system that collects information on violent deaths in participating states. The NVDRS case definition for violent deaths includes homicides, suicides, deaths due to legal intervention, deaths of undetermined intent, unintentional firearm deaths, and deaths due to terrorism. The methods of NVDRS have been described previously. – The system links data from three required sources — death certificates, CME reports, and law enforcement reports — into a single record. The CME reports and law enforcement reports contain narratives with detailed information regarding the violent death and precipitating circumstances. Trained abstractors review these records and abstract the information into variables coded according to standardized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The abstractors also create an incident narrative that includes a description of the precipitating circumstances of death. Information is collected on victims (deceased individuals) and limited information is collected on alleged perpetrators (deceased or live suspects). An incident is defined as a single violent death, or multiple violent deaths if the deaths are related and the fatal injuries were inflicted < 24 hours apart. The incidents in this analysis were from data submitted by the 17 states participating in NVDRS during the study period: Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia (2003–2013); Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin (2004–2013); Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah (2005–2013); and Ohio (2011–2013). Analyses were conducted from December 2015 through June 2016.

### Child homicide perpetrators worldwide: a systematic review [^526406ba]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Flow chart of the systematic review.

In addition to the systematic review, we surveyed country statistics offices, ministries of justice, home offices or police headquarters of 169 WHO-listed countries to further identify country-level data for child homicide perpetrators and victim–perpetrator relationships. We received responses from 90 countries. Additionally, we made contact with homicide research experts to ask for unpublished data on child homicide perpetrators in their studies. In total, this lead to an additional inclusion of data for 24 countries.

The analysis consisted of two main steps — the selection of one estimate per country year and the calculation of the proportion of child homicides committed by different perpetrator categories for different age groups and by gender separately.

As several countries had more than one estimate available, an algorithm was used to develop a single estimate per country for each of the types of homicide and age group or gender analysed, to avoid potential double counting and to ensure to use the best quality estimates available. Where possible, comparable, non-overlapping data were combined. Otherwise, we chose an estimate according to the following hierarchical order: (1) nationally representative estimates were preferred to provincial estimates, which in turn were prioritised over estimates representing a single town or mortuary, as national studies or larger regional samples would be more generalisable to a country and even out local differences across regions or towns; (2) we chose estimates with more detailed information on the victim–perpetrator relationship, estimates that captured children of varied age groups as this would allow us to group them in a way that would allow comparisons with data from countries that had few perpetrator categories and age groupings; (3) studies that were more recent as it is unknown whether child homicide perpetration trends changed over time across the world; (4) estimates directly from statistics offices were preferred as we assumed that they would have received more checks than data from other sources; and (5) we preferred estimates that covered more years to estimates based on a few years as we assumed they would also be more generalisable and not be influenced by single events.

### Sexual assault and fatal violence against women during the Irish war of independence, 1919–1921: kate maher's murder in context [^8799af4d]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Women probably killed for personal reasons

Kate Maher's is one of three cases where women died at the hands of off-duty soldiers. The second is that of the elderly shopkeeper, Mary Maher, also of Tipperary, whose death from a blow to the head apparently inflicted by a private of the Northamptonshire Regiment seems to have occurred in a robbery which went wrong. A Private O'Brien was returned for trial by court martial, but the outcome is unknown. The third such case, that of Elizabeth 'Bessie' Carberry, is somewhat better documented. She was found suffocated in a Dublin city centre laneway on 27 October 1920 after neighbours heard a prolonged argument between her and a soldier with whom she had apparently been drinking. A 30-year-old single woman under five feet in height, she had recent convictions for drunkenness and soliciting (National Archives of Ireland, 1/44/15). The experienced Dublin City Coroner Dr Louis A. Byrne, no stranger to controversial inquests, ordered that two medical witnesses should conduct postmortems independently. They noted extensive bruises to her jaws and a 'severe bruise' behind her left ear and another on her right thigh. As her larynx was undamaged, both doctors surmised she had not been choked or strangled: 'The medical evidence was that death was due to suffocation and that the suffocation resulted from the pressure of a hand across the mouth' (Wicklow People, October 30, 1920, Dublin Evening Telegraph, October 28, 1920). A policeman stated that Bessie Carberry's 'legs were doubled up under her, and her clothing was disarranged, indicating a struggle' (Freeman's Journal, October 28, 1920; Irish Independent, 17 January 1921;). Police also found a regimental cap badge at the scene. The coroner directed the jury to return a verdict of death by suffocation, and of murder 'against a soldier unknown' (GRO Carberry, 29 October 1920). Lance Corporal Albert Hadley had been arrested nearby by a military curfew patrol: his cap badge was missing, and the knees of his trousers were wet as though he had been kneeling. In February 1921, by which time Dublin was under martial law, Hadley was court martialled for murder, or in the alternative manslaughter. Despite the medical and police evidence, no charge of sexual assault was laid. The case was quickly dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence, after it was shown that a second soldier from Hadley's unit had also lost a cap badge in Dublin that night (Wicklow People, 30 October 1920; Dublin Evening Telegraph, 28 October 1920;).

- current psychiatric conditions and current or past mental/behavioral health treatment

- psychiatric symptoms

- social determinants of health and adverse life events

- availability of lethal means

- physical health conditions

- demographic characteristics.

### Sexual assault and fatal violence against women during the Irish war of independence, 1919–1921: kate maher's murder in context [^c173283e]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

We should also consider three cases in which young women were killed by the weapons of policemen with whom they were personally involved. The policemen involved were temporary recruits — two Black and Tans, and one ADRIC.

Sarah Fitzpatrick, a Scottish war widow who had come to Dublin for an engagement as a chorus line dancer in a pantomime, apparently shot herself, perhaps by accident, as she was being escorted home by her ex-boyfriend, ADRIC District Inspector 'Tiny' Purchase. They had both been drinking, although he was on duty. Purchase maintained to a court of inquiry that Sarah Fitzpatrick often toyed with his weapon, and that it had discharged accidentally as she held it just outside her home. A doctor testified that Sarah Fitzpatrick's death was 'due to shock and haemorrhage from wounds in the heart', but was unable to form an opinion as to whether these were self-inflicted. One witness testified that they had all been drinking together that night in pubs near their home. She described 'Connie' as jolly, but stated that 'On one occasion she told me she that loved Tiny, and that if anything came between them she would put a bullet in him first and then in herself afterwards'. That conversation was overheard by two other co-residents. One of these also testified that another woman had claimed that she saw Purchase shoot Fitzpatrick, but dismissed this story as that woman was 'under the influence of drink, and I had an idea what class of girl she was', a clear imputation of immoral character. Although the medical witness said he was unable to form an opinion as to whether her wounds were self-inflicted, the court returned a verdict of suicide, and the death was registered as 'suicidal' from the information received from the military court of inquiry (GRO Fitzpatrick, 5 February 1921). The inadequacy of proceedings was noted by the military authorities: the general officer commanding Dublin district wrote that 'A case like this should have had a legal man on it. I do not think it is all satisfactory. Draw attention… to it & say that it shows in my opinion great slackness & want of supervision on the part of those responsible for the men of this [ADRIC] Coy [company]'. There was a 'large attendance of friends and theatre workers' at Sarah Fitzpatrick's funeral in Dublin, probably an indication of her perceived respectability as well as of general sympathy (Freeman's Journal and Irish Independent, February 9, 1921).

### Involuntary psychiatric hospitalization and its relationship to psychopathology and aggression [^9fdb14a9]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

The current study investigates the relationship between involuntary hospitalization, severity of psychopathology, and aggression. Adult psychiatric inpatients hospitalized from August, 2012 to January, 2013 were evaluated via the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). Individuals were compared regarding voluntariness of hospitalization. Of the 137 hospitalizations in the period, 71 were involuntary (INV). The variables associated with involuntariness were being brought to hospital by ambulance or police, and aggression in the first 24 h of admission. Risk of suicide at admission, and having personal income were associated with voluntariness. The dimensions of the BPRS associated with involuntary hospitalization were activation, resistance, and positive symptoms. Involuntary psychiatric hospitalization was associated with agitation, psychosis and aggression. The data support the indication of involuntary hospitalization for treatment of patients with severe mental illness.

Examples of Real Forensic Application

Case 1

The facts

The defendant was a 40-plus-year-old man charged with murder. In 2014, the man saw a jogger on the street and suddenly stopped and assaulted the woman, who reacted. After having beaten the woman severely, he threw the body off a cliff. The next day, he went back to the scene of the crime and masturbated on the corpse. After ∼3 months, he was interrogated by the police and immediately confessed the murder.

The descriptive diagnosis

The defendant was a 40-plus-year-old man who grew up in a rural mountain area. His parents divorced when he was nine. He had completed 5 years of education. He was married and had a son. A few years into the marriage, he suffered from severe head trauma due to a car accident and was hospitalized for 3 months. His marriage lasted < 2 years after his accident, and no relationship with the son was maintained. He was unable to keep a job for more than a few months since the accident. Moreover, he developed a serial pattern of criminal sexual behaviour. He was previously jailed for 1 year due to performing frottage and making vituperative comments to women on the street.

At the forensic psychiatric examination, no psychotic symptoms were evident, but the defendant did appear fatuous and avoidant. He seemed to not realize the severity or legal consequences of his behaviour. The neuropsychological examination revealed a borderline IQ, impaired verbal comprehension, and below-average working memory function. The defendant presented with severe frontal executive functioning deficits, in particular in the ability to inhibit automatic answers (as measured using the Stroop test) and behaviours (as measured using the frontal assessment battery). During the neuropsychological evaluation, his behaviour was oppositional; he was easily frustrated with negative feedback and had a tendency to become irritated and verbally aggressive towards the examiner.

### The violent or agitated patient [^1c901c58]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Violent and agitated patients are high risk because they may pose a physical threat to the staff, may harm themselves, and may have dangerous comorbidities and illness that are causing the violence. The emergency physician must quickly control these behaviors, and thoroughly identify and treat their etiology, while simultaneously protecting the patients' rights and reducing the risks of injury to themselves, other patients, and medical staff. This article highlights potentially high-risk situations and describes corresponding mitigation tactics.

### Possession: a clinical enigma [^5ffc37cc]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

This is a case of a 21-year-old lady who presented with history of episodes where she would display extraordinary strength while becoming aggressive towards her family members, speak in foreign language and display bizarre behaviour. The episode would last for 15–20 min and would resolve spontaneously. She would always claim amnesia for the event. This would remain irritable in the intervening period. The frequency of such episodes is at least three times a week. The family members took her to several faith healers with no improvement in her condition. On the suggestion of a family friend, the patient was brought in for consultation in the psychiatric clinic. The patient remained a diagnostic dilemma though there has been some reduction in intensity of such episodes on psychotropic medication. Unfortunately, there is no remission in episodes.

### Characterising the killing of girls and women in urban settings in latin America, 2000–2019: an analysis of variability and time trends using mortality data from vital registration systems [^615460a0]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Nearly all countries in Latin America have enacted legislation against femicide either as part of their penal code or as standalone legislation. Yet, femicide remains a contested legal category across the region, and how it is treated inside the legal system has important implications for its measurement. While some countries limit their definition to intimate partner relationships, others broaden the definition but require evidence of motive, sexual violence, and/or previous instances of violence. Moreover, some countries in the region use the term feminicide, a term introduced by Mexican scholar Marcela Lagarde, to emphasise the gender-based power dynamics embedded in the murder of girls and women and the state's complicity in these crimes. Researchers and activists alike have pointed to the fact that these varying definitions often do not allow for cross country or even within country comparisons of gender-related killings of girls and women. Yet, beyond the difficulty encountered in comparative research, relying on legal definitions is problematic because of the many victims that are left out of legal frameworks across the region. Decisions about which femicides are included or excluded from a country's legislation are linked to the historic and social contexts of each country. It is important to note that this problem is not exclusive to femicides. All indicators are human constructs and in fact, the definition of the less contested and more widely used homicide indicator also varies by region.

### The holocaust and medical ethics: the voices of the victims [^d229baef]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2008). Low credibility.

Fifty-nine years ago, Dr Leo Alexander published his now famous report on medicine under the Nazis. In his report he describes the two major crimes of German physicians. The participation of physicians in euthanasia and genocide and the horrible experiments performed on concentration camp prisoners in the name of science. In response to this gross violation of human rights by physicians, the Nuremberg military tribunal, which investigated and prosecuted the perpetrators of the Nazi war crimes, established ten principles of ethical conduct in medical research in 1949. Foremost among them was the need for voluntary consent of the human subject and that the experiment be conducted to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering. Notwithstanding all these important efforts and impressive achievements in understanding the ethical failings of Nazi physicians, the bioethical community has almost completely ignored the moral challenges facing the victims of the atrocities. These dilemmas and their responses have continued relevance for modern medicine.

Re-establishing or reinforcing trust between LE and many communities was identified as a core focus of the 2015 President's Task Force on 21 st Century Policing. Recommendations centered around approaches to improve procedural justice by acknowledging past injustices, increasing transparency and accountability, proactively engaging communities in positive interactions, and increasing workforce diversity. Public distrust of LE in the wake of legal intervention deaths is also fueled by the infrequency with which officers are sanctioned for wrongful action: A recent study found that among thousands of cases of fatal shootings by LE over the past decade, only 54 officers were charged and most were cleared or acquitted. Policies mandating independent investigation and prosecution have been recommended to increase transparency and trust in these investigations.

### Criminal records of homicide offenders [^a37a839d]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Homicide prevention strategies can be either targeted toward high-risk groups or addressed to the population at large. One high-risk group of particular interest is adults with a criminal record. But the prevalence of a criminal record among homicide offenders has not been reliably quantified, nor has the prevalence of criminal record in the general population.

Objective

To determine what portion of the homicide problem would be addressed by interventions linked to arrest or conviction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A case-control analysis was performed using a comprehensive data set of all arrests and felony convictions in Illinois for 1990–2001. Cases were defined as Illinois residents aged 18 to 64 years who were arrested for homicide in 2001. Controls were all other Illinois residents aged 18 to 64 years in 2001. Illinois criminal and juvenile record information for cases and controls was compiled for 1990–2000. Five definitions of previous record were considered (arrest, arrest for a violent crime, 5 or more arrests with at least 1 for a violent crime, felony conviction, and violent-felony conviction), each measured for 1990–2000 and for 1996–2000.

Main Outcome Measure

The population-attributable risk: the portion of homicide offenses that would be eliminated by a hypothetical intervention that reduced the offending risk of individuals with a record to the offending risk of those who lack a record.

Results

For 1990–2000, 42.6% of 884 cases had at least 1 felony conviction compared with 3.9% of nearly 7.9 million controls, for a population-attributable risk of 40.3% (95% CI, 37.0%-43.8%); among cases, 71.6% had experienced any arrest from 1990–2000 compared with 18.2% of controls, for a population-attributable risk of 65.3% (95% CI, 61.6%-68.8%). For 1996–2000, the population-attributable risk among individuals with a felony conviction or any arrest was 31.0% (95% CI, 27.9%-34.2%) and 58.5% (95% CI, 54.9%-62.1%), respectively.

Conclusions

Interventions after arrest or conviction, such as supervised release, imprisonment, correctional programs, or bans on firearm possession, are targeted toward a group that has relatively high incidence of lethal violence, but they leave a large portion of the problem untouched.

### The parasomnia defense in sleep-related homicide: a systematic review and a critical analysis of the medical literature [^89e51f99]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

This review critically analyzes the forensic application of the Parasomnia Defense in homicidal incidents, drawing from medical literature on disorders of arousal (DOA) and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted until October 16, 2022. We screened English-language articles in peer-reviewed journals discussing murders committed during sleep with a Parasomnia Defense. We followed PRISMA guidelines, extracting event details, diagnosis methods, factors influencing the acts, perpetrator behavior, timing, motives, concealment, mental experiences, victim demographics, and court verdicts. Three sleep experts evaluated each case. We selected ten homicides, four attempted homicides, and one homicide/attempted homicide that met inclusion/exclusion criteria. Most cases were suspected DOA as unanimously confirmed by experts. RBD cases were absent. Among aggressors, a minority reported dream-like experiences. Victims were primarily female family members killed in or near the bed by hands and/or with sharp objects. Objective sleep data and important crime scene details were often missing. Verdicts were ununiform. Homicides during DOA episodes, though rare, are documented, validating the Parasomnia Defense's use in forensics. RBD-related fatal aggression seems very uncommon. However, cases often lack diagnostic clarity. We propose updated guidelines to enhance future reporting and understanding of such incidents.

### State reporting requirements for involuntary holds, court-ordered guardianship, and the US national firearm background check system [^358fcb52]. JAMA Health Forum (2023). High credibility.

State Examples

For both court-determined cases (involuntary commitment and incompetence with or without guardianship), but not for the short-term emergency hold case, Arizona required reporting to NICS, but the process was convoluted and without a clear timeline. According to state law: "The court shall transmit [the individual's information] to the [state] supreme court. The supreme court shall transmit the case information and the date of the incompetency finding to the department of public safety.… The department of public safety shall transmit the information to the national instant criminal background check system". Arizona law had a similar procedure for restoration of rights (and removal from NICS) when an individual is "subsequently found competent", but required reporting within 10 days.

In Ohio, for both court-adjudicated cases but not for short-term holds, reporting to the state-based system was required (by the judge or chief clinical officer) within 7 days of the court order. Ohio's requirement reads: if "an individual is found by a court to be a mentally ill person subject to court order or becomes an involuntary patient other than one who is a patient only for purposes of observation, the probate judge who made the adjudication or a chief clinical officer of the hospital, community mental health services provider, or facility in which the person is an involuntary patient shall notify the office of the attorney general". Ohio required the Attorney General's office to compile these data and use them in the state system for criminal records checks and incompetency checks for applications for concealed handgun licenses. However, Ohio's state statute neither required nor prohibited NICS reporting, so information may not be visible to other states.

### Deaths due to use of lethal force by law enforcement: findings from the national violent death reporting system, 17 U.S. States, 2009–2012 [^cb414822]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Four case subtypes were coded based on a review of incident narratives (Tables 1 and 2). To further examine victim and incident characteristics associated with each case subtype, logistic regression analyses were run predicting subtype membership (Table 7). Fifty legal intervention fatalities (6.2%) were identified as unintentional with injuries occurring while in custody, during capture/restraint, while fleeing, or involving an innocent bystander. Unintentional cases were significantly less likely than other cases to involve a threat to LE, an armed victim, or evidence of alcohol use by the victim. Another 17.9% of cases were identified as potential "suicide by cop" incidents based on evidence (e.g. suicidal behavior/threats during incident, suicide note, prior expression of intent/desire to be killed by LE reported by an informant, taunting/asking LE to kill them during the incident) that the victim was suicidal and engaged in behavior to elicit the use of lethal force. "Suicide by cop" cases were significantly more likely than other cases to occur in a home rather than in public, involve victim alcohol intoxication, involve a white than black victim, and almost eight times more likely to involve an armed victim. IPV-related incidents, in which officers responded to an IPV complaint or a partner was threatened/assaulted during the event, accounted for 13.9% of cases. IPV-related cases were 3.8 times more likely to occur in a home and 2.8 times more likely to involve a threat to a civilian. In 21.7% of fatalities, there was evidence that the victim's mental/behavioral health, including behavior attributed to mental illness or substance use, was directly related to LE contact or use of force. Cases related to the victim's mental/behavioral health were significantly more likely to occur in a home, less likely to be precipitated by an alleged crime, less likely to involve injuries to LE officers, less likely to involve civilians killed by the victim before or during the incident, and less likely to involve a black than white victim. Additional information regarding the mental health/substance abuse history of these victims is included in Tables 1 and 2 but is limited by the information available to investigators. Forty-seven percent of cases fell into one of these subtypes. Unclassified cases (53%) were more likely to occur in public than in a home and less likely to involve victim alcohol intoxication; they were also three times more likely to involve injuries to law enforcement and an armed victim and 2.6 times more likely to involve a black than white victim. As noted above, these subtype groups were not mutually exclusive or exhaustive; other case types may exist that were not identified and coded in this study. For example, of those cases identified as potential "suicide by cop" incidents, more than half (55%), but not all, were also identified as mental/behavioral health related.

### Sexual assault and fatal violence against women during the Irish war of independence, 1919–1921: kate maher's murder in context [^5f4eb4fb]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

The solitary charge which Bennett faced was murder, which unlike rape carried a maximum penalty of death. Third parties described the sexual assault which Maher endured in euphemistic terms. Constable Joynson mentioned her disturbed clothes, and that she was bleeding from her womb. That she had been sexually assaulted was clear from Dr McCormick's evidence. The specific question which Bennett had raised during the court of inquiry about 'sexual connections' was not explored.

The level of medical detail presented in the court of inquiry and court martial is insufficient to determine whether what Kate Maher endured at the hands of one or more soldiers constituted rape. The criminal law required that there had to be proof of penetration, as was also stipulated in the Manual of Military Law which guided courts martial. The presence of semen was not considered necessary: 'the slightest penetration will be sufficient'.

The use of objects to penetrate a female did not then constitute rape in Irish law. It is clear Kate Maher was so assaulted. The doctor's evidence was that she had been violently assaulted by the insertion of a blunt instrument into her vagina which had caused her to bleed profusely. It is not possible now to determine if she was also raped, as Willemijn Ruberg has done in comparable Dutch cases of sexual assault.

Historically, court reporting of heinous crimes was necessarily selective, Irish newspapers generally avoided graphic descriptions of wounds or injuries of an intimate or sexual nature disclosed during court proceedings, presumably out of deference to public sensibilities. Reporting on Private Bennett's court martial, one newspaper spoke of Kate Maher's skull fracture and what was delicately termed 'a lacerated wound on another part of her body' (Freeman's Journal, July 18, 1921). Given the heightened state of unrest and the danger of official or unofficial military reprisals against newspapers, detailed coverage carried risk.

Improving the quality of expert testimony — Various branches of organized medicine and some state medical licensure boards have implemented programs to help curb unreliable medical expert testimony, and there are multiple strategies for regulating expert witness testimony. Historically, witness immunity has shielded experts from legal reprisal based on their testimony, but some legal authorities have sought a distinction between expert witnesses and fact witnesses, postulating that because experts testify voluntarily and receive significant compensation, general witness immunity should not apply to them.

Cases were provided by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) for the period of January 2001 to December 2019. BOCSAR mapped incidents into four time‐periods based on time of incident: 12.00–5.59 a.m. 6.00–11.59 a.m. 12.00–5.59 p.m. and 6.00–11.59 p.m. All domestic violence assaults were linked to at least one victim (e‐mail from S. Ramsey (in April 2022). Incidents were at the 'apprehension level'. These are recorded by police irrespective of any further action, such as filing charges or convictions. Following Kypri et al. we used all apprehensions in scope, not just those flagged as alcohol‐related, to overcome any bias in reporting. In NSW, the only determining factor between a domestic violence assault and a non‐domestic violence assault is the nature of the relationship between the offender and the victim. The following incidents were defined as cases: actual bodily harm, common assault, grievous bodily harm (including malicious wounding), shoot with intent other than to murder or spike drink/food offences (NSW Crimes Act 1900) when there was a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim [NSW Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 No. 80]. A domestic relationship is defined as: 'if the person:
(1) is or has been married to the other person, or
(2) is or has been a de‐facto partner of that other person, or
(3) has or has had an intimate personal relationship with the other person, whether or not the intimate relationship involves or has involved a relationship of a sexual nature, or
(4) is living or has lived in the same household as the other person, or
(5) is living or has lived as a long‐term resident in the same residential facility as the other person and at the same time as the other person (not including a correctional centre or a detention centre), or
(6) has or has had a relationship involving his or her dependence on the ongoing paid or unpaid care of the other person, or
(7) is or has been a relative of the other person, or
(8) in the case of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, if the person is or has been part of the extended family or kin of the other person according to the Indigenous kingship system of the person's culture'.

### Sexual assault and fatal violence against women during the Irish war of independence, 1919–1921: kate maher's murder in context [^b781a9c2]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

At the height of the Irish War of Independence, 1919–1921, 45-year-old Kate Maher was brutally raped. She subsequently died of terrible wounds, almost certainly inflicted by drunken British soldiers. This article discusses her inadequately investigated case in the wider context of fatal violence against women and girls during years of major political instability. Ordinarily her violent death would have been subject to a coroner's court inquiry and rigorous police investigation, but in 1920, civil inquests in much of Ireland were replaced by military courts of inquiry. With the exception of medical issues, where doctors adhered to their ethical responsibility to provide clear and concise evidence on injuries, wounds and cause of death, courts of inquiry were cursory affairs in which Crown forces effectively investigated and exonerated themselves. This article adopts a microhistory approach to Maher's case to compare how civilian and military systems differed in their treatments of female fatalities. Despite the fact that the medical evidence unequivocally showed that the attack was of a very violent sexual nature, the two soldiers directly implicated were not charged with rape or any other sexual offence. In her case, and in those of other women who died violently while in the company of soldiers and policemen, prosecutions of the men involved resulted in acquittal by military court martial. This was so both for women portrayed as of immoral character and for others assumed to be 'respectable'. It also reflects on the wider question of sexual violence during the Irish War of Independence, concluding that while females experienced a range of gender-determined threats and actions such as armed raids on their homes, the 'bobbing' of hair and other means of 'shaming', rape, accepted as the most serious act of sexual assault, was regarded by all combatants as beyond the pale.

### Homicide by fright: the intersection of cardiology and criminal law [^83374dc2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The prevailing lay wisdom associates emotional stress with sudden death, and recent medical reports have linked massive catecholamine surges with demonstrable cardiac dysfunction that can be either reversible or fatal. This association does not strictly prove causality, and the question remains open for additional scientific investigation. From the legal viewpoint, however, the issue has been resolved, and case law clearly holds that sudden emotional stress can cause death. More significantly, case law also holds that if the sudden emotional stress is caused by criminal conduct, the resulting death of a victim of the criminal conduct can be prosecuted as homicide. Cardiologists are often called to testify in such circumstances. In the present study, we have reviewed 8 legal cases that are the basis of current opinions in these matters. These legal principles can be summarized as follows: emotional stress is sufficient, and physical abuse is not required for conviction; a time-lapse between the induction of emotional stress and death does not necessarily mitigate the charge of homicide; the criminal act must be the proximate cause of the victim's death; however, the accused does not always need to be physically present to commit the crime. In conclusion, although the pathophysiology of sudden death associated with massive emotional stress has not been fully elucidated from a scientific viewpoint, in the legal system, the association can be causative and can be the basis for a criminal prosecution. Cardiologists may be called on to provide expert opinions in the prosecution of these cases.

### Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking: is medical support ethically justified? [^d3e06297]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The second element of suicide that becomes evident in the abovementioned definitions is the intention to kill oneself. This does not mean the intention to allow death to occur naturally (as is the case in withdrawing life-sustaining treatment), but the intention to hasten one's death. In VSED, the latter intention is clearly present. First, this intention is usually verbalized by the patient towards family members and healthcare professionals. Second, the intention to hasten death is impressively demonstrated by the patient's resolve to endure hunger and thirst in order to reach this goal. Intention is also the key element that distinguishes VSED as a form of suicide from the alleviation of pain and symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect (sometimes called 'indirect euthanasia'), which is not a form of suicide. In the latter, patients accept the possibility of a life-shortening effect of high-dosed drugs that are required to treat otherwise uncontrollable symptoms in the dying phase. Irrespective of whether the shortening of life may be a contingent side effect or a necessary means to symptom control, the primary intention is always symptom relief and not death.

VSED should therefore be considered as a form of suicide, as there is both an intention to bring about death and an omission that directly causes this effect. However, there are some characteristics that render VSED a discrete form of suicide, distinct from other forms. Firstly, in contrast to common forms of suicide (e.g. use of firearms, hanging or suffocation, poisoning, falling), VSED is not characterized by an invasive or aggressive act. Second, other methods of suicide typically result in a relatively rapid death, occurring within seconds to minutes, whereas even a complete cessation of eating and drinking will only lead to death after at least several days. As a consequence, the decision to kill oneself can be reversed by resuming eating and drinking, at least up to a certain point of no return when the patient loses consciousness or when organ damage is too advanced to save the patient's life. Moreover, this protracted course and the suffering that may accompany it require more resolve from the patient than quicker forms of suicide, thus providing a better safeguard against impulsive suicidal behavior. Finally, phenomenologically, the dying phase in VSED resembles that of the natural dying process, which also involves some degree of dehydration. This may be a significant advantage for patients as well as relatives and healthcare professionals and may partly explain the widespread acceptance of this practice.

### Fluoxetine capsules (fluoxetine) [^bac774ac]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

6.3. Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of fluoxetine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is difficult to reliably estimate their frequency or evaluate a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Voluntary reports of adverse reactions temporally associated with fluoxetine that have been received since market introduction and that may have no causal relationship with the drug include the following: aplastic anemia, atrial fibrillation1, cataract, cerebral vascular accident1, cholestatic jaundice, dyskinesia (including, for example, a case of buccal-lingual-masticatory syndrome with involuntary tongue protrusion reported to develop in a 77-year-old female after 5 weeks of fluoxetine therapy and which completely resolved over the next few months following drug discontinuation), eosinophilic pneumonia1, epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, exfoliative dermatitis, gynecomastia, heart arrest1, hepatic failure/necrosis, hyperprolactinemia, hypoglycemia, immune-related hemolytic anemia, kidney failure, movement disorders developing in patients with risk factors including drugs associated with such reactions and worsening of pre-existing movement disorders, optic neuritis, pancreatitis1, pancytopenia, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, QT prolongation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia1, thrombocytopenic purpura, ventricular tachycardia (including torsades de pointes–type arrhythmias), and vaginal bleeding, and violent behaviors1.

### Occupational homicides of law enforcement officers, 2003–2013: data from the national violent death reporting system [^dfce92bf]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This analysis used NVDRS data from 17 states to examine occupational homicides of LEOs. The results add to the body of literature on this subject by providing information regarding LEO victims, the nature of injuries, encounter situations, and circumstances. The results demonstrate the value of the system for collecting information regarding LEO homicides.

Data from NVDRS indicate that the most common precipitating factors in LEO homicides were another crime (57.0%) and another crime in progress (71.2%). This is a common scenario that has been previously documented in the literature, finding that LEO homicides often occur during a crimeor when suspects were eluding capture after committing a crime.

One of the most common situational encounters noted in this analysis was ambushes (21.9%). In these situations, LEOs were faced with some of the characteristic circumstances of ambushes: the element of surprise, concealment of the assailant, their intentions or weapon, suddenness of the attack, and a lack of provocation. From 2003 to 2014, ambushes constituted 13%–31% of felonious deaths among LEOs. In 2011, the U.S. Attorney General identified developing approaches to counter ambush-style attacks as a top priority for LEO safety. The information from this analysis can be used to inform such efforts and help law enforcement agencies characterize and prevent ambush attacks.

Experts can and often will be deposed — A discovery alternative to deposition testimony is the expert's written report, which typically is shared between the parties before trial; however, some states do not require disclosure of the identity of the expert or even disclosure of the report. In criminal cases, discovery of expert opinion usually is accomplished by pretrial interview with the expert witness or by an expert witness' written report. It is helpful when expert witnesses are willing to be available and to discuss their opinions with both sides in advance of their testimony, and it is not advisable that physicians engage in the practice of having attorneys write their reports; if that does occur, physician experts should read that statement carefully to verify agreement with it.

### Psychiatric characteristics of homicide defendants [^c5ff6bad]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors examined the rate of mental disorders in an unselected sample of homicide defendants in a U.S. jurisdiction, seeking to identify psychiatric factors associated with offense characteristics and court outcomes.

Method

Defendants charged with homicide in a U.S. urban county between 2001 and 2005 received a psychiatric evaluation after arrest. Demographic, historical, and psychiatric variables as well as offense characteristics and legal outcomes were described. Bivariate analyses examined differences by age group and by race, and logistic models examined predictors of multiple victims, firearm use, guilty plea, and guilty verdict.

Results

Fifty-eight percent of the sample had at least one axis I or II diagnosis, most often a substance use disorder (47%). Axis I or II diagnoses were more common (78%) among defendants over age 40. Although 37% of the sample had prior psychiatric treatment, only 8% of the defendants with diagnosed axis I disorders had outpatient treatment during the 3 months preceding the homicide; African Americans were less likely than non-African Americans to be in treatment. African American males were more likely to use a firearm and to have a male victim. In exploratory analyses, psychiatric factors did not predict multiple victims, firearm use in the crime, or a guilty verdict.

Conclusions

Rates of axis I disorders were lower than reported in previous studies. Few homicide defendants were in psychiatric treatment at the time of the crime, suggesting limited opportunities for prevention by mental health providers.

### Requests for medical assistance in dying by young Dutch people with psychiatric disorders [^2501068b]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Suicide was reported when the patient died by suicide during the MAID application or assessment procedure. Voluntarily stopping eating and drinking (VSTED) during the procedure was registered separately, as Dutch regulations qualify VSTED as death by natural causes. The small number of VSTED cases (n = 2) did not allow separate reporting of clinical characteristics in this group without potential breach of patient privacy. Deaths by suicide or VSTED occurring after rejection or discontinuation were not reliably documented in the (then closed) patient file; thus, these were not investigated.

For applicants who had died by MAID or suicide, we attempted to obtain detailed information regarding their history of mental health problems, including suicidality and their treatment history, from the patient files. Access to sensitive patient data regarding these themes (but not regarding other themes) was considered ethically permissible, as they could contribute to answering questions with direct and urgent clinical implications. The following clinical characteristic variables were sought: psychiatric diagnoses that applied at any time before or during the MAID application procedure, childhood sexual abuse (yes or no), childhood bullying (yes or no), history of self-harm (yes or no), self-reported number of suicide attempts prior to MAID request, and age at first suicide attempt. For treatment history, we sought to assess whether the following interventions had been tried (yes or no): selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, antipsychotic medications, sedatives or sleep medications, electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation, intensive home treatment, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, and recovery-oriented care (eg, psychosocial support, rehabilitative care, or assisted living). We further assessed the number of unique psychoactive pharmacological interventions tried, number of unique antidepressants tried, history of crisis-related hospital admission (yes or no), history of inpatient treatment (not crisis related; yes or no), history of involuntary treatment (eg, care authorization, compulsory medication, physical restraint, and coercive feeding; yes or no), and age at first contact with any mental health professional.

Information was retrieved from unstructured documentation (eg, referral letters, meeting notes), leading to missing data. In addition, most patients who died by suicide had not undergone full assessment at the time of their death, resulting in a substantial amount of missing data in this group. We reported results for all variables with 70% or greater valid data per group (MAID, suicide).

### Evaluation and management of children and adolescents with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part I: common clinical challenges of patients with mental health and / or behavioral emergencies [^e3784711]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Involuntary hospitalization — Under certain circumstances, physicians may insist on admission to a psychiatric inpatient unit over the objections of patients and/or their guardians ("psychiatric hold"), and every state has laws governing involuntary admission for inpatient psychiatric hospitalization that vary by state. In general, physicians are able to admit a patient against his or her will for a brief period of time, typically up to 72 hours, but ranging from 1 to 30 days; after that initial period, the psychiatric facility works to obtain a court order for civil commitment for ongoing treatment if objections persist. Criteria for involuntary hospitalization typically include the patient having a mental disorder and being at immediate risk of harm to self or others; some states also allow for involuntary hospitalization if the patient is "gravely disabled", with criteria that may include the inability to meet basic physical needs including nourishment, shelter, safety, and/or basic medical care, and state laws differ over whether and, if so, at what age, assent for psychiatric admission must be obtained from minors.

### Status of legal firearm possession and violent deaths: methods and protocol for a retrospective case-control study [^ef8f1f08]. Injury Prevention (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

This project links population data to the Wisconsin Violent Death Reporting System (WVDRS) to determine the extent to which firearm possession criteria are being followed as well as the potential impact of the adoption of proposed possession criteria.

Design and Study Population

Criminal justice data for WVDRS homicide suspects and victims and suicide decedents 2008–2011 and a sample of matched control group of driver's license holders (to characterise the state population) will be abstracted.

Methods

Individual legal possession statuses (prohibited/not prohibited) under each current and expanded criterion will be determined. Proportions of interest will be calculated from two-way contingency tables, and tests between groups with categorical variables (eg, criterion is met or not) will be performed with Fisher's exact or binomial proportion tests. Tests between groups with continuous variables (eg, number of misdemeanours) will be performed by zero inflated negative binomial regression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve will be used to quantify the prediction accuracy of specific univariate or multivariate logistic model for prediction. Inverse probability weighting will be used for analyses that extend from matched controls to the general state population of license holders.

Discussion

Linked data sets and partnerships are challenging, but necessary for comprehensive public health research. Results of this study will contribute knowledge on the proportion of prohibited suspects and suicide decedents that used firearms in violent deaths and, if applying expanded criteria would have increased prohibited persons. This study will also investigate risk and protective factors for being a victim of homicide.

### The physician's unique role in preventing violence: a neglected opportunity? [^2724eb27]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

While knowledge of laws in one's state of practice is essential, experts in medical law strongly recommend that clinicians approach the dangerousness of a patient as a clinical rather than legal issue. The primary determinants in a malpractice suit are the thoroughness of the clinicians' assessment of a patient's potential for violence and the care with which options of action were considered, rather than the accuracy of the clinicians' predictions. Thorough mental status examinations and substance use histories should be documented with direct quotes from the patient. Careful notes should be taken explaining why a certain course of action was taken, what other options were considered but opted against and why. The more potentially dangerous the client, the more care one should take in the documentation of the case.

### Use of risk assessment instruments to predict violence and antisocial behaviour in 73 samples involving 24 827 people: systematic review and meta-analysis [^ff1d231e]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

One implication of these findings is that, even after 30 years of development, the view that violence, sexual, or criminal risk can be predicted in most cases is not evidence based. This message is important for the general public, media, and some administrations who may have unrealistic expectations of risk prediction for clinicians. This expectation is not as high in other medical specialties, in which the expectation that the doctor will identify the individual patient who will have an adverse event is not a primary issue whereas psychiatry, in many countries such as the UK, has developed a culture of inquiries.

A second and related implication is that these tools are not sufficient on their own for the purposes of risk assessment. In some criminal justice systems, expert testimony commonly use scores from these instruments in a simplistic way to estimate an individual's risk of serious repeat offending. However, our review suggests that risk assessment tools in their current form can only be used to roughly classify individuals at the group level, and not to safely determine criminal prognosis in an individual case. This approach is mostly used in forensic psychiatry in the UK and other western countries, where they form part of a wider clinical assessment process. These instruments may also assist in developing risk management plans in selected high risk groups, as suggested by recent clinical guidelines in England and Wales. Furthermore, they are preferable to unstructured clinical judgment owing to their increased transparency and reliability.

Another implication is that actuarial instruments focusing on historical risk factors perform no better than tools based on clinical judgment, a finding contrary to some previous reviews. Finally, our review suggests that these instruments should be used differently. Since they had higher negative predictive values, one potential approach would be to use them to screen out low risk individuals. Researchers and policy makers could use the number safely discharged to determine the potential screening use of any particular tool, although its use could be limited for clinicians depending on the immediate and service consequences of false positives. A further caveat is that specificities were not high — therefore, although the decision maker can be confident that a person is truly low risk if screened out, when someone fails to be screened out as low risk, doctors cannot be certain that this person is not low risk. In other words, many individuals assessed as being at moderate or high risk could be, in fact, low risk. Ultimately, however, what constitutes an appropriate balance between the ethical implications of detaining people based on the predictive ability of these tools and the need for public protection will primarily be a political consideration.

### Longitudinal histories as predictors of future diagnoses of domestic abuse: modelling study [^a1e535cc]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Our case definition includes codes highly specific for abuse, assault, and intentional injury. As with all real world data, however, some visits might have been miscoded. Such omissions and inaccuracies in the data might reduce the performance of the model, but the demonstration of the utility of this approach using real world data has the potential to catalyse additional efforts in generating accurate diagnostic coding for each care episode.

Depending on the case definition used and the desired levels of specificity, the model can yield low to moderate positive predictive values (up to 14.4% for the narrow case definition and 18.9% for the broader case definition, see table 3). This is to be expected with conditions having a low prevalence (in the present case, 1.04% with the narrow definition and 3.44% with the broad definition), as the positive predictive value is directly proportional to prevalence of the condition being detected. These levels could be clinically useful in settings where the model is being used to identify patients for whom standard screening should be performed, especially when screening rates in practice remain below desired levels.

We focused on predicting the risk of future diagnoses of abuse, and the model is trained on patients who have been diagnosed in a clinical setting. Potential differences between cases of abuse that typically get diagnosed versus those cases that typically do not get diagnosed might serve as an important bias and might hinder the model's ability to detect the latter. As mentioned above, however, domestic abuse often goes undiagnosed or is diagnosed only after considerable delay. Given the current high levels of underdiagnosis, it is likely that use of the model in a clinical setting would lead to the detection of some of the cases that are currently not typically diagnosed. The effect of implementing such a model in clinical practice is an important empirical question for future research.

Differences in care and coding practices might affect the generalisability of models from one health environment to another. We therefore recommend the training of a specific model for each healthcare environment. We expect the modelling approach to be generalisable to other settings inside and outside the US, as the minimal set of data elements (ICD-9 codes, dates of visits) used by the model are commonly stored throughout many countries with electronic medical record systems or claims systems. In countries that do not yet have electronic medical record systems, these models would be difficult to implement, though with time, electronic medical record systems are being deployed more widely throughout the world.

### Analysis of "Stand your ground" self-defense laws and statewide rates of homicides and firearm homicides [^4e2b1a66]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Most US states have amended self-defense laws to enhance legal immunities for individuals using deadly force in public. Despite concerns that "stand your ground" (SYG) laws unnecessarily encourage the use of deadly violence, their impact on violent deaths and how this varies across states and demographic groups remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate the association of SYG laws with homicide and firearm homicide, nationally and by state, while considering variation by the race, age, and sex of individuals who died by homicide.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used a controlled, multiple-baseline and -location interrupted time series design, using natural variation in the timings and locations of SYG laws to assess associations. Changes in homicide and firearm homicide were modeled using Poisson regression analyses within a generalized additive model framework. Analyses included all US states that enacted SYG laws between 2000 and 2016 and states that did not have SYG laws enacted during the full study period, 1999 to 2017. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to December 2020.

Exposures

SYG self-defense laws enacted by statute between January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were statewide monthly rates of homicide and firearm-related homicide (per 100 000 persons) from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, grouped by characteristics (ie, race, age, sex) of individuals who died by homicide.

Results

Forty-one states were analyzed, including 23 states that enacted SYG laws during the study period and 18 states that did not have SYG laws, with 248 358 homicides (43.7% individuals aged 20–34 years; 77.9% men and 22.1% women), including 170 659 firearm homicides. SYG laws were associated with a mean national increase of 7.8% in monthly homicide rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR],1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.12; P < .001) and 8.0% in monthly firearm homicide rates (IRR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03–1.13; P = 0.002). SYG laws were not associated with changes in the negative controls of suicide (IRR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–1.01) or firearm suicide (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98–1.02). Increases in violent deaths varied across states, with the largest increases (16.2% to 33.5%) clustering in the South (eg, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana). There were no differential associations of SYG laws by demographic group.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that adoption of SYG laws across the US was associated with increases in violent deaths, deaths that could potentially have been avoided.

### COVID-19-immunity from prosecution for physicians forced to allocate scarce resources: the Italian perspective [^7b471000]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

In times of COVID-19, it may happen that the diagnostic-therapeutic standard in a given clinical situation cannot be guaranteed. This may mean denying a patient treatment because it is not available, because the only available treatment is deemed necessary for another patient, or the extreme case of having to take it away from one subject to give it to another. These decisions are made by the doctor, who in countries such as Italy, where prosecution is mandatory (Constitution art.112), will incur criminal liability.

Criminal immunity for physicians applying the necessity defense has been advanced. This defense protects an individual who, in emergency situations, is forced to commit a crime to prevent more serious harm to themselves or another individual who they have a duty to protect.

Necessity includes objectively detectable requirements: the agent is forced into the situation (e.g. the doctor who has insufficient health resources), or there is danger, not caused by the agent, of serious, existing, and inevitable damage to a subject (e.g. risk of death following an established COVID-19 infection). However, necessity also establishes requisites for which subjective assessment by a judge is required. The most critical of these is the assessment of proportionality: the harm inflicted must be less than the potential harm avoided (e.g. failure to administer therapy to a patient with a compromised prognosis in favor of another patient with a chance of recovery).

Physicians act according to science and conscience, supported if possible by guidelines. However, guidelines have relative value and are also contrary to the principle of the equivalence of lives in liberal democracies. Therefore, a judge may not consider those guidelines as a defense thereby undermining the existence of proportionality of a doctor's choice, thus rendering necessity inapplicable.

The legislator should recognize doctors' actions as always proportionate, when the other conditions of necessity are documented, so that prosecution does not follow. Such modification is preferable to a generalized immunity that would risk making it impossible to prosecute offenses for negligent actions. This might be the case in Italian situations where COVID-19 patients may have been transferred to nursing homes where isolation measures were not present, causing infection in other patients hospitalized in the same facility.

Legal proceedings emanating from the allocation of resources during the epidemic should be handled with priority. If necessity is recognized, the costs for proceedings should be borne by the State.

### CDC grand rounds: evidence-based injury prevention [^ba2ac2db]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 5.8 million persons die from injuries each year, accounting for 10% of all deaths worldwide. In the United States, 180,000 persons die each year from injuries, making the category the country's leading cause of death for those aged 1–44 years and the leading cause of years of potential life lost before age 65 years. Injuries also result in 2.8 million hospitalizations and 29 million emergency department visits each year in the United States. Motor vehicle crashes, falls, homicides, suicides, domestic violence, child maltreatment, and other forms of intentional and unintentional injury affect all strata of society, with widespread physical, mental, and reproductive health consequences. Injuries and violence affect not only individuals, but also families and communities, producing substantial economic and societal burdens related to health-care costs, work loss, and disruption of education. The estimated annual U.S. cost in medical expenses and lost productivity resulting from injuries is $355 billion.

### Is withdrawing treatment really more problematic than withholding treatment? [^2e83fcda]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

'the act is needed to avoid inevitable and irreparable evil';
'no more should be done than is reasonably necessary for the purpose to be achieved';
'the evil inflicted must not be disproportionate to the evil avoided'.

There is, however, at least one key difference between the situation under consideration and the case of Jodie and Mary. Jodie and Mary were inextricably linked, the position of each had to be understood in the context of the other. But in the situation being considered, it is somewhat artificial to suggest that the choice is between two people. In most situations, a hospital will have multiple ventilators and so there may be a whole range of potential scenarios. It may be argued that this makes the situation closer to R v Dudley and Stephens. The case involved three survivors of a shipwreck who had murdered and eaten a fourth crew member in order to live. It was held that an argument of necessity could not be made because the crew had made a conscious choice to kill the youngest and weakest crew member, 'Was it more necessary to kill him than one of the grown men? The answer must be 'No". Applied to the situation being considered, it may be argued that it is not necessary to differentiate between people in need of ventilation and there is no basis to measure the comparative value of lives. The difficulty with this argument is that it may actually be more necessary to deprive one person of ventilation than another. This is because one person's condition may mean that they require a month of ventilation, whereas there may be four others who will only require a week.

### Clinical and social factors associated with involuntary psychiatric hospitalisation in children and adolescents: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis [^ad418ca5]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite the paucity of literature on this topic, our systematic review, meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis have identified a number of clinical and social factors that are associated with an increased likelihood of involuntary over voluntary psychiatric hospitalisation in children and adolescents. The clinical factors include a diagnosis of psychosis, substance misuse, or intellectual disability, as well as the presence of perceived risk of harm to self or others. On narrative synthesis, more severe psychiatric symptoms and poorer levels of functioning also seem to be related to involuntary rather than voluntary hospitalisation. Anxiety and behavioural disorders were associated with voluntary rather than involuntary hospitalisation. In terms of sociodemographic factors, older age and being from a Black rather than a White ethnic group were associated with involuntary rather than voluntary hospitalisation.

The over-representation of adults from Black and minority ethnic groups in hospital involuntarily in the UK and globally has long been recognised and is associated with structural and institutional factors that lead to the systematic disadvantage of people from minority ethnic groups. However, little attention has been given to the role that structural racism plays in the mental health care of children and adolescents, and the effect on health outcomes of early experiences of discrimination. We were only able to identify seven studies that mentioned the ethnicity of the children and adolescents who were involuntarily detained, compared with 71 studies included in a recent international meta-analysis of ethnic variations in involuntary hospitalisation among adults.

### Association of state firearm legislation with female intimate partner homicide [^c78be768]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the association between state firearm legislation and female intimate partner homicide.

Methods

In 2017, the authors conducted a secondary data analysis of 16 states from 2010 to 2014, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, the State Firearm Law Database, and additional public sources. Poisson regression analyses quantified the association between the number of state restrictive firearm legislative provisions and the female population-based intimate partner homicide rate. For etiologic reasons, intimate partner homicide was disaggregated into homicide-suicide (intimate partner homicide followed by perpetrator suicide) and homicide-only intimate partner homicide (intimate partner homicide in the absence of perpetrator suicide).

Results

There were 1,693 female intimate partner homicide deaths in the 16 states during 2010–2014; 67% were homicide-only intimate partner homicide. The number of state-level legislative provisions related to firearm restrictions ranged from four (Alaska) to 95 (Massachusetts). The intimate partner homicide rate in states with zero to 39 provisions was 1.16 per 100,000 person years (95% CI = 1.10, 1.22) and in states with > 40 provisions was 0.68 per 100,000 person years (95% CI = 0.61, 0.72). The incidence of female intimate partner homicide was 56% lower in states with ≥ 40 legislative provisions (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.28, 0.68), relative to states with zero to 39 provisions. This protective association was stronger for homicide-only intimate partner homicide than homicide-suicide intimate partner homicide.

Conclusions

More state-level restrictive firearm legislation is associated with a lower rate of female intimate partner homicides.

### Emergency department evaluation of child abuse [^911471d7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Child abuse presents commonly to emergency departments. Emergency providers are confronted with medical, social, and legal dilemmas with each case. A solid understanding of the definitions and risk factors of victims and perpetrators aids in identifying abuse cases. Forensic examination should be performed only after the child is medically stable. Emergency providers are mandatory reporters of a reasonable suspicion of abuse. The role of the emergency provider is to identify abuse, facilitate a thorough investigation, treat medical needs, protect the patient, provide an unbiased medical consultation to law enforcement, and to provide an ethical testimony if called to court.

### Global status report on violence prevention 2014 [^6081015f]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Interpersonal violence affects millions of people worldwide, often has lifelong consequences, and is gaining recognition as an important global public health problem. There has been no assessment of measures countries are taking to address it. This report aims to assess such measures and provide a baseline against which to track future progress.

Methods

In each country, with help from a government-appointed National Data Coordinator, representatives from six to ten sectors completed a questionnaire before convening in a consensus meeting to decide on final country data; 133 of 194 (69%) WHO Member States participated. The questionnaire covered data, plans, prevention measures, and victim services. Data were collected between November 2012 and June 2014, and analyzed between June and October 2014. Global and country-level homicides for 2000–2012 were also calculated for all 194 Members.

Results

Worldwide, 475,000 people were homicide victims in 2012 and homicide rates declined by 16% from 2000 to 2012. Data on fatal and, in particular, non-fatal forms of violence are lacking in many countries. Each of the 18 types of surveyed prevention programs was reported to be implemented in a third of the 133 participating countries; each law was reported to exist in 80% of countries, but fully enforced in just 57%; and each victim service was reported to be in place in just more than half of the countries.

Conclusions

Although many countries have begun to tackle violence, serious gaps remain, and public health researchers have a critical role to play in addressing them.

### Meaning attribution to intimate partner violence by counselors who support women with intimate partner violence experiences in Greece [^1551bf66]. Journal of Interpersonal Violence (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intimate partner violence:

- **Definition**: Intimate partner violence is defined as any form of aggression or harmful behavior within a romantic relationship. This can include physical, sexual, or psychological harm, as well as controlling behaviors by a current or former partner.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of intimate partner violence is complex and multifaceted, involving an interplay of individual, relational, and societal factors. Substance abuse, mental health issues, and societal norms can also contribute to the occurrence of intimate partner violence.
- **Epidemiology**: Intimate partner violence is a significant global issue and is estimated to affect nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide within their lifetime.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for intimate partner violence include individual factors such as a history of violent behavior, substance misuse, and the presence of specific personality disorders. Relationship-related factors encompass marital discord, dominance and control dynamics within the relationship, and financial stress. Societal factors include societal norms endorsing male authority over female behavior, rigid gender role distinctions, and the existence of community groups that legitimize male violence.
- **Disease course**: It can manifest in various forms, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Physical abuse often results in injuries, with musculoskeletal injuries being the second most common manifestation. These injuries can range from minor bruises and cuts to severe fractures and burns. It can also lead to sexual violence, which can result in STIs and unintended pregnancies. Emotional abuse, another form of intimate partner violence, can lead to mental health conditions such as depression, PTSD, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behavior.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is often characterized by escalating severity and chronicity. The violence can increase in frequency and severity over time, leading to more serious health consequences for the victim. Victims of intimate partner violence are also at an increased risk of future violence.

### "Felony assault should stick: " assaulted EMS responders' frustration and dissatisfaction with the legal system [^406354e9]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

4 FACTORS THAT LEAD TO A CHARGE

4.1 Prosecutorial merit

DAs identified numerous factors that contributed to an assault not being charged as a felony. Themes such as the point at which things "fall out" of the prosecutorial process, whether intent can be determined, and the victim's investment in the process, all contribute to whether a charge is filed and the severity of the charge. For example, the amount of evidence to give a case "prosecutorial merit" is considered:

… a significant number of them fall out at the preliminary hearing for the following reason: that municipal court judges are charged by the law with determining one legal question. Is there sufficient evidence to prove a crime was committed and [that] that's the person [who] committed it? And it's by a preponderance of the evidence — more likely than not. What we see is in cases where the crime is premised only on the protected status of the victim… I don't know about the paramedics, but I do know that teachers and the police officers — the municipal court judges don't follow the law the way it's written about protecting the people in the protected class. (DA #1 [emphasis added])

And I've heard them make comments in individual cases that would lead you to believe that their perception is, well, when you take a job like that, you should expect to get hit. Ludicrous. Ludicrous. But municipal court judges in Philadelphia have had this tradition, some more than others, and some in more cases than others, of not only making a legal determination, but they place a value on the case, and they say is this serious enough to go to the Court of Common Pleas for a felony trial". (DA #1 [emphasis added])

One DA described their discretion in interpreting whether an injury is serious enough to warrant a charge and that psychological injury to the victim is not considered at all or on a par with physical injury. The investigators discussed a previous paramedic assault case (prosecuted by the DA's office) in which a medic was hit in the eye socket resulting in a broken orbital bone:

Child and adolescent forensic evaluations — standards of proof and medical certainty — outline multiple levels of certainty, where the least exacting is "reasonable suspicion", civil cases hinge on "preponderance of the evidence" that can be "51% certain", psychiatric evidence may require "clear and convincing proof", and criminal cases require "beyond a reasonable doubt"; physicians are often asked for opinions with "a reasonable degree of medical certainty", which has been proposed as equivalent to what a physician uses when making a diagnosis and starting treatment, implying that the degree of certainty would depend on the clinical situation.

### Neuroscience and legal determination of criminal responsibility [^9e16d529]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2006). Medium credibility.

Neuroscience is increasingly identifying associations between biology and violence that appear to offer courts evidence relevant to criminal responsibility. In addition, in a policy era of 'zero tolerance of risk', evidence of biological abnormality in some of those who are violent, or biological markers of violence, may be seized on as a possible basis for preventive detention in the interest of public safety. However, there is a mismatch between questions that the courts and society wish answered and those that neuroscience is capable of answering. This poses a risk to the proper exercise of justice and to civil liberties.

### Involuntary commitment for substance use: addiction care professionals must reject enabling coercion and patient harm [^b3e72715]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Ethical and epidemiological concerns should mobilize addiction care providers to deploy their expertise and collective influence to challenge the use of state power to coerce people into treatment settings-especially when such settings often diverge from best clinical practices. Troublingly, with few notable exceptions, the voices of professional organizations on this issue have been largely lacking. This issue of the Journal includes a timely manuscript that sheds light on this resounding silence: "Civil Commitment for Substance Use Disorders: A National Survey of Addiction Medicine Physicians" by Jain et al. provides important and novel insights into the beliefs of physicians regarding civil commitment statutes. This study distributed a web-based survey to physician-members of the American Society of Addiction Medicine with questions gauging awareness of, attitudes toward, and experiences with civil commitment for individuals with substance use disorder. Surprisingly, the study found that the overwhelming majority of addiction medicine providers supported the application of civil commitment for substance use disorder-60.7% reported being in favor of its use whereas only 21.5% reported being opposed.

The origins of the use of expert witnesses to assist courts in helping understand the required conduct in determining the standard of care provides a basis for recognizing the consultant role sought in judicial proceedings. Both rules of evidence and court decisions have evolved in a manner that encourages the introduction of expert testimony while conditioning its use to avoid unfair bias. Trial court judges decide on permitting such testimony, while legal counsel is responsible for helping juries determine its importance and reliability. Certain types of restrictions and adverse consequences for misstatements exist but are subordinated to the trial process in most circumstances, a process that varies among different jurisdictions.

### Preventive detention must be resisted by the medical profession [^b64fc1df]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2002). Low credibility.

A policy of "preventive detention" has recently been debated in the British Parliament. Alarmed by the high-profile criminal activities of people suspected of having dangerous severe personality disorder (DSPD), the government have made clear their intention to "indeterminately but reviewably detain" people with DSPD, after diagnosis by forensic psychiatrists, even if the individuals are yet to commit an offence. Such a policy may improve the safety of the public, but has obvious implications for civil liberties. This essay criticises the morality of the government's intention and rejects the notion that the medical profession could ethically collude with such a policy.

### State-of-the-art review: the intersection of infectious diseases and carceral medicine [^6480ff9c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Mass incarceration is a national epidemic; all clinicians will encounter persons currently incarcerated or with a history of criminal-legal involvement. Infections are highly prevalent in these populations. This review will support clinicians to provide evidence-based infectious diseases treatment with explicit recognition of the interpersonal and structural intricacies in carceral care. Following a criminal-legal system primer, clinicians will have a finer understanding of the psychosocial complexities involved in building provider-patient relationships with those impacted by this system. By recognizing that care delivery can be subject to a potential conflict of interest in supporting both the health interests of persons incarcerated while respecting the unique carceral institution regulations in place to protect carceral staff, clinicians will navigate the concept of "dual loyalty". With this, in conjunction with supporting patient autonomy in treatment decisions and providing infection-prevention counseling and treatment, clinicians can create a therapeutic patient alliance and reduce health disparities.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The role of the expert witness is clear in the eyes of the court but that understanding is less consistent for the medical professionals who may be called on in this capacity. The fundamental key is the clinician's purpose in using their experience, knowledge and training as they provide the court with an unbiased assessment of the clinical issues that have arisen in the case. Using the Australian context, this article provides guidance for clinicians who are asked to provide the court with their expertise through written and spoken representations, drawing upon experience and the use of the "Expert Witness Code of Conduct".
