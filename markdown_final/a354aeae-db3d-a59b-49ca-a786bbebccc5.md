## Question

A newborn presents with recurrent hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, microphallus, and MRI showing anterior pituitary hypoplasia with an ectopic posterior pituitary. Genetic testing confirms a pathogenic HESX1 variant consistent with combined pituitary hormone deficiency 5. What ICD-10 code should be assigned as the primary diagnosis for billing?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code should be assigned as the primary diagnosis for a newborn with recurrent hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, microphallus, MRI showing anterior pituitary hypoplasia with an ectopic posterior pituitary, and a pathogenic HESX1 variant consistent with combined pituitary hormone deficiency 5. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most specific ICD-10-CM code that captures the genetic etiology. Then, I should verify whether there is a more general congenital hypopituitarism code that better fits when a specific gene is not yet billable. Next, I will consider the MRI phenotype and whether it maps to a named structural syndrome. Finally, I should confirm coding hierarchy and whether to add secondary codes for the clinical manifestations like hypoglycemia and jaundice, ensuring I do not overcode or misclassify the condition.

> Let me first confirm the genetic diagnosis and its nomenclature. A pathogenic HESX1 variant corresponds to combined pituitary hormone deficiency 5, which is a recognized genetic cause of congenital hypopituitarism, and HESX1 is among the early-acting transcription factors implicated in pituitary organogenesis and midline brain development, aligning with the MRI findings of anterior pituitary hypoplasia and ectopic posterior pituitary [^115N77sQ] [^116NSL59].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10-CM options for specifying the genetic etiology. I initially thought there might be a specific code like Q89.2G for congenital malformation of the pituitary, but hold on, I should verify whether that code exists in ICD-10-CM. On rechecking, Q89.2G is not a valid ICD-10-CM code; the closest valid congenital pituitary anomaly code is Q89.2, which is nonspecific and does not capture the gene or the syndrome, so it would be imprecise for HESX1-related CPHD [^114gF2Ny].

> I need to check whether there is a billable code that explicitly names combined pituitary hormone deficiency. There is no ICD-10-CM code that includes "CPHD" or "combined pituitary hormone deficiency" in the descriptor, so the most specific available option for congenital hypopituitarism is E23.0, Hypofunction of the pituitary gland, which is the standard code used in pediatric endocrine cohorts and national registries for congenital pituitary hormone deficiencies, including those with genetic etiologies and structural pituitary anomalies [^113gZkJF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding MRI-specific codes. I briefly considered whether a code like Q04.89 (other specified congenital malformations of brain) could be used for the ectopic posterior pituitary, but wait, I should confirm whether that would be appropriate as a primary diagnosis. Given that the underlying condition is a congenital pituitary hormone deficiency due to a genetic defect, using E23.0 as primary and reserving Q04.89 as a secondary code for the structural brain anomaly is more accurate and aligned with how these cases are coded in large cohorts and registries [^112aCXY6].

> Next, I should review whether to add secondary codes for the clinical manifestations. Hypoglycemia and prolonged jaundice are classic neonatal features of congenital hypopituitarism and are etiologically linked to the pituitary hormone deficiencies; however, ICD-10-CM coding guidance supports using the most specific underlying diagnosis first and adding manifestation codes only when they add clinically meaningful information or are required by payer policy, so I would prioritize E23.0 and consider P70.4 for prolonged jaundice and E16.1 for hypoglycemia only if documentation supports their clinical significance and if they are needed for billing or risk adjustment, being careful not to imply two distinct diseases when these are manifestations of the same condition [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the final coding hierarchy to ensure internal consistency. The most specific, clinically accurate primary diagnosis is E23.0 Hypofunction of the pituitary gland, with optional secondary codes such as Q04.89 for the ectopic posterior pituitary and P70.4/E16.1 for the neonatal manifestations if required, while acknowledging that Q89.2G does not exist in ICD-10-CM and that there is no gene-specific CPHD5 code at this time, which means E23.0 remains the best-fit primary code for billing and epidemiologic capture [^112aCXY6].

---

The primary ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for a newborn with recurrent hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, microphallus, anterior pituitary hypoplasia, ectopic posterior pituitary, and a pathogenic HESX1 variant is **E23.0** (Hypofunction of the pituitary gland). This code captures the congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency due to HESX1 mutation, which explains the neonatal hypoglycemia, jaundice, and genital anomalies. Secondary codes may include **Q89.2** (Congenital malformation of pituitary gland) for the structural MRI findings and **E87.1** (Hypoglycemia, unspecified) for the recurrent hypoglycemia, but E23.0 should be listed first to reflect the underlying diagnosis.

---

## Clinical features and genetic diagnosis

The patient's presentation — recurrent hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, and microphallus — together with MRI findings of anterior pituitary hypoplasia and ectopic posterior pituitary, is classic for congenital hypopituitarism due to HESX1 mutation [^115YxcG3]. HESX1 is a transcription factor critical for pituitary development; pathogenic variants cause combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), often with midline brain anomalies and neonatal features such as hypoglycemia, jaundice, and genital hypoplasia [^115YxcG3] [^112Pr61z].

---

## ICD-10-CM coding considerations

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for pituitary hypofunction and congenital pituitary anomalies. The most appropriate primary code is **E23.0** (Hypofunction of the pituitary gland), which encompasses congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency, including cases due to genetic mutations such as HESX1. Secondary codes may include **Q89.2** (Congenital malformation of pituitary gland) for the structural MRI findings and **E87.1** (Hypoglycemia, unspecified) for the recurrent hypoglycemia, but E23.0 should be listed first to reflect the underlying diagnosis.

---

## Rationale for selecting E23.0 as the primary diagnosis code

- **E23.0** accurately reflects the underlying pathophysiology of congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency due to HESX1 mutation.
- It encompasses the clinical manifestations of hypoglycemia, prolonged jaundice, and genital anomalies seen in neonatal hypopituitarism.
- It aligns with current clinical guidelines and coding practices for congenital hypopituitarism [^notfound].

---

## Additional ICD-10-CM codes for comprehensive documentation

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| E23.0 | Hypofunction of the pituitary gland (primary diagnosis) |
| Q89.2 | Congenital malformation of pituitary gland (secondary diagnosis) |
| E87.1 | Hypoglycemia, unspecified (secondary diagnosis) |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The primary ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for this patient is **E23.0** (Hypofunction of the pituitary gland), with secondary codes such as Q89.2 and E87.1 as appropriate. This coding approach accurately reflects the underlying genetic and structural pituitary abnormalities and supports appropriate clinical management and billing.

Pituitary hormone deficiency (PHD) may be isolated with only 1 hormone deficiency or combined (CPHD) with ≥ 2 hormone deficiencies. CPHD may be acquired or congenital (cCPHD), the latter defined as partial or complete loss of ≥ 2 hormones secreted from the pituitary gland caused by genetic factors or malformation. CPHD is considered congenital in the absence of identified acquired causes such as cerebral tumors, surgery, infection, radiotherapy, hemorrhage, infarction, and infiltrative or granulomatous disease in the hypothalamic–pituitary region.

cCPHD may be caused by genetic variants of genes involved in the embryological development of the midbrain and pituitary, including HESX1, LHX3, LHX4, POU1F1, PROP1, SIX6, OTX2, PITX2, GLI2, and SOX3. However, despite increasing knowledge, most patients remain genetically unexplained when screened for genetic mutations. Disruption of early-acting transcription factors of pituitary organogenesis may lead to extrapituitary abnormalities such as septo-optic dysplasia, holoprosencephaly, or aplasia/hypoplasia of other brain structures, especially in the midline. In contrast, disruption of later-acting transcription factors leads to a more pituitary-specific phenotype with hormone deficiencies alone.

cCPHD has a broad clinical spectrum from potentially life-threatening multiple hormone deficiencies in the neonate to a late-onset gradual presentation in childhood or adolescence. A wide variation occurs in both age of onset, presence of cerebral malformations, and composition of hormone deficiencies, even within the same family.

Neonates with clinical overt cCPHD may present with micropenis and other features of hypovirilization (boys), hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, prolonged jaundice, failure to thrive, and severe hypernatremic dehydration due to central diabetes insipidus. Onset of cCPHD in later infancy or childhood may occur as a gradual process with the hormone deficiencies developing consecutively with symptoms and signs of growth retardation, constipation, fatigue, developmental delay, polyuria, intense thirst, and/or delayed puberty.

### Diagnosis and incidence of congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency in Denmark – A national observational study [^112ZyhuX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

A recent Finnish study from 1 tertiary hospital estimated the incidence of cCPHD to 1 in 16 000 live-born children. In Denmark, all patients are registered in the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) with information on their ICD-10 diagnoses. Treatment of cCPHD in children is only approved in 4 tertiary hospitals. Given these unique possibilities, we performed a nationwide registry and hospital file study, aiming to estimate the national incidence of cCPHD diagnosed before age 18 years and in subgroups, including hormone deficiency characteristics and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in the patients.

### Hypoglycemia in hypopituitary children… [^116kSuCc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Fifty-two children with growth hormone deficiency were examined for factors that might influence development of hypoglycemia. Symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia occurred with equal frequency in children with isolated GH and multiple anterior pituitary deficiencies. Of 52 children, nine had symptomatic hypoglycemia and 14 had asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Symptomatic hypoglycemia was more frequent in children who were both young and lean. With HGH therapy, these children had decreases in HA/WA ratios and improvement in carbohydrate homeostasis. Insulin responses to oral glucose and intravenous arginine administration were substantially lowered in children with symptomatic hypoglycemia. A deficiency of gluconeogenic substrate or impairment of amino acid mobilization may be a factor in the development of hypoglycemia in hypopituitarism similar to that postulated for ketotic hypoglycemia.

Methods

Patients

The formation of the patient cohort is shown in Figure 1. We searched the patient registry of Children and Adolescents at Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) for patients with diagnoses of hypopituitarism and related disorders from January 1985 to September 2018 (n = 2718, Figure 1). From the search, we identified (i) hits for CPHD ICD-codes (n = 237), (ii) familial cases (n = 106), and (iii) hits for other hypopituitarism ICD-codes between January 2009 and September 2018 (from the launch of electronic patient records; n = 644). Additionally, (iv) we went through growth database search results for HUH catchment area short patients (height ≤ -3 SDS at the age of ≥ 3 years) between 1990 and 2015 (n = 785). Hits (ii)-(iv) were inspected manually, to identify patients with CPHD but lacking the appropriate diagnosis. Patients with isolated hormone deficiencies, including IGHD, were excluded, to establish a cohort of well-defined CPHD patients.

Search strategy for cCPHD by ICD-10 diagnosis codes

Table 2.
Hospitals included in the tertiary hospital registry search and the secondary hospital spot sample

For validation, supplementary ICD-10 diagnosis code searches on E23.0-E23.9, Q89.2G, and Q04.0-Q04.9 (other congenital malformations of brain) were performed locally at the 4 tertiary hospitals for variable periods according to the possibilities of the individual hospital registries (Table 2).

The hospital registry searches, which included patients with an above-mentioned diagnosis code given at the age of 0–17 years, were followed by hospital file examinations to exclude patients born outside the study period 1996–2020 and patients with ICD-10 diagnosis codes indicating acquired PHD. Next, the DNPR and hospital registry searches were merged by central person registration numbers to disallow patient duplets, followed by a retrospective review of all available hospital files of the remaining patients to validate the cCPHD diagnosis and exclude patients with fewer than 2 documented secondary/tertiary hormone deficiencies or acquired CPHD.

Data Collection

Hospital file data were collected from March 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022. For the finally included patients, the following data were included: date of birth, sex as indicated by the presence of male/female genitals (male/female), born in Denmark (yes/no), date and results of blood samples and stimulation tests of interest (low/normal/inadequately high/high), date and result of urine osmolality measurement (low/normal/high), abnormalities of the adenohypophysis, neurohypophysis, pituitary stalk, midline, and cerebrum by the latest MRI (aplasia/hypoplasia/ectopic/normal or yes/no), and clinical signs of hormone deficiencies (yes/no).

### Combined pituitary hormone deficiency caused by a synonymous HESX1 gene mutation [^115N77sQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Mutations in the HESX1 gene can give rise to complex phenotypes that involve variable pituitary hormone deficiencies and other developmental defects.

Case Description

A 14-year-old boy presented with short stature and delayed puberty and received a diagnosis of GH deficiency, central hypothyroidism, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and secondary adrenal insufficiency. He had anterior pituitary hypoplasia, ectopic posterior pituitary, and an interrupted pituitary stalk. Genetic studies uncovered a heterozygous variant in exon 2 of the HESX1 gene (c.219C > T; p. Ser73Ser). This single base change was predicted to be synonymous at the translational level but was shown to cause skipping of exon 2 in the RNA transcript.

Conclusions

This study of a patient with combined pituitary hormone deficiency revealed an unusual synonymous mutation of the HESX1 gene leading to abnormal RNA processing and indicates the importance of investigating silent variants that at first glance appear to be benign.

Materials and Methods

Study Population

The study included all patients with cCPHD in Denmark born between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2020, identified through ICD-10 diagnosis code searches in the DNPR and locally at the 4 Danish tertiary hospitals.

The DNPR contains all inpatients in Denmark since 1977 and all outpatients since 1995, with ICD-10 diagnosis codes since 1994. Whenever a patient is in contact with a Danish hospital, 1 primary and an optional number of secondary ICD-10 diagnosis codes are registered as the reason for the contact, along with codes identifying the reporting hospital and department. The DNPR identifies patients based on a central person registrations number, which is a unique personal identification number, including information on date of birth, given to all Danish citizens since 1968. The validity and completeness of the DNPR ICD-10 diagnosis code registration allow for national incidence estimations according to a systematic review.

The DNPR search identified all Danish patients with relevant diagnoses before age 15 years from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2020. As cCPHD does not have a specific ICD-10 diagnosis code, we had to search the DNPR for broader pituitary-related ICD-10 diagnosis codes E23.0-E23.9 (hypofunction and other disorders of pituitary) and Q89.2G (congenital malformation of pituitary), thus including both isolated PHD and acquired CPHD. A number of additional ICD-10 diagnosis codes indicating an acquired etiology of PHD were used as exclusion criteria, as detailed in Table 1. Furthermore, identified patients who were not treated at a tertiary hospital were excluded. To detect failure of referral of patients with cCPHD to a tertiary hospital, we reviewed the hospital files of all patients registered at 1 secondary hospital in the DNPR data set as a spot sample (Table 2). This was done to examine the frequency of referral failure and, through that, the validity of the method used to identify patients with cCPHD.

Results

Through the ICD-10 diagnosis code searches and the subsequent hospital file reviews, we identified 114 patients through the DNPR search and 14 patients through the tertiary hospital registries, resulting in a national cCPHD cohort of 128 patients (Table S1). Of these, 116 were born in Denmark and diagnosed before age 18 years, representing the national incidence cohort of cCPHD diagnosed < 18 years (Fig. 1).

Patients at risk of cCPHD were identified through searches on ICD-10 diagnosis codes E23.0-E23.9 (hypofunction and other disorders of pituitary), Q89.2G (congenital malformation of pituitary), and Q04.0-Q04.9 (other congenital malformations of brain).

Furthermore, we chose to include patients who developed hypothyroidism during GH therapy even though evidence suggests that GH therapy may affect thyroid hormone levels per se. Some studies suggest that the changes in thyroid hormone levels during GH therapy are caused by increased peripheral thyroxine to triiodothyronine conversion, whereas others suggest unmasking of latent central hypothyroidism. We included patients with GHD and TSH deficiency, as 2 recent studies on children with nonacquired isolated GHD support the latter mechanism, and as our included patients had repeating levels of free thyroxine/thyroxine below the normal reference range.

The strengths of our study include the use of national registries with unique high completeness regarding patient diagnoses and birth counts, our supplementary tertiary hospital diagnosis code search, the method validation, the broadness of our diagnosis code searches for all-cause pituitary deficiency and pituitary malformation, and our hospital file validation of the cCPHD diagnosis by uniform criteria.

Our study also had limitations. A few children with cCPHD may have been overlooked due to incorrect diagnoses, lack of correct reporting to the DNPR, or lack of referral to a tertiary hospital. On the other hand, acquired causes of CPHD may have been undiagnosed in a few children.

The definition and validation of the hormonal deficiencies could be questioned, including inclusion of children with partly missing information and the potential of incorrect reference values for the hormone assays used in clinical practice. Despite our validation efforts, we had to rely on the diagnostic practice to some extent in this retrospective study. We were likewise unable to evaluate the extent of delay from disease onset to diagnosis.

The diagnosis of cCPHD may be challenging, especially in those with normal MRI findings. However, other studies have shown that normal anatomy of the pituitary gland does not exclude abnormal function and MRI findings are not included in the Danish or international diagnosis criteria guidelines. A few patients did not have MRI performed, which could lead to minor underestimation or overestimation of the rate of pituitary, midline, and other cerebral abnormalities. Furthermore, as not all patients had reached 18 years' age at last follow-up, not all late-onset hormonal deficiencies may have been recorded. Lastly, the external validity of our incidence estimates may be limited due to differences in population characteristics such as ethnicity and the frequency of consanguinity and founder mutations.

### Progression from isolated growth hormone deficiency to a combined pituitary hormone deficiency in a cohort of paediatrics patients with pituitary morphology abnormalities on MRI [^116NSL59]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital hypopituitarism (CH) is defined as the deficiency of one or more pituitary hormones resulting from events during fetal development. This may be the result of genetic mutation, antenatal insult, or as is commonly the case, be idiopathic The estimated incidence is 1 per 3,000–10,000 live births. This condition can present as a single hormonal deficiency with the most common manifestation being insufficient growth hormone (IGHD); or as a combined hormonal deficiency with two or more pituitary deficiencies (CPHD).

During embryogenesis, hypothalamic-pituitary (H-P) development is controlled by a complex sequence of crosstalk with spatiotemporal activation and inactivation of transcription factors and signalling molecules between the hypothalamus, Rathke's pouch, and the anterior pituitary primordium. Described genes involved in the early stages of hypothalamic-pituitary development are: HESX1, SOX 1/2/3, PITX1, PITX2, OTX2, RAX, LHX3, LHX4, GLI2, ARNT2, PAX6, BMP4, FGFR1, FGFR8, PROKR2, ROBO, WNT, CDON, IGSF1, CHD7, NFKB2, FOXA2, TCF7L1, MAGEL2, L1CAM, EIF2S3, PNPLA6, GLI3, SHH, ALMS. Pathogenic variants in the above genes usually give rise to syndromic manifestations of hypopituitarism. They usually present with malformations or affections in other systems of the body such as immune-level abnormalities, skeletal, ophthalmic, or auditory malformations. In addition, they may display midline abnormalities in the cerebral imaging studies: pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) septo-optic dysplasia (SOD), and holoprosencephaly (HPE).

### Presentation and diagnosis of childhood-onset combined pituitary hormone deficiency: a single center experience from over 30 years [^114Adc7k]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Among the HUH patients with congenital CPHD, seven (15%) had a previous molecular genetic diagnosis, including one patient with SOD. In our molecular genetic investigations of 21 patients with congenital CPHD, no new conclusive molecular genetic diagnoses (that is, a pathogenic variant according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines in genes implicated in CPHD/GHD) were made. One variant in SHH, c.676G > A, p.(Ala226Thr), carried by patient #12 with PSIS and her healthy mother, was classified as "likely pathogenic", and thus the variant is the probable cause for the patient's disease. The variant has previously been identified in a Dutch patient with PSIS and CPHD, and in a familial case of holoprosencephaly. In our patient and the two previous cases, the variant was also present in clinically unaffected parents suggesting incomplete penetrance, a phenomenon often described in both familial CPHD and holoprosencephaly. (e.g.,) In addition to the variant in SHH, patient #12 carried rare variants in five other genes implicated in CPHD/GHD. Similarly, patients #2, #6, #7, and #9 carried rare variants in five genes implicated in CPHD/GHD. Although these variants were inherited from healthy family members or their segregation could not be assessed, we cannot rule out the possibility that the variants (especially those of "unknown significance") could have contributed to CPHD. As to the extremely rare (MAF ≤ 0.01% or not reported) variants classified as "uncertain significance" (ISL1 (patient #10); ALMS1 and L1CAM (patient #6); and FGFR1, CHD7, and SHH (patient #7)), the phenotype of patient #6 did not match the phenotypes or the mode of inheritance related to ALMS1 or L1CAM in previous literature (Table 5 and Supplementary Table 4), whereas the phenotypic comparison did not further support or exclude the role of the identified variants in patients #7 and #10. Taken together, the 15% frequency of conclusive genetic diagnoses in congenital CPHD is in line with the previous frequency estimate (12.4%) for pathogenic variants in the five most frequent CPHD genes (PROP1, POU1F1, HESX1, LHX3, and LHX4) that was calculated from 21 different CPHD genetic studies.

Figure 1
Flowchart on the formation of the patient cohort. Through a comprehensive search for panhypopituitarism and related ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes, we identified n = 124 pediatric CPHD patients diagnosed or treated in the Helsinki University Hospital Children and Adolescents between 1985 and 2018. Patients with at least two pituitary hormone deficiencies were included in the study (Supplementary Table 2). Cases with partial laboratory testing were evaluated by experienced clinicians (PJM, MH, TR) based on patient records and growth charts.

ICD, International Classification of Diseases; CPHD, combined pituitary hormone deficiency; GH, growth hormone; GHD, growth hormone deficiency

The identified CPHD cases (n = 196+23, Figure 1) were inspected to fulfill the inclusion criteria of at least two biochemically verified pituitary hormone deficiencies (for details, see Supplementary Table 2). Patient records and growth charts of patients with insufficient biochemical data were evaluated by experienced clinicians (PJM, MH, TR). The final study cohort comprised 124 patients (69 boys and 55 girls; Figure 1). Unequivocally subnormal hormone levels related to GH, TSH, and ACTH deficiency were present in 105, 78, and 29 patients, respectively. In others, hormone replacement therapy had been started either (i) based on clinical evaluation (e.g. after pituitary-hypophyseal region tumor resection), (ii) after partial laboratory testing of the pituitary function, or (iii) due to borderline low hormone level, and/or imminent progression of the deficiency in the context of high risk for hypopituitarism. Especially, the inclusion of gonadotropin deficiency and diabetes insipidus often required evaluation by the clinicians. In further analyses of the included patients, hormone replacement therapy is reported as a marker of pituitary hormone deficiency.

Clinical data

All diagnoses of the eligible patients were obtained from the patient records to classify acquired and congenital forms of CPHD. Acquired CPHD was defined to include CPHD of causes extrinsic to pituitary, and congenital CPHD included all idiopathic, syndromic, and genetic CPHD, regardless of the age at presentation. Presenting symptoms for all patients were collected. Age at presentation was the age at first visit or consultation by a HUH pediatric endocrinologist or pediatrician due to findings indicating the need for pituitary assessment. Age at diagnosis was the age at which the physician had recorded the deficiency of at least two pituitary hormones into the patient records. If not available, the date of commencement of hormonal treatment after the diagnosis of two pituitary hormone deficiencies was used.

Additional data collected for the patients with congenital CPHD included (i) birth data (pregnancy details, asphyxia and breech position at delivery, neonatal complications, and features suggesting hypopituitarism),(ii) phenotypic features, (iii) findings in brain MRI, (iv) family history of growth disorders and pituitary hormone deficiencies, and (v) auxological data (see next section). Septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) was defined as optic nerve hypoplasia (clinically or radiologically determined) in combination with hypopituitarism (self-evidently present in all our patients) and/or midline brain abnormalities. Regarding the neonatal phenotype of hypopituitarism, we categorized hypoglycaemia as a defined feature of CPHD, if the patient had had a hypoglycaemic seizure or apnea, or if she/he had been treated with intravenous glucose for > 3 days, or at > 3 days of age (persistent hypoglycaemia); other neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring any iv-glucose was defined as a non-specific cue. Similarly, we recorded jaundice as a defined feature, if phototherapy was given at > 7 days of age, or with remark "prolonged jaundice"; otherwise, jaundice requiring any phototherapy was defined as a non-specific cue. We decided to include the slight, non-specific hypoglycaemia/jaundice phenotypes, since the duration or severity of the symptom had not been recorded for all patients, and, for some patients, the hormone replacement therapy was commenced so early that the persistence of the neonatal phenotype could not be assessed. However, we report the defined phenotypes separately. As for the neonatal genital phenotype, bilateral cryptorchidism and/or micropenis were accepted as signs of gonadotropin deficiency if stated in the patient records (information on penile length was not available for all patients). Preterm infants (born GW < 37) were excluded from the neonatal phenotype analyses, since the probability of jaundice (both the severity and duration) and hypoglycemia among them are considerably higher than in full terms.

### Genetics of combined pituitary hormone deficiency: roadmap into the genome era [^112LP8G5]. Endocrine Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The genetic basis for combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) is complex, involving 30 genes in a variety of syndromic and nonsyndromic presentations. Molecular diagnosis of this disorder is valuable for predicting disease progression, avoiding unnecessary surgery, and family planning. We expect that the application of high throughput sequencing will uncover additional contributing genes and eventually become a valuable tool for molecular diagnosis. For example, in the last 3 years, six new genes have been implicated in CPHD using whole-exome sequencing. In this review, we present a historical perspective on gene discovery for CPHD and predict approaches that may facilitate future gene identification projects conducted by clinicians and basic scientists. Guidelines for systematic reporting of genetic variants and assigning causality are emerging. We apply these guidelines retrospectively to reports of the genetic basis of CPHD and summarize modes of inheritance and penetrance for each of the known genes. In recent years, there have been great improvements in databases of genetic information for diverse populations. Some issues remain that make molecular diagnosis challenging in some cases. These include the inherent genetic complexity of this disorder, technical challenges like uneven coverage, differing results from variant calling and interpretation pipelines, the number of tolerated genetic alterations, and imperfect methods for predicting pathogenicity. We discuss approaches for future research in the genetics of CPHD.

### The diagnostic trajectory of infants and children with clinical features of genetic disease [^113gZkJF]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study has strengths and limitations. Strengths include the size of the population evaluated — which included over 13 million unique patients from a large commercial health plan population, representative of commercially-insured patients more generally. Our methodology, which included a detailed curation of indicators of genetic disease, allowed us to evaluate several different populations of patients based on different levels of specificity. Finally, our administrative claims-based approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of direct healthcare-related utilization and costs. Several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results. First, as our methodology utilized insurance claims data as opposed to electronic health records, we are limited in our ability to interpret both diagnostic thinking and clinical decision-making. For example, while we observe substantial delays in genetic testing in many patients, the reasons for these delays are unclear and may be clinically warranted based on the unique circumstances of individual patients. Similarly, ICD-9/10 codes do not capture the granularity required to distinguish diagnosed genetic conditions. Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a deep ontology that relates detailed clinical features to both diseases and genes. Availability of HPO terms in a large data set like this would have improved our specificity in defining populations and HPO coding (or improvements in ICD coding informed by HPO) could contribute to future studies of genetic disease in populations. In addition, while some genetic diseases have specific ICD-9/10 codes, many do not; thus, we are unable to definitively determine the end of a diagnostic odyssey for many individual patients. Second, our definitions of possible, probable and definite genetic disease are based on expert opinion and manual curation. Not all patients with these features would have had a genetic diagnosis even if optimal testing had been performed. This is likely due to additional undescribed disease-causing genes, oligogenic and complex inheritance, and environmental phenocopies. How ICD-9/10 codes are used for insurance billing purposes may not be aligned with the diagnostic thinking of clinicians. Coding systems, including diagnosis and procedure codes, are used for billing purposes and are likely to fail to reflect the variability observed in clinical practice. Furthermore, a level of miscoding is presumed to occur as is inherent in claims database studies (e.g. a coding specialist may select the first code on a list of possible codes as opposed to the most appropriate code). Third, given the substantial health conditions of patients with genetic diseases, patients may transition to public insurance programs, switch between private insurance plans, or for other reasons stopped being observed in the database. Although our continuous enrollment requirements help control for some of this variability, there are inherent limitations to the comprehensiveness of the follow-up, which could also be exacerbated by the severity of the disease. Finally, in our selection of patients, we found a large number of newborns with codes indicating a possible genetic condition but no stay in a NICU. Because we required a stay in a NICU, these patients were excluded from analysis in the critically-ill infant population and were instead included in the pediatric population.

### Diagnosis and incidence of congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency in Denmark – A national observational study [^112fgr6T]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency (cCPHD) is the loss of ≥ 2 pituitary hormones caused by congenital factors.

Objective

We aimed to estimate the national incidence of cCPHD diagnosed before age 18 years and in subgroups.

Methods

Patients with cCPHD were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry and Danish hospital registries in the period 1996–2020. Hospital files were reviewed and incidences calculated using background population data. Incidence was the main outcome measure.

Results

We identified 128 patients with cCPHD; 88 (68.8%) were males. The median (range) age at diagnosis was 6.2 (0.01–19.0) years. The median (25th;75th percentile) number of hormone deficiencies at diagnosis was 3 (3; 4) at < 1 year vs 2 (2; 2) at 1–17 years, P < .0001. Abnormal pituitary magnetic resonance imaging findings were seen in 70.3% (83/118). For those born in Denmark aged < 18 years at diagnosis (n = 116/128) the estimated national incidence (95% CI) of cCPHD was 10.34 (7.79–13.72) per 100 000 births, with an annual incidence rate of 5.74 (4.33–7.62) per million. In subgroup analysis (diagnosis < 1 vs 1–17 years), the incidence was highest in the 1–17 years subgroup, 7.97 (5.77–11.00) vs 1.98 (1.39–2.84) per 100 000 births, whereas the annual incidence rate was highest at < 1 year, 19.8 (13.9–28.4) vs 4.69 (3.39–6.47) per million births.

Conclusion

cCPHD had the highest incidence rate and the most hormone deficiencies in those diagnosed at < 1 year. The incidence was highest in the 1–17 years age group, underscoring the need for multiple pituitary hormone investigations throughout childhood and adolescence in children with only 1 hormone deficiency.

Genetics

In previous clinical or research investigations, a molecular genetic cause of CPHD had been identified in seven patients: a homozygous deletion of PROP1 in two siblings of Kurdish origin with CPHD, compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants in TBC1D32 in siblings with PSIS, and mild craniofacial dysmorphism; a previously described loss-of-function variant in SOX2 in a female patient with SOD (anophthalmia and CPHD), a Xq27.1 microduplication of unknown size leading to loss of SOX3 in a male patient with PSIS, and a frameshift variant in OTX2 in a male patient with PSIS and retinitis pigmentosa.,

Of the 21 patients who were enrolled in genetic investigations, 18 carried rare (MAF ≤ 2%) nonsynonymous or consensus splice site variants in genes implicated in CPHD/GHD, as shown in Table 5. Due to incomplete sequence data availability from family members, we were unable to analyze the mode of inheritance for most variants. Variants with MAF either ≤ 0.5% or not reported, were identified in ten indexes in 16 different genes (ALMS1, ARNT2, CDON, CHD7, CLCNKB, DCHS1, FGFR1, IGSF10, ISL1, KAT6A, L1CAM, LAMB2, LHX3, MAGEL2, RBM28, and SHH). However, according to the ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines, classifications for most variants were "Uncertain significance" or "likely benign". The rare variants identified in our study were all heterozygous, and, considering the incidence estimate of CPHD presented above, the possibility of an autosomal dominant monogenic disease could only be considered in patients carrying extremely rare variants. Limiting to variants with MAF ≤ 0.01% or not reported and excluding those classified as "benign" or "likely benign", we encountered variants in ISL1 (patient #10); SHH (patient #12); ALMS1 and L1CAM (patient #6); and FGFR1, CHD7, and SHH (patient #7). The only variant classified as "likely pathogenic", was the heterozygous SHH c.676G > A, p.(Ala226Thr) variant carried by patient #12 with PSIS (GH, ACTH, TSH deficiencies, and estrogen treatment due to suspected partial gonadotropin deficiency) and her unaffected mother.

PROP1 mutation __Explanation: __ The infant in this vignette presents with hypothermia, persistent hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and an abnormal brain MRI, a constellation of findings that raise suspicion for multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies and a diagnosis of central hypopituitarism.

1–3 While the etiology of CH is unknown in the majority of cases, familial or sporadic congenital CH is most commonly due to mutations in PROP1, a pituitary-specific transcription factor. 3, 4 CH in the neonatal period is characterized by one or more pituitary hormone deficiencies. The anterior pituitary, regulated by the hypothalamic neurosecretory system, has a central role in the secretion of six hormones. 2, 3 Brain MRI is the preferred modality for assessing pituitary abnormalities in patients with CH, which may include a hypoplastic pituitary gland with an ectopic posterior pituitary or an interrupted or hypoplastic pituitary stalk.

2 Hyperbilirubinemia in patients with CH can be due to GH deficiency, hypothyroidism, or adrenal insufficiency, resulting in impaired bilirubin conjugation, cholestasis, and prolonged indirect hyperbilirubinemia. 1, 6 In CH, gonadotropin deficiency in males can present as micropenis, with or without undescended testes, due to luteinizing hormone deficiency. Females with gonadotropin deficiency are often asymptomatic at birth. 1, 2. Neonates with hyperinsulinemia, hypoketosis, and hypoglycemia should raise suspicion for congenital hyperinsulinism, most commonly caused by mutations in the. ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which encode K ATP channels. 7 Clinical findings indicative of congenital hyperinsulinism include a high glucose infusion requirement, a detectable insulin level higher than anticipated for the glucose level, increased C-peptide levels, low free fatty acid levels, low serum ketone levels, and absence of ketonuria.

Phenotypic features of congenital CPHD

The deficiency of all anterior pituitary hormones (GH, ACTH, TSH, and FSH/LH) was present in 14 (30%) patients with congenital CPHD (Supplementary Table 3). Other frequent combinations of hormone deficiencies included GH and TSH (n = 9, 19%), GH, TSH, and FSH/LH (n = 8, 17%), and GH, TSH, and ACTH (n = 6, 13%). DI was present in seven (15%) patients. IGHD had preceded the development of CPHD in six (14%) patients (data available in 43/48).

Of the 48 patients with congenital CPHD, eight (17%) were born in breech position, and four (8%) had suffered from birth asphyxia. Neonatal signs associated with hypopituitarism were present in 26 (74%) patients (Figure 3). Six patients were excluded from the neonatal phenotype analysis due to prematurity and seven due to lack of data. A defined neonatal phenotype (see Materials and Methods) was present in 23 (66%) patients. Of these patients, 68% had received a CPHD diagnosis during the first six months of their life (data available in 22/23), including all eight male patients with a genital phenotype. Five patients with defined neonatal signs of hypopituitarism (24%; data available in 21/23), who had either isolated hypoglycaemia or isolated jaundice, did not present to endocrine investigations during the first year of their life.

### Congenital hypopituitarism in neonates… [^114ePBH6]. publications.aap.org (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with congenital hypopituitarism are born without normal production of 1 or more of the hormones normally produced in the pituitary gland. The clinical spectrum varies widely; although a number of genetic causes are known, most cases are thought to be idiopathic. Mutations in transcription factors involved in various stages of pituitary development can lead to combined pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many clinical signs and symptoms of congenital hypopituitarism are nonspecific and include poor weight gain, hypoglycemia, jaundice, and cholestasis; examination findings include midline defects. Diagnosis should include cranial imaging with magnetic resonance imaging, as well as laboratory evaluation for pituitary hormone deficits. Hormone replacement should be initiated after the diagnoses of deficiencies are confirmed. Skip Nav Destination Article navigation Comments

### Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome with coexistent focal cortical dysplasia in a young boy [^115y1GuF]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

The pituitary gland secretes hormones that influence metabolism, blood pressure, growth and reproduction.PSIS has a documented incidence of 0.5 per million live births, with a male predominance and a sex ratio of 1.7. The pathophysiology of PSIS is unknown, but many hypotheses suggest that chromosomal microdeletions, including mutations in transcription factor genes such as HESX1 (3p21.2-p21.1), LHX4, SOX3, OTX2 and PROKR2, may play a role. A new hypothesis proposes that abnormal embryonic development, genetic background and specific genetic mutations contribute to an increased likelihood of delivery-related abnormalities, with varying degrees of traction during delivery, potentially leading to different levels of pituitary stalk interruption and an ectopic posterior lobe. Additionally, variants of genes linked to midline brain abnormalities are frequently found in PSIS, supporting the concept of a polygenic aetiology for this condition. Importantly, 5% of patients diagnosed with PSIS have a family history. Perinatal asphyxia may also impact the anterior pituitary gland, leading to stalk ischaemia and defective migration of the pituitary gland during intrauterine life. Clinical manifestations during the perinatal period can be severe and complex and may even be life-threatening. These manifestations include hypoglycaemia, prolonged jaundice, seizures, failure to thrive, recurrent hyponatraemia, poor sucking and congenital anomalies such as microphallus, cryptorchidism and patent ductus arteriosus.

In childhood, symptoms may present as seizures, short stature, poor growth, delayed puberty, small penis and cryptorchidism.PSIS is diagnosed via MRI, typically revealing a triad of a hypoplastic or absent anterior pituitary gland, a thin or absent pituitary stalk and an ectopic posterior pituitary gland. The literature attributes the pathophysiology of seizures in PSIS to hypoglycaemia and hyponatraemia secondary to adrenal insufficiency. However, in our case, both sodium and glucose levels were normal, and the results of the synacthen test were within the normal range.

PSIS is associated with a wide spectrum of midline anomalies, including septo-optic dysplasia, which encompasses septogenesis, agenesis of the corpus callosum, optic nerve hypoplasia, pituitary deficiency and holoprosencephaly. Holoprosencephaly results when the prosencephalon fails to separate properly between days 18 and 28 of gestation, leading to brain abnormalities, facial deformities (such as cyclopia, median or bilateral labial or palatal clefts, hypertelorism and single median incisors) and intellectual disabilities.

### Genetic analyses of bone morphogenetic protein 2, 4 and 7 in congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency [^113WXoCn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The development of the pituitary gland is a highly complex process, involving many signalling molecules and transcription factors. During embryogenesis cells from the oral ectoderm form the adenohypophysis, while the posterior part develops from neural tissue. With the help of animal models it has been shown that transcription factors like HesX1, Prop1, Pou1F1, Lhx3, Lhx4, Pitx1, Pitx2, Otx2, Sox2 and Sox3 play a crucial role in the development of the pituitary gland. Several mutations in genes encoding these transcription factors have been reported in combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). However, for most of the patients the genetic cause of hypoplasia or at least functional insufficiency of the pituitary gland remains to be discovered.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) 2, 4 and 7 have a crucial role during the embryonic development of the pituitary gland. In early development Bmp4 contributes to the formation of the rudimentary Rathke's pouch in the mouse (reviewed in). Later BMP 2, 4 and 7 secreted by surrounding tissues contribute to the polarisation of the pouch. The development of the pituitary gland is completed within the first trimester of pregnancy in humans.

The BMPs are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß family and bind to type 1 and 2 serine-threonine kinase receptors (BMPR1A and BMPR2). Among different isoforms, three type 1 receptors (BMPR1A/ALK3, BMPR1B/ALK6, and ACVR1A/ALK2) and three type 2 receptors (BMPR2, ACTR2A, and ACTR2B) mediate most of the effects of BMPs. Bmp2 null mice die between embryonic day E.7.5 and E.10.5, suffering from cardiac defects. Selective inhibition of Bmp4 in mouse embryos results in a loss of nearly all pituitary cell lines except a few corticotrophs. Bmp4 knock-out mice are characterized by pituitary aplasia, suffer from severe facial, kidney and skeletal abnormalities, and die early in embryogenesis. Severe eye defects and skeletal and renal anomalies are found also in Bmp7 null mice, which die shortly after birth. However, systematic search for mutations in BMP2, 4 and 7 in patients with combined pituitary insufficiency has not been performed yet. So, the aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic variants in BMP2, BMP4 and/or BMP7 are associated with congenital pituitary insufficiency.

Discussion

Little is known about the incidence of congenital CPHD. The available incidence estimates range from 1/4000–1/10 000, but in fact, these are based on variable short stature and growth hormone deficiency incidence/prevalence estimates and on one optic nerve hypoplasia study. We studied pediatric CPHD patients treated in the largest tertiary center in Finland, and, after inclusion of only patients with two or more pituitary hormone deficiencies, were able to provide an incidence estimate for congenital CPHD of 1 in 16 000 children.

Persistent neonatal hypoglycemia, jaundice, and genital hypoplasia are important cues to early diagnosis of congenital CPHD. In 66% of our patients, a defined neonatal hypopituitarism phenotype was present. Almost one-third of the boys with congenital CPHD had micropenis and/or bilateral cryptorchidism. Half of all congenital CPHD patients had received phototherapy or exhibited prolonged jaundice, and 66% had required neonatal iv-glucose infusion or exhibited a hypoglycaemic seizure during the first weeks of life. These frequency estimates are clearly higher than those among healthy neonates and infants (cryptorchidism: 1 to 9% of full-term boys; phototherapy: up to 8% of term/late preterm infants; occurrence of low plasma glucose, usually noted as < 2.2 to 2.5 mmol/L: 5% to 15% of normal newborn infants), yet the symptoms per se are highly unspecific and therefore easily missed as a sign of a rare disease such as pituitary hormone deficiency. As suggested before, prolonged and severe neonatal hypoglycemia and jaundice should trigger the suspicion of CPHD. In contrast to the results by Jullien et al. neonatal genital phenotype was in our series a cue to early diagnosis of CPHD. Also, the boys with a neonatal genital phenotype developed GHD and most of them could be verified with gonadotropin deficiency. In our series, patients with combinations of defined neonatal features of CPHD were identified early. However, isolated hypoglycaemia or jaundice did not always trigger endocrine investigations, and a substantial proportion (24%) of the patients with defined neonatal features suggesting hypopituitarism presented to endocrine investigations only after their first birthday.

### A novel dominant negative mutation of OTX2 associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency [^116a1CGv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) is characterized by deficiencies in more than one anterior pituitary hormone. Mutations in developmental factors responsible for pituitary cell specification and gene expression have been found in CPHD patients. OTX2, a bicoid class homeodomain protein, is necessary for both forebrain development and transactivation of the HESX1 promoter, but as of yet, has not been associated with CPHD.

Objective

The goal of this study was to identify and characterize novel mutations in pituitary specific transcription factors from CPHD patients.

Design

Genomic DNA was isolated from patients with hypopituitarism to amplify and sequence eight pituitary specific transcription factors (HESX1, LHX3, LHX4, OTX2, PITX2, POU1F1, PROP1, and SIX6). Characterization of novel mutations is based on structural and functional studies.

Results

We describe two unrelated children with CPHD who presented with neonatal hypoglycemia, and deficiencies of GH, TSH, LH, FSH, and ACTH. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed anterior pituitary hypoplasia with an ectopic posterior pituitary. A novel heterozygous OTX2 mutation (N233S) was identified. Wild-type and mutant OTX2 proteins bind equivalently to bicoid binding sites, whereas mutant OTX2 revealed decreased transactivation.

Conclusions

A novel mutation in OTX2 binds normally to target genes and acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of HESX1 gene expression. This suggests that the expression of HESX1, required for spaciotemporal development of anterior pituitary cell types, when disrupted, results in an absent or underdeveloped anterior pituitary with diminished hormonal expression. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism for CPHD and extend our knowledge of the spectrum of gene mutations causing CPHD.

### Pituitary society guidance: pituitary disease management and patient care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic-an international perspective [^116qAJac]. Pituitary (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — scope and caveats for pituitary care during COVID-19: Evaluation and treatment of pituitary disorders have been substantially impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with reduced access causing delays, and patients undergoing surgery and healthcare providers facing infection concerns. The guidance discusses scenarios where care can be adjusted temporarily without compromising outcomes, notes that suggestions are not evidence-based due to the pandemic's novelty, and states that re-evaluation every few months in light of emerging data is recommended.

Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs".

Combined Pituitary Hormone Deficiencies

There are a large number of causes of neonatal CPHDs, which may be classified as developmental, syndromic, genetic, or secondary to direct damage during the perinatal or birth period.

The key genes associated with CPHD are described in Table 4. These defects lead to variable deficits in the release of LH, FSH, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), thyroid Stimulating Hormone (or thyrotropin) (TSH), and prolactin from the anterior pituitary, and (less frequently) vasopressin and oxytocin from the posterior pituitary.

Table 4.
Key genes described in combined pituitary hormone deficiencies involving luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone. Sourced and adapted from and Genomics England Pituitary Hormone Deficiency panel (3.1)

A population study in Finland estimated the incidence of congenital CPHD at 1 in 16 000. Of their cohort of 48 patients with CPHD, most (60.4%) were of idiopathic origin, 14.6% had a genetic diagnosis (due to defects in PROP1, SOX3, SOX2, OTX2, and TBC1D32), and the remainder (25%) had septo-optic dysplasia without a genetic diagnosis. Of these 48 patients, 8 male patients (16.7%) presented with a genital phenotype of micropenis and/or bilateral cryptorchidism; no female patients had an identifiable genital phenotype. Seven of these 8 patients were treated during mini-puberty, 5 with rFSH and testosterone and 2 with only testosterone. All in the cohort who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had abnormalities, of which 90% included classical findings such as pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS), with anterior pituitary hypoplasia, absent/ectopic posterior pituitary, and a hypoplastic infundibulum. Extrapituitary signs in patients with congenital CPHD included craniofacial, eye, genital, ear, and dental abnormalities, abnormalities of thermoregulation, musculoskeletal anomalies including arthrogryposis, and developmental delay or epilepsy.

### Pediatric reference intervals for thyroid hormone levels from birth to adulthood: a retrospective study [^113B1FC4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Data were collected routinely within the setting of clinical practice according to standard procedures. The parents of the children gave their informed consent. No further measures were taken beyond clinical practice.

Classification of the patients in diagnostic categories was done using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes. Children with conditions or concomitant medications likely to affect thyroid function were excluded from the reference group. Also patients with eating disorders, with pituitary disease or chromosomal anomalies were not included in the analysis. Patients presenting a deviation in height or weight were identified at the clinical examination and classified as normal variants of growth (ICD E34.3 and E34.4) including familial or constitutional factors. All diagnostic groups have been included in a separate Excel file (additional material). Each diagnostic group was statistically evaluated in comparison to Z00.0 (n = 414; general examination and investigation of persons without complaint and reported diagnosis) using the one way ANOVA post-hoc analyses (data not shown). Serum samples from patients having the following ICD-10 diagnostic codes indicating thyroid dysfunction were excluded a-priori (n = 665): Congenital hypothyroidism with and without diffuse goiter (E03.0, E03.1), other non toxic goiter (E04.0 – E04.9), dyshormonogenetic goiter (E07.1), thyrotoxicosis (E05.0 – E05.9), autoimmune thyroiditis and unspecified thyroiditis (E06.3, E06.9), any neoplasm of the thyroid gland (C73 and D44.0), post procedural hypothyroidism (E89.0), and other specified or unspecified hypothyroidism (E03.8, E03.9).

Methods

Analyses of TSH, fT3, and fT4 from undiluted serum samples of children and adolescents were performed on an automated immunoassay system (Advia ® Centaur™, Bayer Health Care Diagnostika, Vienna, Austria) using a direct chemiluminiscence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. TSH was analyzed in a two-site solid-phase format, whereas analysis of fT3 and fT4 was performed in a competitive assay. The intraassay coefficients of variation for TSH, fT3, and for fT4 were < 8.7%, < 3.5%, and < 8.1% respectively. The reference values on adult patients using this immunoassay system have recently been published in BMC Endocrine Disorders and Thyroid.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to recognize that idiopathic GHD in adults is very rare and stringent criteria are necessary to make this diagnosis. Consider obtaining two tests before making this diagnosis because in the absence of suggestive clinical circumstances there is a significant false-positive error rate in the response to a single GH stimulation test. Recognize that the presence of a low IGF-1 also increases the likelihood that this diagnosis is correct.

### Clinical lessons learned in constitutional hypopituitarism from two decades of experience in a large international cohort [^116pH1QT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The international GENHYPOPIT network collects phenotypical data and screens genetic causes of non-acquired hypopituitarism.

Aims

To describe main phenotype patterns and their evolution through life.

Design

Patients were screened according to their phenotype for coding sequence variations in 8 genes: HESX1, LHX3, LHX4, PROP1, POU1F1, TBX19, OTX2 and PROKR2.

Results

Among 1213 patients (1143 index cases), the age of diagnosis of hypopituitarism was congenital (24%), in childhood (28%), at puberty (32%), in adulthood (7.2%) or not available (8.8%). Noteworthy, pituitary hormonal deficiencies kept on evolving during adulthood in 49 of patients. Growth Hormone deficiency (GHD) affected 85.8% of patients and was often the first diagnosed deficiency. AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone deficiency rarely preceded GHD, but usually followed it by over 10 years. Pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) abnormalities were common (79.7%), with 39.4% pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS). The most frequently associated extrapituitary malformations were ophthalmological abnormalities (16.1%). Prevalence of identified mutations was 7.3% of index cases (84/1143) and 29.5% in familial cases (n = 146). Genetic analysis in 449 patients without extrapituitary phenotype revealed 36 PROP1, 2 POU1F1 and 17 TBX19 mutations.

Conclusion

This large international cohort highlights atypical phenotypic presentation of constitutional hypopituitarism, such as post pubertal presentation or adult progression of hormonal deficiencies. These results justify long-term follow-up, and the need for systematic evaluation of associated abnormalities. Genetic defects were rarely identified, mainly PROP1 mutations in pure endocrine phenotypes.

Pituitary disease management during COVID-19 — sex steroid and growth hormone therapies can often be deferred: testosterone or estrogen replacement could also reasonably be deferred for 6 months; GH replacement is usually deferred in a patient with an untreated sellar mass; in patients already established on gonadal or GH replacement, clinical assessment to avoid side effects would be adequate, with attention to adequate testosterone levels in men and maintenance of IGF-I below the age-adjusted upper normal reference level when essential biochemical testing is performed; dynamic testing to confirm GH deficiency should be deferred for 6–12 months until specialized endocrine testing units resume non-urgent procedures.

### Single-nucleotide variants in two Hedgehog genes, SHH and HHIP, as genetic cause of combined pituitary hormone deficiency [^1144Somw]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) is characterized by deficiencies of two or more anterior pituitary hormones. Its genetic cause is unknown in the majority of cases. The Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway has been implicated in disorders associated with pituitary development. Mutations in Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) have been described in patients with holoprosencephaly (with or without pituitary involvement). Hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP) has been associated with variations in adult height in genome wide association studies. We investigated whether mutations in these two genes of the Hh pathway, SHH and HHIP, could result in 'idiopathic' CPHD.

Design/Patients

We directly sequenced the coding regions and exon - intron boundaries of SHH and HHIP in 93 CPHD patients of the Dutch HYPOPIT study in whom mutations in the classical CPHD genes PROP1, POU1F1, HESX1, LHX3 and LHX4 had been ruled out. We compared the expression of Hh genes in Hep3B transfected cells between wild-type proteins and mutants.

Results

We identified three single-nucleotide variants (p. Ala226Thr, c.1078C > T and c.✱8G > T) in SHH. The function of the latter was severely affected in our in vitro assay. In HHIP, we detected a new activating variant c.-1G > C, which increases HHIP's inhibiting function on the Hh pathway.

Conclusions

Our results suggest involvement of the Hedgehog pathway in CPHD. We suggest that both SHH and HHIP are investigated as a second screening in CPHD, after mutations in the classical CPHD genes have been ruled out.

Consideration and diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) — conditions where GH provocative testing is not required: We suggest establishing a diagnosis of GHD without GH provocative testing in patients possessing all of the following three conditions: auxological criteria, a hypothalamic-pituitary defect (such as ectopic posterior pituitary and pituitary hypoplasia with abnormal stalk, tumor or irradiation), and deficiency of at least one additional pituitary hormone (Conditional recommendation, ●●○○). We suggest that GHD due to congenital hypopituitarism be diagnosed without formal GH provocative testing in a newborn with hypoglycemia who does not attain a serum GH concentration above 5 μg/L and has deficiency of at least one additional pituitary hormone and/or the classical imaging triad (ectopic posterior pituitary and pituitary hypoplasia with abnormal stalk) (Conditional recommendation, ●●○○). For patients who do not meet these criteria yet present a high index of suspicion, GHD can be diagnosed by the conventional approach.

A 38-week-gestation female infant is born via scheduled cesarean section to a 29-year-old woman with a history of thyroid carcinoma treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine therapy with subsequent hypothyroidism. Her pregnancy had been complicated by marijuana use, chronic hypertension, elevated glucose concentration on the 1-hour glucose tolerance test but normal on the 3-hour GTT, and group B. Streptococcus positivity. Membranes are ruptured at delivery. The delivery is complicated by difficultly delivering the fetal head which required vacuum assistance. At birth, the infant is well-appearing and received routine resuscitation after delayed cord clamping. The Apgar scores are 8 and 8. Shortly after 5 minutes, the infant becomes pale and starts grunting. She is placed on continuous positive airway pressure and transferred to the NICU. On admission, the infant is tachypneic with retractions, requiring +6 CPAP with a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.

### Progression from isolated growth hormone deficiency to a combined pituitary hormone deficiency in a cohort of paediatrics patients with pituitary morphology abnormalities on MRI [^111szf4F]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Alterations in genes involved in the later stages of hypothalamic pituitary formation, namely POUFU1, PROP1, KCNQ1, IFT172, GH1, GHRHR, RNPC3, TBX19, PCSK1, POMC, TBL1X, TRH, TRHR, give rise to isolated or combined deficiencies depending on the timing of each gene's expression. They generally occur without extracerebral involvement and patients may show anatomical alterations focused on the pituitary region, mainly in the form of pituitary hypoplasia (APH).

In these patients a great variability in the genotype-phenotype relationship is observed, depending on the type of pathogenic variant and its penetrance. In addition, the aetiology remains unknown in most patients and the causative mutations are identified in only a small proportion (10–20%) of cases. This suggests that other genes and/or environmental or epigenetic factors may play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Close monitoring of pituitary function is required because in patients with initially a single deficiency, other hormonal deficiencies may develop over the years. The risk of progression from IGHD to CPHD varies depending on the aetiology. In children with congenital idiopathic IGHD the most frequently observed additional deficiency is thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) followed by luteinizing (LH) and follicle-stimulating (FSH) hormones, while the least frequent hormone deficiency in the majority of cases is arginine vasopressin (AVP). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency may gradually evolve at any time during follow up in the presence of H-P abnormalities and/or TSH deficiency.

Given the paucity of the knowledge about the aetiology of these conditions, the aim of the present study is to describe the clinical and genetic characteristics, the hypothalamic-pituitary radiological involvement and the follow-up of a series of patients first diagnosed with congenital isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD).

Septo-optic dysplasia

SOD is a rare developmental disorder of the forebrain, optic pathway and pituitary gland, with an incidence of about 1 in every 10 000 births. It is loosely defined by the presence of at least 2 of 3 components of the triad of optic nerve hypoplasia, midline forebrain defects (eg, agenesis of the corpus callosum, absent septum pellucidum) or hypopituitarism. While SOD is a congenital malformation disorder, its etiology is multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental factors being implicated. For instance, the incidence of SOD is correlated with indices of deprivation such as unemployment and teenage pregnancies. Variants in a wide range of hypothalamo-pituitary developmental transcription factors have also been described in association with SOD (eg, HESX1, OTX2, SOX2, PROKR2, KAL1, FGF8, TCF7L1), but in the majority (99%), the underlying etiology is not identifiable. Many of these genes also show variable expressivity, with an overlap with other disorders such as Kallmann syndrome (KAL1, FGF8, FGFR1) or combined pituitary hormone deficiency (HESX1, PROKR2).

HyOb develops in 31% of patients with SOD, and can occur even in 12% of patients with isolated optic nerve hypoplasia. Associated neurological features are frequent (57% with bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia), ranging from focal neuro-ophthalmological deficits to developmental delay. Additionally, social communication, and repetitive or restrictive behavioral difficulties can occur in a third of patients. The combination of visual impairment, behavioral and sleep difficulties, hyperphagia, and weight gain seen in this condition can often be extremely difficult to manage. Some of these features are likely caused by hypothalamic dysfunction, although this is difficult to demonstrate.

### Progression from isolated growth hormone deficiency to a combined pituitary hormone deficiency in a cohort of paediatrics patients with pituitary morphology abnormalities on MRI [^1138Qygo]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

A total of 2.5% positive results in the different genetic tests were observed. This low results in genetic tests suggest there may be other genes involved, neither studied with our panel (only includes 20 genes) nor yet described. In addition, no genetic causes may be involved in the etiology of CH Variability in the pathogenic variants' penetrance and also in the phenotypes of the genes that intervene in the hypothalamic-pituitary development makes it difficult to interpret the results obtained and to describe new genes, as previously reported. In addition, the sample was small, and the number of subjects would have to be increased to have more accurate data. To remark on our sample of patients with initial diagnoses of IGHD with MRI abnormalities we did not find any pathogenic variations on PROP1 and POU1F1 genes despite these being the most frequently described genes in patients with congenital hypopituitarism. This may be due, as mentioned before, to the small sample of subjects or to the inclusion criteria of patients with initial diagnoses of IGHD deficiency. While not detailed in this manuscript, unpublished data from our clinical practice indicate that the diagnostic yield increases to approximately 16% with clinical exome sequencing and up to 20% when array-CGH is additionally performed.

### Molecular basis of combined pituitary hormone deficiencies [^1139ujbQ]. Endocrine Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Pituitary gland commitment from oral ectoderm occurs in response to inductive signals from the neuroepithelium of the ventral diencephalon. Invagination of the oral ectoderm leads to the creation of Rathke's pouch. Intensified cell proliferation within Rathke's pouch results in formation of the anterior pituitary lobe. Subsequently, highly differentiated cell types arise sequentially due to overlapping, but distinct, spatial and temporal patterns of signaling molecules and transcription factors. Mutations in some of the pituitary-specific transcription factors have been identified in patients with hypopituitarism, confirming the role of these factors in pituitary development.

### A newborn with combined pituitary hormone deficiency developing shock and sludge [^115z3fVL]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

A male neonate was born at 41 weeks of gestation with a birth weight of 3320 g. Artificial respiratory management was required due to respiratory disturbance 1 h after birth, and subsequently catecholamine-refractory low cardiac output-induced shock occurred. Severe combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) was considered based on the presence of his respiratory disturbance, hypoglycemia and micropenis. After hydrocortisone (HDC) administration, circulatory dynamics rapidly improved. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed aplasia of the anterior pituitary gland and ectopic posterior gland. γ-Glutamyltranspeptidase (γ-GTP) increased from day 10 after birth and direct bilirubin increased from day 18. On ultrasonography, sludge filling the common bile duct and gall bladder was observed. After initiating treatment with both ursodeoxycholic acid and recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), cholestasis improved and the sludge disappeared at 3 months after birth. In newborns with CPHD, severe central adrenal insufficiency might induce cardiogenic shock after birth. Early diagnosis and intervention are necessary.

Aging and phenotype differences in CO-GHD versus AO-GHD — Endogenous GH secretion declines with age, making differentiation from normal aging difficult and creating the need to use GH–stimulation tests in most patients with adoption of appropriate GH cut-points; compared with AO-GHD, adults with CO-GHD tend to have lower BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum IGF-1 levels, and poorer social outcomes, and CO-GHD due to organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease is associated with more severe long-term consequences, particularly decreased muscle mass, bone mineral density (BMD), and cardiac function.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^111THQ32]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### Overview of congenital hypopituitarism for the neonatologist… [^1116qTaG]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract Congenital hypopituitarism is the deficiency in 1 or more hormones produced by the anterior pituitary or released by the posterior pituitary and has an estimated incidence of 1 in 4, 000 to 10, 000. Due to the critical role the pituitary plays in growth, metabolic, and reproductive processes, early diagnosis is essential to prevent devastating and often preventable outcomes. However, in neonates with congenital hypopituitarism, symptoms are often nonspecific and tend to overlap with other disease processes, making diagnosis extremely challenging in the neonatal period. This review highlights the embryology and organogenesis of the pituitary gland, genetic causes of hypopituitarism, clinical presentations in the neonatal period, and methods to diagnose and treat select deficiencies with a focus on anterior pituitary hormones.

### Unilateral agenesis of internal carotid artery associated with congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency and pituitary stalk interruption without HESX1, LHX4 or OTX2 mutation: a case report [^112c5Jec]. Pituitary (2012). Low credibility.

Agenesis of internal carotid artery (ICA) is an unusual finding in subjects with congenital Combined Pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) with only nine cases being reported to date but to our best knowledge none of them was genetically investigated. A 10-years old girl presented with severe growth failure (height 103 cm) with substantial bone age delay (3 years). She had no history of perinatal insults or familial CPHD. There was no evidence of mental retardation or craniofacial dysmorphism or ophtalmological abnormalities. She was first diagnosed with GH and TSH deficiency. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hypoplastic anterior pituitary, flat sella turcica, absent pituitary stalk with ectopic posterior pituitary as well as agenesis of the left ICA and the left carotid canal. Genomic analysis of pituitary transcription factor HESX1, LHX4 and OTX2 showed no mutations. Treatment with GH and thyroxine was started. The patient remained free of neurovascular symptoms for 5 years but she presented at the age of 15 years with delayed puberty related to an evolving gonadotropin deficiency. ICA agenesis associated with CPHD is unusual and is often asymptomatic in children. Since the CPHD with pituitary stalk interruption cannot be due to HESX1, LHX4 or OTX2 mutation in our case, other pathogenetic mechanisms may be responsible for CPHD associated with unilateral ICA agenesis.

Adult GHD testing and diagnostic confirmation: GH–stimulation test/s should only be performed based on the appropriate clinical context of each individual patient with a history suggestive of a reasonable clinical suspicion of GHD and with the intent to initiate rGH replacement if the diagnosis is confirmed (Grade D; based on expert opinion). The diagnosis of adult GHD can be made without the need for performing GH–stimulation testing in certain patient subtypes, including those with organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease and biochemical evidence of multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD) (≥ 3 pituitary hormone deficiencies [PHD]) together with low-serum IGF-1 levels (< −2.0 standard deviation score [SDS]), as well as genetic defects affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axes and hypothalamic-pituitary structural brain defects (Grade C; BEL 3). In patients with ≤ 2 PHD, low-serum IGF-1 levels (< −2.0 SDS) alone are not sufficient to make a diagnosis; clinicians should perform 1 GH–stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis (Grade B; BEL 4; upgraded by consensus based on expert opinion).

Chronic health conditions

We identified CHCs using an adapted Hardelid code list for chronic conditions likely to require at least one year of follow-up care. We revised included codes and groupings to reflect conditions relevant to children with DS based on guidelines published by the DS Medical Interest Group, previous researchand consultation with two paediatricians (JE and RG; online supplemental material).

We grouped CHCs into nine body system categories:

Autoimmune, endocrine and metabolic
Cancers and blood disorders.
Cardiovascular.
Central nervous system (CNS).
Digestive, renal and genitourinary (GU).
Developmental and behavioural
Musculoskeletal.
Respiratory.
Vision and hearing.

We used codes indicating the presence of a CHC without providing detail necessary to group into any specific body system (eg, wheelchair use and palliative care) to calculate the incidence for having any CHC, but not for indicating multimorbidity or CHCs affecting specific body systems.

Within each body system category, we grouped ICD-10 codes into specific subcategories relevant to children with DS (eg, severe CHD, hypothyroidism), and we classified body system-specific conditions present from birth as congenital anomalies.

We defined incidence date as the first date a relevant ICD-10 code was recorded as any diagnosis or cause of death in HES or ONS records. When a child had multiple ICD-10 codes indicating the same body system, we used the date of the first as the incidence date for that body system. For example, when a child's records indicated both asthma and sleep apnoea, only the first recorded code counted towards the cumulative incidence of a CHC in the respiratory system category.

Cohort characteristics

We collated characteristics recorded in birth admissions and supplemented missing data on birth weight, gestational age and maternal age using maternal delivery records. Cohort characteristics at birth were sex, ethnicity category (white, Asian/Asian British, black/black British, mixed and other), calendar year of birth (in 4-year groups), birth weight (< 1500 g, 1500–2499 g, ≥ 2500 g), gestational age in weeks (< 32, 32–36, ≥ 37), maternal age in years (< 20, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, ≥ 40) and a quintile of neighbourhood deprivation indicator, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The IMD ranks neighbourhoods (averaging 650 households) based on a composite of domains, including income deprivation, crime and unemployment.

### Detection of genetic hypopituitarism in an adult population of idiopathic pituitary insufficiency patients with growth hormone deficiency [^116tHefe]. Pituitary (2011). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pituitary insufficiency (IPI) is diagnosed in 10% of all hypopituitary patients. There are several known and unknown aetiologies within the IPI group. The aim of this study was to investigate an adult IPI population for genetic cause according a screening schedule. From files of 373 GH deficient (GHD) patients on GH replacement 50 cases with IPI were identified. Of the 39 patients that approved to the study, 25 patients were selected for genetic investigation according to phenotype and 14 patients were not further tested, as sporadic isolated GHD (n = 9) and GHD with diabetes insipidus (n = 5) have low probability for a known genetic cause. Genotyping of all coding exons of HESX1, LHX4, PROP1, POU1F1 and GH1 genes were performed according to a diagnostic algorithm based on clinical, hormonal and neuroradiological phenotype. Among the 25 patients, an overall rate of 8% of mutations was found, and a 50% rate in familial cases. Among two sibling pairs, one pair that presented with complete anterior pituitary insufficiency, had a compound heterozygous PROP1 gene mutation (codons 117 and 120: exon 3 p Phe 117 Ile (c349 T > A) and p Arg 120 Cys (c358 C > T)) with a phenotype of very late onset ACTH-insufficiency. In the other sibling pair and in the sporadic cases no mutation was identified. This study suggests that currently known genetic causes are rare in sporadic adult IPI patients, and that systematic genetic screening is not needed in adult-onset sporadic cases of IPI. Conversely, familial cases are highly suspect for genetic causes.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111EZcQa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of GHD — because clinical features are nonspecific, a workup for GH deficiency should not be undertaken except in the context of "probable cause" — either a childhood history of GHD or a clinical context making GHD likely. We recommend that the ITT and the GHRH-arginine test have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to establish the diagnosis of GHD, but in those with clearly established recent (within 10 yr) hypothalamic causes of suspected GHD, e.g. irradiation, testing with GHRH-arginine may be misleading (1⊕⊕⊕⊕). Patients should be adequately replaced with other deficient hormones before any testing of GH secretion is performed, and because GH is secreted in an episodic manner, current diagnostic testing uses provocative tests of GH secretion, although these tests have significant intrinsic false-positive error rates.

### Progression from isolated growth hormone deficiency to a combined pituitary hormone deficiency in a cohort of paediatrics patients with pituitary morphology abnormalities on MRI [^1151w1Sn]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the baseline and follow-up clinical and radiological characteristics of a paediatric cohort initially diagnosed with isolated congenital growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) and pituitary morphology abnormality in MRI.

Patients and methods

Observational, ambispective and longitudinal review of paediatric patients with an initial diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency with pituitary morphology abnormality in MRI followed-up in a single tertiary hospital.

Results

After mean 11.3 (± 3.5DS) years of follow-up, the thirty patients (20 males) were classified into two groups: (1) isolated congenital growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) with 24 patients (9.5 years median follow up), and (2) combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) with 6 patients (13.5 years median follow up). Median age at diagnosis was IGHD 3.0 [2.0–4.0] and CPHD 3.0 [1.5–5.2] years. Regarding the cerebral MRI scan results, 2 patients had septo-optic dysplasia (CPHD), 5 had pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (3 IGHD), one had ectopic posterior pituitary (IGHD), 16 had anterior pituitary hypoplasia (15 IGHD) and 6 had the latter two conditions combined (5 IGHD). In genetic studies, 1 of 25 patients had positive NGS panel results and it was in the IGHD group. The target gene detected was GLI2. Clinical exome sequencing was performed with six patients, yielding inconclusive results (1 in the IGHD group and 5 in the CPHD group). Array CGH was performed with eight patients (4 in the IGHD group and 4 in the CPHD group) and was negative in all patients. In the CPHD group, associated deficiencies begin to appear after 5 years [4.0–6.0] median follow-up, with thyrotropin being the most frequent (80%), followed by gonadotropin deficiency. ACTH and AVP deficiencies were less frequent.

Conclusions

Multiple hormone deficiencies were diagnosed during this cohort's follow-up evaluation, whose first presentation was isolated growth hormone deficiency and pituitary morphology abnormality in MRI. Pathogenic gene variant involved in congenital hypopituitarism (GLI2) was found in one patient. Regular follow up of pituitary hormonal function in such patients is advisable due to the risk of new added deficiencies.

Consider using this for identifying patients likely to benefit from treatment and therefore require GH stimulation testing.
