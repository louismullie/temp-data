## Question

45 yo F, history of chronic migraines and recent diagnosis of depression, currently taking sumatriptan 100 mg PRN and escitalopram 20 mg daily, presents with symptoms of severe nausea and vomiting. She is prescribed ondansetron 8 mg ODT for symptomatic relief. Is this a safe choice?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ondansetron 8 mg ODT is a safe choice for a 45-year-old woman with chronic migraines and depression who is taking sumatriptan 100 mg PRN and escitalopram 20 mg daily, and who now has severe nausea and vomiting. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and serotonergic mechanisms of each drug. Then, I should verify the risk of serotonin syndrome with the combination. Next, I will review ondansetron's cardiac safety, especially QT prolongation, and whether baseline ECG or electrolytes are needed. After that, I should consider migraine-specific antiemetic choices and whether ondansetron is appropriate here. Finally, I will synthesize a risk–benefit recommendation and outline practical monitoring and alternatives if needed.

> Let me first confirm the drug classes and mechanisms to anchor the interaction risk. Sumatriptan is a 5-HT1B/1D agonist (triptan), escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; all three modulate serotonin pathways, which raises a mechanistic concern for serotonin syndrome when combined, even though ondansetron's action is receptor blockade rather than increased synaptic serotonin, and FDA labeling for both sumatriptan and ondansetron warns about serotonin syndrome with concomitant serotonergic drugs [^bfb4f55b] [^e4d439bf] [^744a182d].

> Wait, let me verify the actual risk magnitude rather than assume. The FDA explicitly warns that life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with triptans combined with SSRIs/SNRIs, and ondansetron labeling likewise advises patients to seek immediate care if serotonin syndrome symptoms occur; case reports document serotonin syndrome in patients receiving ondansetron with SSRIs and triptans, including during pregnancy, so the risk is real albeit uncommon and unpredictable in any individual patient [^bfb4f55b] [^e4d439bf] [^97f1846b].

> I need to check ondansetron's cardiac safety next. Ondansetron can prolong the QT interval and has been associated with torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with electrolyte disturbances, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or concomitant QT-prolonging drugs; FDA labeling recommends ECG monitoring in those contexts and avoidance in congenital long QT, so I should confirm electrolytes and consider a baseline ECG if risk factors are present or if repeated dosing is anticipated [^dfdfbb27] [^52cb0378] [^744a182d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about appropriateness for migraine-related nausea. I initially thought ondansetron is a standard antiemetic for migraine, but wait, I should double-check guideline-backed options. Contemporary primary care and specialty guidelines prioritize dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide for acute migraine-associated nausea, with evidence that metoclopramide improves nausea and can enhance absorption of oral migraine therapies; ondansetron is not a first-line antiemetic for acute migraine nausea in these guidelines, though it may still be used off-label when dopamine blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated [^44567d62] [^6bb43f33] [^b66378a1].

> Let me consider the clinical scenario carefully. Severe nausea and vomiting can impair oral absorption of triptans, so I should confirm whether a non-oral route or an alternative acute strategy would be better. Subcutaneous sumatriptan bypasses GI delay and is effective for acute migraine with nausea, and rectal or intranasal formulations can also circumvent vomiting; if oral therapy is still preferred, adding metoclopramide is guideline-supported and may improve outcomes, whereas ondansetron does not address gastric stasis and carries the serotonergic risk in this polypharmacy context [^075fbbdc] [^8e9afe55] [^44567d62].

> I should confirm dosing and monitoring specifics if ondansetron is nevertheless used. The 8 mg ODT dose is within labeled adult dosing, but given the SSRI and triptan background, I would obtain baseline electrolytes and consider an ECG if there are cardiac risk factors, symptoms, or repeated dosing; I would counsel on serotonin syndrome symptoms and advise urgent evaluation for mental status changes, autonomic instability, or neuromuscular features, and I would avoid other QT-prolonging agents and correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia before use [^dfdfbb27] [^52cb0378] [^e4d439bf].

> But wait, what if the nausea reflects a migraine attack itself rather than a separate process. Let me reconsider the abortive plan: treating the migraine promptly with a non-oral triptan or with an oral triptan plus metoclopramide may both relieve the headache and the nausea more reliably than ondansetron alone, and it avoids layering a third serotonergic agent; if triptans are contraindicated or ineffective, gepants or ditans are reasonable alternatives per contemporary guidance, again with attention to drug–drug interactions and patient-specific risks [^893f26c0] [^98dfddf7].

> Putting this together, I should conclude that ondansetron 8 mg ODT is not the safest first choice here because of the additive serotonergic risk with escitalopram and sumatriptan and the availability of better-supported antiemetics for migraine-associated nausea. If used, it should be reserved for select situations with informed consent, baseline risk assessment, and clear monitoring plans, and I would preferentially recommend metoclopramide 10 mg with or before the triptan, or a non-oral triptan formulation to bypass GI delay, while watching for serotonin syndrome and correcting electrolytes if ondansetron is unavoidable [^44567d62] [^075fbbdc] [^e4d439bf].

---

Ondansetron 8 mg ODT is **not the safest choice** for this patient because of the **increased risk of serotonin syndrome** from combining ondansetron with escitalopram and sumatriptan [^e4d439bf] [^bfb4f55b]. While ondansetron is effective for nausea, **metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are preferred** for migraine-associated nausea due to lower serotonin syndrome risk and stronger evidence of benefit [^44567d62] [^6bb43f33]. If ondansetron is used, monitor closely for serotonin syndrome and consider an ECG if cardiac risk factors are present [^dfdfbb27] [^52cb0378].

## Pharmacological considerations

### Mechanism of action and serotonin-related risks

- **Sumatriptan**: a 5-HT1B/1D agonist (triptan) used for acute migraine; increases serotonin levels [^e50435cb].
- **Escitalopram**: an SSRI that increases serotonin by blocking reuptake [^a080261f].
- **Ondansetron**: a 5-HT3 antagonist used for nausea; also modulates serotonin pathways [^3189b1f3].

Together, these agents can cause **excess serotonin**, raising the risk of serotonin syndrome — a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities [^01269815].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **Serotonin syndrome risk**: FDA warnings highlight serotonin syndrome with combined serotonergic drugs, including SSRIs, triptans, and 5-HT3 antagonists [^e4d439bf] [^bfb4f55b].
- **Migraine nausea management**: Guidelines favor metoclopramide or prochlorperazine for migraine-associated nausea due to efficacy and lower serotonin syndrome risk [^44567d62] [^6bb43f33].
- **Ondansetron use**: Effective for nausea but not first-line for migraine-associated nausea because of serotonin syndrome risk and limited evidence in this setting [^51d91fb4].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

The patient has **chronic migraines** and is on sumatriptan, which already elevates serotonin; adding escitalopram further increases this risk. She also has **recent depression**, and SSRIs can destabilize mood and increase suicidality, especially early in therapy or with dose changes [^a080261f].

---

## Alternative antiemetic options

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Rationale for use in migraine-associated nausea** | **Serotonin syndrome risk** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Metoclopramide | Dopamine antagonist | - Effective for migraine nausea <br/> - Enhances gastric motility <br/> - Guideline-recommended | Low |
| Prochlorperazine | Dopamine antagonist | - Effective for migraine nausea <br/> - Guideline-recommended | Low |
| Promethazine | Antihistamine | - Effective for nausea <br/> - Sedating | Low |

---

## Monitoring and precautions if ondansetron is used

If ondansetron is used, **monitor for serotonin syndrome** — mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities — and obtain an ECG if the patient has cardiac risk factors or is on other QT-prolonging drugs, as ondansetron can prolong the QT interval [^dfdfbb27] [^52cb0378].

---

## Clinical recommendation

Given the patient's current regimen and risk profile, **ondansetron is not the safest choice** for nausea. Metoclopramide or prochlorperazine are preferred alternatives with lower serotonin syndrome risk and stronger evidence in migraine-associated nausea [^44567d62] [^6bb43f33]. If ondansetron is used, monitor closely for serotonin syndrome and consider ECG monitoring if indicated [^e4d439bf] [^dfdfbb27].

CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of sumatriptan tablets in the acute treatment of migraine headaches was demonstrated in 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Patients enrolled in these 3 studies were predominately female (87%) and Caucasian (97%), with a mean age of 40 years (range, 18 to 65 years). Patients were instructed to treat a moderate to severe headache. Headache response, defined as a reduction in headache severity from moderate or severe pain to mild or no pain, was assessed up to 4 hours after dosing. Associated symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia were also assessed. Maintenance of response was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose. A second dose of sumatriptane tablets or other medication was allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache. Acetaminophen was offered to patients in Studies 2 and 3 beginning at 2 hours after initial treatment if the migraine pain had not improved or worsened. Additional medications were allowed 4 to 24 hours after the initial treatment for recurrent headache or as rescue in all 3 studies. The frequency and time to use of these additional treatments were also determined. In all studies, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were compared to placebo in the treatment of migraine attacks. In 1 study, doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg were also compared to each other.

There is as yet no evidence-based treatment of CVS. Although principles of management are helpful, optimal management for any patient is likely to differ from that of any other patient. Treatment is applied according to the phase the patient is in at the time of presentation. The therapeutic goals during the inter-episodic phase include migraine prophylaxis, e.g. amitriptyline, propranalol, cyproheptadine and others if migraine diathesis is suspected. Conditions that pre-dispose to or trigger episodes (e.g. anxiety, chronic infections, pre-menstrual syndrome) need to be identified and treated.

The therapeutic goal during the prodromal phase is to abort the onset of vomiting. To this end, discern the prodrome's constituent symptoms and attempt to relieve each as quickly as possible before vomiting begins. For example, ondansetron, lorazepam or alprazolam, and ibuprofen or oxycodone, might be taken for their anti-nausea, anxiolytic and analgesic effects. If prodromal symptoms subside as the patient rests, and if the remission lasts, the emetic phase would have been successfully aborted.

Information for Patients

See PATIENT INFORMATION at the end of this labeling for the text of the separate leaflet provided for patients.

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the use of sumatriptan or other triptans, especially during combined use with SSRIs or SNRIs.

Laboratory Tests

No specific laboratory tests are recommended for monitoring patients prior to and/or after treatment with sumatriptan.

Drug Interactions

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors/Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome:

Cases of life‑threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptans (see WARNINGS).

Ergot-Containing Drugs

Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and sumatriptan within 24 hours of each other should be avoided  (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibitors

MAO-A inhibitors reduce sumatriptan clearance, significantly increasing systemic exposure. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Sumatriptan tablets are not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests.

Abortive therapy for CVS—the goal is to completely abort the emetic phase or drastically reduce its severity, with the highest probability when medications are taken as early into the prodromal phase as possible; nearly all patients with CVS require combinations of ≥2 agents to reliably abort attacks, commonly sumatriptan with an antiemetic such as ondansetron; sumatriptan can be administered via nasal spray or potentially via subcutaneous injection, ondansetron is available in a sublingual tablet form, other antiemetics such as promethazine and prochlorperazine are available in rectal suppository form, and inducing sedation is often effective with agents including promethazine, diphenhydramine, benzodiazepines, and alprazolam (available in sublingual tablet and rectally administered forms).

### Diagnosis and management of cyclic vomiting syndrome: a critical review [^2fbccf4f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic disorder of gut-brain interaction characterized by recurrent disabling episodes of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. CVS affects both children and adults with a prevalence of approximately 2% in the United States. CVS is more common in female individuals and affects all races. The pathophysiology of CVS is unknown and a combination of genetic, environmental, autonomic, and neurohormonal factors is believed to play a role. CVS is also closely associated with migraine headaches and likely have a shared pathophysiology. The diagnosis of CVS is based on the Rome criteria, and minimal recommended testing includes an upper endoscopy and imaging studies of the abdomen. CVS is frequently associated with anxiety, depression, and autonomic dysfunction. Patients with CVS commonly use cannabis therapeutically for symptom relief. By contrast, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome is believed to be a subset of CVS with chronic heavy cannabis use leading to hyperemesis. Due to the recalcitrant nature of the illness, patients often visit the emergency department and are hospitalized for acute CVS flares. Guidelines on the management of CVS recommend a biopsychosocial approach. Prophylactic therapy consists of tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline), antiepileptics (topiramate), and aprepitant in refractory patients. Abortive therapy consists of triptans, antiemetics (ondansetron), and sedation. Treatment of comorbid conditions is extremely important to improve overall patient outcomes. CVS has a significant negative impact on patients, families, and the healthcare system, and future research to understand its pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies is needed.

The increasing recognition of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in adults prompted the development of these evidence-based guidelines on the management of CVS in adults, which was sponsored by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) and the Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome Association (CVSA). GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework was used and a professional librarian performed the literature search. The expert committee included the President of the CVSA who brought a patient perspective into the deliberations. The committee makes recommendations for the prophylaxis of CVS, treatment of acute attacks, diagnosis, and overall management of CVS. The committee strongly  recommends that adults with moderate-to-severe CVS receive a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), such as amitriptyline, as a first-line prophylactic medication and receive topiramate or aprepitant as alternate prophylactic medications. Zonisamide or levetiracetam and mitochondrial supplements (Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and riboflavin) are conditionally recommended as alternate prophylactic medications, either alone or concurrently with other prophylactic medications. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepitant to abort symptoms. Emergency department treatment is best achieved with the use of an individualized treatment protocol and shared with the care team (example provided). The committee recommended screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use with referral to appropriate allied health services as indicated. Techniques like meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback may be offered as complementary therapy to improve overall well-being and patient care outcomes.

Drug Label Information Updated August 27, 2024 If you are a consumer or patient please visit this version.
- Download DRUG LABEL INFO: PDF XML
- Official Label 1. Indications and Usage Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use:
- Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with sumatriptan tablets, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before sumatriptan tablets are administered to treat any subsequent attacks.
- Sumatriptan tablets are not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks.
- Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose.

The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after Sumatriptan Injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. The safety of treating an average of more than 4 headaches in a 30-day period has not been established.
2. 2 Dosing in Patients with Hepatic Impairment If treatment is deemed advisable in the presence of mild to moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum single dose should not exceed 50 mg. The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets.

Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm, even in patients without a history of CAD.
5. 3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina.
5. 4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities.

In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.
5. 5 Other Vasospasm Reactions. Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or tablets. These events are extremely rare and most have been reported in patients with risk factors predictive of CAD. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS) .

Significant hypertensive episodes, including hypertensive crises, have been reported on rare occasions in patients with or without a history of hypertension (see WARNINGS).

Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials

Table 2 lists adverse events that occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug. Only events that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in any group treated with sumatriptan tablets and were more frequent in that group than in the placebo group are included in Table 2. The events cited reflect experience gained under closely monitored conditions of clinical trials in a highly selected patient population. In actual clinical practice or in other clinical trials, these frequency estimates may not apply, as the conditions of use, reporting behavior, and the kinds of patients treated may differ.

aEvents that occurred at a frequency of 2% or more in the group treated with sumatriptan tablets and that occurred more frequently in that group than the placebo group.

Other events that occurred in more than 1% of patients receiving sumatriptan tablets and at least as often on placebo included nausea and/or vomiting, migraine, headache, hyposalivation, dizziness, and drowsiness/sleepiness.

Sumatriptan tablets are generally well tolerated. Across all doses, most adverse reactions were mild and transient and did not lead to long-lasting effects. The incidence of adverse events in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients. There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse events.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause hypersensitivity reactions, some as severe as anaphylaxis and bronchospasm. Instruct patients to immediately report any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, chills, rash, or breathing problems to their healthcare provider. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

QT Prolongation

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias such as QT prolongation. Instruct patients to tell their healthcare provider right away if they perceive a change in their heart rate, if they feel lightheaded, or if they have a syncopal episode. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

Drug Interactions

Instruct the patient to report the use of all medications, especially apomorphine, to their healthcare provider. Concomitant use of apomorphine and ondansetron may cause a significant drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.
Advise patients of the possibility of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of ondansetron and another serotonergic agent such as medications to treat depression and migraines. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if the following symptoms occur: changes in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms with or without gastrointestinal symptoms. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

The triptans

We advise patients to use a triptan at the start of the headache phase of a migraine attack, since there is no evidence of efficacy if taken during preceding aura.Using a triptan at the start of the headache may reduce headache recurrence, prevent disability and possibly reduce central sensitisation. The difficulty arises in chronic migraineurs, since taking the triptan early can lead to a pattern of increasing use and medication-overuse headache. We try to help these people to identify early features that might indicate an ensuing severe migraine attack, as the triptan should be reserved for these headaches. It is important to explain that the triptan should be used, on average, on no more than 2 days per week (10 days per month) to reduce the risk of a triptan-overuse headache.

Our own practice is to try any particular triptan on at least three occasions before assessing its efficacy. Poor efficacy or tolerability with a single triptan does not reliably predict response to another, so it is definitely worthwhile working through different agents. However, choosing the right triptan for a given situation can be difficult, especially when considering second-line or third-line choices. Figure 1 and the following section may assist this decision.

Triptan selection in acute migraine. An approach to triptan selection based on the characteristic of acute attacks. BD, twice daily; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; TDS, three times a day.

Which triptan and how do they work?

The seven triptans—almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan—are 5HT 1B/1D receptor agonists with vasoconstrictive effects on blood vessels. The choice of triptan depends on efficacy, side effects, the duration of the headache, coexisting vomiting and cost (table 2).

### Integrating the triptans into clinical practice [^3c401494]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The triptans (selective serotonin agonists) are becoming the first-line alternatives in the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine, at least for attacks of moderate-to-severe intensity. Although clinical trials demonstrate significant differences in efficacy between triptan tablets, they often appear similar in efficacy when used in clinical practice, particularly after dose adjustments. Most patients with migraine consider drugs that can be administered orally to be the most user-friendly. However, gastrointestinal absorption may be impaired during migraine attacks because gastric motility is inhibited, and there is a risk that nausea during the attack will culminate in vomiting. Furthermore, in addition to their antimigraine properties, triptans may prolong the gastric emptying time. For this reason the absorption of any triptan taken orally during the migraine attack will be erratic and treatment effects inconsistent. Despite these barriers to good efficacy and high reliability, the tablet is the most commonly used triptan formulation.

### Serotonin syndrome after treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy [^97f1846b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy often require pharmacotherapy for symptom management. Serotonin syndrome is a rare clinical entity that can be precipitated by the medications used to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

Case

A 35-year-old pregnant individual with a history of hyperemesis gravidarum in an earlier pregnancy requiring prolonged hospitalization presented with nausea and vomiting at 7 weeks of gestation. She was incidentally found to have severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection when she was universally screened at the time of admission. She required pharmacotherapy, including prochlorperazine and ondansetron for treatment of nausea as well as sumatriptan for migraine. She developed acute spasticity, autonomic dysfunction, and temperature rise, precipitated by antiemetic therapy, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The syndrome resolved with supportive care and benzodiazepines.

Conclusion

Serotonin syndrome is a serious clinical entity that can be provoked by the pharmacotherapy given to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This medical emergency requires early recognition and prompt management.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^8a0aafbe]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Sumatriptan tablets should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established.

Risk of Myocardial Ischemia and/or Infarction and Other Adverse
Cardiac Events

Sumatriptan should not be given to patients with documented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease (CAD) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). It is strongly recommended that sumatriptan not be given to patients in whom unrecognized CAD is predicted by the presence of  risk  factors  (e.g.,  hypertension,  hypercholesterolemia,  smoker,  obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, or male over 40 years of age) unless a cardiovascular evaluation provides satisfactory clinical evidence that the patient is reasonably free of coronary artery and ischemic myocardial disease or other significant underlying cardiovascular disease. The sensitivity of cardiac diagnostic procedures to detect cardiovascular disease or predisposition to coronary artery vasospasm is modest, at best. If, during the cardiovascular evaluation, the patient’s medical history or electrocardiographic investigations reveal findings indicative of, or consistent with, coronary artery vasospasm or myocardial ischemia, sumatriptan should not be administered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

For patients with risk factors predictive of CAD, who are determined to have a satisfactory cardiovascular evaluation, it is strongly recommended that administration of the first dose of sumatriptan tablets take place in the setting of a physician’s office or similar medically staffed and equipped facility unless the patient has previously received sumatriptan. Because cardiac ischemia can occur in the absence of clinical symptoms, consideration should be given to obtaining on the first occasion of use an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the interval immediately following sumatriptan tablets, in these patients with risk factors.

It is recommended that patients who are intermittent long-term users of sumatriptan and who have or acquire risk factors predictive of CAD, as described above, undergo periodic interval cardiovascular evaluation as they continue to use sumatriptan.

The systematic approach described above is intended to reduce the likelihood that patients with unrecognized cardiovascular disease will be inadvertently exposed to sumatriptan.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Hypersensitivity Reactions

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause hypersensitivity reactions, some as severe as anaphylaxis and bronchospasm. Instruct patients to immediately report any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including fever, chills, rash, or breathing problems to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. QT Prolongation

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias, such as QT prolongation. Instruct patients to tell their healthcare provider right away if they perceive a change in their heart rate, if they feel lightheaded, or if they have a syncopal episode [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Drug Interactions

1. Instruct the patient to report the use of all medications, especially apomorphine, to their healthcare provider. Concomitant use of apomorphine and ondansetron may cause a significant drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.

2. Advise patients of the possibility of serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of ondansetron and another serotonergic agent, such as medications to treat depression and migraines. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if the following symptoms occur: changes in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular symptoms with or without gastrointestinal symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Myocardial Ischemia

Inform patients that ondansetron may cause myocardial ischemia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical help if any symptoms suggestive of a myocardial ischemia occur, such as sudden chest pain or chest tightness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .

Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

Inform patients following abdominal surgery or those with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that ondansetron may mask signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction. Instruct patients to immediately report any signs or symptoms consistent with a potential bowel obstruction to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Management of cyclic vomiting syndrome in adults: evidence review [^00b73b38]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Certainty in the evidence

Indirect estimates influenced the certainty of the evidence supporting the utility of triptans as abortive therapy in CVS. With regard to the outcome of relief of nausea at 2 hours, we had moderate certainty in the beneficial effect of triptans, as presented by the summary estimate yielded from a meta‐analysis of eight RCTs. We downgraded for indirectness as the population studied was patients with migraine headaches (CVS is in the subgroup of periodic syndromes that include migraine and its equivalents).

With regard to the outcome of treatment response and adverse events (across the three studies in CVS patients), the certainty in the evidence was deemed to be very low. We downgraded due to risk of selection bias, imprecision (concern for fragility in the estimate due to suboptimal information size), and indirectness, because some studies were conducted in pediatric populations and some data come from a CVS–migraine‐associated phenotype.

3.3.2 Should 5‐HT3 antagonists be used as abortive therapy in adults with CVS?

No published studies examining the use of ondansetron as abortive therapy for CVS were identified despite its widespread use in CVS. No GRADE evidence profile was created.

### Aspirin with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^4924b05d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2010 (Kirthi 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of aspirin, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 10 March 2010 for the original review and to 31 January 2013 for the update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled or active-controlled studies, or both, using aspirin to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

No new studies were found for this update. Thirteen studies (4222 participants) compared aspirin 900 mg or 1000 mg, alone or in combination with metoclopramide 10 mg, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes, all active treatments were superior to placebo, with NNTs of 8.1, 4.9 and 6.6 for 2-hour pain-free, 2-hour headache relief, and 24-hour headache relief with aspirin alone versus placebo, and 8.8, 3.3 and 6.2 with aspirin plus metoclopramide versus placebo. Sumatriptan 50 mg did not differ from aspirin alone for 2-hour pain-free and headache relief, while sumatriptan 100 mg was better than the combination of aspirin plus metoclopramide for 2-hour pain-free, but not headache relief; there were no data for 24-hour headache relief.Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring slightly more often with aspirin than placebo.Additional metoclopramide significantly reduced nausea (P < 0.00006) and vomiting (P = 0.002) compared with aspirin alone.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Aspirin 1000 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, similar to sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. Addition of metoclopramide 10 mg improves relief of nausea and vomiting. Adverse events were mainly mild and transient, and were slightly more common with aspirin than placebo, but less common than with sumatriptan 100 mg.

### Migraine as a cause of persistent nausea or vomiting in palliative care: a case series [^ea1d1e67]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Migraine is common, underdiagnosed, and frequently inadequately treated in the general population. Nausea and vomiting are common reasons for patients to be referred for symptom control. Nausea can be the most prominent feature of migraine; the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) recognizes cyclical vomiting syndrome as a migraine variant in children, and there is increasing evidence for a similar entity in adults. We present three patients with troublesome nausea uncontrolled by conventional antiemetic therapy. On questioning, all three had other symptoms suggestive of migraine, and two had a family history. Their symptoms settled with the use of various antimigraine therapies. Amitriptyline appears to be particularly useful. A therapeutic trial of prophylaxis may be indicated for patients whose nausea and vomiting may be attributed to migraine.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^40ef7498]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm  (see WARNINGS).

Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function.

There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.

Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS).

For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.

Overuse:

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use.

### Adult cyclic vomiting syndrome successfully treated with intranasal sumatriptan [^6f3d1b52]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cyclic vomiting syndrome is an increasingly recognized cause of nausea and vomiting in adults. We report the case of a 47-year-old man with recurrent episodes of intractable nausea and vomiting for one year. His symptoms persisted for 4-7 days and then resolved spontaneously, only to return after periods of time ranging from one week up to a month. After an extensive workup, which failed to determine any causative explanation for his symptoms, he was diagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome. His episodes of vomiting were successfully terminated with the use of intranasal sumatriptan. In this case, we highlight that sumatriptan effectively aborted symptoms in an adult patient with cyclic vomiting syndrome. Increasing physicians' awareness of adult cyclic vomiting syndrome may improve care of patients suffering from this debilitating condition.

### Potential for treatment benefit of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist plus monoclonal antibody in migraine therapy [^96911acd]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient 2

The second patient is a 36 year-old white woman with a 19-year history of migraine without aura. She reported an average of 11 MMDs with pain of moderate to severe intensity. Her treatment history involved subcutaneous sumatriptan, intranasal zolmitriptan, and oral tablets of rizatriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, and almotriptan, all of which were suboptimal (e.g. relief took too long, did not last, was inconsistent). She also had a 6-year history of treatment with an implanted occipital nerve stimulator (ONS). At enrollment, her migraine treatments included oral sumatriptan 100 mg, IM ketorolac tromethamine 30 mg, IM diphenhydramine 100 mg, oral methadone 80 mg, oral ondansetron 8 mg, oral zonisamide 250 mg, and ONS. Before enrollment, she stopped using methadone, a prohibited medication for the trial.

During a 30-day run-in to the long-term safety trial, the patient experienced 22 attacks of moderate to severe pain intensity. On entry into the treatment phase, she received 30 tablets of rimegepant 75 mg and was instructed to take rimegepant 75 mg up to once per calendar day, as needed, for the acute treatment of migraine attacks of any pain intensity. In the first 30 days of treatment, she used 16 doses of rimegepant; in the second 30 days, she used 11 doses of rimegepant and stopped ondansetron, ketorolac, and diphenhydramine. Because of high headache frequency, she was subsequently started on a monthly dose of erenumab 140 mg. Over the first 30 days after starting erenumab, she experienced 9 attacks, all of which were treated successfully with rimegepant. While using rimegepant alone or together with erenumab, she experienced no adverse events.

### Sumatriptan (rectal route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^8e9afe55]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Rectal administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of rectal sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using rectally administered sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Three studies (866 participants) compared rectally administered sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses. For the majority of efficacy outcomes, sumatriptan surpassed placebo. For sumatriptan 12.5 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 5.2 and 3.2 for headache relief at one and two hours, respectively. Results for the 25 mg dose were similar to the 12.5 mg dose, and there were no significant differences between the two doses for any of the outcomes analysed. The NNTs for sumatriptan 25 mg versus placebo were 4.2, 3.2, and 2.4 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at one hour, and headache relief at two hours, respectively.Relief of functional disability was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, with NNTs of 8.0 and 4.0 for the 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses, respectively. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than with placebo, but there were insufficient data to perform any analyses.Direct comparison of sumatriptan with active treatments was limited to one study comparing sumatriptan 25 mg with ergotamine tartrate 2 mg + caffeine 100 mg.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited amounts of data, sumatriptan 25 mg, administered rectally, is an effective treatment for acute migraine attacks, with participants in these studies experiencing a significant reduction in headache pain and functional disability within two hours of treatment. The lack of data on relief of headache-associated symptoms or incidence of adverse events limits any conclusions that can be drawn.

### Pharmacologic treatments of acute episodic migraine headache in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^98dfddf7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clinical considerations—pharmacologic choices and sequencing emphasize initiating or optimizing simple analgesics and considering additional options: consider treating mild episodic migraine headache with an nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), acetaminophen, or the combination of an NSAID and acetaminophen; ask about prior use and ensure appropriate dosing, considering increasing the dosage without exceeding the recommended maximum daily dose if relief is inadequate; patients who do not tolerate or have inadequate response to a recommended treatment may respond to another within the same drug class; although comparative effectiveness data were uncertain, there is evidence supporting efficacy for CGRP antagonists-gepants (rimegepant, ubrogepant, or zavegepant) or ergot alkaloid (dihydroergotamine); consider using the ditan lasmiditan in nonpregnant outpatient adults who do not tolerate or have inadequate response to all other pharmacologic treatments included in this guideline; consider using a nonoral triptan and an antiemetic in people having severe nausea or vomiting; and do not use opioids or butalbital for acute episodic migraine.

### Sumatriptan tablet (...) [^2402aace]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use:

2. 1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions. If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24-hour period. Use after Sumatriptan Injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses.

The use of sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with ischemic or vasospastic CAD. There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions, including acute myocardial infarction, occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan tablets. Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD. Sumatriptan tablets may cause coronary artery vasospasm, even in patients without a history of CAD.
5. 3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina.
5.

4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.
5. 5 Other Vasospasm Reactions.

Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5-HT1 agonists. Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack, a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5-HT1 agonists has not been clearly established.
5. 6 Medication Overuse Headache. Overuse of acute migraine drugs may lead to exacerbation of headache. Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms may be necessary. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes, autonomic instability (e. g.

Figure 1—Suggested cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) management algorithm based on GRADE evidence and expert consensus recommendations details non-pharmacological measures for all patients, severity thresholds, abortive care pathways, escalation steps for nonresponse, and prophylactic options. All patients receive behavioral interventions, trigger avoidance, supplements/alternative options, and neuromodulation, then severity is categorized as mild (≤ 4 episodes/year; ≤ 24 hours duration; no IV therapy required; function not impaired), moderate (> 4 episodes/year but < 1 episode/month; 24–48 hours duration; occasional ED visits/hospitalizations; function moderately impaired), or severe/refractory (≥ 1 episode/month; ≥ 48 hrs duration; repeated ED visits/hospitalizations; function severely impaired). Abortive care includes non-pharmacological stress reduction and pharmacological options such as NSAIDs ± triptans for migraine feature, NK-1 R antagonist (e.g., aprepitant), 5HT3 R antagonists (e.g., ondansetron), and sedatives (e.g., anti-histamines, melatonin), with nonresponsive branches specifying early presentation for IV fluid therapy, IV 5HT3 R antagonist (e.g., ondansetron), IV NK-1 R antagonist (e.g., fosaprepitant), IV NSAID if pain/migraine feature, and sedatives (e.g., IV anti-histamines or IV benzodiazepines). Prophylactic pharmacological options include β-blockers (e.g., propranolol), 5HT2 antagonists (e.g., cyproheptadine), NK-1 R antagonist (e.g., aprepitant), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), and oral contraceptives for catamenial CVS, and refractory notes list anticonvulsants (topiramate, valproate) with the directive to consider re-evaluation for alternative etiologies if nonresponsive to treatment.

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^71a85a90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 11, 2010 (Derry 2010). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting, which are commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies through 4 October 2010 for the original review, and to 13 February 2013 for the update. Two clinical trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov and gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com) were also searched on both occasions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered paracetamol to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared with placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Searches for the update identified one additional study for inclusion. Eleven studies (2942 participants, 5109 attacks) compared paracetamol 1000 mg, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes paracetamol was superior to placebo, with NNTs of 12 (19% response with paracetamol, 10% with placebo), 5.0 (56% response with paracetamol, 36% with placebo) and 5.2 (39% response with paracetamol, 20% with placebo) for 2-hour pain-free and 2- and 1-hour headache relief, respectively, when medication was taken for moderate to severe pain.Paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was not significantly different from oral sumatriptan 100 mg for 2-hour headache relief; there were no 2-hour pain-free data.Adverse event rates were similar between paracetamol and placebo, and between paracetamol plus metoclopramide and sumatriptan. No serious adverse events occurred with paracetamol alone, but more serious and/or severe adverse events occurred with sumatriptan than with the combination therapy (NNH 32).

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg alone is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 12 for pain-free response at two hours is inferior to at of other commonly used analgesics. Given the low cost and wide availability of paracetamol, it may be a useful first choice drug for acute migraine in those with contraindications to, or who cannot tolerate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin. The addition of 10 mg metoclopramide gives short-term efficacy equivalent to oral sumatriptan 100 mg. Adverse events with paracetamol did not differ from placebo; serious and/or severe adverse events were slightly more common with sumatriptan than with paracetamol plus metoclopramide.

### Highlights of prescribing information (...) [^01269815]. FDA (DailyMed) (2017). Low credibility.

Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan tablets, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAO inhibitors. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes, autonomic instability, neuromuscular aberrations, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, including patients without a history of hypertension. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan. Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal. In general, anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan. Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan. Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures.

There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent. Sumatriptan tablets should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, palpitations. Neurological: Dystonia, tremor. Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications and sumatriptan tablets within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated. MAO-A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 7-fold. Therefore, the use of sumatriptan tablets in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated. Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of sumatriptan tablets and other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated.

Five controlled clinical trials evaluating oral sumatriptan in pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years enrolled a total of 701 adolescent migraineurs. These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in adolescents. Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults. The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose
- and age-dependent, with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older adolescents. A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors prior to receiving sumatriptan tablets.

### Sumatriptan (subcutaneous route of administration) for acute migraine attacks in adults [^075fbbdc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a highly disabling condition for the individual and also has wide-reaching implications for society, healthcare services, and the economy. Sumatriptan is an abortive medication for migraine attacks, belonging to the triptan family. Subcutaneous administration may be preferable to oral for individuals experiencing nausea and/or vomiting

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous sumatriptan compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine attacks in adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, online databases, and reference lists for studies through 13 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using subcutaneous sumatriptan to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Thirty-five studies (9365 participants) compared subcutaneous sumatriptan with placebo or an active comparator. Most of the data were for the 6 mg dose. Sumatriptan surpassed placebo for all efficacy outcomes. For sumatriptan 6 mg versus placebo the NNTs were 2.9, 2.3, 2.2, and 2.1 for pain-free at one and two hours, and headache relief at one and two hours, respectively, and 6.1 for sustained pain-free at 24 hours. Results for the 4 mg and 8 mg doses were similar to the 6 mg dose, with 6 mg significantly better than 4 mg only for pain-free at one hour, and 8 mg significantly better than 6 mg only for headache relief at one hour. There was no evidence of increased migraine relief if a second dose of sumatriptan 6 mg was given after an inadequate response to the first.Relief of headache-associated symptoms, including nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia, was greater with sumatriptan than with placebo, and use of rescue medication was lower with sumatriptan than placebo. For the most part, adverse events were transient and mild and were more common with sumatriptan than placebo.Sumatriptan was compared directly with a number of active treatments, including other triptans, acetylsalicylic acid plus metoclopramide, and dihydroergotamine, but there were insufficient data for any pooled analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Subcutaneous sumatriptan is effective as an abortive treatment for acute migraine attacks, quickly relieving pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and functional disability, but is associated with increased adverse events.

### Sumatriptan succinate, ondansetron (sumansetron) [^58bb198b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Postmarketing Experience With Sumatriptan

Serious cardiovascular events, some resulting in death, have been reported in association with the use of sumatriptan succinate injection or sumatriptan tablets. The uncontrolled nature of postmarketing surveillance, however, makes it impossible to determine definitively the proportion of the reported cases that were actually caused by sumatriptan or to reliably assess causation in individual cases. On clinical grounds, the longer the latency between the administration of sumatriptan and the onset of the clinical event, the less likely the association is to be causative. Accordingly, interest has focused on events beginning within 1 hour of the administration of sumatriptan.

Cardiac events that have been observed to have onset within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration include: coronary artery vasospasm, transient ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and death.

Some of these events occurred in patients who had no findings of CAD and appear to represent consequences of coronary artery vasospasm. However, among domestic reports of serious cardiac events within 1 hour of sumatriptan administration, almost all of the patients had risk factors predictive of CAD and the presence of significant underlying

Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with oral or subcutaneous sumatriptan, and some have resulted in fatalities. The relationship of sumatriptan to these events is uncertain. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, sumatriptan having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. As with other acute migraine therapies, before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. It should also be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack).

Other Vasospasm-Related Events

Sumatriptan may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Both peripheral vascular ischemia and colonic ischemia with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea have been reported. Very rare reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of sumatriptan. Visual disorders may also be part of a migraine attack.

### Aspirin with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^b2d052e2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of aspirin, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies through 10 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using aspirin to treat a discrete migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Thirteen studies (4222 participants) compared aspirin 900 mg or 1000 mg, alone or in combination with metoclopramide 10 mg, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes, all active treatments were superior to placebo, with NNTs of 8.1, 4.9 and 6.6 for 2-hour pain-free, 2-hour headache relief, and 24-hour headache relief with aspirin alone versus placebo, and 8.8, 3.3 and 6.2 with aspirin plus metoclopramide versus placebo. Sumatriptan 50 mg did not differ from aspirin alone for 2-hour pain-free and headache relief, while sumatriptan 100 mg was better than the combination of aspirin plus metoclopramide for 2-hour pain-free, but not headache relief; there were no data for 24-hour headache relief.Associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia were reduced with aspirin compared with placebo, with additional metoclopramide significantly reducing nausea (P < 0.00006) and vomiting (P = 0.002) compared with aspirin alone.Fewer participants needed rescue medication with aspirin than with placebo. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring slightly more often with aspirin than placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Aspirin 1000 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, similar to sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. Addition of metoclopramide 10 mg improves relief of nausea and vomiting. Adverse events were mainly mild and transient, and were slightly more common with aspirin than placebo, but less common than with sumatriptan 100 mg.

### Naproxen with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^7b1dbf1f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services, and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID); its efficacy in acute migraine has not been established by systematic reviews. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine headaches.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of naproxen, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared with placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Oxford Pain Relief Database, together with two online databases (www.gsk-clinicalstudyregister.com and www.clinicaltrials.gov) and reference lists, for studies to 22 May 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm, using naproxen alone or with an antiemetic to treat a migraine headache episode.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate risk ratios and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared with placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

We included six studies using naproxen 275 mg, 500 mg, or 825 mg to treat attacks of moderate or severe pain intensity. Overall, 1241 participants took naproxen (275 mg to 825 mg), 229 took sumatriptan 50 mg, 173 took naratriptan 2.5 mg, and 1092 took placebo. No studies combined naproxen with an antiemetic. Studies using naproxen 275 mg provided no useable data for analysis.Naproxen (500 mg and 825 mg) was better than placebo for pain-free response and headache relief. At two hours, the NNT for pain-free response was 11 (17% response with naproxen, 8% with placebo; risk ratio 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.6), moderate quality) and for headache relief was 6.0 (45% response with naproxen, 29% with placebo; risk ratio 1.6 (1.4 to 1.8), moderate quality). The NNT for sustained pain-free response during the 24 hours post dose was 19 (12% response with naproxen, 6.7% with placebo), and for sustained headache relief during the 24 hours post dose was 8.3 (30% response with naproxen, 18% with placebo). Analysing only the lower dose of 500 mg of naproxen did not significantly change the results. Adverse events, which were mostly mild or moderate in severity and rarely led to withdrawal, were more common with naproxen than with placebo when the 500 mg and 825 mg doses were considered together, but not when the 500 mg dose was analysed alone.There were insufficient data for analysis of naproxen compared with sumatriptan, and no data suitable for analysis of naproxen compared with naratriptan.

Authors' Conclusions

Naproxen is statistically superior to placebo in the treatment of acute migraine, but the NNT of 11 for pain-free response at two hours suggests that it is not a clinically useful treatment. Cochrane reviews examining other commonly used analgesics for acute migraine have reported better (lower) NNT results for the same outcome. Naproxen is not clinically useful as a stand-alone analgesic in acute migraine, as it is effective in fewer than 2 people in 10.

### Early intervention in migraine with sumatriptan tablets 50 mg versus 100 mg: a pooled analysis of data from six clinical trials [^81f1a45e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In clinical trials evaluating sumatriptan in the treatment of moderate or severe migraine pain, the 50- and 100-mg doses have been comparably effective and well tolerated.

Objective

To assess the dose-efficacy relationship of sumatriptan tablets given early for mild pain, data from 6 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, early-intervention studies of sumatriptan tablets 50 mg and 100 mg (5 of which have been published) were pooled for analysis. These constitute all the studies conducted to date of sumatriptan tablets prospectively given early for mild pain.

Methods

The primary efficacy end point in all the studies was the proportion of patients reporting a pain-free result (ie, mild, moderate, or severe pain reduced to none) 2 hours postdose. Other efficacy end points included the proportion of patients who were migraine free (ie, no pain and no associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia) 2 hours postdose; the proportion reporting worsening of pain (ie, moderate or severe pain) 2 hours postdose; and the proportion with a sustained pain-free result (ie, pain free from 2-24 hours postdose with no use of a second dose of study medication or of rescue medication). Tolerability was assessed by evaluating the incidence of individual adverse events. The investigators assessed each adverse event's relationship to study medication.

Results

The number of patients in the intent-to-treat population was 2297 (771 sumatriptan 50 mg, 759 sumatriptan 100 mg, 767 placebo). Patients' mean age ranged from 39.4 to 39.8 years across groups, and most patients were female (90%-92%) and white (89%-90%). A pain-free result 2 hours post dose was reported by significantly more patients who took either dose of sumatriptan tablets compared with placebo and by significantly more patients who took the 100-mg dose compared with the 50-mg dose (50 mg, 49%; 100 mg, 58%; placebo, 24%; P < 0.001, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg). A similar pattern was observed for migraine-free results 2 hours postdose (50 mg, 42%; 100 mg, 47%; placebo, 20%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg), worsening of pain 2 hours postdose (50 mg, 26%; 100 mg, 21%; placebo, 46%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg), and sustained pain-free results from 2 through 24 hours postdose (50 mg, 30%; 100 mg, 35%; placebo, 12%; P < 0.05, both sumatriptan doses vs placebo, and 100 mg vs 50 mg). Both doses of sumatriptan were well tolerated, and no dose-related trends in the incidence of individual drug-related adverse events were observed.

Conclusions

In this analysis of pooled data from 6 clinical trials, sumatriptan tablets 50 mg and 100 mg administered early in a migraine attack while the pain was mild were well tolerated and significantly more effective than placebo. The 100-mg dose of sumatriptan was significantly more effective than the 50-mg dose.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of auricular acupuncture for migraine: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d704f45d]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a neurological condition that significantly impacts individuals, marked by recurring, moderate-to-severe, one-sided pulsating headaches, frequently associated with symptoms such as nausea, sensitivity to light, and cognitive dysfunction.Its pathogenesis involves complex interactions among genetic predispositions, environmental triggers, and endogenous regulatory mechanisms.Migraine affects about 1.04 billion people worldwide, accounting for 14% of the global population. Studies spanning 1990 to 2019 document that South Asia exhibits the greatest migraine prevalence, reporting 154,490,169.8 cases. Additionally, for individuals globally between 15 and 49 years old, migraine constitutes the primary cause of disability burden.As the second most significant contributor to global disability, migraine significantly affects socioeconomic factors, including reduced work productivity and higher healthcare costs.

Current pharmacological management relies primarily on acute and preventive therapies. According to the guidelines,acute treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), acetaminophen, and triptans (eg, sumatriptan), which remain first-line for mild-to-severe attacks depending on response. Ergot derivatives (eg, dihydroergotamine), antiemetics (eg, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine), and combination regimens (eg, triptan plus NSAID) are also utilized in selected cases. Preventive therapies encompass beta-blockers (eg, propranolol, metoprolol), calcium channel blockers (eg, flunarizine, verapamil), antiepileptic drugs (eg, topiramate, valproate), and tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline), as well as newer agents targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway. Despite the availability of these diverse classes, chronic use may lead to medication-overuse headaches, dependence, or adverse effects (eg, gastrointestinal disturbances), while substantial proportion of patients report inadequate symptom control.These challenges underscore the need for safer, more tolerable therapeutic alternatives.

Ondansetron and 5‑HT3 receptor antagonists—acute management of pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by widespread use and very low‑certainty evidence; the panel judged desirable effects moderate, undesirable effects small, and supports IV ondansetron use based on indirect efficacy and safety, with attention to QTc risks and potential interactions; for most younger patients, dose ranges between 0.13 and 0.26 mg/kg showed no major outcome differences, periodic re‑evaluation is essential, and research priorities include trials of ondansetron and head‑to‑head comparisons with NK‑1 receptor antagonists. The page notes ondansetron’s utility in CVS for facilitating retention of other oral medications and cites indirect data showing 90% efficacy in controlling vomiting in pediatric migraine.

### Practical selection of antiemetics in the ambulatory setting [^ba31bc02]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are mediated primarily by three neurotransmitter pathways: visceral stimulation releases dopamine and serotonin; vestibular and central nervous system activation release histamine and acetylcholine; and chemoreceptor trigger zone activation releases dopamine and serotonin. Clinicians can improve the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments by targeting the appropriate pathways. Antihistamines and anticholinergics are most effective in patients with vestibular-mediated nausea secondary to vertigo. Serotonin antagonists block serotonin in the intestines and chemoreceptor trigger zone, and are most effective for treating gastroenteritis. Dopamine antagonists block dopamine in the intestines and chemoreceptor trigger zone; indications for these agents are similar to those for serotonin antagonists. For treatment of mild pregnancy-induced nausea, pyridoxine with or without doxylamine is recommended, and ginger may also be effective. In patients with migraine headache-associated nausea, metoclopramide improves response to oral anti-migraine agents. Ondansetron reduces nausea and vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis and in women with hyperemesis gravidarum.

### Drugs for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults in the emergency department setting [^807c77f1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting is a common and distressing presenting complaint in emergency departments (ED). The aetiology of nausea and vomiting in EDs is diverse and drugs are commonly prescribed. There is currently no consensus as to the optimum drug treatment of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Objectives

To provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of antiemetic medications in the management of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1966 to August 2014), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1980 to August 2014) and ISI Web of Science (January 1955 to August 2014). We also searched relevant clinical trial registries and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any drug in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the treatment of adults in the ED. Study eligibility was not restricted by language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias in included studies. We contacted authors of studies to obtain missing information if required.

Main Results

We included eight trials, involving 952 participants, of which 64% were women. Included trials were generally of adequate quality, with six trials at low risk of bias, and two trials at high risk of bias. Three trials with 518 participants compared five different drugs with placebo; all reported the primary outcome as mean change in visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 100) for nausea severity from baseline to 30 minutes. Trials did not routinely report other primary outcomes of the change in nausea VAS at 60 minutes or number of vomiting episodes. Differences in mean VAS change from baseline to 30 minutes between placebo and the drugs evaluated were: metoclopramide (three trials, 301 participants; mean difference (MD) -5.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -11.33 to 0.80), ondansetron (two trials, 250 participants; MD -4.32, 95% CI -11.20 to 2.56), prochlorperazine (one trial, 50 participants; MD -1.80, 95% CI -14.40 to 10.80), promethazine (one trial, 82 participants; MD -8.47, 95% CI -19.79 to 2.85) and droperidol (one trial, 48 participants; MD -15.8, 95% CI -26.98 to -4.62). The only statistically significant change in baseline VAS to 30 minutes was for droperidol, in a single trial of 48 participants. No other drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo. Other included trials evaluated a drug compared to "active controls" (alternative antiemetic). There was no convincing evidence of superiority of any particular drug compared to active control. All trials included in this review reported adverse events, but they were variably reported precluding meaningful pooling of results. Adverse events were generally mild, there were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there were not enough data.

Authors' Conclusions

In an ED population, there is no definite evidence to support the superiority of any one drug over any other drug, or the superiority of any drug over placebo. Participants receiving placebo often reported clinically significant improvement in nausea, implying general supportive treatment such as intravenous fluids may be sufficient for the majority of people. If a drug is considered necessary, choice of drug may be dictated by other considerations such as a person's preference, adverse-effect profile and cost. The review was limited by the paucity of clinical trials in this setting. Future research should include the use of placebo and consider focusing on specific diagnostic groups and controlling for factors such as intravenous fluid administered.

### Transdermal delivery of sumatriptan for the treatment of acute migraine [^7f8508b6]. Neurotherapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Summary

Migraine is a common, multisymptom disorder that can severely impact the daily activities of migraineurs. Triptans (primarily sumatriptan) are the most commonly prescribed treatment for migraine and are considered a relatively safe and effective initial therapy. Unfortunately, current sumatriptan formulations (i.e., oral, nasal, subcutaneous) may be associated with limitations that can result in patients' delaying or avoiding treatment. For oral formulations, these limitations include difficulty in taking an oral medication due to the nausea and vomiting that often accompany migraine, and inconsistent absorption, whereas nasal and subcutaneous formulations may be associated with low bioavailability and an undesirable rate of adverse events, respectively. An alternative to current formulations is transdermal drug delivery, particularly iontophoresis. Transdermal delivery has several advantages over current formulations, including avoidance of the gastrointestinal tract, controlled and sustained delivery, and convenient administration. This article reviews the in vitro, in vivo, and preclinical data supporting the use of iontophoresis for the delivery of sumatriptan, as well as the recent clinical data for Zelrix (NuPathe Inc., Conshohocken, PA), an iontophoretic sumatriptan patch currently in phase III development for the treatment of migraine.

Abortive interventions (pharmacological)—The guideline panel recommends using antimigraine agents (e.g., NSAIDs, triptans) for treatment of acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes in children and adolescents with a personal or family history of migraine (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). The guideline panel suggests using NK1-receptor antagonist (i.e., aprepitant) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects), and acute treatment with NK1 receptor antagonist should be continued for 3 consecutive days. The guideline panel suggests using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (i.e., ondansetron) for treatment of acute CVS episodes in children and adolescents (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects).

Recommendation 8—For acute cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) episodes not responding to outpatient abortive therapies in children and adolescents, the guideline panel suggests using an IV 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g., ondansetron) with a conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects. Ondansetron is readily available, familiar and widely used both in home and ED settings and is considered probably effective, especially in those patients with lower-intensity attacks; decreasing nausea and vomiting may dampen anticipatory anxiety that can trigger recurrent CVS attacks and may also facilitate the maintenance of hydration and concomitant anti-migraine medication such as NSAIDs, triptans, and sedatives such as diphenhydramine that may facilitate sleep. Alternate formulations, including orally dissolving tablets and topical forms, were noted to be effective based on positive clinical experience by the expert panel, and early intervention with a topical formulation may provide relief of nausea and facilitate tolerance for subsequent oral abortive agents including aprepitant. Background notes that ondansetron is a potent, highly selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with established antiemetic efficacy and tolerability in the prevention of pediatric CINV, and that oral ondansetron is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has lower bioavailability compared with the IV form.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥15 days per month for >3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^e087ecf1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of paracetamol (acetaminophen), alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief Database for studies through 4 October 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered paracetamol to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and numbers needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment.

Main Results

Ten studies (2769 participants, 4062 attacks) compared paracetamol 1000 mg, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes paracetamol was superior to placebo, with NNTs of 12, 5.2 and 5.0 for 2-hour pain-free and 1- and 2-hour headache relief, respectively, when medication was taken for moderate to severe pain. Nausea, photophobia and phonophobia were reduced more with paracetamol than with placebo at 2 hours (NNTs of 7 to 11); more individuals were free of any functional disability at 2 hours with paracetamol (NNT 10); and fewer participants needed rescue medication over 6 hours (NNT 6).Paracetamol 1000 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg was not significantly different from oral sumatriptan 100 mg for 2-hour headache relief; there were no 2-hour pain-free data. There was no significant difference between the paracetamol plus metoclopramide combination and sumatriptan for relief of "light/noise sensitivity" at 2 hours, but slightly more individuals needed rescue medication over 24 hours with the combination therapy (NNT 17).Adverse event rates were similar between paracetamol and placebo, and between paracetamol plus metoclopramide and sumatriptan. No serious adverse events occurred with paracetamol alone, but more "major" adverse events occurred with sumatriptan than with the combination therapy (NNH 32).

Authors' Conclusions

Paracetamol 1000 mg alone is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, and the addition of 10 mg metoclopramide gives short-term efficacy equivalent to oral sumatriptan 100 mg. Adverse events with paracetamol did not differ from placebo; "major" adverse events were slightly more common with sumatriptan than with paracetamol plus metoclopramide.

### Diclofenac with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^881e2772]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in Issue 2, 2012 (Derry 2012a). Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. Diclofenac is an established analgesic, and new formulations using the potassium or epolamine salts, which can be dissolved in water, have been developed for rapid absorption, which may be beneficial in acute migraine. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 27 September 2011 for the original review and 15 February 2013 for the update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled or active-controlled studies, or both, using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Five studies (1356 participants, 2711 attacks) compared oral diclofenac with placebo, and one also compared it with sumatriptan; none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic. Four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication, and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response. Only two studies, with three active treatment arms, provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes. For single doses of diclofenac potassium 50 mg versus placebo (two studies), the NNTs were 6.2, 8.9, and 9.5 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at two hours, and pain-free responses at 24 hours, respectively.Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient, with diclofenac and placebo.There were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac, or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens; only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator (oral sumatriptan 100 mg).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral diclofenac potassium 50 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine, providing relief from pain and associated symptoms, although only a minority of patients experience pain-free responses. Adverse events are mostly mild and transient and occur at the same rate as with placebo.

### Refractory nausea and vomiting in the setting of well-controlled idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^6b7d68e7]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Summary A 27-year-old woman with a history of recurrent nausea and vomiting in the setting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) was admitted for control of unremitting nausea and vomiting. Initial antiemetic therapy included optimisation of IIH therapy by titrating acetazolamide, in addition to using ondansetron and metoclopramide as needed, with minimal relief. She was ultimately treated with palonosetron with complete resolution of her acute nausea. Nausea, often treated with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, approved for perioperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea, are used off-label to treat nausea and vomiting outside of those settings. The efficacy of different regimens has been compared in the literature and continues to remain controversial. When choosing from different 5-HT3 antagonists there are other considerations, in addition to efficacy to consider: dosing schedule, half-life, time of onset, duration and cost-to-benefit ratio, and although one 5-HT3 antagonist may not have been effective, another one may be. In our case palonosetron, with a significantly longer half-life than other 5-HT3 antagonists, was effective in resolving nausea when compared with the more commonly used ondansetron.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^87b34236]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

These data demonstrate that aprepitant can provide relief of DHE-induced nausea and emesis where standard strategies, such as dopamine receptor antagonists, serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, and antihistamines, have failed. Moreover, aprepitant can be effective in patients with marked nausea before DHE administration and in patients with a history of DHE-induced nausea. A distinctive subgroup of patients with refractory nausea withdrawing from daily cannabinoid agonist use also respond well to aprepitant. While comparative efficacy studies would be appropriate to ascertain which is the best initial antiemetic path when using DHE, our data support the addition of aprepitant in patients whose conventional antiemetics failed or in those with special cases likely to be refractory to conventional antiemetics. Moreover, given the very common occurrence of nausea and vomiting in patients with migraine attending emergency departments and the excellent tolerability of aprepitant including a lack of sedative effects, its broader use could be considered in such settings.

DHE has been used in the treatment of migraine for many years.Nausea in association with administration of DHE is well recognized; it has been suggested that its control is associated with better medium-term efficacy outcomes. Frequently used antiemetic medications in the context of DHE include ondansetron and granisetron (5-HT 3 receptor antagonists), metoclopramide (dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist), promethazine (primarily H 1 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist), prochlorperazine (primarily D 2 receptor antagonist), and domperidone (peripheral D 2 and D 3 receptor antagonist). While domperidone and the 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists are very well tolerated when used conservatively, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine are not without their own adverse events that can complicate the inpatient management of migraine. Despite vigorous treatment, some patients may develop significant nausea resulting in dose adjustments of DHE or premature termination of treatment with diminished efficacy. Aprepitant was developed for cancer therapy–induced emetogenesisand thus offers a novel approach to DHE-induced refractory nausea.

### Abdominal migraine in adults: a review of pharmacotherapeutic options [^7f586a1d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the case of a 32-year-old woman with abdominal migraine and present a literature review to evaluate abdominal migraine in adults, with particular regard to effective treatment.

Case Summary

A 32-year-old African American female presented with recurrent, severe abdominal pain. The patient had several previous admissions with similar symptoms and an extensive gastrointestinal workup in which findings were normal. Attacks of abdominal pain occurred despite treatment with analgesics and antiemetics. She had a family history of migraine headaches. A diagnosis of abdominal migraine was presumed and prophylactic therapy with topiramate 50 mg twice daily relieved the symptoms.

Discussion

Most published cases of adult abdominal migraine describe females who had a long history of abdominal pain refractory to conventional therapies. The majority of patients had a strong family history of migraine and reported similar episodic abdominal pain. Patients responded to prophylactic migraine therapies, including calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, topiramate, and antihistamines; a few responded to abortive sumatriptan therapy.

Conclusions

Abdominal migraine should be considered a possible source of incurable abdominal pain in adults when accompanied by a complete gastrointestinal workup with normal results. We recommend a trial of topiramate as prophylactic therapy if abdominal migraine is the likely source of the pain.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride (ondansetron) [^dfdfbb27]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and bronchospasm, have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5-HT3receptor antagonists. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of ondansetron; treat promptly per standard of care and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve [see Contraindications (4)] .

5.2 QT Prolongation

Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including QT interval prolongation have been seen in patients receiving ondansetron. In addition, postmarketing cases of Torsade de Pointes have been reported in patients using ondansetron. Avoid ondansetron in patients with congenital long QT syndrome. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia), congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] .

### News flash: old mother hubbard reports the cupboard is bare...time for the FDA to let droperidol out of the (black) box [^d0dca171]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

A quick way for a clinical pharmacist to eliminate himself or herself from "employee of the month" consideration is to mention the term medication shortage. Even with training geared toward maximizing resources, the cumulative disappearance of a plethora of medications for the treatment of nausea, vomiting, and/or primary headaches is almost too much for emergency medicine physicians to manage. With prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, promethazine, and ondansetron in increasingly short supply, it is time for the Food and Drug Administration to revisit droperidol's black box warning driven by QTc interval prolongation, given its questionable validity, and restore droperidol's place in the armamentarium of emergency medicine physicians.

### Diclofenac with or without an antiemetic for acute migraine headaches in adults [^4a987466]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers choose not to, or are unable to, seek professional help and rely on over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics. Diclofenac is an established analgesic, and new formulations using the potassium or epolamine salts, which can be dissolved in water, have been developed for rapid absorption, which may be beneficial in acute migraine. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce the nausea and vomiting commonly associated with migraine.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of diclofenac, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 27 September 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- and/or active-controlled studies using self administered diclofenac to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We used numbers of participants achieving each outcome to calculate relative risk (or 'risk ratio') and numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or a different active treatment.

Main Results

Five studies (1356 participants) compared oral diclofenac with placebo, and one also compared it with sumatriptan; none combined diclofenac with a self administered antiemetic. Four studies treated attacks with single doses of medication, and two allowed an optional second dose for inadequate response. Only two studies, with three active treatment arms, provided data for pooled analysis of primary outcomes. For single doses of diclofenac potassium 50 mg versus placebo (two studies), the NNTs were 6.2, 8.9, and 9.5 for pain-free at two hours, headache relief at two hours, and pain-free responses at 24 hours, respectively.Associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, and functional disability were reduced within two hours, and similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient.There were insufficient data to evaluate other doses of oral diclofenac, or to compare different formulations or different dosing regimens; only one study compared oral diclofenac with an active comparator (oral sumatriptan 100 mg).

Authors' Conclusions

Oral diclofenac potassium 50 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine, providing relief from pain and associated symptoms, although only a minority of patients experience pain-free responses. Adverse events are mostly mild and transient and occur at the same rate as with placebo.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^cd6d7925]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) has been established as an effective acute treatment for refractory migraine. The most common side effect of DHE is nausea, and its control is associated with better treatment outcomes. Indeed, nausea and vomiting control is a practical and common issue in emergency departments in the management of acute migraine.

Typically, premedication regimens used to prevent DHE-associated nausea, or indeed nausea more generally in migraine, target dopamine, serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT 3), and histamine receptors. Aprepitant is a selective, high-affinity substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK 1) receptor antagonist, which mitigates the emetic effects of substance P.Aprepitant has been used in the prevention of postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.In patients for whom conventional antiemetics were not effective, we began to use aprepitant and here report our experience with this novel approach to DHE-associated nausea.

### Sumatriptan (Imitrex) [^c225cdff]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sumatriptan PO (also known as Imitrex, Onzetra Xsail, Zembrace Symtouch, Sumavel Dosepro, Tosymra): 
- Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- Hypersensitivity reactions: maintain a high level of suspicion, as sumatriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.
- Medication overuse headache: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- Seizure: use caution in patients with a seizure disorder.
- Serotonin syndrome: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.

### Sumatriptan (...) [^91ceef58]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Sumatriptan tablets are indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. Limitations of Use: Use only if a clear diagnosis of migraine headache has been established. If a patient has no response to the first migraine attack treated with sumatriptan, reconsider the diagnosis of migraine before sumatriptan is administered to treat any subsequent attacks. Sumatriptan is not indicated for the prevention of migraine attacks. Safety and effectiveness of sumatriptan tablets have not been established for cluster headache.
2. 1 Dosing Information The recommended dose of sumatriptan tablets is 25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg. Doses of 50 mg and 100 mg may provide a greater effect than the 25 mg dose, but doses of 100 mg may not provide a greater effect than the 50 mg dose. Higher doses may have a greater risk of adverse reactions.

If the migraine has not resolved by 2 hours after taking sumatriptan tablets, or returns after a transient improvement, a second dose may be administered at least 2 hours after the first dose. The maximum daily dose is 200 mg in a 24 hour period. Use after sumatriptan injection If the migraine returns following an initial treatment with sumatriptan injection, additional single sumatriptan tablets may be given with an interval of at least 2 hours between tablet doses. Concurrent administration of a monoamine oxidase -A inhibitor or recent use of an MAO-A inhibitor Hypersensitivity to sumatriptan.

3 Chest, Throat, Neck, and/or Jaw Pain/Tightness/Pressure Sensations of tightness, pain, pressure, and heaviness in the precordium, throat, neck, and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan tablets and are usually non-cardiac in origin. However, perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk. The use of sumatriptan tablets is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal’s variant angina.
5. 4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1 agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not. Also, patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events.

Discontinue sumatriptan tablets if a cerebrovascular event occurs. Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with atypical symptoms, exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions. Sumatriptan tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA.
5. 5 Other Vasospasm Reactions. Overuse of acute migraine drugs may lead to exacerbation of headache. Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms may be necessary. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e. g.

### Sumatriptan-naproxen sodium in migraine: a review [^bf279843]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Silberstein and colleagues additionally investigated an early treatment paradigm using sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium versus placebo to treat a single migraine attack within 1 h of pain onset whilst the pain was still mild. A total of 658 and 647 participants were randomized to treatment across two replicate, randomized, placebo‐controlled trials. Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar amongst the study and treatment groups, with the majority of participants being female (87%–91%), White (84%–88%) and observing a mean age of 39.3 ± 10.6 and 40.8 ± 11.2 years. Of those enrolled, most participants had a diagnosis of migraine without aura (63%–69%). The median time to treatment was 24–30 min for both groups, and 86%–88% of all participants followed an early treatment approach whilst their head pain was mild. Sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium generated more pain‐free responses at 2 h compared with placebo (p < 0.001) (Table 4). Pain‐free responses were observed as early as 30 min for both studies (study 1: sumatriptan‐naproxen 5% > 2% placebo, p = 0.016; study 2: sumatriptan‐naproxen 6% > 2% placebo, p < 0.021) and persisted throughout all time intervals of testing through to 24 h (study 1: sumatriptan‐naproxen 45% > 12% placebo, p < 0.001; study 2: sumatriptan‐naproxen 40% > 14% placebo, p < 0.001) (Table 4). The rate of progression from mild to moderate‐to‐severe migraine pain was two to three times higher in participants treated with placebo compared with those treated with sumatriptan‐naproxen sodium from 30 min to 4 h. Importantly, the incidence of traditional migraine‐associated symptoms of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia at 2 and 4 h was significantly lower compared with placebo in both studies (Table 5). No significant differences were observed in the incidence of vomiting post‐baseline, thought to be secondary to a very low (≤2%) incidence of baseline vomiting amongst participants.

### Pain-free efficacy after treatment with sumatriptan in the mild pain phase of menstrually associated migraine [^dfc5d097]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the efficacy of sumatriptan 50-mg and 100-mg tablets in menstrually associated migraine when treatment is administered during the mild pain phase.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-attack study was conducted. Menstrually associated migraine was defined as any migraine beginning on or between day -2 and day 4, with day 1 = first day of flow. Patients had at least a 1-year history of migraine as defined by International Headache Society criteria and reported regularly occurring menstrually associated migraines typically having a mild pain phase. Patients treated attacks within 1 hour of the onset of pain but only if the pain was mild at onset and while the pain was still mild.

Results

In the 349 women with menstrually associated migraine, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo: 61% and 51% of patients who used sumatriptan 100 mg and 50 mg, respectively, were pain-free 2 hours after treatment compared with 29% of patients who used placebo (P <.001 for both comparisons). At 2 hours, 51% and 45% of patients who used sumatriptan 100 mg and 50 mg were free of pain and associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting) compared with 25% of placebo patients (P <.001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were low for sumatriptan 100 and 50 mg, and both doses were generally well tolerated.

Conclusion

Sumatriptan 50-mg and 100-mg tablets are generally well tolerated and effective in providing pain-free relief and relief of the associated symptoms of menstrually associated migraine when administered in the mild pain phase.
