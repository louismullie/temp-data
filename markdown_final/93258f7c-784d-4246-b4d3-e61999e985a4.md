## Question

why does hemoglobin H disease cause pigmented gallstones

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why hemoglobin H disease causes pigmented gallstones. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology of HbH disease and whether it produces chronic hemolysis. Then, I should verify how hemolysis increases bilirubin load and whether that bilirubin is conjugated or unconjugated. Next, I will examine how unconjugated bilirubin in bile promotes calcium bilirubinate precipitation and black pigment stone formation. After that, I should consider additional genetic modifiers, especially UGT1A1 promoter variants, that amplify risk. Finally, I will integrate these into a concise causal pathway and confirm the clinical implications and prevalence data to ensure the reasoning is consistent with observed disease patterns.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. Hemoglobin H disease is a form of alpha-thalassemia in which three alpha-globin genes are deleted, leading to excess beta-globin chains that form unstable tetramers and precipitate within red cells, causing chronic hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis; this chronic hemolytic state is the key starting point for pigment gallstone formation [^1168r3H9] [^113qEfVf].

> Wait, let me verify the bilirubin chemistry next. Hemolysis liberates heme, which is catabolized to unconjugated bilirubin; unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble and poorly soluble in bile, making it prone to precipitate when concentrations are high, whereas conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and less likely to precipitate; this distinction is central to pigment stone pathogenesis in hemolytic states [^114rxijJ] [^112i4jQH].

> I will now examine the precipitation mechanism. Elevated biliary unconjugated bilirubin can complex with calcium to form calcium bilirubinate, the principal component of black pigment gallstones; this precipitation is facilitated by mucin and other pronucleating factors in bile, and the resulting stones are typically multiple, small, and dark due to their bilirubin content [^113X1g1K] [^1168zggC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm whether HbH patients actually demonstrate this phenotype. Prospective data in non–transfusion-dependent thalassemia cohorts, which include HbH disease, show very high gallstone prevalence, consistent with chronic hemolysis driving pigment lithogenesis; splenectomy and higher hemoglobin levels modulate risk, but the overall signal for pigment stones remains strong in these populations [^115PuZDT].

> Next, I should review genetic modifiers that could amplify risk. Variants in UGT1A1, particularly the (TA)7/(TA)7 promoter genotype associated with Gilbert syndrome, reduce hepatic bilirubin conjugation and raise unconjugated bilirubin; in populations with hemolytic disorders, co-inheritance of UGT1A1 promoter variants substantially increases gallstone risk, and similar principles plausibly apply to HbH disease where baseline bilirubin load is already high [^111ryU6K] [^112GbBP1] [^11181GL6].

> Let me think about the full causal pathway and make sure it is coherent. Chronic hemolysis in HbH disease increases unconjugated bilirubin delivery to bile; unconjugated bilirubin exceeds its solubility and precipitates with calcium as calcium bilirubinate; mucin and other pronucleating factors stabilize these precipitates into black pigment stones; coexisting UGT1A1 promoter variants can further increase unconjugated bilirubin and gallstone risk, aligning with the observed high prevalence of pigment stones in hemolytic anemias including HbH disease [^113qEfVf] [^112i4jQH] [^115PuZDT].

> But wait, what if I overstated the stone type — could these be brown pigment stones instead of black? Brown pigment stones typically arise from bacterial deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronides in obstructed or infected bile ducts, whereas black pigment stones are classically linked to chronic hemolysis; given the chronic hemolytic milieu of HbH disease without primary biliary infection, black pigment stones are the expected and biologically consistent phenotype here [^113qEfVf] [^112i4jQH].

> I should double-check the clinical implications briefly to ensure the mechanistic explanation matches management realities. Patients with chronic hemolytic anemias, including HbH disease, have a markedly elevated risk of pigment gallstones and related biliary complications; this is reflected in high prevalence estimates in NTDT cohorts and supports surveillance and individualized decisions about cholecystectomy when symptomatic or when concurrent procedures are planned [^115PuZDT] [^113G4q68].

---

Hemoglobin H disease causes pigmented gallstones by **chronic hemolysis** [^113qEfVf] leading to **unconjugated bilirubin overload** [^114rxijJ] in bile, which precipitates as calcium bilirubinate to form black pigment stones [^113X1g1K]. The risk is further increased by **UGT1A1 promoter polymorphisms** (Gilbert syndrome) [^111ryU6K] [^112GbBP1], which reduce bilirubin conjugation and raise unconjugated bilirubin [^11181GL6]. Additional contributors include gallbladder stasis [^112i4jQH] and biliary calcium salts, which promote stone formation [^115jDqVx].

---

## Pathophysiology of hemoglobin H disease

Hemoglobin H disease is a form of alpha-thalassemia characterized by **reduced alpha-globin chain synthesis**, leading to an excess of beta-globin chains that aggregate as beta-4 tetramers (hemoglobin H) [^1168r3H9]. These tetramers are unstable and precipitate within red blood cells, causing **chronic hemolytic anemia** [^113qEfVf].

---

## Mechanism of gallstone formation in hemoglobin H disease

### Chronic hemolysis and unconjugated bilirubin overload

In hemoglobin H disease, chronic hemolysis releases large amounts of **heme**, which is catabolized to unconjugated bilirubin [^116MrcMJ]. The liver's capacity to conjugate bilirubin becomes overwhelmed, increasing unconjugated bilirubin in bile [^115jDqVx]. Unconjugated bilirubin is poorly soluble and readily precipitates with calcium to form calcium bilirubinate — the main component of black pigment gallstones [^113X1g1K].

---

### Role of unconjugated bilirubin in gallstone formation

Unconjugated bilirubin is hydrophobic and prone to precipitation in bile [^112dsyY6]. When its concentration exceeds solubility, it forms crystals that aggregate into stones [^112JW9r9]. Chronic hemolysis in hemoglobin H disease maintains high unconjugated bilirubin, promoting **persistent precipitation and stone growth** [^112i4jQH].

---

### Influence of genetic factors

Genetic variations, such as UGT1A1 promoter polymorphisms (Gilbert syndrome) [^112GbBP1], reduce hepatic bilirubin conjugation, further increasing unconjugated bilirubin and **gallstone risk** [^112GbBP1]. Coinheritance of these variants with hemoglobin H disease significantly elevates the likelihood of pigment gallstone formation [^notfound].

---

### Additional contributing factors

- **Gallbladder stasis**: Reduced gallbladder motility allows prolonged bile retention, promoting bilirubin precipitation and stone formation [^112JW9r9].
- **Calcium salts**: Elevated calcium in bile facilitates calcium bilirubinate precipitation, forming pigment stones [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Pigmented gallstones in Hemoglobin H disease can cause **complications** such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, and pancreatitis [^113qEfVf]. Management includes:

- **Regular monitoring**: Ultrasound surveillance for gallstone development and complications [^115JyFEz].
- **Surgical intervention**: Cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones or complications [^111iM6VH].
- **Genetic counseling**: Assessment for UGT1A1 polymorphisms to inform risk and management [^111ryU6K].

---

Hemoglobin H disease causes pigmented gallstones primarily through **chronic hemolysis** leading to unconjugated bilirubin overload, with additional contributions from genetic variants, gallbladder stasis, and calcium salts [^114rxijJ].

Gallstone disease exacts a considerable financial and social burden worldwide leading to frequent physician visits and hospitalizations. Based on their composition, gallstones are categorized as cholesterol, black pigment, and brown pigment, with each category having a unique structural, epidemiologic, and risk factor profile. Cholesterol crystal formation requires the presence of one or more of the following: (a) cholesterol supersaturation, (b) accelerated nucleation, or (c) gallbladder hypomotility/bile stasis. Some risk factors for cholesterol stones include age, gender, genetics, obesity, rapid weight loss, and ileal disease. Generally, pigment stones are formed by the precipitation of bilirubin in bile, with black stones associated with chronic hemolytic states, cirrhosis, Gilbert syndrome, or cystic fibrosis, and brown stones associated with chronic bacterial or parasitic infections.

Bile is composed of multiple macromolecules, including bile acids, free cholesterol, phospholipids, bilirubin, and inorganic ions that aid in digestion, nutrient absorption, and disposal of the insoluble products of heme catabolism. The synthesis and release of bile acids is tightly controlled and dependent on feedback mechanisms that regulate enterohepatic circulation. Alterations in bile composition, impaired gallbladder relaxation, and accelerated nucleation are the principal mechanisms leading to biliary stone formation. Various physiologic conditions and disease states alter bile composition and metabolism, thus increasing the risk of developing gallstones.

Introduction

Gallstones are calcified stones formed by deposits of substances like bile, bile acids, or cholesterol on the gallbladder and are a digestive system disease. The primary ingredient in the most prevalent kind of gallstone is cholesterol. Hemoglobin breaks down to form calcium bilirubinate, which is what causes black stones. Brown stones, on the other hand, are made of a mixture of calcium substrates, such as calcium bilirubinate, calcium phosphate or palmitate, cholesterol, and bile, and they develop in the context of bacterial or parasite illness. Those with diabetes and other metabolic disorders frequently develop cholesterol stones. On the other hand, individuals who experience hemolysis or have an inflammatory disease like Crohn's disease tend to get black stones, whereas people with biliary strictures and infections from bacteria or parasites tend to get brown-pigmented stones. The prevalence of gallstones in European adults is about 10% to 20%, while the prevalence in Asians is about 5% to 8%. Gallstones are a complex disease resulting from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have shown a clear familial aggregation and racial disparity in the incidence of gallstones, with genetic factors accounting for approximately 25% of the population variance. Eighty percent of gallstone patients are asymptomatic; however, without timely intervention, the clinical course of gallstones can progress from asymptomatic carriers to symptomatic complex conditions such as acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and, in rare cases, intestinal obstruction.

Introduction

The high prevalence of GSD, a common condition affecting the biliary tract, substantially contributes to increased morbidity and hospitalization rates among patients with digestive system disorders. Moreover, it is widely acknowledged as a potential risk factor for the development of biliary tract tumors. In recent decades, there has been a notable global rise in the incidence of GSD, which has become a significant public health concern. According to global statistics, GSD affects approximately 10–20% of the adult population. In Europe, as reported by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the prevalence of GSD is estimated at around 20%; in the United States, this proportion is approximately 10%, affecting an estimated 20 to 25 million individuals. It constitutes a principal cause for surgical hospitalizations and results in annual treatment expenditures surpassing 6.5 billion dollars.

The primary constituent of the most common type of gallstone is cholesterol. The degradation of hemoglobin results in the formation of calcium bilirubinate, leading to the development of black pigment stones. In contrast, brown pigment stones are composed of a mixture of calcium compounds, including calcium bilirubinate, calcium phosphate, and palmitate, as well as cholesterol and bile. These stones typically form in the context of bacterial or parasitic infections. Individuals with diabetes and other metabolic disorders are at an increased risk of developing cholesterol stones. Conversely, patients undergoing hemolysis or those with inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease are more likely to develop black pigment stones, while those with biliary strictures or bacterial and parasitic infections tend to form brown pigment stones.

While the majority of GSD patients remain asymptomatic, a subset may experience acute biliary colic. Research findings suggest that a considerable proportion of individuals diagnosed with GSD (ranging from 58 to 72%) suffer from recurrent bile duct infections, predominantly caused by E. coli. These infections pose a significant risk of leading to a range of complications, including acute or chronic cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and in severe cases, gallbladder perforation. Specifically, these complications not only exacerbate the healthcare burden but can also lead to severe pain, repeated hospitalizations, and require surgical interventions. As a result, this substantially diminishes patients' quality of life and may indirectly increase the risk of mortality. This underscores the critical importance of addressing GSD as a public health priority. There is an urgent need to conduct further research into the epidemiological characteristics and risk factors associated with GSD in order to inform the development of effective preventive strategies.

### Gallstones [^113qEfVf]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Gallstones grow inside the gallbladder or biliary tract. These stones can be asymptomatic or symptomatic; only gallstones with symptoms or complications are defined as gallstone disease. Based on their composition, gallstones are classified into cholesterol gallstones, which represent the predominant entity, and bilirubin ('pigment') stones. Black pigment stones can be caused by chronic haemolysis; brown pigment stones typically develop in obstructed and infected bile ducts. For treatment, localization of the gallstones in the biliary tract is more relevant than composition. Overall, up to 20% of adults develop gallstones and > 20% of those develop symptoms or complications. Risk factors for gallstones are female sex, age, pregnancy, physical inactivity, obesity and overnutrition. Factors involved in metabolic syndrome increase the risk of developing gallstones and form the basis of primary prevention by lifestyle changes. Common mutations in the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 confer most of the genetic risk of developing gallstones, which accounts for ∼25% of the total risk. Diagnosis is mainly based on clinical symptoms, abdominal ultrasonography and liver biochemistry tests. Symptoms often precede the onset of the three common and potentially life-threatening complications of gallstones (acute cholecystitis, acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis). Although our knowledge on the genetics and pathophysiology of gallstones has expanded recently, current treatment algorithms remain predominantly invasive and are based on surgery. Hence, our future efforts should focus on novel preventive strategies to overcome the onset of gallstones in at-risk patients in particular, but also in the population in general.

Introduction

Gallstones typically develop within the gallbladder or bile ducts. They are categorized into three primary types: cholesterol stones, bilirubin stones, and mixed stones. Among these, cholesterol stonesand those are classified as mixed stones. Gallstones, which may present as either asymptomatic or symptomatic, are chemically classified into two main types: common cholesterol stones and bilirubin (pigment) stones. Black pigment stones are associated with chronic hemolysis, while brown pigment stones are linked to obstructed or infected bile ducts. The majority of gallstones (80–90%) that form in the gallbladder primarily consist of cholesterol (70%), embedded within a matrix of bile pigments, calcium salts, and glycoproteins. In addition to pure and mixed cholesterol stones, pure pigment stones are also identified. Brown pigment stones are associated with biliary tract infections (bacterial and helminthic deconjugation of bilirubin glucuronides) and are more prevalent in Asia. Black pigment stones, which mainly consist of calcium bilirubinate, are found in conditions such as hemolytic anemia, ineffective hematopoiesis, and in patients with cystic fibrosis. The increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin is believed to be the cause of black pigment stones, a phenomenon also observed in patients with ileal dysfunction, consistent with the finding of elevated bilirubin levels in bile in patients with active ileal Crohn's disease or following ileal resection. However, in patients with bile salt malabsorption, other factors leading to biliary cholesterol supersaturation may more likely promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones. Gallstones are a prevalent condition, with particularly high incidences rates among American Indians, where the prevalence can reach up to 60–70%. In contrast, among White adults in developed countries, the prevalence ranges from 10 to 15%. Gallstones pose a substantial burden on healthcare systems, a challenge anticipated to escalate with an aging and high-risk population. In the United States (US), gallstone disease is the most frequently diagnosed hospitalized condition among gastrointestinal and liver diseases. The majority of individuals with gallstones remain asymptomatic throughout their lives, yet approximately 10 percent of patients will eventually develop symptoms. Complications associated with gallstones, such as cholecystitis, acute suppurative cholangitis, and pancreatitis, impact between 20 and 40% of individuals diagnosed with gallstones. However, approximately 1–2% of these patients experience complications necessitating surgical intervention annually. Furthermore, the presence of gallstones elevates the risk of gallbladder cancer(GBC), a condition typically associated with a poor prognosis. GBC is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract, representing 80–95% of biliary tract cancers worldwide. Although relatively uncommon, it ranks sixth among all gastrointestinal malignancies. In 2019, an estimated 12,360 new cases were diagnosed, and 3,960 patients died from GBC and other biliary cancer in the United States. Because of the insidious onset, rapid progression, and early asymptomatic characteristics of GBC, diagnosis is usually not made until intraoperative and postoperative pathological examinations, when the disease is already in moderate and advanced stages, and the therapeutic effect are poor. Indeed, the overall mean survival rate for patients with gallbladder cancer is 6 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 5%. Gallstones have traditionally been regarded as an etiological factor for gallbladder cancer according to case–control studies or autopsy studies. Most patients with gallbladder cancer have gallstones, and gallbladder cancer rates are well correlated with the prevalence of gallstones disease. In support of this association, an inverse correlation between cholecystectomy for gallstones and gallbladder cancer rates has been described. Convincing evidence also exists for the presence of gallstones as a strongly associated factor for gallbladder cancer etiology. It incurs direct costs amounting to $6.5 billion, and the associated expenditures have been escalating rapidly. Consequently, the identification of reliable and well-controlled clinical indicators is crucial for predicting or preventing the development of gallstones.

### Biliary obstruction in pediatric hereditary spherocytosis: a clinical review of 16 cases [^115JyFEz]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited hemolytic disease characterize by anemia, jaundice and splenomegaly. The underlying defect in the spherocyte cell membrane predisposes these cells to entrapment and destruction in the spleen, leading to significantly elevated bilirubin levels in the biliary system and the formation of pigment gallstone. Consequently, complications such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis and biliary obstruction are clinical concerns in HS patients.

The prevalence of gallbladder stone in pediatric HS patients is reported to be 17%, with this figure raising to 41% when regular biliary ultrasound scan is initiated earlier. But most these gallstones remain asymptomatic, as evidence indicated that symptomatic cases requiring cholecystectomy mainly involve cholesterol stones. Most HS pediatric cases with biliary stone are diagnosed before the age of 13. Acute biliary obstruction associated with gallstone in HS is a severe but rarely reported manifestation that sometimes be fatal. Despite its clinical significance, there is limited consensus on the optimal management strategies, particularly regarding surgical interventions.

The aim of this study is to review the clinical presentation, management and outcomes of acute biliary obstruction in pediatric HS patients, with the goal of narrowing the existing knowledge gap and providing evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^114rxijJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstone (GS) disease is one of the leading upper gastrointestinal surgical problems in the Western countries causing a significant health care burden. Though prevalence of GS disease is low among Asians a rising trend of GS disease is observed. The worldwide distribution of types of GS is different and cholesterol GS is the commonest type in Western population while brown pigment GS is the commonest type in East Asians. Black pigment stones are rare in these countries. Compare to Western and East Asian countries black pigment GS are prevalent in South Asian population. Moreover, of the different types of cholesterol GS, mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS are identified as the predominant types of GS in South Asian population. Therefore the identification of aetiopathogenesis of GS with special reference to both mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS is important in implementing preventive measures for GS among South Asians. Both mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones are composed of same chemical constituents namely cholesterol, calcium bilirubinate, calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. Cholesterol is the main chemical constituent in mixed cholesterol GS whereas calcium bilirubinate is the main constituent in black pigment GS. Further in mixed cholesterol GS, cholesterol is concentrated mainly in peripheral zones and pigments are mainly seen in the core. Therefore though these two types of GS are described separately existence of common aetiological factors for both types of GS is also a possibility.

Main cause for the pathogenesis of black pigment GS is the elevated unconjugated bilirubin level in bile. Conditions causing chronic hemolysis and chronic liver disease are identified as classic causes for elevated biliary unconjugated bilirubin. Apart from that gall bladder hypomotility, acquired enterohepatic circulation of unconjugated bilirubin and effects of trace elements are under investigation as the causes for pathogenesis of black pigment GS, as most of the incidence of this type of stone cannot be explained by the classic causes. Of these causes the acquired enterohepatic circulation of unconjugated bilirubin is a new concept of pathogenesis of black pigment GS and ileal dysfunction is identified as the principle pathology behind this concept. Diseases, resection or bypass surgeries of ileum, dietary factors causing impaired ileal function (high carbohydrate and cholesterol) and alcoholism are the main causes for ileal dysfunction.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic complications of sickle cell disease [^1153PTnG]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive abnormality of the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin (Hb), resulting in poorly deformable sickled cells that cause microvascular occlusion and hemolytic anemia. The spleen is almost always affected by SCD, with microinfarcts within the first 36 months of life resulting in splenic atrophy. Acute liver disorders causing right-sided abdominal pain include acute vaso-occlusive crisis, liver infarction, and acute hepatic crisis. Chronic liver disease might be due to hemosiderosis and hepatitis and possibly to SCD itself if small, clinically silent microvascular occlusions occur chronically. Black pigment gallstones caused by elevated bilirubin excretion are common. Their small size permits them to travel into the common bile duct but cause only low-grade obstruction, so hyperbilirubinemia rather than bile duct dilatation is typical. Whether cholecystectomy should be done in asymptomatic individuals is controversial. The most common laboratory abnormality is an elevation of unconjugated bilirubin level. Bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels correlate with one another, suggesting that chronic hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, rather than liver disease, are the sources of hyperbilirubinemia. Abdominal pain is very common in SCD and is usually due to sickling, which resolves with supportive care. Computed tomography scans might be ordered for severe or unremitting pain. The liver typically shows sickled erythrocytes and Kupffer cell enlargement acutely and hemosiderosis chronically. The safety of liver biopsies has been questioned, particularly during acute sickling crisis. Treatments include blood transfusions, exchange transfusions, iron-chelating agents, hydroxyurea, and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

### UGT1A1 variation and gallstone formation in sickle cell disease [^112GbBP1]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Pigment gallstones are a common clinical complication of sickle cell (SS) disease. Genetic variation in the promoter of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) underlies Gilbert syndrome, a chronic form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and appears to be a risk factor for gallstone formation. We investigated the association between UGT1A1 (TA)(n) genotype, hyperbilirubinemia, and gallstones in a sample of Jamaicans with SS disease. Subjects were from the Jamaican Sickle Cell Cohort Study (cohort sample, n = 209) and the Sickle Cell Clinic at the University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica (clinic sample, n = 357). The UGT1A1 (TA)(n) promoter region was sequenced in 541 SS disease subjects and 111 healthy controls (control sample). Indirect bilirubin levels for (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) and (TA)(7)/(TA)(8) genotypes were elevated compared with (TA)(6)/(TA)(6) (clinic sample, P < 10⁻⁵; cohort sample, P < 10⁻³). The (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype was also associated with symptomatic presentation and gallstones in the clinic sample (odds ratio [OR] = 11.3; P = 7.0 × 10⁻⁴) but not in the younger cohort sample. These unexpected findings indicate that the temporal evolution of symptomatic gallstones may involve factors other than the bilirubin level. Although further studies of the pathogenesis of gallstones in SS disease are required, the (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) genotype may be a risk factor for symptomatic gallstones in older people with SS disease.

### Gallstone disease: common questions and answers [^111iM6VH]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 10% to 15% of adults are affected by gallstones, and cholesterol gallstones are the most prevalent subtype. Risk factors for developing gallstone disease include female sex; older age; certain medications; and having type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, rapid weight loss, or hemolytic anemia. Nearly 80% of gallstones are found incidentally and remain asymptomatic. When symptomatic, gallstone disease usually presents as sudden onset right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain. Common complications of gallstones include cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, gallstone pancreatitis, and ascending cholangitis. The Murphy sign is a specific physical examination finding for acute cholecystitis. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging choice for detecting gallstones and acute cholecystitis. A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan can be used to evaluate for cholecystitis in patients with negative or equivocal ultrasound findings. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is an accurate, noninvasive diagnostic test to identify choledocholithiasis, certain malignancies, and biliary obstruction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are safe and effective in treating pain from acute cholecystitis and biliary colic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for most patients with biliary colic or acute cholecystitis. Ursodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid should not routinely be used to treat gallstone disease, but they can be used as a nonsurgical alternative for certain patients. Postcholecystectomy syndrome is a potential postoperative complication that presents with abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):518–524.

### Risk factors associated with symptomatic cholelithiasis in Taiwan: a population-based study [^116zLjG2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In selecting the medical conditions for analysis, we were constrained by the level of specificity within the database (e.g. data for hyperlipidemia were available, but data for HDL and LDL levels were not provided). We were particularly interested in evaluating medical conditions with particular relevance to the population of Taiwan. Hepatitis B and C were of interest, because their prevalence is much higher in Taiwan than in western countries. Conversely, blood cholesterol level was not evaluated, because the majority of cases of cholelithiasis in Taiwan do not involve cholesterol stones (see below).

Gallstones are generally classified as belonging to one of two types: cholesterol stones, and pigment stones. Pigment stones can be further subdivided into high-residue pigment, low-residue pigment, and muddy pigment stones. Cholesterol stones are formed by the precipitation of cholesterol as solid crystals from supersaturated bile and reflect high levels of hepatic cholesterol secretion. Pigment stones, which are more predominant in the Asian population, are composed primarily of bilirubinate salts and oxidized tetrapyrrolic derivatives formed by polymerization of unconjugated bilirubin. This type of gallstone is linked to hemolysis, bacterial infection, or liver disease, rather than hormonal factors. Others also report an association between pigment gallstones and advancing age and possibly alcoholism. We were unable to directly assess the distribution of gallstone types in this study, because no clinical test reports regarding signs of hyperhemolysis (lower hemoglobin content) were available in the database. Chronic liver disease is a well-recognized risk factor for cholelithiasis. Fatty liver, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, elevated ALT levels, and cirrhosis have all been found to be related to cholelithiasis in different small studies. In Taiwan there is known to be a higher prevalence of viral hepatitis than in other regions. Our study confirms that hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and cirrhosis contribute a significant risk for cholelithiasis. Additional studies to understand the mechanistic relationship between cholelithiasis, virus hepatitis, alcohol-related cirrhosis, viral hepatitis cirrhosis, as well as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are needed.

### Gallstones top to toe: what the radiologist needs to know [^112JW9r9]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones are solid rounded particles composed of a combination of cholesterol and bilirubin that form within the gallbladder and within the biliary system. The size and number of gallstones is variable with some patients forming multiple small gallstones and others forming single or few large stones.

The incidence of gallstones is increasing in Western populations as obesity levels rise. In the United States, 8.6% of Caucasian men and 16.6% of women have gallstones. The vast majority of gallstones are asymptomatic and require no follow-up; however, approximately 10–15% of gallstones will become symptomatic over a period of 10–15 years of follow-up. The symptomatic manifestations of gallstones are variable and range from mild symptoms such as biliary colic to severe acute presentations such as pancreatitis, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a patient that has suffered a symptomatic manifestation of gallstones, the incidence of a further manifestation over their lifetime is approximately 3% per year. The risk for gallstone-related pathology is also related to the number and size of stones with numerous larger stones more likely to cause symptoms. For this reason, it is suggested that once symptoms present, the patient should be offered a cholecystectomy.

The main risk factors for gallstone formation are outlined in Table 1, and the factors protective against gallstones are outlined in Table 2.

Table 1
Main risk factors for gallstone formation

Table 2
Factors protective against gallstones

There are three main types of gallstones: cholesterol, mixed and pigmented. Cholesterol gallstones account for 10% of gallstones and are composed of at least 50% cholesterol and form with supersaturation of bile. Patients with high-fat diets and high serum lipids are more likely to have a higher cholesterol composition. Pigmented gallstones, which are darker in colour and are composed mainly of bilirubin with < 20% cholesterol, form with supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. There are two subtypes of pigmented gallstones: black pigmented gallstones which are formed due to chronic haemolysis, cirrhosis or intestinal malabsorption, and brown pigmented gallstones which are formed secondary to bacterial and parasitic infections such as Clonorchis sinensis or due to stasis of bile. Finally, mixed gallstones account for 80% of gallstones and have a cholesterol content of 20–50%.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^111Gtd2S]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pathogenesis of gallstones (GS) is multifactorial and multiple genetic and environmental factors have been identified in different populations for different types of GS with varying prevalence. However the role of the each aetiological factor on the formation of mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS has not being addressed adequately. Hence in this study we attempted to compare known possible risk factors for mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS among two groups of patients with two types of GS.

Methods

The study was done on a cohort of patients with symptomatic GS admitted to the Teaching Hospital Peradeniya, Sri Lanka over a period of 18 months. Clinical and epidemiological data and physical parameters of the patients were recorded and surgically removed GS were analyzed chemically and physically to identify the type of GS. In addition lipid profile was done in all the patients with normal serum bilirubin levels.

Results

A total of 86 patients were included in the study. Mixed cholesterol GS was significantly common among females than males (χ² test, p = 0.029). Mixed cholesterol GS was commonly seen among patients belonging to Moor ethnicity (χ² test, p = 0.009). Majority of patients with mixed cholesterol GS had body mass index above 25 kg/m² (χ² test, p = 0.018). Black pigment GS were significantly common among patients with type II diabetes mellitus (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.035). Further all the patients with chronic haemolytic anaemia and alcoholic cirrhosis had black pigment GS. Age, family history, Fasting Blood Glucose, dyslipidaemia, lipid profile, parity and use of oral contraceptive pills in females, smoking and alcohol intake in males did not differ significantly among patients in the two groups.

Conclusion

Gender, ethnicity and body mass index can be used to predict the formation of mixed cholesterol GS and black pigment GS.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^113crEvZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Type II DM was more common among patients with black pigment GS and it was significantly (p = 0.035) higher compared to patients with cholesterol stones. However, in patients who were not diagnosed to have DM (n = 67) the difference in the mean fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations between the two groups was not significant (p = 0.854). Only 5 patients in the study group had dyslipidaemia and frequency of dyslipidaemia among patients with two types of GS was not significantly different (p = 0.653). Similar observations were seen for the serum TC, TG, HDL- cholesterol and LDL- cholesterol (n = 62).

Only one patient had a history of chronic haemolytic anaemia, while 4 patients had chronic liver disease. Alcohol was the identified cause for chronic liver disease in all 4 patients. All the GS recovered from these patients were black pigment GS. None of the patients in the study groups had history of ileal resection or ileal bypass surgery.

### The frequency of gallbladder stones in patients with pernicious anemia [^115GXNS6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Ineffective erythropoiesis and intramedullary hemolysis are the two important results of pernicious anemia. Hemolysis is one of the risk factors in the formation of gallbladder stones.

Patients and Methods

The frequency of gallstones was searched in 59 patients with pernicious anemia and in 54 healthy subjects.

Results

Nineteen (32.2%) patients in the pernicious anemia group and three (5.5%) patients in the control group were detected to have gallstones. Pernicious anemia patients with and without gallbladder stones were also compared for mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, and vitamin B12 levels but no statistically significant difference was encountered.

Conclusion

Apart from other risk factors, pernicious anemia itself increases the frequency of gallbladder stones. Should patients with pernicious anemia develop upper-abdominal pain or other symptoms referable to biliary tract disease, a high index of suspicion for gallstone-related disease should be maintained.

### Refractory obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis: a new endoscopic approach [^1138uqxX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Liver involvement is a common finding in patients with sickle cell disease. Three principal clinical pictures have been recognized: acute intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatic crisis and lithiasis. Possible causes of acute intrahepatic cholestasis and hepatic crisis are acute intrasinusoidal sickling, with subsequent obstruction, and hepatic ischemia. Moreover, 50–70% of sickle cell patients have pigmented gallstones due to precipitation of unconjugated bilirubin, and cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis are common complications. The highest prevalence of these complications occurs in patients with Gilbert's syndrome because of the combined effect of increased bilirubin production and reduced bilirubin-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1-A1) enzyme activity. Cholelithiasis is also a common complication in patients with thalassemia. To avoid these clinical consequences, elective cholecystectomy with appropriate preoperative preparation is recommended for patients in whom gallstones develop.

Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis can cause symptomatic obstructive jaundice, with abdominal pain that mimics painful vaso-occlusive events. A correct diagnosis is critical, though challenging. Endoscopic removal of choledochal stones does not always resolve the clinical picture, as in cases of dysfunction of the Vater's papilla, increased bile density due to persistently impaired bile flow or to distortion of the choledocus due to dilatation, or inflammation secondary to gallstones.

In this case, severe and persistent obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis and Gilbert's syndrome was successfully resolved with deep and thorough biliary washing, and stenting with a new removable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered stent.

### Acute cholangitis in an old patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II-a case report [^1168zggC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

CN type II, unlike type I, is a potentially benign disease. Patients with this condition usually have serum bilirubin levels ranging between 10 and 20 mg/dL (175 and 350 μmol/l) and seldom develop kernicterus, although neurological dysfunction may occur if hyperbilirubinemia is exacerbated by fasting, drugs or infectious diseases. There have been several published reports of increased incidence of gallstones in patients with UDP-GT mutations. In a series with 20 patients with CN type I followed over a 16-year period, half developed cholelithiasis and required elective cholecystectomy. Gallstones were detected on cholecystography in 4 of 53 patients with Gilbert's disease by Foulk et al. and required cholecystectomy in 2 of 55 patients studied by Powell et al. In a series of cholecystectomy patients, Gilbert's disease was reported in 7.5% of male patients. Several explanations for this occurrence have been suggested. One theory relates to the composition of bile which is markedly abnormal in patients with UDP-GT mutations. Due to the inability to adequately conjugate bilirubin, the bile of patients with UDP-GT mutations exhibits abnormal amounts of bilirubin mono and diglucuronides. These compounds are more prone to deconjugation by bacterial glucuronidases. Unconjugated bilirubin combines with bile calcium, leading to the formation of pigmented gallstones. This however, may prove to be insufficient as a physiopathological explanation, since most reports of gallstones in patients with UDP-GT mutations describe an additional factor such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease or spherocytosis. Nevertheless, despite an elevated risk for gallstone disease, we have only found one report of cholangitis in a patient with CN type II. Differentiation between Gilbert's disease and CN type I and II is important since treatment and prognosis are different between these entities. Although the diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds, response to phenobarbital (decrease by at least 25% in CN type II), bile analysis, measurement of UDP-GT on liver tissue and genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Interestingly, patients with atypical presentations preventing a clear differentiation between type I and II have been described, raising awareness for possible phenotypes with incomplete penetration. Although generally unnecessary, treatment options for patients with CN type II include phototherapy, plasmapheresis, enzyme induction with phenobarbital and liver transplantation. Phototherapy effectively decreased unconjugated bilirubin by converting it to a water-soluble photoisomer that can be excreted in the bile. This treatment is only temporary as skin thickness and body surface area increase with age, reducing its efficiency. Additionally, phototherapy represents a heavy burden for the patient, requiring 10 to 12 h/day of treatment. The average life expectancy for patients having type I syndrome is around 30 years. Even though the prognosis of CN type II is usually good and is compatible with a normal life span, repeated episodes of kernicterus may culminate in permanent neurological damage. The present case seemed of great interest due to the rarity of the situation, and also because of the advanced age of presentation, with the patient only presenting this frequent complication at this old age. Aside from the episode of acute gallstone pancreatitis, 7 years earlier, no other significant complications of the prolonged hyperbilirubinemia were seen in her lifetime.

### Genetic determinants of jaundice and gallstones in haemoglobin E beta thalassaemia [^111ryU6K]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Chronic hyperbilirubinaemia, gallstone formation, and gall bladder disease are unusually common in people with haemoglobin E beta thalassaemia in Sri Lanka. To determine whether this has a genetic basis we compared the bilirubin levels and frequency of gallstones in patients with different alleles of the UGT*1 gene. There was a significantly higher bilirubin level in those with the 7/7 genotypes compared with 6/6 and 6/7 genotype (p = 0.032 and 0.0015 respectively), who also appeared more prone to gallstone formation. These results suggest that the UGT*1 genotpe is of importance in the genesis of gallstones in this population of patients.

### Refractory obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis: a new endoscopic approach [^112dsyY6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Liver involvement, including elevated direct-reacting bilirubin levels, is common in patients with sickle cell disease. Fifty to seventy percent of sickle cell patients have pigmented gallstones due to precipitation of unconjugated bilirubin, and cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis are common complications. The highest prevalence of these complications occurs in patients with Gilbert's syndrome because of the combined effect of increased bilirubin production and reduced bilirubin-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme activity. Cholelithiasis is also a common complication in patients with thalassemia. Endoscopic removal of choledochal stones does not always resolve the clinical picture, as in cases of dysfunction of the Vater's papilla, increased bile density due to persistently impaired bile flow or distortion of the choledocus due to dilatation, or inflammation secondary to gallstone.

Case Presentation

We report here a case of severe and persistent obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis and Gilbert's syndrome, previously, and unsuccessfully, treated with endoscopic removal of choledochal stones. Deep and thorough biliary washing, and stenting with a new removable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-covered flared-type stent led to complete resolution of the obstructive jaundice.

Conclusions

This report shows that an aggressive endoscopic approach in this select category of patients can help resolve the severe complication of hemolytic anemia, thus avoiding surgery.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^113jr8eS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in lipid homeostasis is identified in patients with cholesterol GS in some studies and it is identified as a risk factor for development of cholesterol GS. Interestingly mean values of all the tested lipid parameters were seen in normal range in two groups and none of the tested lipid parameters were identified as predicting factors of pathogenesis of two types of GS. Though abnormalities in serum lipid is identified in patients with cholesterol GS, none of the lipid parameters were related to the occurrence of mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^111dsjtn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The study was carried out among adult (age > 18 years) symptomatic patients with GS admitted to Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka for surgical removal of GS over a period of 18 months. A total of 102 patients underwent GS removal surgeries during the study period and the relevant data of each patient were recorded in an examiner administered individual formatted data sheets after obtaining informed written consent. These include demographic data (age, gender and ethnicity) and the presence of known aetiological factors for GS disease. The considered aetiological factors include age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, family history of GS disease and comorbid conditions (type II diabetes mellitus - DM, dyslipidaemia, chronic haemolytic anaemia, chronic liver disease, ileal resection and ileal bypass surgeries). Females were additionally questioned on parity and use of exogenous oesterogen therapy (oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy). Number of still and live births were considered to determine the parity.

Weight and height of the patients were measured using standard techniques and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. According to the BMI values, patients were classified into two groups as normal, overweight or obese. The categorization was done using WHO BMI cutoff values given for the South Asian community and whole world. According to the cutoff values for whole world, patients with BMI less than 25 kg/m² were classified into normal and 25 kg/m² or above as overweight and obese. According to the South Asian cutoff values patients with BMI less than 23 kg/m² were classified as normal and 23 kg/m² or above as overweight and obese.

Patients with normal serum bilirubin (total) were further tested for serum triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol and LDL - cholesterol using 2 mL of venous blood obtained after 12 hours of fasting period. Serum lipid parameters were analyzed by enzymatic colorimetric method according to the procedure given in commercially available enzymatic kits purchased from Aggape diagnostics, Germany.

### Chenodiol [^116cxMeq]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Of 916 patients enrolled NCGS, 17.6% had stones seen in upright form (horizontal X-ray beam) to float in the dye-laden bile during oral cholecystography using iopanoic acid. Other investigators report similar findings. Floatable stones are not detected by ultrasonography in the absence of dye. Chemical analysis has shown floatable stones to be essentially pure cholesterol.

Other Radiographic and Laboratory Features: Radiolucent stones may have rims or centers of opacity representing calcification. Pigment stones and partially calcified radiolucent stones do not respond to Chenodiol. Subtle calcification can sometimes be detected in flat film X-rays, if not obvious in the oral cholecystogram. Among nonfloatable stones, cholesterol stones are more apt than pigment stones to be smooth surfaced, less than 0.5 cm in diameter, and to occur in numbers less than 10. As stone size number and volume increase, the probability of dissolution within 24 months decreases. Hemolytic disorders, chronic alcoholism, biliary cirrhosis and bacterial invasion of the biliary system predispose to pigment gallstone formation. Pigment stones of primary biliary cirrhosis should be suspected in patients with elevated alkaline phosphates, especially if positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies are present. The presence of microscopic cholesterol crystals in aspirated gallbladder bile, and demonstration of cholesterol super saturation by bile lipid analysis increase the likelihood that the stones are cholesterol stones.

### Can the type of gallstones be predicted with known possible risk factors? a comparison between mixed cholesterol and black pigment stones [^113KQAV3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In our study group majority of patients with mixed cholesterol GS had BMI of above 25 kg/m² indicating both overweight and obesity as favorable factors for formation of mixed cholesterol GS. Further, though it was not detected in this study, a study done in Germany identified a significant effect of obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) on formation of cholesterol GS separately for females and males also. Failure of such identification might be due to the inclusion of lesser numbers of subjects into two gender categories. A strong association of obesity with the development of GS is identified in many case control studies conducted in western population. Several mechanisms are suggested for high incidence of pure cholesterol GS among obese people. Of them hyperinsulinaemia caused by insulin resistance, increased cholesterol saturation index in bile due to the stimulatory effect of insulin on HMG Co A reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase) enzyme are discussed widely. The current study highlights the significant effect of overweight and obesity even for the formation of mixed cholesterol GS. Interestingly when BMI cutoff values for South Asians was considered, majority of patients with both mixed cholesterol and black pigment GS had BMI above 23 kg/m². This indicates a high risk of cardiovascular disease among majority of patients with GS irrespective of the type. Since high morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases has been observed in patients with GS in USA this could be taken as a warning sign for development of cardiovascular disease in future for patients in this cohort as most of the patients were around 40 years.

### Relation of cholesterol metabolism to pediatric gallstone disease: a retrospective controlled study [^113CVhdn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

In the CS-group, most of the gallstones were idiopathic (70%), whereas in the BPS-group the etiopathogenesis was more heterogeneous, and the most common clinical diagnosis were haemolytic diseases (38%) and idiopathic (27%) (Table 2). Only four PS patients had a history of parenteral nutrition. Preoperative serum values of haemoglobin, white and red blood cells, platelets, C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate were within normal limits in both subgroups of patients (not shown). Preoperative serum levels of γGT were elevated by 1.6- - 5-fold in 19% of the patients with BPS and in 10% among those with CS (p = 0.33) (Table 3). The median of total bilirubin level in serum was two times higher in BPS than in CS (p = 0.02) (Table 3). Respectively, serum levels of ALP were above the upper limit of normal by 1.1- - 1.3-fold in 8% (BPS-group) and in 9% (CS-group) (p = 1.00).

### Familial risks for gallstones in the population of Sweden [^113DwmcS]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones grow inside the gallbladder or biliary tract and if symptomatic they constitute gallstone disease or cholelithiasis. Gallstones may be classified by their composition into common cholesterol gallstones and bilirubin stones, by their colour into black pigment stones caused by haemolysis and brown pigment stones caused by obstructed or infected bile ducts, and by their localisation most commonly in the gallbladder or in the biliary tract. Over 10% of the US and European populations develop gallstones and the condition is becoming more widespread due to the increasing prevalence of risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity. Other risk factors are female sex, high age, pregnancy, certain ethnic background, family history and genetics. However, the female excess incidence could not be found in Taiwanese vegetarians. Gallstone disease has important medical consequences and costs; prevention should be of high priority.

Based on familial clustering of gallstone disease, a 2.2-fold to 4.5-fold elevated risk has been reported in case–control studies among first-degree relatives and heritability estimates of 25% to 29% have been derived from family and twin studies. In one study, young women were at particular risk and the authors suggested that 'female relatives of young gallstone patients should be routinely screened for gallstones'. A family study from the 1960s found no increased risk for gallstones among spouses, which suggests purely genetic origin for the familial clustering of gallstone disease. Several susceptibility genes have been identified, including apolipoproteins E (APOE) and B (APOB), cholesterol ester transporting protein (CETP), cholesterol 7 α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), cholecystokinin receptor A (CCKAR) and LDL receptor (LDLR). In some genome-wide association studies (GWASs), low-risk variants for the hepatic cholesterol secretion (ABCG8 19H and ABCB4) have been associated with gallstone disease. It has been estimated that the mutations in the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG8 confer the largest share of the genetic risk of developing gallstones. A meta-analysis of GWASs of individuals of European ancestry identified genetic risk variants for gallstone disease in ABCG8, TM4SF4, SULT2A1 and CYP7A1 genes.

Positive family history was identified only in 6 (7%) patients of the study cohort and it is a lesser incidence compared to existing literature. However in this study positive family history of GS was recorded based on patients awareness alone and hence this results might not be the true representation, as diagnosis of GS is mainly done following development of symptoms where only 1/3rd of people with GS develop symptoms related to GS during their lifetime.

Similar to most of the other studies, factors which have direct influence on increased unconjugated bilirubin in bile were found in only few patients with black pigment stones. Majority of patients had obscured reasons to develop black pigment GS. However male gender and type II DM were identified as predicting factors of black pigment GS.

In this study black pigment GS was significantly high in patients with type II DM than mixed cholesterol GS. However, FBG was not significantly different among patients with two types of GS. Therefore the small sample size can be considered as one possibility for the statistically significant difference. Further, DM causes pathogenesis of GS in three ways. Type II DM which is associated with hyperinsulinaemia impairs both gall bladder and intestinal motility. Though DM has an effect on pathogenesis of GS, previous studies are also not identified it as a strong risk factor. DM is identified as a risk factor in the presence of other risk factors like obesity and family history of GS disease. Moreover in Western population obesity is the strongest risk factor for GS even in patients with DM.

Majority of males were then, current smokers and smoking was not associated with the type of GS. However GS had been identified as a disease of nonsmokers in a previous study. Protective effects of cigarette smoke on the pathogenesis of GS and absence of such relationship also identified in some previous studies indicating controversies of effect of smoking on GS formation. As the exact mechanisms by which the smoking affect the pathogenesis of GS have not been identified, further studies are required to identify the effect of smoking on GS pathogenesis. Similar observations can be seen on the effect of alcohol. It is an area which is explored widely and a positive association between alcoholism and development of pigment GS has been identified in patients without a history of cirrhosis as well. Further a protective effect of alcohol on development of GS is also identified. However a significant association between alcohol and the chemical composition of GS was not identified in this study. This fact has been proven in previous studies as well.

### The pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I [^116mW4S2]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

History and examination

While some cases have been identified in utero (Parez et al, 2000; Kato et al, 2001; Lin et al, 2014), most present in childhood or young adulthood (Iolascon et al, 2011; Shalev et al, 2017). Cases detected in utero have led to fetal demise if untreated, but intra‐uterine transfusions support survival to term, followed by lifelong transfusion dependence. Later presentation can be due to intermittent jaundice and fatigue or the requirement for occasional blood transfusion for severe anaemia, while some have presented with secondary iron overload (Kawabata et al, 2012) or pigment gallstones (Fujino et al, 2013). Retrieving a neonatal history can be useful as some neonates with CDA‐I experience prolonged jaundice and/or the requirement for a blood transfusion perinatally, with no further transfusions thereafter. As a recessive disorder, CDA‐I is more likely to occur in consanguineous families and this should be directly questioned. Intriguingly, there is marked heterogeneity in phenotype expression, not only between unrelated patients with different mutations, but even in siblings with identical mutations, where, for example, one sibling presents in the neonatal period and the other at 2 years of age (al‐Fawaz & al‐Mashhadani, 1995; Heimpel et al, 2010).

Examination may reveal pallor, mild jaundice and splenomegaly, which is found in all cases, at least radiologically (Gambale et al, 2016; Shalev et al, 2017). The finding of frontal bossing can be observed in the more severe untreated cases, and this may prompt the need for imaging to assess for extramedullary haematopoiesis (Heimpel et al, 2003). The finding of limb abnormalities in the presence of anaemia should suggest CDA‐I.

### The linear effects of α-thalassaemia, the UGT1A1 and HMOX1 polymorphisms on cholelithiasis in sickle cell disease [^117Wehfd]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Serum bilirubin levels and predisposition to gallstones in sickle cell disease (SCD) are influenced by genetic variation in the hepatic uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) gene, but the association is not consistent. This study investigated whether variation in the gene encoding haem oxygenase (HMOX1), a rate-limiting enzyme upstream of UGT1A in the haem catabolic pathway, and alpha-thalassaemia could explain some of the inconsistent effects. The UGT1A1 [TA](n) and HMOX1 [GT](n) promoter polymorphisms and alpha globin genotypes were determined in 263 SCD patients (199 HbSS, 5 HbS/beta(0), 59 HbSC). Detection of gallstones was based on ultrasound of the liver/biliary tree. Regression analysis showed that serum bilirubin levels and the incidence of gallstones were strongly associated with the number of UGT1A1 [TA] repeats in all subjects (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.01, respectively). While HMOX1 genotype had no effect, co-inheritance of alpha-thalassaemia reduced serum bilirubin levels in all SCD patients independently of the number of UGT1A1 [TA] repeats. Each additional [TA] repeat is associated with an increase in mean serum bilirubin levels of 21% and cholelithiasis risk of 87% in SCD.

### 10-year risk of gallstones in congenital red blood cell disorder patients: a nationwide cohort study [^111otvD1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic hemolysis potentially elevates the risk of gallstones in several types of congenital red blood cell (RBC) disorders. However, the magnitude of the risk is unknown. We investigate the risk of gallstone disease in congenital RBC disorder patients, compared with general population comparators. Patients were identified from the Danish National Patient Registry covering all Danish hospitals and the National Reference Laboratory for RBC disorders during 1980–2016. Patients were matched by sex, age, and region of origin with up to 50 general population comparators. Gallstone events were identified using hospital-registered diagnoses and surgery codes. Our study included 9354 congenital RBC disorder patients, grouped according to type of congenital RBC disorder, and 416994 general population comparators. The cumulative 10-year incidence of gallstone disease was 4.2% in patients with congenital RBC disorders and 1.7% among comparators. Adjusted csHR's [95% confidence interval] were 8.1 [6.8, 9.7] for hereditary spherocytosis; 3.3 [1.6, 6.8] for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; 21.6 [10.6, 44.1] for pyruvate kinase deficiency; 3.7 [1.9, 7.0] for sickle cell disease; 0.8 [0.4, 1.6] for sickle cell trait; 1.5 [1.1, 2.2] for α-thalassemia trait; 1.8 [1.4, 2.3] for β-thalassemia minor; and 2.1 [1.8, 2.6] for other congenital hemolysis. We found a markedly higher risk of hospital-registered gallstone diseases in nearly all groups of patients with congenital RBC disorders compared with the general population.

### Thalassemia minor, the Gilbert mutation, and the risk of gallstones [^11181GL6]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Gallstones are a frequent complication of hemolytic anemias. The association with the mutation of the A(TA)nTAA motif of the promoter of the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene has also been reported to increase the risk of gallstones. We studied the prevalence of cholelithiasis in thalassemia minor and the role of the Gilbert mutation.

Design and Methods

A group of 143 women obligate carriers of beta-thalassemia, and a control group of 170 hematologically normal women were compared. In both groups serum bilirubin, total cholesterol, and alanine-aminotransferase were measured and analysis of the mutation of the UGT-1A gene was performed. On the same occasion the women underwent ultrasonography.

Results

Total and unconjugated bilirubin were significantly higher in beta-thalassemia heterozygotes. Carriers of thalassemia had a higher prevalence of gallstones (20.3% vs 10.6% OR = 2.15). Among the control group, the prevalence of gallstones did not differ significantly in relation to UGT1-A1 genotype, while in women carriers of beta-thalassemia it increased in an allele dose-dependent fashion. As compared to the controls, the odds ratios for the development of gallstones in thalassemic women were 1.68 (95% C. I.: 0.70–4.03) for those who had the normal UGT1-A1 genotype [(TA)6/(TA)6], 2.31 (95% C. I.: 1.06–5.02) for heterozygote carriers of the mutated genotype [(TA)7/(TA)6] and 3.88 (95% C. I.: 1.31–11.55) for those homozygous for the mutated genotype [(TA)7/(TA)7].

Interpretation and Conclusions

Thalassemia minor represents a risk factor for cholelithiasis and the Gilbert mutation further increases this risk. This is an additional example of how two genotypes can interact and modify a phenotype.

### Refractory obstructive jaundice in a child affected with thalassodrepanocytosis: a new endoscopic approach [^1112TKj3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This report shows that obstructive jaundice in patients with chronic biliary lithiasis can persist after gallstone removal because of bile density and deformation of chronically dilated choledocus.

An aggressive endoscopic approach, with thorough biliary cleansing together with PTFE full-covered removable SEMS stenting in this select category of patients can help resolve the severe complication of hemolytic anemia, thus avoiding surgery.

### Relation of cholesterol metabolism to pediatric gallstone disease: a retrospective controlled study [^1132E8WE]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gallstones are quite rare in healthy children, but they more frequently occur in subjects who have a predisposing condition. Recent series document an increasing incidence of pediatric gallstone disease most probably due to increased detection with frequent use of ultrasonography, as well as the growing obesity epidemic. Grading of gallstones into black pigment (BPS), brown pigment (BRPS) and cholesterol stones (CS) can be performed by determining the stone cholesterol content. More exact classification methods apply ultrastructural examination with scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffractometry and infrared spectroscopy.

Numerous conditions have been associated with the pathogenesis of BPS, in which the elevated biliary bilirubin level is the cornerstone phenomenon, and this is frequently a consequence of chronic haemolysis or hepatobiliary disease. In turn, BRPS have been related to parenteral nutrition even more tightly than the BPS. CS, which are more frequent in older children and adults than pigment stones (PS), are formed by several pathophysiologic factors, of which certain properties in cholesterol metabolism play essential roles. These metabolic features include hepatic hypersecretion of biliary lipids, enhanced phase transition of cholesterol, high efficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption and increased hepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol.

Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by the interaction between intestinal absorption, de novo synthesis, hepatic output into the bile and fecal secretion of cholesterol. Phytosterols are not synthesized in the human body, but they are normally absorbed to a much lesser extent than cholesterol, and, consequently, their serum levels are only 0.1–0.005% of total cholesterol concentration. Of phytosterols in serum, campesterol and sitosterol are the most abundant ones, whereas stigmasterol and avenasterol form minor fractions. That ratios to cholesterol of campesterol, sitosterol and cholestanol (a 5-α saturated, enzymatically formed derivative of endogenous cholesterol) in serum are associated with the efficiency of cholesterol absorption among human subjects has been documented in detail. Generally in serum, the ratios to cholesterol of squalene, lanosterol and cholesterol demethylated precursor sterols, i.e. cholestenol, desmosterol and lathosterol, positively reflect cholesterol synthesis and inversely cholesterol absorption efficiency and the respective surrogate sterol markers of cholesterol absorption. These variables of cholesterol metabolism occur also in bile and gallstones. Additionally, serum level of lathosterol reflects the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity.

### Red blood cell enzyme disorders [^111NL6qK]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Mature red blood cells are reliant on the glycolytic pathway for energy production and the hexose monophosphate shunt for cell protection from oxidative insults. The most common red blood cell enzyme disorders are characterized by hemolysis but with wide clinical variability. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is the most common red cell enzyme disorder worldwide. Frequent clinical presentations include neonatal jaundice and episodic hemolysis after exposure to oxidative stress. Symptoms of pyruvate kinase deficiency and other glycolytic enzyme disorders include neonatal jaundice, chronic hemolytic anemia, gallstones, and transfusion-related and transfusion-independent iron overload. Diagnosis is critical for appropriate supportive care, monitoring, and treatment.

### Coinheritance of Gilbert syndrome-associated UGT1A1 mutation increases gallstone risk in cystic fibrosis [^115H8mDL]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The prevalence of "black" pigment gallstones is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Bile acid malabsorption with augmented bilirubin uptake from the intestine and the development of "hyperbilirubinbilia" have been proposed as key factors in gallstone formation in CF patients. We have now tested the hypothesis that the coinheritance of the common UGT1A1 promoter mutation associated with Gilbert syndrome is an additional lithogenic risk factor for gallstone formation in CF. Our results show that patients with CF and gallstones are significantly more likely to carry at least one Gilbert UGT1A1 allele compared with stone-free patients (OR 7.3; p = 0.042) and that these carriers display significantly higher serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin (P = 0.002). In conclusion, the Gilbert UGT1A1 allele increases the risk of gallstone formation in CF. This genetic association supports the current concept for gallstone formation in CF and suggests that genetic and exogenous sources contributing to hyperbilirubinbilia might be lithogenic in CF patients.

### Integrative genome-wide analysis unveils the genetic landscape of gallstone disease and highlights novel loci with therapeutic potential [^1136MWuW]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Gallstone disease (GD), also known as cholelithiasis, is a common gastrointestinal disorder marked by stones in the gall bladder or bile ducts. These stones can be primarily classified into cholesterol stones, pigment stones and mixed stones, with cholesterol stones being the most common, constituting about 90% of cases.GD is mainly caused by disrupted biliary cholesterol homoeostasis, which alters the physical-chemical balance of cholesterol solubility in bile. This leads to cholesterol supersaturation and subsequent gallstone formation.

Epidemiological studies suggested that high-calorie diets, especially those rich in cholesterol and carbohydrates, may increase the risk of cholesterol gallstone formation, while moderate alcohol consumption and physical activity may offer protection. Prior family based studies have indicated a significant genetic component to GD development. In recent decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and pedigree analyses have identified common genetic variants associated with GD. Variants in ABCG5/8 and GCKR affect cholesterol transport and synthesis. Other variations can influence bile acid concentration by targeting bile salt reabsorption in the ileum, bile acid conjugation or bile acid formation, thereby affecting cholesterol availability and solubility in bile. Other identified genetic polymorphisms include those in liver-specific transcription factors, proteinase inhibitors, transmembrane proteins and fucosyltransferase genes, though their mechanisms remain largely unexplored.

Here, to better understand GD pathogenesis with translational potential, we conducted GWAS and a meta-analysis using the latest genotype data from the UK Biobank and FinnGen in European ancestry, with additional confirmation with a look-up study using the Biobank Japan data set. Our study included the largest sample size and the highest number of gallstone cases to date in European ancestry (71 384 cases and 779 234 controls), enhancing the statistical power to identify novel genetic loci. The subsequent comprehensive post-GWAS analyses using the meta-analysis results provide new genetic perspectives on GD pathogenesis and unveil unrecognised molecular targets for the primary prevention of GD.

### Acute liver function decompensation in a patient with sickle cell disease managed with exchange transfusion and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography [^113kzaHQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a relatively uncommon complication of homozygous sickle cell anemia, which may lead to acute hepatic failure and death. Treatment is mainly supportive, but exchange transfusion is used as salvage therapy in life threatening situations. We describe a case of a 16-year-old female with homozygous sickle cell anemia who presented to the emergency room with fatigue, malaise, dark urine, lower back pain, scleral icterus and jaundice. She was found to have marked hyperbilirubinemia, which persisted after exchange transfusion. Because of the concomitant presence of gallstones and choledocholithiasis, the patient underwent endoscopic ultrasound and laparoscopic cholecystectomy followed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and sphincterotomy.

### Helicobacter pylori in the etiology of cholesterol gallstones [^114Pn5EK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Goals

We aimed to investigate the presence of bacterial structures in cholesterol gallstones and particularly presence of Helicobacter spp/H. pylori in gallstones by microbiologic cultivation, histopathologic staining, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Background

Many studies suggest that different mechanisms are responsible for the formation of pigmented gallstones and cholesterol gallstones. Recently, studies showed that infection could have an important role in the formation of cholesterol gallbladder stones.

Study

We examined 77 mixed cholesterol gallstones. After cholecystectomy, gallbladder cultures were done for H. pylori and other bacterium. Gallbladder has also been examined by three histopathologic staining methods (Warthin-Starry, hematoxylin eosin, and gram staining) for Helicobacter spp. In addition, 16S rRNA-PCR amplification was performed for Helicobacter spp in gallstones. Twenty postmortem gallbladders without gallstones were investigated by the same histopathologic and PCR methods for Helicobacter spp. as a control group.

Results

Different bacterium were isolated from 22 gallbladder samples (12 Escherichia coli, 8 Pseudomonas, and 2 clostridium) and H. pylori was isolated in 6 gallbladder samples. Helicobacter spp was found in 7 gallstones by PCR amplification. Helicobacter-like organisms were demonstrated in 18 samples by three different histopathologic methods. Helicobacter-like organisms were also found in five samples by the same histopathologic methods (Warthin-Starry, hematoxylin-eosin, and gram staining). Only four samples were found positive for Helicobacter spp/H. pylori by all methods.

Conclusions

Bacterial population including H. pylori could have a possible role in the formation of cholesterol gallstones.

### Mechanisms of disease: the genetic epidemiology of gallbladder stones [^116MXV33]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

Cholelithiasis is one of the most prevalent and most expensive gastroenterologic diseases. It belongs to the group of complex metabolic disorders that affect humans, and its critical pathogenic mechanisms are not well defined. As a result, primary or secondary prevention strategies are sparse, and the only effective treatment is cholecystectomy. Here we provide an update on the molecular pathogenesis of gallbladder stones, evidence supporting the hypothesis that genetic factors are key elements predisposing to gallstones, and progress in human genetic studies of cholesterol stones. Data from recent identical twin, family and linkage studies provide conclusive evidence for a strong genetic component to gallstone disease. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies in at-risk populations indicate that gallstone formation is caused by multiple environmental influences and common genetic factors and their interactions. By contrast, monogenic subtypes of cholelithiasis, such as ATP-binding-cassette transporter deficiencies, appear to be rare. The summary of human association studies illustrates that distinct common gene variants might contribute to gallstone formation in different ethnic groups. The characterization of lithogenic genes in knockout and transgenic mice and the identification of many gallstone-susceptibility loci in inbred mice provide the basis for studies of the corresponding genes in patients with gallstones. The transfer of findings from mouse genetics to the bedside might lead to new strategies for individual risk assessment and reveal novel molecular targets for prevention and medical therapies.

### Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II: epidemiology, clinical appearance, and prognosis based on long-term observation [^117C36ar]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA II) is the most frequent type of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia. More than 200 cases have been described, but with the exception of a report by the International CDA II Registry, these reports include only small numbers of cases and no data on the lifetime evolution of the disease. Since 1967, we were able to follow 48 cases of CDA II from 43 families for up to 35 years. All patients exhibit chronic anemia of variable severity requiring regular red cell transfusions only in a minority of children; 60% developed gallstones before the age of 30 years, and 16 patients had cholecystectomy between 8 and 34 years of age. Iron overload was a frequent complication. In 16 cases, iron depletion started between 7 and 36 years. Three patients died from secondary hemochromatosis. Splenectomy, performed in 22 cases, led to moderate increases in hemoglobin values and eliminated the need for transfusions but did not prevent further iron loading. The current recommendation is to consider splenectomy if the anemia compromises patients' performance, and to manage iron overload according to the guidelines derived from patients with thalassemia.

### UGT1A1 polymorphism outweighs the modest effect of deletional (-3.7 kb) α-thalassemia on cholelithogenesis in sickle cell anemia [^113CsDMw]. American Journal of Hematology (2006). Low credibility.

Enhanced erythrocyte destruction in sickle cell anemia results in chronic hyperbilirubinemia. Only a subset of patients develop cholelithiasis. UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism is associated both with unconjugated bilirubin level and elevated risk for cholelithiasis in such subset. Here, we investigated the role of alpha-thalassemia, yet another genetic factor that modulates hemolysis, in conferring protection from cholelithiasis. We show that, although alpha-thalassemia is associated with modest reduction in hemolysis and unconjugated bilirubin level, UGT1A1 polymorphism outweighs its effect on cholethiogenesis in sickle cell anemia patients.

### Increased prevalence of cholelithiasis in gaucher disease: association with splenectomy but not with Gilbert syndrome [^116mX7D7]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Goals

The purpose of this study is to ascertain the incidence of gallstones among adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease and whether the presence of the UDPGT1 polymorphism (Gilbert syndrome), increases the incidence of gallstones.

Background

Cholelithiasis was been observed among patients with type I Gaucher disease with variable frequency. Too, studies have addressed the possibility of an association between Gilbert syndrome and formation of bilirubinate gallstones in hereditary spherocytosis wherein, like Gaucher disease, there is hemolysis of blood cell membranes.

Methods

Medical records of all adult patients with type 1 disease in a referral clinic were reviewed for evidence of gallstones or cholecystectomy. Blood samples were collected for molecular analysis for Gilbert syndrome.

Results

Of 323 adult patients, 82 patients (25.4%), 54 women (65.9%) and 28 men (34.1%), had evidence of gallbladder disease (P < 0.001 relative to normal white controls). There was a statistically significant increase (P < 0.001) for all groups above the ages of 20 years other than for men aged 40 to 49 years. There was a statistically significant association between splenectomy and both cholelithiasis (P = 0.022) and Gilbert syndrome (P = 0.002).

Conclusions

This study highlights an increase incidence of cholelithiasis but not Gilbert syndrome among patients with Gaucher disease. Storage of glycolipid per se or an immune reaction to storage, may explain these findings.

### Management of pyruvate kinase deficiency in children and adults [^1171Ah75]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is an autosomal-recessive enzyme defect of the glycolytic pathway that causes congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. The diagnosis and management of patients with PKD can be challenging due to difficulties in the diagnostic evaluation and the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations, ranging from fetal hydrops and symptomatic anemia requiring lifelong transfusions to fully compensated hemolysis. Current treatment approaches are supportive and include transfusions, splenectomy, and chelation. Complications, including iron overload, bilirubin gallstones, extramedullary hematopoiesis, pulmonary hypertension, and thrombosis, are related to the chronic hemolytic anemia and its current management and can occur at any age. Disease-modifying therapies in clinical development may decrease symptoms and findings associated with chronic hemolysis and avoid the complications associated with current treatment approaches. As these disease-directed therapies are approved for clinical use, clinicians will need to define the types of symptoms and findings that determine the optimal patients and timing for initiating these therapies. In this article, we highlight disease manifestations, monitoring approaches, strategies for managing complications, and novel therapies in development.

### Cholesterol gallstones [^113fTEcU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Cholesterol cholelithiasis is common in Western populations and represents a consequence of altered cholesterol homeostasis. Gallstones form because of a complex and incompletely understood series of metabolic and physicochemical events that promote cholesterol crystallization in bile. In the context of current paradigms, this article reviews recent progress in research on biliary lipid metabolism and the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones.

### Gallstone disease: from genes to evidence-based therapy [^111gp3Dm]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The number of gallstone patients is increasing in ageing populations with a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity. Recently variants of hepatic ATP binding cassette transporters have been identified as genetic susceptibility factors for gallstone disease, pointing to novel means for risk assessment and prevention. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the mainstay of therapy for symptomatic gallbladder stones, the clinical management of gallstone disease is changing rapidly, with an increase in day case surgery and the advent of transluminal endoscopic surgery. Here, we summarize the molecular and genetic mechanisms of gallstone formation as well as the current evidence-based algorithms for diagnosis and therapy of gallbladder and bile duct stones.

### Iron overload and morbidities in Chinese with non-transfusion-dependent thalassaemia [^1168r3H9]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This project provided interesting information about iron overload and disease‐associated morbidities in Hong Kong Chinese patients with NTDT. The inclusion of paediatric and adult patients enabled comparison of patients across various age groups and with different subtypes of NTDT.

Among Chinese patients with HbH disease, rightward deletion of 3.7 kb of a part of α1 and α2‐globin gene was the most common genotype in combination with two α globin gene deletions of the SEA type in trans, followed by leftward deletion of 4.2 kb of α2 globin gene, similar to previously reported data.α‐Thalassaemia mutations were not uncommonly seen in our β‐thalassaemia intermedia patients. It is widely accepted that the presence of α‐thalassaemia can ameliorate the symptoms of β‐thalassaemia, whereas the presence of a triplicate or quadruplicate α‐genotype can lead to an increased production of α‐globin chains and thus a greater globin chain imbalance that may aggravate the clinical presentation.α‐Globin gene triplication aggravated the disease severity of β‐thalassaemia trait in the female aged 20 years, whose baseline haemoglobin was 8.8 g/dL and had gallstone disease. Nonetheless, multiple complications still existed in the two young adults with β‐thalassaemia intermedia with concomitant heterozygous two α globin gene deletion of the SEA type, with little disease modification effect.

A previous history of transfusion was present in 18% of our patients. Since we excluded those who required regular transfusion, the transfusion rate was expected to be lower than in cohorts based on a specific genotype that included patients undergoing regular transfusion. For example, a transfusion rate of 44% was reported in a Thai cohort of patients with HbH diseaseand 84% in a Taiwan cohort. We confirmed that patients with non‐deletional HbH disease were more likely to require transfusion and iron chelation. Iron chelation was more commonly required in our cohort of β‐thalassaemia intermedia patients than in those with HbH disease, possibly related to differences in the erythropoiesis–hepcidin–iron store axis. Of note, 15% of patients with a negative transfusion history developed hyperferritinaemia, and five patients who had never been transfused required chelation. These findings aligned with a previously reported median serum ferritin level of 1084 μg/L in patients with non‐transfusion‐dependent HbH disease and 956 μg/L in those with β‐thalassaemia intermedia.

### Gallbladder motility in inflammatory bowel diseases [^114wzvwv]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

In patients with Crohn's disease, the prevalence of gallstones is increased, especially in patients with ileal disease or after ileal resection. Recent studies point to alterations in enterohepatic bilirubin cycling, resulting in increased biliary bilirubin levels leading to pigment rather than cholesterol gallstones. Gallbladder (hypo)motility is another important factor in the pathogenesis of gallstones leading to bile stasis, crystallisation and stone formation. Postprandial gallbladder emptying is not markedly reduced in patients with Crohn's disease but lower fasting gallbladder volumes have been observed in patients with colonic disease or after ileocaecal resection. Prolonged and repeated bowel rest before and after intestinal surgery has been recognised as a significant risk factor for gallstone formation in patients with Crohn's disease.

### Primary choledocholithiasis after cholecystectomy without hyperbilirubinaemia in a child with sickle cell disease [^115TMHBy]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) may have hepatobiliary pathology secondary to chronic haemolysis and intrahepatic sickling during vaso-occlusive crisis. Choledocholithiasis in children with SCD is usually secondary to cholelithiasis but, less commonly, can be due to primary choledocholithiasis. A known history of cholecystectomy may lead to a delay in diagnosis of biliary tract pathology in sickle cell patients presenting with abdominal pain. Normal conjugated bilirubin levels may further stray healthcare providers away from considering biliary disease in these patients. Here, we report an unusual case of primary choledocholithiasis in a child with SCD after cholecystectomy with normal conjugated bilirubin at the time of presentation.

### Clinical and biochemical footprints of inherited metabolic disease. XVI. hematological abnormalities [^117SMADx]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

By far the most common enzyme deficiency causing hemolysis is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (Fig. 4). This occurs at high frequency in Mediterranean, African and Asian populations. It is an X-linked recessive disorder of variable severity, characterized by acute episodes of hemolysis brought on by the ingestion of oxidizing drugs or fava beans (broad beans). Patients typically present with dark "cola" or tea-colored urine due to hemoglobinuria, along with acute onset symptomatic anemia. Neonatal jaundice is common, often without anemia. It should be noted that G6PD levels measured during the acute hemolytic phase are frequently falsely normal in the presence of reticulocytosis, because of a higher concentration of G6PD in reticulocytes compared to mature red blood cells. Management is supportive in the acute phase with folic acid supplementation and transfusion support if necessary, and in the long term requires avoidance of oxidizing medications and fava beans. Rarely, G6PD deficiency can lead to a chronic hemolytic anemia with acute exacerbations by oxidizing substances.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency is the most common red cell enzymopathy affecting Caucasian people. As with any chronic hemolytic anemia, there is associated splenomegaly, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia and a propensity towards developing gallstones. Other hereditary deficiencies of enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism are extremely rare, and are mostly associated with other congenital abnormalities such as learning difficulties (hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase) or myopathy (phosphofructokinase/Glycogen Storage Disease type VII).

Hemolytic anemia can be seen in advanced liver disease due to metabolic disorders, where it is termed "spur cell anemia" due to the presence of acanthocytes on the blood film. Hemolytic anemia can be seen in the organic acidurias MMA, PA and IVA. Abetaliproproteinemia and sitosterolemia are two disorders of lipid metabolism associated with hemolytic anemia, with acanthocytes and stomatocytes seen on the blood film respectively. Cobalamin C disease is a rare cause of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which presents as an atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), with hemolysis and renal failure due to thrombotic microangiopathy of the renal microvasculature. Plasma homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels are typically high, and treatment includes B12 injections and folate.

### Recommendations regarding splenectomy in hereditary hemolytic anemias [^11733kwW]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Splenectomy

Splenectomy in HS usually results in disappearance of anemia and a clear decrease of hemolytic markers. In the large HS series reported by Mariani et al. the median hemoglobin increase after splenectomy was 3 g/dL (10.8 to 13.9 g/dL), associated with a decrease of reticulocyte count (from 337 to 51×10⁹ /L) and unconjugated bilirubin (from 32.5 to 12 μmol/L).

Due to increasing awareness of post-splenectomy complications, the rate of splenectomy has declined in the last decade. During the period from 1980 to 2005, splenectomy was performed in only 20% of HS patients. In general, splenectomy is not indicated in patients with mild HS, whereas it is usually necessary in severe cases, albeit delayed if possible until the age of 6 years (Table 2). In the intermediate categories the indications for splenectomy are less clear. One indication is symptomatic/painful splenomegaly with associated thrombocytopenia or leukopenia that affects the patient's quality of life. For young adult patients, unacceptable cutaneous jaundice (usually in patients with concomitant Gilbert genotype) may become a social problem that balances a decision towards splenectomy.

Available guidelines for splenectomy

Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HS, including splenectomy were published on behalf of the General Haematology Task Force of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology in 2004 and updated in 2011. In agreement with previous recommendations, the laparoscopic approach is preferred if trained surgeons are available; in children undergoing splenectomy, the gall bladder should be removed concomitantly if symptomatic gallstones are present (Table 3). We referred to previously published guidelines when considering two particular clinical situations: (i) whether splenectomy should accompany cholecystectomy when biliary stones are present; and (ii) the role of partial splenectomy, particularly in children younger than 6 years of age with severe HS.

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adults with sickle cell disease [^113d3urk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic hemolysis predisposes adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) to the formation of bilirubinate cholelithiasis.

Methods

To study the impact of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) on this groups, we reviewed our records of all patients with SCD and cholelithiasis treated electively from 1991 to 1999. During that period, 13 consecutive patients with SCD underwent elective LC for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Nine patients (69.2%) were managed with a preoperative transfusion regimen to achieve a hemoglobin value of ≥ 10 g/dl, independent of hemoglobin S percentage. Five patients who presented with jaundice were referred for preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which identified choledocholithiasis in two of them. Three other patients underwent intraoperative cholangiography, which revealed common bile duct stones in one patient.

Results

One patient developed pyrexia for 2 days. There were no vaso-occlusive crises or deaths. The mean hospital stay was 3.3 days.

Conclusions

LC has proven to be a safe and efficacious method for the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis in this high-risk population. Hematologists are now more willing to refer early, well-prepared patients with SCD and uncomplicated gallbladder disease for elective LC.

### Cholesterol gallstone disease [^111NnFh2]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

With a prevalence of 10–15% in adults in Europe and the United States, gallstones are the most common digestive disease needing admission to hospital in the West. The interplay between interprandial and postprandial physiological responses to endogenous and dietary lipids underscores the importance of coordinated hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal functions to prevent crystallisation and precipitation of excess biliary cholesterol. Indeed, identifying the metabolic and transcriptional pathways that drive the regulation of biliary lipid secretion has been a major achievement in the field. We highlight scientific advances in protein and gene regulation of cholesterol absorption, synthesis, and catabolism, and biliary lipid secretion with respect to the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstone disease. We discuss the physical-chemical mechanisms of gallstone formation in bile and the active role of the gallbladder and the intestine. We also discuss gaps in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of gallstone formation and the potential for gene targeting in therapy.

Diagnostic challenges

The newly-diagnosed adult patient

CASE: A 29-year old man with a history of ulcerative colitis, inflammatory anemia, and cholecystitis (cholecystectomy performed at the age of 27) is referred for further workup of hemolytic anemia with a negative direct antiglobulin test. He underwent colectomy at the age of 17 for ulcerative colitis. Following colectomy, his chronic anemia (hemoglobin 9.0–11.0 g/dL) improved to a new baseline of 11.5–12.5 g/dL. He has long-standing hyperbilirubinemia that has been attributed to Gilbert syndrome, although genetic confirmation of this has not been performed. Currently his laboratory evaluation is remarkable for the following: hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL, mean cell volume 106 fL, absolute reticulocyte count 1,030 × 10⁹ /L, indirect bilirubin 3.7 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 476 U/L, and undetectable haptoglobin. The direct antiglobulin test is negative. A peripheral blood film is nonspecific and hemoglobin electrophoresis is unremarkable. Testing for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, erythrocyte membrane defects, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is negative. PK activity is 1.2 U/g hemoglobin (reference range, 6.7–14.3 U/g hemoglobin). A diagnosis of PKD is confirmed by genetic testing revealing compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations in the PKLR gene: c.1091G > A (p. Gly364Asp) and c.1529G > A (p. Arg510Gln).

Patients with PKD who are regularly transfused or have severe hemolytic anemia are typically diagnosed in the neonatal period or in early childhood. Patients who have never or rarely been transfused, however, are frequently diagnosed as adults. These patients typically have mildto- moderate anemia that can be misdiagnosed as thalassemia trait (without genetic confirmation), iron deficiency (often in a menstruating woman), more common hemolytic anemias (e.g. hereditary spherocytosis), or inflammatory anemia. Patients can also evade early diagnosis because of normal or near normal hemoglobin concentrations in the setting of well-compensated hemolysis. Complications resulting from PKD, such as hyperbilirubinemia, gallstones, and iron overload, can often be mistaken as discrete diagnostic entities attributed to other causes, such as Gilbert syndrome or hereditary hemochromatosis.

### Integration of bile proteomics and metabolomics analyses reveals novel insights into different types of gallstones in a high-altitude area [^1114pX4s]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

To explore the pathogenesis of different subtypes of gallstones in high-altitude populations from a molecular perspective.

Methods

We collected bile samples from 20 cholesterol gallstone disease (CGD) patients and 20 pigment gallstone disease (PGD) patients. Proteomics analysis was performed by LC/MS DIA, while metabolomics analysis was performed by UPLC- Q-TOF/MS.

Results

We identified 154 up-regulated and 196 down-regulated differentially expressed proteins, which were significantly enriched in neurodegenerative diseases, energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism etc. In metabolomics analysis, 20 up-regulated and 63 down-regulated differentially expressed metabolites were identified, and they were significantly enriched in vitamin B6 metabolism. Three pathways of integrated proteomics and metabolomics were significantly enriched: porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, riboflavin metabolism and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. Remarkably, 7 differentially expressed proteins and metabolites showed excellent predictive performance and were selected as potential biomarkers.

Conclusion

The findings of our metabolomics and proteomics analyses help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of gallstone formation in high-altitude populations.

### Predictors of gallstone composition in 1025 symptomatic gallstones from Northern Germany [^11442T2U]. BMC Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The fine structure, bacterial colonization and mechanistics of gallstone generation have been studied in detail in previous experiments. We think, that this study still makes a substantial contribution in that it has focussed more on a general epidemiological survey of gallstone composition mainly to determine the principal components of the current gallstones in order to help identify patients for future innovative non-surgical interventions: In the descriptive statistics of gallstone composition, two main conclusions can be drawn: Firstly, gallstones in the investigated population are quite homogenous in terms of their main components: In only eightytwo (7.6%, including sixty stones, that contained bilirubin/cholesterol combinations) out of 1074 stones, different main substances were identified in the two samples taken from each stone (Table 3). Most of this relates to the inclusion of bilirubin in otherwise dominant cholesterol stones, thus representing the pigment cores or rings in cholesterol gallstones, which have been studied previously in detail. The other source of heterogeneity stems from calcium as an admixture to gallstones. The quantitatively major components of gallstones identified in this experiments are cholesterol, bilirubin (pigment) and calcium carbonate with 93.3%, 5.5% and 4.8% relative frequencies of detection as main substances (Table 2). These major components are not randomly assembled in gallstones (p < 0.001), but the composition falls into distinct classes of gallstones, namely cholesterol, bilirubin (pigment) and calcium stones. This classification has obviously been developed before and is here confirmed on a more formal level. Thus, for further analysis, stones were classified into four classes (for exact definition see the Results section). Calcium was detected only in 10% of gallstones, which has implication for the sonographic and radiographic detection of these concrements.

### Dietary phytochemical index and the risk of gallstone disease: a case-control study [^112HbSKc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cholelithiasis, commonly known as gallstones, is a prevalent condition that affects the biliary system and often requires hospitalization. There are three types of gallstones based on their biochemical composition: cholesterol, pigment, and mixed gallstones. The majority of gallstones are made of cholesterol, with the most common type being yellow-gray stones made of crystalline cholesterol monohydrate. Initially, gallstones may be asymptomatic, but once they exceed 8 mm in size, symptoms begin to appear. These stones can block the flow of bile or digestive enzymes, leading to severe, acute pain in the upper right abdomen, along with nausea, vomiting, and inflammation. Gallstones impose a significant financial burden, especially in Western countries, with over 20 million adults in the US between ages 20 and 74 estimated to be affected by this condition. The formation of gallstones is a complex process that varies depending on the type and is believed to be influenced by a combination of genetic, dietary, and environmental factors (high energy intake, high fat intake, simple sugars and saturated fat intake, tobacco,… etc.).

The pathophysiology of gallstone disease (GSD) involves an abundance of free radicals and oxidative stress, which results in an increase in lipid and protein oxidation products and a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and vitamins. Bile elements such as bile acids, cholesterol, and bilirubin can interact with free radicals, leading to oxidative stress. Patients with gallbladder disease often have reduced antioxidant defense mechanisms in both the gallbladder wall and their circulation, which can affect the activity of important enzymes involved in cholesterol and bilirubin metabolism in mucosal cells. This, in turn, impacts the absorption and secretion of bile mucins and glycoproteins in the gallbladder, ultimately increasing the risk of bile saturation and contributing to gallstone formation. Animal models and theoretical considerations suggest that the absence of micronutrient antioxidants and polyphenols in the diet may play a role in the development of gallstones in humans. Many foods contain various antioxidant and polyphenol compounds, and there is evidence from clinical and experimental studies supporting the influence of dietary components in both the induction and prevention of GSD.

### Calcium carbonate gallstones in children [^116U11hX]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States, cholesterol stones account for 70% to 95% of adult gallstones and black pigment stones for most of the remainder. Calcium carbonate stones are exceptionally rare. A previous analysis of a small number of pediatric gallstones from the north of England showed a remarkably high prevalence of calcium carbonate stones. The aims of this study were to analyze a much larger series of pediatric gallstones from our region and to compare their chemical composition with a series of adult gallstones from the same geographic area.

Methods

A consecutive series of gallbladder stones from 63 children and 50 adults from the north of England were analyzed in detail using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. Demographic and clinical data were collected on all patients. The relative proportions of each major stone component were assessed: cholesterol, protein and calcium salts of bilirubin, fatty acids, calcium carbonate, and hydroxyapatite.

Results

Thirty-nine (78%) adults had typical cholesterol stones, 7 (14%) had black pigment bilirubinate stones, and only 2 (4%) had calcium carbonate stones. In contrast, 30 (48%) children had black pigment stones, 13 (21%) had cholesterol stones, 15 (24%) had calcium carbonate stones, 3 (5%) had protein dominant stones, and 2 (3%) had brown pigment stones. In children, cholesterol stones were more likely in overweight adolescent girls with a family history of gallstones, whereas black pigment stones were equally common in boys and girls and associated with hemolysis, parenteral nutrition, and neonatal abdominal surgery. Calcium carbonate stones were more common in boys, and almost half had undergone neonatal abdominal surgery and/or required neonatal intensive care.

Conclusion

The composition of pediatric gallstones differs significantly from that found in adults. In particular, one quarter of the children in this series had calcium carbonate stones, previously considered rare. Geographic differences are not the major reason for the high prevalence of calcium carbonate gallstones in children.

### Clinical, biochemical, and genetic characterization of north American patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria [^111Cbpqy]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Autosomal recessive erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) are rare photodermatoses presenting with variable degrees of painful phototoxicity that markedly affects quality of life. The clinical variability, determinants of severity, and genotype/phenotype correlations of these diseases are not well characterized.

Objective

To describe the baseline clinical characteristics, genotypes, and determinants of disease severity in a large patient cohort with EPP or XLP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A prospective observational study was conducted among patients with confirmed diagnoses of EPP or XLP from November 1, 2010, to December 6, 2015, at 6 academic medical centers of the Porphyrias Consortium of the National Institutes of Health Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network. Detailed medical histories, including history of phototoxicity and treatment, were collected on standardized case report forms. Patients underwent baseline laboratory testing, total erythrocyte protoporphyrin (ePPIX) testing, and molecular genetic testing. Data were entered into a centralized database.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Results of biochemical and genetic tests were explored for association with clinical phenotype in patients with EPP or XLP.

Results

Of the 226 patients in the study (113 female and 113 male patients; mean [SD] age, 36.7 [17.0] years), 186 (82.3%) had EPP with a FECH (OMIM 612386) mutation and the common low-expression FECH allele IVS3–48T > C, and only 1 patient had 2 FECH mutations. Twenty-two patients had XLP (9.7%; 10 male and 12 female patients), and 9 patients (4.0%) had elevated ePPIX levels and symptoms consistent with protoporphyria but no detectable mutation in the FECH or ALAS2 (OMIM 301300) gene. Samples of DNA could not be obtained from 8 patients. Patients' mean (SD) age at symptom onset was 4.4 (4.4) years. Anemia (107 [47.3%]), history of liver dysfunction (62 [27.4%]), and gallstones (53 [23.5%]) were commonly reported. Higher ePPIX levels were associated with earlier age of symptom onset (median ePPIX levels for those who developed symptoms before vs after 1 year of age, 1744 vs 1567 µg/dL; p = 0.02), less sun tolerance (median ePPIX levels for those reporting symptoms before vs after 10 minutes of sun exposure, 2233 vs 1524 µg/dL; P ≤ .001), and increased risk of liver dysfunction (median ePPIX levels for those with liver dysfunction vs normal liver function, 2016 vs 1510 µg/dL; p = 0.003). Patients with EPP and FECH missense mutations had significantly lower ePPIX levels than those with other mutations (1462 vs 1702 µg/dL; p = 0.01). Male patients with XLP had significantly higher ePPIX levels, on average, than did patients with EPP (3574 vs 1669 µg/dL; P < .001). Marked clinical variability was seen in female patients with XLP owing to random X-chromosomal inactivation.

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest that higher ePPIX levels are a major determinant of disease severity and risk of liver dysfunction in patients with EPP or XLP. These findings provide a framework for clinical monitoring and management of these disorders.

### A prospective analysis for prevalence of complications in Thai nontransfusion-dependent Hb E / β-thalassemia and α-thalassemia (Hb H disease) [^115PuZDT]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, complications in patients with nontransfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), in particular those with β-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI), were found to be significantly different from those in patients with transfusion dependent thalassemia (TDT), mainly β-thalassemia major (β-TM). However, this information is rather limited in other forms of NTDT. In this prospective study, adult Thai NTDT patients were interviewed and clinically evaluated for thalassemia related complications. Fifty-seven NTDT patients (age 18–74 years), 59.6% Hb E/β-thalassemia and 40.4% Hb H disease, were recruited; 26.4% were splenectomized. The most common complications were gallstones (68.4%), osteoporosis (26.3%), and pulmonary hypertension (15.8%). Splenectomy was associated with higher rate of gallstones and serious infection (P = 0.001 and .052, respectively), consistent with a multivariate analysis (RR = 9.5, P = 0.044, and RR = 15.1, P = 0.043, respectively). In addition, a higher hemoglobin level was inversely associated with gallstones in both univariate and multivariate analyses (P = 0.01 and .022, respectively). Serum ferritin was associated with abnormal liver function (P = 0.002). In contrast to the previous study, the prevalence of thrombosis was less common in our population (1.7%), probably due to differences in transfusion therapy, ethnicity, and underlying genotypes. For the first time, this prospective study provided the current prevalence of NTDT related complications in a Southeast Asian population with a different underlying genetic basis compared with previous studies. Although individual prevalence of each complication might differ from other studies, several important clinical factors such as splenectomy, degree of anemia, and iron overload seem to be determining risks of developing these complications consistently across different ethnicities.

### Molecular heterogeneity of pyruvate kinase deficiency [^112pDFig]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Epigenetic factors and co-inheritance

Other causes of variability of clinical expression in PK deficiency could depend on possible individual differences in metabolic or proteolytic activity, which may modulate the basic effect of the mutations on ineffective erythropoiesis, or differences in splenic function, and on the ability to compensate for the enzyme deficiency by overexpressing isozymes or using alternative pathways. In addition, other factors, such as genetic background, concomitant functional polymorphisms of other enzymes, post-translational or epigenetic modifications, and co-inheritance of other diseases may greatly contribute to the phenotypic heterogeneity and complications.

Patients with PK deficiency usually develop secondary iron overload with a multifactorial pathogenesis, involving chronic hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and transfusion therapy; HFE mutations p.C282Y and p.H63D have been proposed as additional risk factors. Similarly, the co-inheritance of the UGT1A1 TA promoter polymorphism may contribute to the occurrence of gallstones, which are detected with increased frequency after the first decade of life in PK-deficient patients.

The concomitance of PK deficiency and other hereditary anemias, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, and red blood cell membrane defects, has been reported on rare occasions, with variable contributions of the different diseases to the severity of hemolysis, and should always be considered when interpreting clinical severity. The number of these reports has grown in recent years due to the increased use of NGS technologies, allowing identification of multiple disease-associated variants in patients affected by congenital hemolytic anemias and complex patterns of inheritance.

Heterozygosity for a mutation in the PKLR gene may accompany other red cell diseases, confounding the hematologic pattern and sometimes making the diagnosis challenging; likewise, concomitant causes of anemia may explain some patients with decreased PK activity and only one mutation detected upon molecular analysis. In a series of 56 French patients diagnosed with PK deficiency by enzymatic assay and submitted to a molecular diagnosis, 17 cases were reported to carry a heterozygote PK mutation; in three of them, an association with other defects was found, namely a membrane defect, a hexokinase deficiency and a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. In these cases, complete hematologic investigation and molecular characterization of the involved genes are needed to clarify the correct diagnosis, also in view of therapeutic approaches and genetic counseling.

### Biliary pronucleating proteins and apolipoprotein E in cholesterol and pigment stone patients [^112x5ELi]. Journal of Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Although cholesterol gallstone patients exhibit higher biliary cholesterol saturation than pigment stone patients, underlying mechanisms that affect stone type are unknown. We hypothesized that pronucleating proteins, hydrophobic bile salts or apolipoprotein E genotype affect stone type. We therefore compared these putative factors in cholesterol and pigment stone patients.

Methods

In 74 cholesterol and 12 pigment stone patients, bile lipids, various pronucleating proteins, crystallization and apolipoprotein E genotype were determined.

Results

Crystallization was enhanced, and cholesterol saturation higher in case of cholesterol stones, without any difference in bile salt composition. Concentrations of mucin (0.91 ± 0.08 versus 0.31 ± 0.06 mg/ml: P < 0.0001), protein, IgM, IgG, IgA, haptoglobin, alpha1-acid glycoprotein and haptoglobin were 2–6-fold higher in cholesterol stone patients. Twenty cholesterol stone pts (27%) but only one pigment stone pt (8%) had at least one epsilon4 allele. There was a significant difference in allele frequencies between both groups (cholesterol stones similar to Dutch population: epsilon2 0.074, epsilon3 0.770, epsilon4 0.156: pigment stones: epsilon2 0.250, epsilon3 0.708, epsilon4 0.042).

Conclusions

Various pronucleating biliary proteins are markedly higher in cholesterol than pigment stone patients. Also, apolipoprotein E genotype differs between cholesterol and pigment stone patients. These factors may affect gallstone type.

### The diagnostic challenge of congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia: two cases of' CDA type II' [^112fKK9r]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The congenital dyserythropoietic anaemias (CDAs) are a group of rare hereditary disorders characterised by ineffective erythropoiesis and morphological abnormalities in the erythroblasts. Patients may present with jaundice or with symptoms of anaemia, gall stones or iron overload. The diagnosis can be challenging and cases have been confused with haemolytic anaemia, haemochromatosis or a haemoglobinopathy. A delayed diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment or delayed management of iron overload. We present two patients previously diagnosed as CDA type II in whom the diagnosis was revised to CDA type I and to hereditary spherocytosis. The conditions are compared and the approach to diagnosis is discussed.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^113mH35x]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

### Neutrophil extracellular traps initiate gallstone formation [^117LpqT6]. Immunity (2019). Medium credibility.

The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is a highly prevalent and severe disease and one of the leading causes of hospital admissions worldwide. Due to its substantial health impact, we investigated the biological mechanisms that lead to the formation and growth of gallstones. We show that gallstone assembly essentially requires neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We found consistent evidence for the presence of NETs in human and murine gallstones and describe an immune-mediated process requiring activation of the innate immune system for the formation and growth of gallstones. Targeting NET formation via inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 or abrogation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as well as damping of neutrophils by metoprolol, effectively inhibit gallstone formation in vivo. Our results show that after the physicochemical process of crystal formation, NETs foster their assembly into larger aggregates and finally gallstones. These insights provide a feasible therapeutic concept to prevent cholelithiasis in patients at risk.

### Gut microbiota promotes cholesterol gallstone formation by modulating bile acid composition and biliary cholesterol secretion [^115hnBEt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Cholesterol gallstone disease is a worldwide common disease. Cholesterol supersaturation in gallbladder bile is the prerequisite for its pathogenesis, while the mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, we find enrichment of gut microbiota (especially Desulfovibrionales) in patients with gallstone disease. Fecal transplantation of gut microbiota from gallstone patients to gallstone-resistant strain of mice can induce gallstone formation. Carrying Desulfovibrionales is associated with enhanced cecal secondary bile acids production and increase of bile acid hydrophobicity facilitating intestinal cholesterol absorption. Meanwhile, the metabolic product of Desulfovibrionales, H₂S increase and is shown to induce hepatic FXR and inhibit CYP7A1 expression. Mice carrying Desulfovibrionales present induction of hepatic expression of cholesterol transporters Abcg5/g8 to promote biliary secretion of cholesterol as well. Our study demonstrates the role of gut microbiota, Desulfovibrionales, as an environmental regulator contributing to gallstone formation through its influence on bile acid and cholesterol metabolism.

### Effect of bilirubin and Gilbert syndrome on health: cohort analysis of observational, genetic, and mendelian randomisation associations [^111onH1s]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This may explain some of the increased rates of liver diseases, especially as bilirubin is often used as a diagnostic test to stratify or intervene in suspected hepatobiliary disease. As effect estimates for many of these conditions are small (odds ratio < 1.1), the increased odds may be all due to differential case ascertainment. Against this, conditions such as gallstones (diagnosed often by abdominal imaging) are less susceptible to this bias, and increased rates of gallstones in those with higher bilirubin is biologically plausible. Additionally, although we have a large cohort, absolute number of cases of certain outcomes are low, and preclude firm conclusions. For approximately 80% of the included outcomes, we are powered to identify moderate size effects (odds ratio > 1.25), but for those with lower case counts we are necessarily less confident on the precision of our estimates. Given the interconnectedness of biology, however, we would suggest that our summary results do not support a broadly causal role of bilirubin in the development of health conditions outside of the biliary tract and of our novel association with pityriasis rosea, in stark contrast to the associations identified in observational data.

In this analysis, because of the complexity of applying non-linear approaches, we used linear (or generalised linear, for example, logistic) regression models to assess the genetic associations. Bilirubin could possibly be truly causal for some of our outcomes that we have defined as null because we have not captured this non-linearity. However, this association would require a very specific relation that would have no overall effect in a linear model (eg, a completely U-shaped model), which is biologically implausible for many of our outcomes, and our approach would capture some non-linear effects (eg, those with a monotonic risk increase but that simply differed in shape).

As with any Mendelian randomisation study, a risk of horizontal pleiotropy from the instruments is possible. This effect occurs when the genetic instrument is acting not through the exposure (eg, our variant alters the risk of each outcome not through its effect on bilirubin).

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding with hemobilia caused by gallstones [^116a5H8M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hemobilia refers to bleeding in the biliary tract, commonly due to iatrogenic, traumatic, and neoplastic causes. It is a rare source of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but it can be severe and fatal. However, gallstones account for 5%-15% of hemobilia cases.

Case Report

A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease visited the emergency department with complaints of epigastric pain and vomiting of coffee ground-like content for 2 days. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds. Laboratory tests showed anemia with a hemoglobin count of 10.7 mg/dL and elevated liver function tests with total and direct bilirubin levels of 3.6 mg/dL and 2.5 mg/dL, respectively. Panendoscopy showed oozing of coffee ground-like material at the orifice of the ampulla of Vater and second portion of the duodenum, leading to suspicion of hemobilia. After admission, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed common bile duct (CBD) dilatation with choledocholithiasis, biliary sludge, and filling defect at the middle section of the CBD. Endoscopic sphincterotomy with balloon lithotripsy was performed. After biliary decompression and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration, abdominal pain was relieved, and liver enzyme and total bilirubin levels improved. Symptoms of hemobilia depend on the bleeding rate and presence of bile duct obstructions due to clots. Minor and slow bleeding tend to form clots and cause biliary obstruction. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although minor hemobilia may remain asymptomatic and tends to resolve spontaneously, the cause of hemobilia must be corrected to prevent recurrent bleeding or obstruction.

### MAFLD mediates the association between CHR and gallstones in the U.S. adults: evidence from NHANES 2021–2023 [^116rQDKB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a common chronic liver disease, is caused by metabolic disorders. Numerous recent reports have discussed the association between MAFLD and gallstones. In their review, Slouha et al. reported that patients with MAFLD had an increased risk of developing gallstones. A Mendelian randomization study suggested that MAFLD is a potential causative factor of gallstones. However, the detailed mechanisms and whether the link between CHR and gallstones is mediated by MAFLD have not been elucidated.

In this investigation, we hypothesized that the CHR is related to an increased risk of developing gallstones and that MAFLD plays a partial mediating role in this association. This hypothesis is based on evidence suggesting that inflammation and dyslipidemia are key contributors to both MAFLD and gallstone formation. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The objective of this research was testing this hypothesis using the NHANES dataset and employing advanced statistical models to evaluate the effects of the CHR on gallstones and the mediating influence of MAFLD. The validation of this hypothesis could enhance our understanding of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms within metabolic dysregulation and gallstone disease, potentially leading to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for patients with gallstones.

### Erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency: 2015 status report [^114ptmw7]. American Journal of Hematology (2015). Low credibility.

Before splenectomy, all PKD patients should receive immunizations according to the Center for Disease Control guidelines for patients with asplenia, including the pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus influenza vaccines. Post‐splenectomy, these vaccines should be boosted at regular intervals according to the same guidelines and any newly recommended vaccines should be administered in children and adults. Providers must be aware that these guidelines vary from time to time. Splenectomized patients should seek urgent medical care for all fevers ≥ 101.5 F due to the risk of sepsis with encapsulated organisms. These febrile, splenectomized individuals should have a blood culture drawn and then broad spectrum parenteral antibiotics should be administered. Penicillin prophylaxis generally is recommended for 1–2 years post‐splenectomy. Continued penicillin prophylaxis beyond this time period is more controversial. Some clinicians consider a lifetime course of prophylaxis, particularly for those patients who live a long distance from a medical center.

As in other congenital hemolytic anemias, gallstones occur at an earlier age than in the healthy population. Pancreatitis can occur as an acute complication of biliary tract disease. In contrast to hereditary spherocytosis, gallstones are also common in splenectomized PKD patients. Thus, the risk continues for gallstones to develop regardless of splenectomy status 21. For this reason, in order to avoid a second surgery and future complications, some advocate for a cholecystectomy at the time of splenectomy, even in the absence of gallstones. Concomitant Gilbert Syndrome should be suspected in patients with higher than expected indirect bilirubin measurements, which may predispose to a higher rate of gallstones. Genetic testing for the UGT1A1 promoter polymorphism of Gilbert syndrome may be indicated in such patients.

Successful pregnancies and deliveries have been reported in women with PKD 41, 42, 43, 44. Pregnancy is associated with increased hemolysis in some individuals; thus, regular transfusions may be necessary even in women who were transfusion‐independent before pregnancy. No guidelines exist regarding indications for blood transfusion during pregnancy, and it is not clear whether splenectomy status or other factors affect the degree of hemolysis in pregnancy. The increased hemolysis observed during pregnancy abates soon after delivery 43. Women should be counseled regarding the potential for increased hemolysis during pregnancy, and the requirement for close follow up with both an obstetrician and hematologist 41.

### Is endoscopic treatment beneficial in patients with clinically suspicious of common bile duct stones but no obvious filling defects during the ERCP examination? [^112ppf5f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design, definition and patient selection

This retrospective study was approved by Institutional Review Board of Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. Eligibility of patients includes those who were clinically classified as either intermediate or high risks for CBDS according to symptoms and signs, laboratory data or image studies during the period of April 2008 to March 2014. These patients had received either EST or EPBD treatments, although no obvious filling defect was detected by ERC. Exclusion criteria include peri-ampullary tumors, hepatocellular disease, hemolytic disease, and patients who ever received endoscopic or surgical treatment for bile duct stones. In addition, positive extraction of stones was defined as stones detectable by naked eyes through the video endoscopic pictures during extracting the bile duct by using basket or balloon catheter; or presence of microlithiasis (non-visible by naked eyes) under microscopic exams of the bile. The model of "probability of CBDS" from American society for gastrointestinal endoscopy (ASGE, 2010) was applied in this study, in which high probability of CBDS includes: 1) CBDS seen on trans-abdominal ultrasonography (US) (and/or CT scan), 2) signs of acute cholangitis (people who had Charcot's triad), 3) total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL, 4) both dilated CBD on US (> 6 mm with gallbladder in situ and > 10 mm with cholecystectomy) and total bilirubin level 1.8 ~ 4 mg/dL; and intermediate probability of CBDS includes: 1) either one of these two factors: dilated CBD on US or total bilirubin level 1.8 ~ 4 mg/dL, 2) advanced age (> 55 year-old), 3) elevation of a liver biochemical test other than bilirubin, and 4) gallstone pancreatitis. In addition, ERCP-related complications were defined and graded in severity according to the consensus criteria, which was adapted as (Table 1), developed by Cotton et al.

Indirect bilirubin and GD

We hypothesise that indirect bilirubin levels may reflect GD risk, with lower levels potentially reflecting enhanced UGT1A4 function and increased GD risk. Our results showed higher indirect bilirubin levels in individuals with GD across European, non-European and mixed populations (figure 4A, A' and A"). Logistic regression revealed a significant trend of decreasing GD risk from the first (Q1) to the third (Q3) quintiles of indirect bilirubin levels, with ORs of 0.928 (95% CI 0.887 to 0.969, p = 4.20×10⁻⁴) for Q2 and 0.945 (95% CI 0.900 to 0.990, p = 1.87×10⁻²) for Q3 compared with Q1. However, the fourth quintile (Q4) showed a non-significant increase in GD risk relative to Q1 (OR = 1.011, 95% CI 0.974 to 1.048, p = 0.930) (figure 4B, B' and B", online supplemental tables S2 and S3). These findings suggest that lower indirect bilirubin levels are associated with higher GD risk within a certain range and suggest a potential U-shaped relationship between indirect bilirubin levels and GD occurrence, where both extremely high and low levels within the normal range might increase risk. Descriptive analyses for African, Asian and transethnic populations are shown in online supplemental figure S11.

### Genetic and functional identification of the likely causative variant for cholesterol gallstone disease at the ABCG5 / 8 lithogenic locus [^114WN1fT]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The sterolin locus (ABCG5/ABCG8) confers susceptibility for cholesterol gallstone disease in humans. Both the responsible variant and the molecular mechanism causing an increased incidence of gallstones in these patients have as yet not been identified. Genetic mapping utilized patient samples from Germany (2,808 cases, 2,089 controls), Chile (680 cases, 442 controls), Denmark (366 cases, 766 controls), India (247 cases, 224 controls), and China (280 cases, 244 controls). Analysis of allelic imbalance in complementary DNA (cDNA) samples from human liver (n = 22) was performed using pyrosequencing. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were used for [³H]-cholesterol export assays, analysis of protein expression, and localization of allelic constructs. Through fine mapping in German and Chilean samples, an ∼250 kB disease-associated interval could be defined for this locus. Lack of allelic imbalance or allelic splicing of the ABCG5 and ABCG8 transcripts in human liver limited the search to coding single nucleotide polymorphisms. Subsequent mutation detection and genotyping yielded two disease-associated variants: ABCG5-R50C (P = 4.94 × 10(-9)) and ABCG8-D19H (P = 1.74 × 10(-10)) in high pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.95). [(3) H]-cholesterol export assays of allelic constructs harboring these genetic candidate variants demonstrated increased transport activity (3.2-fold, P = 0.003) only for the ABCG8–19H variant, which was also superior in nested logistic regression models in German (P = 0.018), Chilean (P = 0.030), and Chinese (P = 0.040) patient samples.

Conclusion

This variant thus provides a molecular basis for biliary cholesterol hypersecretion as the mechanism for cholesterol gallstone formation, thereby drawing a link between "postgenomic" and "pregenomic" pathophysiological knowledge about this common complex disorder. (HEPATOLOGY 2012).

### Cholelithiasis complicating sickle-cell anemia… [^116aeo4z]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

EASTON JG, WRIGHT PM. Cholelithiasis Complicating Sickle-Cell Anemia. AMA Am J Dis Child. 1957; 93: 87–89. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1957.02060040089003 MUCH has been written concerning the occurrence of cholelithiasis in patients with congenital hemolytic anemia, but cholelithiasis complicating sickle-cell anemia is rarely encountered. Weems, 1 in 1945, pointed out that gallstones were occasionally found at autopsy in patients with sickle-cell disease, and he described two adults and a 13-year-old boy in whom gallstones had definitely been demonstrated by x-ray. Although no statement was made, it seems fairly safe to assume that these patients had been treated with multiple transfusions, as it is only recently that the trend away from this type of therapy has occurred. In a review of autopsy findings from 44 cases in the literature Weems found 12 instances of cholelithiasis, only one of which was in the age group from 11 to 20 years.

He advanced the theory that cholelithiasis was responsible for some of the acute and chronic abdominal symptoms in these cases. Tomlinson2 also Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### The role of ursodeoxycholic acid in treatment of gallstones in… [^115jDqVx]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Study Overview It is well established that hemolytic diseases predispose patients to the development of pigment gallstones. Gallstones are noted in at least 5% of children under the age of 10 years, increasing to 40–50% in the second to fifth decades. The co-inheritance of Gilbert's syndrome increases the risk of cholelithiasis four to five-fold. In patients with chronic hemolysis, total bile lipid concentration is decreased and the total bilirubin to total lipid ratio is increased. This suggests that the conjugating capacity of hepatocytes is surpassed by the excessive amount of bilirubin resulting from hemolysis. Increased bilirubin monoconjugate and unconjugated bilirubin can precipitate in bile and form complexes with inorganic ions, mostly calcium, and develop into stones. Patients with hemolytic disorders can also develop biliary sludge, a suspension of precipitated particulate matter in bile dispersed in a viscous, mucin-rich liquid phase.

The chemical composition of the precipitates correlates well with the composition of the associated stone and sludge often stands as a harbinger of future stone development. There is strong data suggesting a benefit in treating cholelithiasis with UDCA and also in preventing gallstone development in various high risk scenarios. There are several proposed mechanisms for the positive effect of UDCA in primary prevention of pigment stones. Mucoglycoproteins are present in significant amounts in black pigment stones and contribute to the matrix of gallstones. UDCA suppresses the secretion of protein and decreases the levels of various proteins in bile. It has also been suggested that increased colonic bile salt may solubilize unconjugated bilirubin and may prevent calcium complexing. There is no published data at present on the role of UDCA in prevention and treatment of cholelithiasis in hemolytic diseases.

The investigators hypothesise that UDCA can be of benefit to patients with hemolytic disorders in the primary prevention of pigment stones, possible resolution of biliary sludge and existent stones, and reduction of symptomatic episodes of cholelithiasis. Repeat abdominal ultrasound will be performed at 12 months. The US will specifically relate to the following features in comparison to the baseline US:
- Presence of biliary sludge
- **Presence of gallstone**: i. Size ii. Number
- Presence of bile duct dilatation
- **Presence of gall bladder wall thickening Drug**: Ursodeoxycholic Acid

### Pathogenesis of gallstones… [^112gfipD]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Pathogenesis of Gallstones Gallstones found in the gallbladder are classified as cholesterol, pigmented or mixed stones, based on their chemical composition. Up to 90 percent of gallstones are cholesterol or mixed gallstones. The remaining 10 percent of gallstones are pigmented stones, which have less than 20 percent cholesterol. Mucin and a soluble glycoprotein are potential nucleation factors. Prostaglandins stimulate the synthesis and secretion of bile mucin. Inflammation and other stimuli, which enhance prostaglandin secretion, increase the risk for gallstone formation. Biliary sludge, also referred to as microlithiasis, is a viscous gel composed of mucin, precipitates of cholesterol and calcium bilirubinate. Gallstone formation is usually preceded by the presence of biliary sludge.

5 Common bile duct stones may form de novo in bile ducts or migrate to the common bile duct from the gallbladder. Composition of gallstones in the common bile duct is usually the same as that of gallstones in the gallbladder, although some bile duct stones are softer and more brownish because of deposition of calcium bilirubinate and other calcium salts caused by the bacterial deconjugation of bilirubin and hydrolysis of phospholipids. In the event of delayed diagnosis in the setting of acute cholecystitis, the cystic duct remains obstructed, and the lumen may become distended with clear mucoid fluid. Although rare, a large gallstone in the gallbladder will sometimes erode through the gallbladder wall into an adjacent viscus, usually the duodenum.

9 Ultrasound scans may indicate dilatation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts, which is highly suggestive of distal obstruction, with a sensitivity of 76 percent. Ultrasonographic findings that are suggestive of acute cholecystitis include the following: pericholecystic fluid; gallbladder wall thickening greater than 4 mm; and sonographic Murphy's sign.

### Hemoglobinuria and hemoglobinemia. report of cases, two deaths and four recoveries… [^115VP8XH]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Hemoglobinuria, which may be a disease per se, is also present as a symptom in many other conditions, viz: in various chemical intoxications, a long list of infective processes and also extensive burns; more especially does it occur, as a disease, in paroxysmal hemoglobinuria, syphilis and malaria being the cause. A given predisposition, combined with a sufficient cause, as sudden exposure to cold, strained physical condition and the like, will produce the characteristic lesion which is to be found in the blood, and which consists of the disassociation of the oxy. or carbondioxy hemoglobin, the free hemoglobin being taken up by the blood plasma — hemoglobinemia. The free hemoglobin produced by the increased hemolysis is eliminated as such, in part, by the kidney, and in part as gall. The stroma of the blood corpuscles having undergone this change are to be found generally in. HIRTH GJ. HEMOGLOBINURIA AND HEMOGLOBINEMIA.
