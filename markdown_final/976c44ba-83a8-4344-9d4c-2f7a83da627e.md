## Question

Ulcerative colitis pathophysiogy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease definition and anatomic distribution to anchor the framework. Then, I should verify the four core pillars of pathogenesis: genetics, barrier dysfunction, immune dysregulation, and the microbiome. Next, I will examine the immunopathology and effector mechanisms, followed by the disease course and progression phenotypes. After that, I should integrate environmental modifiers and special populations, and finally align the mechanistic insights with therapeutic implications and current knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and distribution. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, idiopathic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum characterized by continuous, superficial mucosal inflammation that begins in the rectum and extends proximally to varying extents, with bloody diarrhea, urgency, and tenesmus as cardinal symptoms; importantly, inflammation is limited to the mucosa and is not transmural, which helps distinguish UC from Crohn's disease in most cases [^115LJQc9] [^114DAVck] [^115rx7J1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check the multifactorial model. Contemporary evidence supports four interacting pillars: genetic susceptibility, epithelial barrier dysfunction, dysregulated mucosal immunity, and environmental triggers acting on the gut microbiome, with disease arising when these elements converge in a susceptible host; this integrated model is consistently emphasized across high-quality reviews and primers [^115LJQc9] [^115rx7J1] [^1159xP7X].

> I will now examine the genetic architecture. Genome-wide association studies have identified dozens of UC risk loci, many of which converge on pathways of barrier integrity, innate and adaptive immunity, and microbial sensing; notable signals include HLA class II, IL-23/Th17 axis genes, and barrier-related loci, and roughly half of Crohn's risk loci overlap with UC, underscoring shared immunobiology while preserving disease-specific distinctions [^115LixF9] [^1159xP7X] [^113YgwwA].

> Wait, let me verify the barrier dysfunction component. UC mucosa shows increased permeability, tight junction alterations, goblet cell dysfunction, and reduced mucus, which together facilitate luminal antigen penetration and amplify immune activation; experimental models and translational studies corroborate that barrier breakdown is both an early feature and a perpetuator of inflammation, with patient-derived organoids recapitulating epithelial and stromal defects including compromised tight junctions and goblet cell abnormalities [^115innex] [^115f8DPG] [^111hbyDa].

> Next, I should review the immune dysregulation signature. UC exhibits a complex, not purely Th2, cytokine milieu with elevated TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12/23 axis cytokines, and IL-13, alongside neutrophil-rich infiltrates and impaired regulatory control; this dysregulation is clinically mirrored by the efficacy of TNF-α, α4β7 integrin, and IL-12/23 pathway blockade, and by the association of neutrophil activity with endoscopic severity in UC compared with Crohn's disease [^113t4ES4] [^113H42Eo] [^113E47Eu].

> Let me consider the microbiome dimension carefully. Dysbiosis with reduced microbial diversity, altered short-chain fatty acid producers, and increased abundance of adherent-invasive organisms such as certain Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species is repeatedly observed in UC; mechanistically, dysbiosis perturbs tolerogenic signaling, increases antigen load, and can sustain inflammation even after clinical remission, though causality remains under active investigation [^115gYEAJ] [^115bt2MD] [^1159xP7X].

> I should double-check the environmental triggers that modulate risk and phenotype. Western diet patterns, antibiotic exposures, air pollution, and early-life events have been implicated, while appendectomy appears protective against developing UC, and cigarette smoking is consistently associated with lower UC incidence; these observations reinforce a gene–environment–microbiome model and highlight modifiable risk elements [^115CDsv8] [^111rx7mk] [^113YgwwA].

> Now, I will synthesize the pathogenic cascade. In a genetically susceptible host, environmental insults perturb the epithelial barrier and microbiome, enabling luminal antigens to breach defenses; antigen-presenting cells then prime effector T cells and neutrophils, establishing a self-amplifying loop of cytokine release, oxidative stress, and tissue injury that manifests clinically as mucosal edema, friability, erosions, and bleeding, with neutrophil crypt abscesses as a histologic hallmark [^115LJQc9] [^111iJ2CF] [^116LSgiZ].

> But wait, what about disease course and progression; I need to ensure I distinguish UC from CD here. UC is classically relapsing–remitting, yet a substantial subset exhibits progression over time with phenotype evolution, deeper inflammatory effects, increased hospitalizations and colectomy, and higher risks of dysplasia and colorectal cancer; importantly, persistent clinical activity despite mucosal healing has been documented, and extent of disease at diagnosis tracks with long-term colectomy and cancer risk, supporting a more dynamic, progressive model than historically appreciated [^113rwPvJ] [^114mqsro] [^112VUTt7].

> Let me review special populations and modifiers. Pediatric UC more often presents with extensive colitis and may have a more aggressive course, while sex-based differences in incidence and outcomes are increasingly recognized; age of onset shapes pathophysiologic contributions from innate versus adaptive immunity, and very early onset disease carries a stronger monogenic signal, all of which may influence therapeutic responsiveness and prognosis [^116xahEj] [^117JZaVs] [^113bzGz2].

> Next, I should align mechanisms with therapeutics to ensure coherence. Anti-TNF agents, anti-integrin therapy, IL-12/23 blockade, and JAK inhibition target key nodes of the dysregulated network, while 5-ASA supports barrier-protective and anti-inflammatory effects; treat-to-target strategies prioritizing endoscopic improvement and steroid-free remission are recommended, and fecal calprotectin is endorsed to monitor inflammation and guide therapy adjustments, reflecting the centrality of mucosal control in altering long-term outcomes [^113Ueo4a] [^113p4Y7H] [^117JeFoR].

> Hold on, I should verify current knowledge gaps so I don't overstate certainty. We lack validated biomarkers to predict response or stratify progression risk, the directionality of barrier dysfunction versus dysbiosis remains debated, and the optimal timing and sequencing of advanced therapies are still being refined; emerging areas such as microbiome-directed therapies, barrier restoration strategies, and precision medicine frameworks built on molecular phenotyping are poised to address these gaps but require robust trials and standardization [^1117JQCQ] [^115innex] [^115A3nRc].

> In summary, UC pathophysiology reflects the convergence of genetic susceptibility, epithelial barrier failure, dysregulated mucosal immunity, and environmentally shaped microbiome disturbances that together sustain a relapsing–remitting and potentially progressive inflammatory process; recognizing this multifactorial, dynamic model clarifies why therapies that simultaneously blunt cytokine signaling, restore barrier function, and modulate the microbiome are most likely to achieve durable, deep remission and alter the disease trajectory [^115LJQc9] [^115rx7J1] [^1159xP7X].

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is driven by a **multifactorial interplay** of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity, and intestinal microbiota alterations, culminating in chronic mucosal inflammation [^115LJQc9] [^1159xP7X]. Key mechanisms include **barrier dysfunction** with tight junction disruption and goblet cell loss [^115innex], excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12/23) [^113H42Eo] [^1153Gh9z], and neutrophil infiltration with crypt abscesses [^113E47Eu]. Disease is typically **continuous and confined to the mucosa**, starting in the rectum and extending proximally [^114DAVck], with risk of progression to colorectal cancer via inflammation-driven dysplasia [^112VUTt7]. Therapies targeting TNF-α, integrins, and JAK/STAT pathways [^115REwQw] restore barrier function and cytokine balance to induce and maintain remission [^115innex] [^1133EkY5] [^1153Gh9z].

---

## Genetic predisposition

- **Genetic susceptibility**: Multiple loci confer risk, including HLA-DRB1, IL23R, IL10, and NOD2 [^notfound], affecting barrier integrity, cytokine signaling, and microbial sensing [^1153aU5U].

- **Family history**: First-degree relatives have a 2–4-fold increased risk, supporting heritability [^notfound].

- **Gene–environment interplay**: Genetic risk shapes immune responses to environmental and microbial cues [^116nxf5d].

---

## Environmental triggers

Environmental factors modulate risk and phenotype via **microbiome and immune effects** [^116fAWVk]. Western diets (high fat, refined carbs, low fiber) are associated with higher incidence, whereas appendectomy and smoking are protective, though smoking is harmful overall [^1175RfDD] [^113YgwwA] [^111rx7mk]. Antibiotic exposure, particularly in early life, increases risk, likely via dysbiosis [^notfound].

---

## Immune dysregulation

- **Innate immunity**: Defective epithelial barrier and innate signaling (e.g. NLRP3 inflammasome) enable microbial translocation and inflammation [^115innex].

- **Adaptive immunity**: Excess Th1/Th17 cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23) and impaired Treg function perpetuate inflammation [^115REwQw].

- **Neutrophil infiltration**: Neutrophil recruitment and crypt abscesses are histologic hallmarks [^113E47Eu].

---

## Intestinal microbiota alterations

Intestinal microbiota alterations feature **dysbiosis**, with reduced diversity and increased Proteobacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli) that drive inflammation [^115gYEAJ]. Pathobionts such as adherent-invasive E. coli and Bacteroides species exacerbate mucosal injury [^notfound]. Functional shifts include decreased short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, which impairs barrier integrity and immune regulation [^notfound].

---

## Epithelial barrier dysfunction

Epithelial barrier dysfunction involves **tight junction disruption** — altered claudins and occludins increase permeability and antigen penetration [^115innex]. Goblet cell loss reduces mucus and exposes the epithelium to bacteria and toxins [^notfound]. Apoptosis increases, compromising barrier integrity and promoting inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Cytokine and chemokine imbalance

Cytokine and chemokine imbalance includes **pro-inflammatory cytokines** — TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23 — that drive tissue damage [^113t4ES4]. Chemokines such as CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL2 recruit neutrophils and monocytes, sustaining inflammation [^notfound]. Anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-β are insufficient to restore balance [^113t4ES4].

---

## Histopathological features

Histopathology shows **chronic mucosal inflammation** with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils [^notfound]. Neutrophil-rich crypt abscesses are characteristic of active disease [^notfound]. Chronicity is reflected by crypt architectural distortion, atrophy, and basal lymphoid aggregates [^115Mg8Db].

---

## Disease progression and complications

- **Extent and severity**: Inflammation is continuous, starting in the rectum and extending proximally [^114DAVck].

- **Colorectal cancer risk**: Chronic inflammation increases dysplasia and cancer risk, especially with pancolitis and long duration [^112VUTt7].

- **Extraintestinal manifestations**: Arthritis, PSC, and ocular/skin involvement reflect immune-mediated systemic effects [^113Hf41t].

---

## Therapeutic implications

Therapeutic strategies include **anti-TNF agents** (infliximab, adalimumab) that reduce inflammation and promote mucosal healing [^113Ueo4a]. Anti-integrin therapy (vedolizumab) blocks lymphocyte trafficking to the gut [^notfound]. JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib) modulate cytokine signaling and restore immune balance [^116SSVMF]. Mesalamine supports barrier function and exerts anti-inflammatory effects [^112XNgW3].

---

Ulcerative colitis arises from a **multifactorial interplay** of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, immune dysregulation, and microbiota alterations, leading to chronic mucosal inflammation. Key mechanisms include barrier dysfunction, cytokine imbalance, and neutrophil infiltration, with disease typically continuous and confined to the mucosa. Therapies targeting TNF-α, integrins, and JAK/STAT pathways restore barrier function and cytokine balance to induce and maintain remission [^115REwQw].

### What does disease progression look like in ulcerative colitis, and how might It Be prevented? [^113rwPvJ]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has been characterized by inflammation limited to the mucosa. Although sustained and durable remission has been associated with mucosal healing, the recurrent phenomenon of persistent clinical disease activity despite mucosal healing has been observed in clinical practice and across pivotal trials. Over time, UC appears to confer an increased risk of progression, defined as changes of disease phenotype; adverse transmural effects on the bowel wall; increased risk of neoplasia development; worsening colorectal function; and increased risk of colectomy, hospitalizations, and other extraintestinal comorbidities. Although the treatment paradigm for Crohn's disease has shifted toward early aggressive intervention to prevent disease progression and irreversible bowel damage, such urgency in efforts to halt disease progression in UC have been largely overlooked. This review summarizes the multiple facets of UC contributing to a modified perception of the disease as a progressive one. We propose further study of the natural history and priorities for further treatment goals that include these considerations.

### Ulcerative colitis [^114DAVck]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa, which starts in the rectum and generally extends proximally in a continuous manner through part of, or the entire, colon; however, some patients with proctitis or left-sided colitis might have a caecal patch of inflammation. Bloody diarrhoea is the characteristic symptom of the disease. The clinical course is unpredictable, marked by alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. In this Seminar we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, natural history, medical and surgical management, and main disease-related complications of ulcerative colitis, and briefly outline novel treatment options. Enhanced understanding of how the interaction between environmental factors, genetics, and the immune system results in mucosal inflammation has increased knowledge of disease pathophysiology. We provide practical therapeutic algorithms that are easily applicable in daily clinical practice, emphasising present controversies in treatment management and novel therapies.

### The appendix and ulcerative colitis-an unsolved connection [^111rx7mk]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The appendix is thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, but the nature and basis of this association remains unclear. In this Perspective, we consider the biology of the appendix with respect to its immunological function and the microbiome, and how this relates to evidence that supports the involvement of the appendix in ulcerative colitis. In experimental models, removal of the inflamed appendix prevents colitis, and in human observational studies, appendectomy is associated with protection against ulcerative colitis. Further, among people who develop ulcerative colitis, appendectomy before diagnosis might influence the course and outcomes of the disease - some evidence suggests that it protects against colectomy but could increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Appendectomy after onset of ulcerative colitis seems to have disparate consequences. Clinical trials to understand whether appendectomy has a role in the treatment of ulcerative colitis are ongoing. Major questions about the role of the appendix in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis remain unanswered, and further research is needed to establish whether the connection is clinically relevant.

### Epidemiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis [^1175RfDD]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the colon. Factors associated with increased risk of UC include diet, particularly Western diet influences in newly industrialized nations, medications, and lifestyle factors that may influence the host's microbiome or immune response to antigens. Although much evidence identifying potential genetic and host-related factors is currently available, there are still many unanswered questions. As the global UC incidence and prevalence continues to increase, there are multiple opportunities for continued investigation to clarify our understanding of UC, identify potential predictors of disease severity, response to therapy, and novel therapeutic targets.

### Ulcerative colitis [^115rx7J1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology affecting the colon and rectum. Multiple factors, such as genetic background, environmental and luminal factors, and mucosal immune dysregulation, have been suggested to contribute to UC pathogenesis. UC has evolved into a global burden given its high incidence in developed countries and the substantial increase in incidence in developing countries. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying UC has led to the emergence of new treatments. Since the early 2000s, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment has significantly improved treatment outcomes. Advances in medical treatments have enabled a paradigm shift in treatment goals from symptomatic relief to endoscopic and histological healing to achieve better long-term outcomes and, consequently, diagnostic modalities have also been improved to monitor disease activity more tightly. Despite these improvements in patient care, a substantial proportion of patients, for example, those who are refractory to medical treatment or those who develop colitis-associated colorectal dysplasia or cancer, still require restorative proctocolectomy. The development of novel drugs and improvement of the treatment strategy by implementing personalized medicine are warranted to achieve optimal disease control. However, delineating the aetiology of UC is necessary to ultimately achieve disease cure.

### Mechanisms of disease: pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^1153aU5U]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are idiopathic, chronic, relapsing, inflammatory conditions that are immunologically mediated. Although their exact etiologies remain uncertain, results from research in animal models, human genetics, basic science and clinical trials have provided important new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated, intestinal inflammation. These studies indicate that Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are heterogeneous diseases characterized by various genetic abnormalities that lead to overly aggressive T-cell responses to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria. The onset and reactivation of disease are triggered by environmental factors that transiently break the mucosal barrier, stimulate immune responses or alter the balance between beneficial and pathogenic enteric bacteria. Different genetic abnormalities can lead to similar disease phenotypes; these genetic changes can be broadly characterized as causing defects in mucosal barrier function, immunoregulation or bacterial clearance. These new insights will help develop better diagnostic approaches that identify clinically important subsets of patients for whom the natural history of disease and response to treatment are predictable.

### Ulcerative colitis [^115LJQc9]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the colon, and its incidence is rising worldwide. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, epithelial barrier defects, dysregulated immune responses, and environmental factors. Patients with ulcerative colitis have mucosal inflammation starting in the rectum that can extend continuously to proximal segments of the colon. Ulcerative colitis usually presents with bloody diarrhoea and is diagnosed by colonoscopy and histological findings. The aim of management is to induce and then maintain remission, defined as resolution of symptoms and endoscopic healing. Treatments for ulcerative colitis include 5-aminosalicylic acid drugs, steroids, and immunosuppressants. Some patients can require colectomy for medically refractory disease or to treat colonic neoplasia. The therapeutic armamentarium for ulcerative colitis is expanding, and the number of drugs with new targets will rapidly increase in coming years.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^111hELJs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing and remitting gastrointestinal disorder of uncertain aetiology. The last two decades have seen an expansion in the therapeutic arsenal used to treat UC. This has resulted in improved clinical remission and response rates. Nonetheless, staples in our current medical management originate from trials conducted in the early 20th century. In this review article, we aim to outline the key milestones in the history of the medical management of UC in addition to highlighting promising therapeutic developments for the future.

### Acute severe ulcerative colitis: from pathophysiology to clinical management [^111MGXTz]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum, resulting from a dysregulated immune response towards intraluminal antigens in a genetically predisposed host. The disease has a varying extent and severity. Approximately 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis experience a severe flare during the course of their disease, requiring hospitalization. Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is potentially a life-threatening condition that requires early recognition, hospitalization, correction of body fluids and electrolytes, and nutritional support if needed. Superimposed bacterial or viral infections need to be excluded and thromboprophylaxis should be started. Intravenous corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for this condition. Rescue treatment with ciclosporin or infliximab is indicated in patients who do not sufficiently respond to corticosteroids after 3–5 days, with close monitoring of the patients' symptoms, serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels. If medical therapy fails, timely colectomy should be performed to prevent critical complications. In this article, we review all relevant aspects of ASUC, from its pathophysiological background to modern management in clinical practice.

### Ulcerative colitis in adults: a review [^114mqsro]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ulcerative colitis:

- **Definition**: UC is a chronic relapsing-remitting IBD characterized by superficial mucosal ulceration extending from the rectum to proximal colon.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of UC is multifactorial and involves mutations in susceptibility genes, abnormalities in gut microbiota composition and host-microbiome interactions, as well as abnormalities in humoral and cellular adaptive immunity.
- **Epidemiology**: The highest incidence and prevalence of IBD are seen in the populations of Northern Europe and North America and the lowest in continental Asia. In the US, the incidence of UC is estimated at 8.8 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the prevalence is estimated at 286.3 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: Inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa may result in clinical manifestations of proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left-sided colitis, pancolitis, severe rectal bleeding, toxic megacolon, and CRC, in addition to extraintestinal complications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Over 10-years, 50–55% of patients remit, approximately 37% follow a chronic intermittent course, and 6% develop a chronic continuous course. An estimated 20–30% of patients require colectomy after 25 years of disease activity. The standardized mortality ratio of patients with UC, as compared with the general population, is estimated at 2.78 (95% CI, 1.48–4.75).

### Recent understanding of IBD pathogenesis: implications for future therapies [^116nxf5d]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are comprised of two major phenotypes, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Research over the last couple of years has led to great advances in understanding the inflammatory bowel diseases and their underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. From the current understanding, it is likely that chronic inflammation in IBD is due to aggressive cellular immune responses to a subset of luminal bacteria. Susceptibility to disease is thereby determined by genes encoding immune responses which are triggered by environmental stimuli. Based on extensive research over the last decade, there are several new and novel pathways and specific targets on which to focus new therapeutics. The following review summarizes the current view on the four basic tenets of the pathophysiological basis of IBD and its implications for therapies of IBD: genetics, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction and the role of the microbial flora.

### Pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease: an overview [^1152JieK]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis are considered idiopathic diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract. These two diseases are often considered together because of multiple similarities, including gastrointestinal inflammation, waxing and waning severity and symptoms, and unknown etiology. However, they have separate symptoms and microscopic characteristics as well as patterns within the gastrointestinal tract.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: recent developments [^116givFF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis, or just IBD?

The continuum of IBD has traditionally been separated into Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with patients lying between being referred to as IBD unclassified. Features typifying Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis are largely related to disease location, and to a lesser extent histological appearances. Increasingly, the divide is arbitrary, with significant overlap in everything from therapies to genetic risk loci to disease location. Whether this is a paediatric phenomenon or not, the descriptive term IBD, better captures all disease phenotypes. This has the potential to drive management towards a risk stratification approach considering disease severity, disease location, disease behaviour, response to initial treatment and additional phenotypic factors such as concurrent illnesses. In the future, a personalised molecular diagnosis will help inform a more precise diagnosis for individuals, with the ability to produce a personalised prognosis and treatment.

### Immunopathogenesis of IBD: current state of the art [^1116aE6j]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

IBD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract encompassing two main clinical entities: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Although Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have historically been studied together because they share common features (such as symptoms, structural damage and therapy), it is now clear that they represent two distinct pathophysiological entities. Both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with multiple pathogenic factors including environmental changes, an array of susceptibility gene variants, a qualitatively and quantitatively abnormal gut microbiota and a broadly dysregulated immune response. In spite of this realization and the identification of seemingly pertinent environmental, genetic, microbial and immune factors, a full understanding of IBD pathogenesis is still out of reach and, consequently, treatment is far from optimal. An important reason for this unsatisfactory situation is the currently limited comprehension of what are the truly relevant components of IBD immunopathogenesis. This article will comprehensively review current knowledge of the classic immune components and will expand the concept of IBD immunopathogenesis to include various cells, mediators and pathways that have not been traditionally associated with disease mechanisms, but that profoundly affect the overall intestinal inflammatory process.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^112XNgW3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting and potentially progressive form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of uncertain aetiology, characterised by inflammation localised in the mucosa of the rectum and colon. A number of aetiological factors, such as genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, perturbations in the gut microbiome and immune dysregulation, have been implicated. The term 'ulcerative colitis' was first coined by Sir Samuel Wilks in 1859, distinguishing it as a separate entity from infectious diarrhoeal illnesses, a condition that would, in fact, be called Crohn's disease today. Until the realisation that corticosteroid therapy induced remission, surgery was the mainstay of management. There has been an evolution in therapies since the 1950s, and conventional management evolved into the use of broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs, such as amino-salicylates and corticosteroids, or immunomodulators, such as thiopurines, often sequentially with the aim of relieving symptoms and achieving remission to prevent long-term complications.

Unprecedented advances in the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of IBD in the last 2–3 decades have translated into a dramatic increase in our therapeutic armamentarium with biological and 'small molecule' therapies intercepting and abrogating the immune-inflammatory cascade. Consequently, we have seen clinical response and remission rates that have emboldened our definitions of meaningful disease control. In this paper, we undertake a journey in the pharmacological therapy of UC from corticosteroids to modern biological, small molecule and other novel therapies.

### Ulcerative colitis: making the diagnosis [^116t61Ay]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory condition of the colon. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is based on clinical presentation, endoscopic evaluation, and histologic parameters in the absence of demonstrable alternate etiology. The differential diagnosis remains broad, and infection in particular must be considered and excluded. Although laboratory and radiographic findings can aid in the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, endoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. A correct diagnosis and disease staging are imperative because these factors affect treatment options and prognosis.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113FB1Tu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### Update on the etiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis of ulcerative colitis [^113YgwwA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Medium credibility.

Evidence is accumulating that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to ulcerative colitis. The most consistent genetic associations have been shown for the MHC locus HLA Class II alleles, but the interleukin-1 family of genes and the multidrug resistance gene MDR1 have also been implicated as genetic susceptibility factors for the development of disease. In addition, there is a relationship between ulcerative colitis and bacterial flora, with an increased number of adherent Bacteroides spp. and Enterobacteriaceae spp. present in inflamed bowel segments. Conversely, cigarette smoking and appendectomy have both been shown to protect against the development of ulcerative colitis. Despite our improved understanding of the genetics and inflammatory mechanisms that underpin this disease, however, the etiology and pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis remain undefined. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is being aided by recent advances in diagnostic strategies, including the detection of fecal and serologic markers and the use of wireless capsule endoscopy, but, in the absence of a pathognomonic marker, the definition of this disease remains based on well-established clinical, endoscopic and histologic criteria. In particular, it is difficult to discriminate ulcerative colitis from other forms of colitis, including Crohn's disease, and there seems to be a growing overlap of pathophysiologic processes between ulcerative colitis and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome. Patients who remain indeterminate between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease also continue to be a diagnostic challenge.

### How does genotype influence disease phenotype in inflammatory bowel disease? [^115coMmN]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic immunologically mediated diseases of the gut. Advances in genetics have revolutionized our understanding of the pathogenesis of these conditions with 163 risk loci identified, encompassing a variety of immunologic functions. There is substantial heterogeneity in the natural history of these diseases with respect to disease onset, course, and progression to complications. There are also significant variations in response to therapies and susceptibility to therapy-related and disease-related complications. An important need in the field is to identify predictors of disease course, complications, and likelihood of response and adverse events to allow for targeted therapeutic decision making. The genotype of an individual in constant and non-modifiable, and thus could potentially fulfill the role of important predictors of these outcomes. In this review, we discuss the existing literature on the prediction of various disease phenotypes in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis using underlying genotype. We also identify gaps in the literature and suggest future directions for research. There is need for large, multi-institutional, and international collaborative consortia with efficient and detailed cohort accrual, phenotypic definition, genotyping, and dynamic assessments of external (e.g., diet) and internal (microbiome) environment to allow us to progress toward personalized and precision medicine in the management of these complex diseases.

### Ulcerative colitis care pathway [^112uueFa]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis care pathway — risk stratification and remission targets emphasize that the standard assessment of ulcerative colitis (UC) activity at a single time point is insufficient and that disease risk is important; patients with mild or moderate symptoms but deep ulcers on colonoscopy should receive immunomodulatory and/or biologic therapy, treatment success is defined as steroid-free clinical remission, and clinical remission remains the primary therapeutic goal.

### Overview to challenges in IBD 2024–2029 [^1128DK5i]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The mission of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation is to cure Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis and to improve the quality of lives of patients living with these diseases-in other words, to care and cure. To achieve these missions, there is a need to identify and prioritize research gaps and approaches to address these gaps, which is the aim of Challenges in IBD 2024. The Foundation convened close to 80 experts in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including researchers, clinicians, patients and caregivers, funders, industry representatives, and Foundation scientific staff and organized them into 5 workgroups, one for each of the 5 Challenges topics: Preclinical Human IBD Mechanisms, Environmental Triggers, Precision Medicine, Novel Technologies, and Pragmatic Clinical Research. The findings of these groups outline a research agenda that intends to change the research paradigm in IBD by introducing 2 concepts in the course of IBD that warrant specific focus: interception (during the preclinical phase) and restoration of normal physiology after remission is achieved. We hope these reviews will stimulate innovations in our understanding and management of IBD.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### Mechanisms regulating intestinal barrier integrity and its pathological implications [^111hbyDa]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease and ulcerative colitis

IBD is a group of conditions in which patients have severe inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract –. It is a chronic condition that affects one out of 250 people in the European population as well as a significant population of people of other ethnic origins, and it has an unknown etiology, poor prognosis, and lifelong morbidity in patients. There are two major classifications of IBD: ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). In UC, the inflammation is restricted to the rectum and the colon and never affects the small intestine; in contrast, in CD, there can be severe inflammation in any part of the intestine, including the small intestine and the large intestine. The mechanism and etiology of disease progression are entirely different for these two types of IBD. Genetic predisposition to the disease is observed widely; in most cases, patients have at least one or more members in the family with the disease. Although the exact cause and mechanism of both types of IBD are yet to be completely understood, environmental or autoimmune-related factors are major causative factors. The dysregulation of the mucosal immune response is also thought to be primarily responsible for disease progression.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^111NdPeT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — key concept statements indicate that there are no validated therapeutic biomarkers or companion diagnostic tests to enhance selection or predict response to treatment for the patient with active ulcerative colitis (UC); patients with UC should have available all medical options as recommended by their doctor and healthcare team, and third-party payers and requirements for step therapy should not come between the patient and their healthcare team in making decisions about treatment for UC; patients with moderately to severely active UC have higher rates of response and remission with their first therapies than after failure of one or more other advanced therapies; given the expanding number of therapies per mechanistic class, a distinction between primary nonresponse and secondary nonresponse is important to select the next therapeutic option; post hoc subgroup analyses and network meta-analyses provide hypothesis-generating data but are not sufficient to stratify therapies for individual patients; infliximab is the preferred anti-TNF therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC; some patients with moderately to severely active UC who are at higher risk for infectious complications may benefit from vedolizumab or an anti-IL-23 strategy over more systemically immunosuppressed medical options; and initial and subsequent therapies for moderately to severely active UC may be chosen based on extraintestinal manifestations, including the involvement of joints or skin, in which therapies having efficacy for both UC and the extraintestinal organ is known.

### IBD across the age spectrum: is it the same disease? [^113bzGz2]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

IBD is a chronic disorder with disease onset ranging from early childhood to beyond the sixth decade of life. The factors that determine the age of onset currently remain unexplained. Is timing of occurrence a random event or is it indicative of different pathophysiological pathways leading to different phenotypes across the age spectrum? Over the past decade, several studies have suggested that the characteristics and natural history of IBD seem to be different according to age of onset. This heterogeneity suggests that the respective contributions of genetics, host immune system and environment to the aetiology and phenotype of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are different across ages. Critical reviews that focus on differences characterizing IBD between age groups are scarce. Therefore, this Review updates the knowledge of the differences in epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and natural history of paediatric, adult and elderly-onset IBD. In addition, potential differences in host-gene-microbial interactions according to age are highlighted.

### Inflammatory bowel disease presentation and diagnosis [^111xj5sd]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

A full understanding of the presentation and work-up of inflammatory bowel disease is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment of this complex disease. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share many common clinical features but are treated very differently. This article covers the factors which contribute to IBD pathogenesis and presentation as well as the methods of diagnosis and work-up to ensure that the appropriate diagnosis is reached. This article also serves as a basis of understanding for the more complex aspects of the disease to be discussed in subsequent articles.

### A review of the therapeutic management of ulcerative colitis [^116K3ahp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The history of UC is flagged by several clinical trials that underpin and influence our current clinical practice (Figure 1). The biological era is considered the fulcrum that is propelling current and anticipated developments in the field. Given the associated drawbacks with immunosuppressive therapies, additional treatment options are being explored and progressing to clinical trials. With this in mind, we anticipate the therapeutic landscape and current treatment paradigms to undergo marked transformation over the proceeding decade.

### Unravelling the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease [^1159xP7X]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Recently, substantial advances in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been made owing to three related lines of investigation. First, IBD has been found to be the most tractable of complex disorders for discovering susceptibility genes, and these have shown the importance of epithelial barrier function, and innate and adaptive immunity in disease pathogenesis. Second, efforts directed towards the identification of environmental factors implicate commensal bacteria (or their products), rather than conventional pathogens, as drivers of dysregulated immunity and IBD. Third, murine models, which exhibit many of the features of ulcerative colitis and seem to be bacteria-driven, have helped unravel the pathogenesis/mucosal immunopathology of IBD.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^112qSrhf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1133EkY5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — goals for managing patients — UC is a chronic condition for which therapy is required to induce and maintain remission; therapeutic decisions should be categorized into those for (i) induction and (ii) maintenance, and strategies for management of UC should reflect the patient's and provider's goals and recognize the chronic nature of the disease. Symptomatic remission relates to improvement in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) while endoscopic mucosal healing is defined as restoration of intact mucosa without friability; deep remission implies both symptomatic and endoscopic remission and should be assessed as a preferred goal of management, and corticosteroid-free remission is defined based on symptomatic and endoscopic response during a steroid-free period of time (usually more than 12 wk). Initial treatment of UC should focus on restoration of normal bowel frequency and control of the primary symptoms of bleeding and bowel urgency; an endoscopically healed mucosa is associated with sustained remission and reduced risk of colectomy. Histologic remission is associated with some improved clinical outcomes but has not yet been validated prospectively as a preferred target for treatment, and control of mucosal inflammation may reduce dysplasia risk. Given the chronic nature of UC and the therapies for UC, monitoring for disease-related and drug-related complications is important, routine visits are recommended to monitor for relapse and address health maintenance needs, and patients with UC should be screened for coexistent anxiety and depressive disorders with resources provided when identified.

### Ulcerative colitis [^113AR4r4]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the rectum and colon. Results from many studies in people and animals of intestinal inflammation suggest that ulcerative colitis results from environmental factors triggering a loss of tolerance for normal intestinal flora in genetically susceptible individuals. Although progress has been made in the overall management of the disease, no innovative treatment has been developed. By contrast with Crohn's disease, there are few clinical data on biological agents. Probiotics seem the most promising of several experimental and traditional agents that have been investigated in controlled clinical trials.

### A summary of the BRIDGe summit on damage-related progression of ulcerative colitis: establishing research priorities [^112K5oM5]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Define Phenotypes of Ulcerative Colitis Progression

Behavior of UC is noticeably absent from the Montreal UC classification, suggesting there is a lack of predictability to the way the disease might progress or regress over time. Yet population studies suggest there are multiple phenotypes of disease, and it is possible that, with improved understanding, patients may be classified with progressive vs nonprogressive UC. There may also be subcategories of these phenotypes, such as early vs late progression, or subphenotypes categorized by different components of progression.

Expert consensus will be required to assign bounding parameters for each phenotype, as well as meaningful clinical outcomes associated with them, so that patients could be categorized and classified according to the different disease behaviors.

### Cross talk between gut microbiota and intestinal mucosal immunity in the development of ulcerative colitis [^115gYEAJ]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC), a nonspecific inflammatory disease, is characterized by inflammation and mucosal damage in the colon, and its prevalence in the world is increasing. Nevertheless, the exact pathogenesis of UC is still unclear. Accumulating data have suggested that its pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, environmental factors, microbial dysbiosis, and dysregulated immune responses. Generally, UC is aroused by inappropriate immune activation based on the interaction of host and intestinal microbiota. The relationship between microbiota and host immune system in the pathogenesis of UC is complicated. However, increasing evidence indicates that the shift of microbiota composition can substantially influence intestinal immunity. In this review, we primarily focus on the delicate balance between microbiota and gut mucosal immunity during UC progression.

### Fibrosis in ulcerative colitis: mechanisms, features, and consequences of a neglected problem [^112DrtAv]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic intestinal inflammation and impaired tissue repair leading to intestinal fibrosis are a commonly observed complication in inflammatory bowel disease. This is particularly true for small bowel Crohn's disease. However, the development of fibrosis in ulcerative colitis has remained largely unexplored. This is surprising, given knowledge about its prevalence for decades, well described histopathologic features of fibrotic and stricturing ulcerative colitis, the relevance of the extracellular matrix for intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, and the clinical impact of fibrosis on stricture formation, motility, and the necessary discrimination from colonic malignancy. This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge of ulcerative colitis-related fibrosis, including epidemiology, basic mechanisms, histopathology, and clinical implications.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114qKA77]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis presentation and disease course — common initial symptoms, age pattern, activity pattern, and complications are summarized. The initial presentation of new UC is usually characterized by symptoms of an inflamed rectum that include bleeding, urgency, and tenesmus, and the condition may present at any time and at all ages with a predominant onset that peaks in the third decade of life. The pattern of inflammatory disease activity is most often relapsing and remitting with alternating active symptoms and clinical quiescence, although some patients have persistent disease activity despite available medical therapy and a small number present with rapid progressive unresponsive fulminant colitis. UC causes significant morbidity but has a low incidence of mortality, and patients with active disease are more likely to have comorbid anxiety and depression and to have impaired social interactions or decreased performance; longstanding UC is associated with a defined risk of dysplasia and colorectal cancer.

### The influence of cytokines on the complex pathology of ulcerative colitis [^113H42Eo]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) specifically affects the colon and rectum through multifactorial mechanisms associated with genetic alterations, environmental factors, microbiota, and mucosal immune dysregulation. In patients with corticosteroid-refractory UC, current therapies primarily employ antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-α, α4β7 integrin, and interleukin (IL)-12/23 p40; and a small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor. Despite these revolutionary molecular targeting therapies introduced during the last two decades, 30%-55% of patients fail to respond such molecular targeting agents in the induction phase, requiring changes in treatment. Here we review basic and clinical research aimed to address this problem, focusing on the pathogenic effects of cytokines produced by innate and adaptive immune cells. For example, IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, T helper (Th) 1-, Th2-, and Th17-associated cytokines are expressed at relatively higher levels in the intestinal tissues of patients with UC. However, their expression levels depend on disease stage and patient characteristics. The complex pathology of UC may induce differences in responses to therapy. The findings of such studies strongly support the argument that future targeted therapies must focus on differences in cytokine levels associated with the stages of UC as well as on the distinct cytokine expression profiles of individual patients.

### Intestinal barrier dysfunction in inflammatory bowel disease: pathophysiology to precision therapeutics [^115innex]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation and disruptions in the intestinal barrier, commonly referred to as "intestinal barrier dysfunction". This phenomenon involves increased intestinal permeability, enabling bacterial toxins, antigens, and other harmful substances to cross the epithelial barrier, exacerbating inflammation and contributing to systemic complications. The underlying mechanisms of intestinal barrier dysfunction in IBD are multifactorial, encompassing genetic predispositions, immune dysregulation, epithelial tight junction protein alterations, and gut microbiota imbalances. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of barrier dysfunction and its role in driving IBD pathogenesis, influencing disease severity, and contributing to extraintestinal complications. We examine current and emerging diagnostic biomarkers such as zonulin, fecal calprotectin, and microbial signatures, while outlining persistent challenges in their standardization and translation into clinical practice. Therapeutic strategies targeting gut barrier restoration spanning anti-inflammatory agents, dietary modifications, and novel microbiota-targeted therapies are critically discussed. The key gaps, particularly whether barrier dysfunction is a primary cause or a secondary consequence of IBD, lack of standardized clinically validated biomarkers, and limited translational efficiency into therapeutic applications, are also discussed. Addressing these gaps by integrating multidisciplinary research and adoption of advanced analytical technologies can pave way for personalized treatments, improving patient outcomes and mitigating the disease burden.

INTRODUCTION

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are multifactorial, chronic, relapsing, immune-mediated conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Although the clinical classification of these conditions is limited to these 2 primary forms, IBD is complex in etiology, clinical presentation, and therapeutic responsiveness. Complexity of this disease is due to the pathologic manifestation of a diverse series of triggers including genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, and the gut microbiota. Specific triggers of CD and UC involve a combination of immune- and nonimmune-mediated factors including chemokines, cytokines, and inflammasomes playing a role in the development of these conditions. It is not fully understood which of these factors are the initiators of inflammation and which are compounders; however, as a disorder of immune-dysregulation, there is an accepted recognition of the role of the innate immune system to initiate inflammation, followed by the adaptive immune system to maintain this inflammation, resulting in disease progression. The first line of defense against pathogenic infection as a potential etiology and many other aspects of the innate and adaptive immune responses are unbalancedand lead to a chronic inflammatory state, resulting in the damage observed in both CD and UC. This article is a review of JAK pathway pathophysiology and how the newly available agents in this drug class offer a new target for the treatment of IBD.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1117JQCQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.

### The dual role of Escherichia coli in the course of ulcerative colitis [^115bt2MD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic non-specific inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation that is limited to the mucosa of the colon and rectum. The characteristic symptoms of UC are bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Clinically, the course of UC commonly consists of periods of exacerbated inflammations and remissions. Disease activity is determined on the basis of medical history and endoscopic changes in the colon. Genetic predisposition, disorders of the immune system, environmental factors, and the intestinal microbiota are the primary factors contributing to the etiology of UC. Currently, the intestinal microbiota is considered to play an important role in UC pathogenesis. E. coli has been specifically highlighted for its role in the propagation and maintenance of chronic inflammation in UC. The biology of E. coli suggests that it may play a double role and show the ability both to increase or decrease gut inflammation. For example, high levels of E. coli gut colonization are correlated with high concentrations of its lipopolysaccharide, which activates the host immune system. However, E. coli also has features that can promote the resolution of intestinal inflammation.

### Bowel urgency in ulcerative colitis: current perspectives and future directions [^117NijFg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Bowel urgency (BU), the sudden or immediate need for a bowel movement, is one of the most common and disruptive symptoms experienced by patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Distinct from the separate symptom of increased stool frequency, BU has a substantial negative impact on quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Among patients with UC, BU is one of the top reasons for treatment dissatisfaction and one of the symptoms patients most want improved. Patients may not discuss BU often due to embarrassment, and healthcare providers may not address the symptom adequately due to the lack of awareness of validated tools and/or knowledge of the importance of assessing BU. The mechanism of BU in UC is multifactorial and includes inflammatory changes in the rectum that may be linked to hypersensitivity and reduced compliance of the rectum. Responsive and reliable patient-reported outcome measures of BU are needed to provide evidence of treatment benefits in clinical trials and facilitate communication in clinical practice. This review discusses the pathophysiology and clinical importance of BU in UC and its impact on the quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Patient-reported outcome measures developed to assess the severity of BU in UC are discussed alongside overviews of treatment options and clinical guidelines. Implications for the future management of UC from the perspective of BU are also explored.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, of which ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the 2 most prevailing entities. Very early onset IBD (VEO-IBD) children diagnosed with IBD under age 6 years. Although the etiology of IBD is mostly unknown, it involves a complex interaction among host genetics, microbiota, environmental factors, and aberrant immune responses. Advances in the understanding of the genetic contribution, which appears to be much more significant in younger children, gives us a useful insight into the pathogenesis and potential future therapeutic targets in IBD.

### Systematic review of metabolomic alterations in ulcerative colitis: unveiling key metabolic signatures and pathways [^116MzFEC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

While there have been several systematic reviews published on UC metabolomics, most have concentrated on specific aspects such as particular sample types, metabolite classes, or patient groups. – Only a handful of these reviews have aimed to provide a broader overview of metabolomic studies in UC, with the most recent data extending up to October 2022. – These studies have offered valuable insights into the metabolomic profiles associated with UC. Building on these foundational works, our study extends this knowledge base with several distinct advantages. First, our analysis is more comprehensive, covering a broader spectrum of studies up to 28 December 2022. This allows for a more current understanding of the metabolomic landscape in UC, ensuring that our insights are grounded in the latest research. Second, unlike previous reviews which may have focused on specific sample types or metabolite classes, our review encompasses all study types, metabolite categories, and patient groups. This inclusive approach has enabled us to identify and analyze a wider range of differential metabolites, providing a more holistic view of the metabolic alterations in UC. Third, our systematic review goes beyond merely listing differential metabolites by also examining their frequency of occurrence and trends across multiple datasets and sample types. This comprehensive analysis has revealed core metabolites consistently associated with UC, enhancing our understanding of the disease's metabolic signature. Finally, our in-depth metabolic pathway analysis, facilitated by advanced tools like MetaboAnalyst, has allowed us to identify key disrupted pathways across various sample types, shedding light on the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of UC. These strengths highlight the unique contributions of our systematic review to the existing literature, providing valuable insights for future research and potential clinical applications in UC.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical efficacy of ADS051, a neutrophil modulator, in ulcerative colitis: results of a randomized phase 1b trial [^111iJ2CF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Inflammatory bowel diseases include ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic, idiopathic, inflammatory disease that targets the colon, and Crohn's disease. Inflammation in UC is limited to the colonic mucosa, where the presentation can vary from mild erythema and friability to frank ulceration. In UC, pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammation are complex, with unclear etiology; however, genetic susceptibility, intestinal mucosal barrier function, abnormal immunoregulation, environmental factors, and microbiota are all believed to be involved. A leading hypothesis of UC pathogenesis suggests that gut inflammation results from a malfunction of the host's mucosal immunity and its interaction with enteric microflora in genetically susceptible individuals (,–). The breakdown of this balance may result in the transepithelial migration of neutrophils into the colonic mucosa and the release of cytokines/chemokines and tissue-damaging agents on their activation. Interaction of activated neutrophils with other immune cells amplifies inflammation and furthers epithelial damage, ultimately leading to compromised gut barrier integrity. Consequently, the involvement of multiple factors makes it difficult to develop targeted therapies.

### Microscopic colitis: clinical and pathologic perspectives [^113FGxwW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic nonbloody diarrhea and specific histopathology features. Active disease, defined as 3 or more stools or 1 or more watery stools per day, significantly reduces quality of life. Epidemiologic studies have found the incidence and prevalence of microscopic colitis to be comparable with those of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Nevertheless, microscopic colitis is still under-recognized in clinical practice-most health care workers know little about its etiology and pathophysiology. Furthermore, there are many challenges to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. We review the epidemiologic and clinical features of this disorder and discuss its pathogenesis. We also outline the criteria for histopathologic evaluation of microscopic colitis, recently published by the European Consensus on Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and discuss a treatment algorithm created by the European Microscopic Colitis Group. Treatment options for patients with budesonide-refractory disease are discussed.

### Colorectal neoplasia in ulcerative colitis-recent advances [^114Hjsye]. Histopathology (2001). Low credibility.

It is recognized that ulcerative colitis (UC) predisposes to the development of colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), and the molecular pathway for this process differs from that for sporadic CRCs. However, several important details regarding the risk factors for and the molecular changes underlying UC-related colorectal carcinogenesis have only come to light lately. First, recent data suggest environmental factors related to long-standing inflammation contribute more to this increased cancer risk than an inherited susceptibility. Second, molecular changes that may represent the first steps in the development of neoplasia are being increasingly identified in non-dysplastic, colitic mucosa. Third, there is now good evidence suggesting that UC-related CRC may develop along more than one molecular pathway. These emerging data will hopefully contribute to attempts to prevent the development of UC-related CRC, e.g. through refining surveillance programmes. Details of the molecular heterogeneity of UC-related dysplasia and CRC may also help develop reliable tools for diagnosing the former and for predicting the behaviour of the latter. Finally, there is increasing awareness of non-epithelial colorectal malignancies which are associated with UC and may potentially increase in incidence with changes in the medical management of this inflammatory disease.

### Advances in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: linking host genetics and the microbiome [^115xPbDN]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Studies of the genetics underlying inflammatory bowel diseases have increased our understanding of the pathways involved in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and focused attention on the role of the microbiome in these diseases. Full understanding of pathogenesis will require a comprehensive grasp of the delicate homeostasis between gut bacteria and the human host. In this review, we present current evidence of microbiome-gene interactions in the context of other known risk factors and mechanisms, and describe the next steps necessary to pair genetic variant and microbiome sequencing data from patient cohorts. We discuss the concept of dysbiosis, proposing that the functional composition of the gut microbiome may provide a more consistent definition of dysbiosis and may more readily provide evidence of genome-microbiome interactions in future exploratory studies.

### Fecal transplantation for ulcerative colitis: current evidence and future applications [^1141vX75]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Established evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a role in ulcerative colitis (UC). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is clearly recognized as a highly effective treatment for patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and has been investigated also in patients with UC, with promising results. Areas covered: Literature review was performed to select publications concerning current evidence on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of UC, and on the effectiveness of FMT in this disorder. Expert opinion: The randomized controlled trials published investigating the use of FMT suggested a potential role for FMT in the treatment of mild to moderate UC. However, given several unanswered questions regarding donor selection, dose, route of administration and duration of therapy, this is not yet recommended as a viable therapy option. FMT has allowed for more in depth investigation with regards to the role the gut microbiota may be playing in UC. This knowledge is critical to identifying where FMT may appropriately fit in the UC treatment paradigm. As our understanding of the role the microbiome plays in this chronic disease, FMT, and then eventually defined microbes, will hopefully serve in a complementary role to conventional IBD therapies.

### Pathogenesis and precision medicine for predicting response in inflammatory bowel disease: advances and future directions [^114L2d5L]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic, relapsing, immune-mediated disorders including both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The prevalence of IBD is increasing worldwide. Analyses from the Global Burden of Disease Study across 195 countries over a 27-year period reported an estimated 6.8 million cases of IBD globally with an increase in age-standardised prevalence from 79.5 (75.9–83.5) per 100 000 in 1990 to 84.3 (79.2–89.9) per 100 000 people in 2017. The health economic consequences of this are substantial. In Europe, the mean annual healthcare costs for prevalent CD and UC were US$12 439 and US$7224, respectively. In North America, these values increased to mean annual healthcare costs of $17 495 for CD and $13 559 for UC. The primary driver of these annual costs appeared to be related to greater access to advanced medical therapies, highlighting the future benefit of rational, tailored drug selection for each patient.

### A scoping review on early inflammatory bowel disease: definitions, pathogenesis, and impact on clinical outcomes [^112Ct1tM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), result from the dysregulated crosstalk between commensal microflora and the mucosal-associated immune system, in patients with a genetic predisposition and environmental exposure to risk factors. CD and UC pathogenesis are believed to have different yet interrelated immunological phases. From a pathophysiological point of view, several cytokines have been reported to be differentially expressed in distinct disease phases; particular attention shall be devoted to interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-17 during early and late stages, respectively. IBD-related inflammation may go unnoticed for prolonged periods delaying clinical presentation. Therefore, at the time of diagnosis, disease may be advanced, both immunologically and phenotypically.CD diagnosis is often delayed 5–9 months due to the variability of the initial manifestations, as opposed to UC, which is usually diagnosed earlier, due to the consistent and alarming initial symptoms and manifestations.

Recognizing early disease as a clinically distinct entity may change the objectives of the treatment strategy and impact clinical outcomes, as it has been suggested for rheumatoid arthritis. The relevance of the transition from early to late disease in the management of IBD relies on the association of these states with disease phenotype, extension, severity, and prognosis. In fact, IBD progressively induced damage results from a continued phenomenon. Early CD phases have been reported to be more dependent on the breakdown of epithelial barrier function and on the impairment of innate immunity, triggering subacute inflammation. The subsequent compromise of bacterial clearance and the dysregulated adaptive immune responses perpetuate the inflammation state. The interest on UC early phases is more recent and, as in CD, innate immunity is also a key player. It has been described that early intervention with biologics may slow disease progression and improve long-term outcomes in IBD, reducing irreversible damage. This supports the existence of a 'window opportunity' for intervention, before severe inflammation and bowel damage become established.

In this scoping review, we aimed to analyze the evidence regarding early CD and UC definition and the immunological mechanisms associated with early disease stages, as well as to summarize the available information on the impact of prompt treatment on prognosis, including its strengths and limitations.

### Differential efficacy of medical therapies for ulcerative colitis according to disease extent: patient-level analysis from multiple randomized controlled trials [^1125T4TQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) phenotypically is sub classified into ulcerative proctitis (E1-limited to rectum), left-sided (E2) and extensive colitis (E3). According to pooled analysis of 17 population based cohort studies, approximately 40% of patients with UC have left-sided colitis, 30% have extensive colitisand 30% have proctitis at diagnosis. Furthermore, 20% of patients with left-sided colitis at diagnosis will progress to extensive colitis over the subsequent 10 years of their disease course. Left-sided colitis and extensive colitis differ not only in the extent of disease distribution, but also in terms of long-term prognosis. Several observational studies have reported a higher risk of colectomy in patients with extensive colitis compared to left-sided colitis. Similarly long-term follow-up studies demonstrated that the risk of colorectal cancer was higher in patient with extensive colitis compared to left-sided colitis. In addition, differential gene expression profiles have been reported between patients with extensive colitis versus left-sided colitis, suggesting differences in inflammatory process between these phenotypes. Allelic variations of genes such as the multi drug resistance (MDR) gene were shown to be associated with extensive colitis indicating genetic differences might exist between these two clinical phenotypes. There may also be differential patterns of healing in the colon after medical therapy, based on the concept that the colon heals from right to left. Furthermore, it is plausible that symptom burden may also differ; for example, symptoms such as tenesmus and urgency may be dominant in left-sided disease. Despite these differences in underlying pathophysiology and long-term prognosis, it is unclear whether there is a differential response to treatment according to disease distribution. In a study of 5-aminosalycilic acid (5-ASA), patients with extensive colitis had shorter time to relapse compared to left-sided colitis. However, studies evaluating the efficacy of advanced therapies according to different distribution are scarce. In a single center observational study, left-sided colitis was associated with superior clinical remission rates compared to extensive colitis after treatment with vedolizumab.

### Constipation in ulcerative colitis: pathophysiology and practical management [^112o9JCY]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical experience suggests that there is a cohort of patients with refractory colitis who do have faecal stasis that contributes to symptoms. The underlying physiology is poorly understood, partly because until recently the technology to examine segmental colonic motility has not existed. Patients are given little information on how proximal faecal stasis can complicate colitis. Treatment guidelines are scanty and many patients are offered little apart from laxatives and advice on increasing fibre intake, which often makes symptoms worse. This article aims to review the history, pathology and management, and create impetus for future research on this underappreciated condition.

### The role of diet in the aetiopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease [^115CDsv8]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as IBD, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the aetiopathogenesis of IBD is largely unknown, it is widely thought that diet has a crucial role in the development and progression of IBD. Indeed, epidemiological and genetic association studies have identified a number of promising dietary and genetic risk factors for IBD. These preliminary studies have led to major interest in investigating the complex interaction between diet, host genetics, the gut microbiota and immune function in the pathogenesis of IBD. In this Review, we discuss the recent epidemiological, gene-environment interaction, microbiome and animal studies that have explored the relationship between diet and the risk of IBD. In addition, we highlight the limitations of these prior studies, in part by explaining their contradictory findings, and review future directions.

### Alterations in the epithelial stem cell compartment could contribute to permanent changes in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis [^111rwiMB]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

In light of our results, key questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms driving these expression changes in UC-derived epithelium and their functional consequences. While these questions are beyond the scope of the present study, it is tempting to speculate that epigenetic changes may contribute to expression alterations of the UC epithelium. In particular, DNA methylation changes in the UC epithelium have been already linked to UC pathogenesis and its complications. Finally, we propose that lasting changes in the UC epithelium may translate into alterations in the absorptive and secretory functions, which could help perpetuate the disease over time.

### Food as treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases [^117KB4u3]. Infection and Immunity (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), namely, Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are lifelong and incurable chronic inflammatory diseases affecting 6.8 million people worldwide. By 2030, the prevalence of IBD is estimated to reach 1% of the population in Western countries, and thus there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies to reduce the burden of this disease. Microbiome dysbiosis is at the heart of the IBD pathophysiology, and current research and development efforts for IBD treatments have been focused on gut microbiome regulation. Diet can shape the intestinal microbiome. Diet is also preferred over medication, is safe, and has been proven to be an effective strategy for the management of IBD. Therefore, although often overlooked, dietary interventions targeting the microbiome represent ideal treatments for IBD. Here, I summarize the latest research on diet as a treatment for IBD from infancy to adulthood, compile evidence of the mechanisms of action behind diet as treatment, and, lastly, provide insights into future research focusing on culturally tailored diets for ethnic minority groups with increased incidence of IBD yet underrepresented in nutrition research.

### Myeloperoxidase enzyme activity in feces reflects endoscopic severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^113E47Eu]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures of myeloperoxidase activity were more closely associated with disease activity in ulcerative colitis patients, with less robust correlations in Crohn's disease. This is likely due to distinct pathophysiological differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The role of neutrophils in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is complex. Ulcerative colitis has stereotypically been defined as a neutrophil-dominated disease compared to Crohn's disease. In ulcerative colitis, active disease is associated with the presence of neutrophils in histological lesions and neutrophil-derived biomarkers. In comparison, one hypothesis of the cause of Crohn's disease is inadequate bacterial clearance by neutrophils, which then leads to an excessive adaptive immune response. Neutrophil dysfunction, or inadequate recruitment of neutrophils has been observed in Crohn's disease patients when compared to healthy controls or patients with ulcerative colitis.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^1117PcGs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) — key concepts include that UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of the ileum and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist. Categories of disease extent in UC consist of proctitis, left-sided colitis, or extensive colitis. If the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless there are other symptoms or findings to suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of CD rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity should be based on patient-reported outcomes, the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers of inflammation including fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS). Disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and periods of suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### IBD immunopathogenesis: a comprehensive review of inflammatory molecules [^113ahrCZ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Inflammatory molecules play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, both of which are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Abnormal expressions of pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules have been described to cause an imbalance to the gut innate and adaptive immunity, and recently a large portion of research in IBD has been geared towards identifying novel molecules that may be used as potential therapeutic targets. Understanding of these inflammatory molecules has suggested that although ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease share many common clinical symptoms and signs, they are in fact two separate clinical entities characterized by different immunopathogenesis. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the roles of numerous inflammatory molecules including but not limited to cytokines, chemokines, inflammasomes, microRNAs and neuropeptides and their expression status in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in relation to their effects on the overall intestinal inflammatory process.

### Efficacy and safety of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115REwQw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), a term that refers to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), represents increasing trends in incidence and burden over the past decade. IBD affects > 0.3% of the world population in the 21st century. In 2023, the global prevalence of ulcerative colitis was around 5 million cases, with increasing values.

UC is an idiopathic, immune-mediated chronic inflammation of the large intestine, causing diffuse friability, erosions, bleeding, and haustral loss in the colon. UC typically involves the rectum, extending proximally in a steady manner throughout a part of the colon. The classical presentation of UC includes urgency, fatigue, increased frequency of bowel movements, incontinence, mucus discharge, abdominal discomfort, and nocturnal defecations. According to the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS), moderate to severe UC is determined through an endoscopic score of 5–6 calculated by summing the sub-scores for vascular patterns (0–2), hemorrhage (0–3), and ulcers (0–3).

An imbalance between regulatory and effector T cells is an instrumental part of the pathophysiology of UC. Such an imbalance is a consequence of events disturbing the mucosal barrier and disrupting the healthy stability of the gut microbiota. When macrophages and dendritic cells are stimulated by antigens, they release IL-23. This cytokine has a role in inflammation, correlated with the dysregulated innate and adaptive immune response to the gut microbiota. IL-23 induces activation of memory T cells expressing IL-23 receptor, and increased levels of IL-23 have been observed in murine models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and confirmed in patients with UC.

The primary aim of UC management is to induce and maintain remission while preventing colectomy and colorectal cancer. Other treatment goals include the normalization of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal calprotectin, in addition to the prevention of disability, restoring quality of life, and normal growth in children. Current lines of treatment for moderate to severe UC are monoclonal antibodies to TNF-α and α4β7 integrins, as well as oral small-molecule therapies targeting Janus kinase or sphingosine-1-phosphate. Additionally, Ustekinumab has been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis in adult patients. Despite these options, colectomy is necessary for up to 15% of patients diagnosed with UC.

### Mechanistic investigation and the optimal dose based on baicalin in the treatment of ulcerative colitis – A preclinical systematic review and meta-analysis [^111spkEX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompasses both UC and Crohn's disease as its primary manifestations. Recognized globally due to its incrementally rising incidence, UC is characterized by spontaneous, chronic, and recurrent inflammation of the colon, presenting symptoms such as bloody stools and chronic pain. The etiology of UC remains elusive; however, current research indicates that a combination of mucosal barrier defects, genetic predisposition, and alterations in the intestinal microbiota may contribute to its pathogenesis. Traditional treatments for IBD have focused on managing the immune response via glucocorticosteroids, aminosalicylates, and immunosuppressants. A study demonstrated that 15% of patients experienced adverse effects following 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) treatment, with the primary adverse effects including exacerbation of ulcerative colitis (UC), diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Three classes of biologic agents have shown efficacy in the treatment of UC: anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) antibodies, anti-integrin α4β7 agents, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. However, due to their high cost and the partial response in some patients, a significant number of individuals continue to endure numerous symptoms, contributing to both physical and psychological burdens associated with the disease.

### Physical activity and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: prospective study from the nurses' health study cohorts [^113aqJpC]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease, are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract affecting nearly 1.4 million Americans. Inflammatory bowel disease accounts for over $6 bn in direct healthcare costs annually. In addition, inflammatory bowel disease is associated with important indirect costs, loss of economic productivity, and work disability.

Although the exact pathophysiology of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis remains largely unknown, findings from ecologic studies, the rising incidence in inflammatory bowel disease over the past several decades, and the relatively modest risk contribution from known genetic risk loci (< 15%), highlight the importance of the environment in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. To date, few environmental risk factors have been identified.

Recent in vivo studies have shown that exercise may induce autophagy, a lysosomal degradation pathway known to protect against diseases such as cancer, neurogenerative disorders, infections, and inflammatory disorders. In parallel, genome wide association studies have identified susceptibility loci to Crohn's disease within autophagy pathways, suggesting a possible mechanistic association between physical activity and risk of inflammatory bowel disease.

We examined the association between physical activity and risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in two large ongoing prospective cohort studies of US women, the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II. With more than 20 years of biennially updated and validated data on lifestyle, diet, and medical diagnoses, these cohorts offered us the unique opportunity to examine the association between physical activity assessed at multiple time points over adulthood and subsequent risk of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the context of other potential risk factors.

### Redefining the IBDs using genome-scale molecular phenotyping [^115A3nRc]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

The IBDs, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract resulting from an aberrant immune response to enteric microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals. Disease presentation and progression within and across IBDs, especially Crohn's disease, are highly heterogeneous in location, severity of inflammation and other phenotypes. Current clinical classifications fail to accurately predict disease course and response to therapies. Genome-wide association studies have identified > 240 loci that confer risk of IBD, but the clinical utility of these findings remains unclear, and mechanisms by which the genetic variants contribute to disease are largely unknown. In the past 5 years, the profiling of genome-wide gene expression, epigenomic features and gut microbiota composition in intestinal tissue and faecal samples has uncovered distinct molecular signatures that define IBD subtypes, including within Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In this Review, we summarize studies in both adult and paediatric patients that have identified different IBD subtypes, which in some cases have been associated with distinct clinical phenotypes. We posit that genome-scale molecular phenotyping in large cohorts holds great promise not only to further our understanding of the diverse molecular causes of IBD but also for improving clinical trial design to develop more personalized disease management and treatment.

### Sex-based differences in inflammatory bowel diseases: a review [^117JZaVs]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), comprising Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic and oftentimes progressive inflammatory diseases of the bowel. The clinical course of IBD is unpredictable, but generally includes periods of remission interspersed with periods of acute or subacute exacerbations, so-called 'flares', the triggers for which are multiple. Extraintestinal symptoms might accompany the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or present seemingly independent of luminal symptoms. Although it is well established that IBD pathogenesis represents the complex interplay of genetic susceptibility and dysregulated innate and adaptive immune systems in the face of environmental triggers, and likely gut dysbiosis, the 'unpredictable' nature of IBD reflects our still incomplete understanding of the interaction of these elements, and possibly others yet to be defined.

Sex-based differences in IBD pathogenesis, disease course, and even response to therapy have been increasingly recognized. Our ability to leverage experimental and translational models to define and test hypothesized mechanisms for these observed differences has already extended our understanding of possible mechanisms underlying observed differences, including the potential modifying role of sex hormones and sex-dependent (epi)genetic and gut microbiome changes. That other immune-mediated diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and systemic lupus erythematosus, – similarly have sex-based differences in incidence, as well as natural and therapeutic disease course provides additional support that observed sex-based differences have a biological basis. That said, sex-based differences that are nonbiological, including differential access to care and differential early-life exposures and throughout-life exposures, must also be considered and might be particularly relevant in IBD. Further complicating our understanding of observed sex-based differences in IBD is the striking geographic differences, specifically between Asian–Pacific and Western countries.

Better understanding the epidemiology of sex-based differences in IBD, including disease presentation and response to therapy, as well as defining the underlying biological and nonbiological mechanisms, has far-reaching clinical, scientific, economic, and societal implications. Herein, our primary objective is to comprehensively review sex-based differences in IBD, including epidemiology, pathogenesis, phenotypic differences, therapeutic response, and outcomes. Wherever relevant, we also summarize complementary experimental data and data from other immune-mediated diseases where sex-based differences are similarly recognized.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^116xahEj]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Within the diagnostic label of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) is typically characterised by diffuse mucosal inflammation, limited to the colon, with confluent inflammation extending proximally from the rectum to varying severity and extent. In children, it is well recognised however, that UC typically affects all or most of the colon (extensive or pan-colitis), whereas adults more often present with localised distal disease (proctitis). Recently, the paediatric Porto criteria for the diagnosis of IBD have been revised to take account of diagnostic advances, for example, in imaging techniques, and also to help correctly assign patients to the differing IBD subgroups. In the paediatric age group, up to 10% of cases cannot be assigned to as either UC or Crohn's despite comprehensive assessment. These are classified as IBD unclassified, although in practice, currently, they are most commonly treated along the same lines as UC.

Biomarker-based treat-to-target strategy in ulcerative colitis — In ulcerative colitis (UC), there is a paucity of high-quality data confirming the value of a biomarker-based treat-to-target strategy. Indirect support comes from evidence in which persistent biomarker elevation, despite symptomatic remission, is associated with a higher risk of relapse; however, direct evidence is lacking. There have not been any studies comparing a biomarker-based strategy with an endoscopy-based strategy for assessment and monitoring of endoscopic remission, and this was identified as a knowledge gap by the panel.

### The role of environmental factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases: a review [^116fAWVk]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, are chronic relapsing conditions that affect a growing number of children worldwide. The pathogenesis of these disorders is complex and thought to be mediated by the interplay between genetic susceptibility, microbial dysbiosis, and environmental factors that result in a dysregulated immune system. This dysregulation ultimately mediates intestinal inflammation and clinical symptoms typically observed in patients with IBD including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and poor growth. A dramatic increase in the incidence of IBD has been observed in the past 2 decades, mainly in developed countries but also in developing regions. This increased incidence has paralleled changes in diet, sanitation conditions, and lifestyle habits.

Observations

The increased incidence of IBD can likely be attributed to more than evolving genetic diversity alone and strongly suggests that environmental factors are playing an increasingly critical role in the development of these disorders and in the modulation of IBD clinical phenotypes over time. Here, we review the data suggesting how different environmental factors may modulate the risk of developing IBD including diets, smoking, lifestyle choices, enteric infections, appendectomy, air pollution, and the use of medications, with an emphasis on antibiotics. We will also discuss how early-life events can influence the subsequent likelihood of developing one of these diseases and suggest directions that can help decrease the risk of IBD in particularly high-risk populations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dramatic lifestyle changes in the last century have substantially improved the quality of life but are also associated with increased risk of various diseases. Pediatricians should be aware of the changing epidemiology of IBD and environmental factors that modulate the risk of developing these conditions.

### Inflammatory bowel disease: recent advances on genetics and innate immunity [^116p8xub]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

The chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are recognized as important causes of gastrointestinal disease in children and adults. Insight into IBD is advancing rapidly owing to a plethora of investigations into intestinal inflammation in animal models, advances in the interrogation of diseases inherited as complex genetic traits, and the development of methods to define the composition of the intestinal microbiota. These advances offer a better understanding of the genetically determined interplay between the commensal microbiota, intestinal cells and the immune system, and the manner in which this interaction might be modified by environmental factors in the pathogenesis of IBD. The present review highlights recent advances in IBD research.

### Cytokines in inflammatory bowel disease [^113t4ES4]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cytokines have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, where they control multiple aspects of the inflammatory response. In particular, the imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines that occurs in IBD impedes the resolution of inflammation and instead leads to disease perpetuation and tissue destruction. Recent studies suggest the existence of a network of regulatory cytokines that has important implications for disease progression. In this Review, we discuss the role of cytokines produced by innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as their relevance to the future therapy of IBD.

### 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde alleviates intestinal inflammation by attenuating intestinal mucosal barrier damage via directly inhibiting STAT3 [^116huAVi]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC), a major prevalent form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the colonic and rectal mucosa, with bloody stool and diarrhea as the main clinical manifestations. The global incidence of UC continues to rise, leading to significant negative effects on patients' quality of life and imposing substantial economic burdens on individuals and society as a whole. Although the specific cause of UC remains unclear, increasing studies support the association of epithelial barrier disruption, genetic susceptibility, dysregulated immune responses, and environmental factors with its pathogenesis. Ulcerative colitis remains a disease that requires continuous treatment owing to its complex etiology. The current clinical objectives of UC treatment are to ameliorate inflammation, maintain remission, and address the secondary effects of the disease. Commonly used agents for UC treatment include 5-aminosalicylic acid, glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and monoclonal antibodies. However, these medicines are often associated with suboptimal clinical outcomes, drug dependence, and certain adverse reactions. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to find new, safe, and effective therapeutic methods to optimize the treatment of UC.

### Genome-wide association identifies multiple ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci [^115LixF9]. Nature Genetics (2010). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with a complex genetic and environmental etiology. In an effort to identify genetic variation underlying ulcerative colitis risk, we present two distinct genome-wide association studies of ulcerative colitis and their joint analysis with a previously published scan, comprising, in aggregate, 2,693 individuals with ulcerative colitis and 6,791 control subjects. Fifty-nine SNPs from 14 independent loci attained an association significance of P < 10⁻⁵. Seven of these loci exceeded genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸). After testing an independent cohort of 2,009 cases of ulcerative colitis and 1,580 controls, we identified 13 loci that were significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (P < 5 × 10⁻⁸), including the immunoglobulin receptor gene FCGR2A, 5p15, 2p16 and ORMDL3 (orosomucoid1-like 3). We confirmed association with 14 previously identified ulcerative colitis susceptibility loci, and an analysis of acknowledged Crohn's disease loci showed that roughly half of the known Crohn's disease associations are shared with ulcerative colitis. These data implicate approximately 30 loci in ulcerative colitis, thereby providing insight into disease pathogenesis.

### New mediators of immunity and inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease [^112ZLfJc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the tissue damage results from an inappropriate or exaggerated immune response to antigens of the gut microflora. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the role of immune-inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

Recent Findings

Despite having a common basis in overresponsiveness to luminal antigens, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are immunologically distinct entities. Crohn's disease is associated with a Th1 T cell-mediated response, characterized by enhanced production of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Interleukin (IL)-12 and, possibly, IL-23 govern the Th1 cell differentiation, but optimal induction and stabilization of polarized Th1 cells would require additional cytokines, such as IL-15, IL-18 and IL-21. In ulcerative colitis, the local immune response is less polarized, but it is characterized by CD1-reactive natural killer T cell production of IL-13. Beyond these differences, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share important end-stage effector pathways of intestinal injury, which are mediated by an active cross-talk between immune and non-immune mucosal cells.

Summary

The clarification of the complex network of immune-inflammatory mediators operating in the gut of patients with inflammatory bowel disease has led to the identification of new targets that could, in turn, drive the development of effective biological therapies.

### Diagnosis and classification of ulcerative colitis [^113Hf41t]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterised by superficial mucosal ulceration, rectal bleeding, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. In contrast to Crohn's disease (CrD), UC is restricted to the colon and the inflammation is limited to the mucosal layer. Classic UC affects the colon in a retrograde and continuous fashion starting from the rectum and extending proximally. Dependent on the anatomic extent of involvement, UC can be classified as proctitis, left-sided colitis, or pancolitis. Inflammatory arthropathies and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are the most common and clinically most important extraintestinal manifestations of UC. The aetiopathogenesis of UC is incompletely understood, but immune-mediated mechanisms are responsible for dysregulated immune responses against intraluminal antigens in genetically predisposed individuals. The diagnosis is based on the history, as well as clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological features. Autoantibodies, mainly antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and anti-goblet cell antibodies (GAB) may be helpful in the early diagnosis of UC and in differentiating it from CrD.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two principal types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is a debilitating inflammatory condition of the colon that usually begins in young adulthood. Although the precise pathogenesis is unknown, the lack of mucus secretion, elevated concentrations of soluble inflammatory mediators secreted by the stroma, wounding, and epithelial barrier permeability are thought to play essential early roles in the development and progression of UC –. Clinical UC is heterogeneous, ranging from acute to chronic inflammation of the colon. As the pathogenesis is unknown, medical interventions are nonspecific, resulting in inconsistent treatment responses. Patients with poor response to these therapies develop severe symptoms, ultimately leading to resection of the colon and rectum. Because patient-based predictive models, which capture individual heterogeneity, are lacking, a more complete experimental model is essential.

Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived human intestinal organoids have been developed for the normal mid/hind gut, and colon, and have distinct advantages in advancing precision medicine. These organoids can be derived from the individual patient and exhibit recapitulation of physiological responses both in vitro and in vivo. Besides the unique characteristics of PSCs, induced PSC-derived (iPSC) organoids retain the phenotype and genetic background of the individual donor as reported by recent studies modeling both normal and pathological organs –.

In this study, we provide evidence linking recent advances in stem cell biologywith intestinal development. to reprogram colonic fibroblasts isolated from UC patients to iPSCs, followed by directed differentiation to induced human UC organoids (iHUCOs). Notably, iHUCOs have both epithelial and stromal compartments, preserving the colitic phenotype of their tissue of origin, such as responding to wounding by aberrant proliferation, a lack of goblet cells, and having compromised cellular tight junctions in their epithelial barrier.

### Oxidative stress and DNA damage: implications in inflammatory bowel disease [^116LSgiZ]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

This review will focus on published human studies on oxidative stress and DNA damage in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, assessing their role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Search was performed over PubMed and ScienceDirect databases to identify relevant bibliography, using keywords including "oxidative stress", "DNA damage", "IBD", and "oxidative DNA damage". Whether as cause or effect, mechanisms underlying oxidative stress have the potential to condition the course of various pathologies, particularly those driven by inflammatory scenarios. IBDs are chronic inflammatory relapsing conditions. Oxidative stress has been associated with some of the characteristic clinical features exhibited in IBD, namely tissue injury and fibrosis, and also to the ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer. The possible influence of oxidative stress over therapeutic behavior and response, as well as their contribution to the oxidative burden and consequences, is also addressed. Due to the high prevalence and incidence of IBD worldwide, and also to its associated morbidity, complications, and disease and treatment costs, it is of paramount importance to better understand the pathophysiology of these diseases.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^115AZoZK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis — The diagnosis of UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of affected and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist, preferably one with expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. Categories of disease extent include proctitis within 18 cm of anal verge (distal to rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis extending from sigmoid to splenic flexure, and extensive colitis beyond splenic flexure including pancolitis; if the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless other symptoms or findings suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of Crohn's disease rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity are needed to guide treatment decisions and should be based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers such as FC, CRP, and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity, and disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^116BECwi]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA clinical practice guidelines — mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) definition and severity classification state that the severity of UC is generally classified as mild-to-moderate or moderate-to-severe, and for this guideline mild–moderate UC was defined as patients with < 4–6 bowel movements per day, mild–moderate rectal bleeding, absence of constitutional symptoms, low overall inflammatory burden, and absence of features suggesting of high inflammatory activity, based upon Truelove and Witts criteria and the Mayo Clinic score. Patients with mild–moderate disease activity generally are at low risk of requiring colectomy.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC), being a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the digestive system, is characterized by several symptoms that include diarrhea, fever, fecal mucus and bleeding, acute abdominal pain, weight loss and fatigue. The prolonging of these symptoms often leads to increased anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life among UC patients. While the global prevalence of UC is evolving, the disease's prevalence is unquestionably on the rise.

Impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function is recognized as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. Dysregulation of the intestinal environment may lead to augmented intestinal mucosal permeability, activation of macrophages and antigen delivery cells, and consequent inflammatory responses as invasive monocytes differentiate into macrophages, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23. Monoclonal antibody treatments for UC typically aim to reduce inflammatory responses in the gut, including inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and suppressing the immune responses, such as TNF-α monoclonal antibodies and IL-12 / IL-23 antagonists.

### Towards IBD prediction and prevention: the contribution of genetics and genomics [^111F1zzG]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

This review appraises the current genetic and genomic knowledge in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with regard to diagnosis, therapy, and medicine for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The results of numerous genetic and genome-wide association studies leave no doubts that IBD has an undeniable and biologically relevant genetic component, deeply rooted in the patient individual genetic makeup. Decades of research have firmly established that numerous genetic loci are linked to IBD, making the individuals who inherit them significantly more susceptible to developing ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. IBD genetics are very heterogeneous and variable when considering natural history, clinical features, age of onset, and the discrete subgroups that are affected. The review interrogates the risk for IBD and highlights some opportunities that may lead to the future possibility of preventing IBD. If strategies for prevention, early detection, early intervention, or even avoidance are to be developed, the obvious genetic underpinnings of IBD cannot be ignored.

### Targets for new immunomodulation strategies in inflammatory bowel disease [^114GPLmQ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in human beings, are characterized by damage to the intestinal epithelium and deeper layers, which is caused by an excessive immune response directed against normal constituents of the gut microflora. In both IBD, the diseased tissue is heavily infiltrated with several subsets of leukocytes that produce huge amounts of inflammatory cytokines whose profiles varies not only between CD and UC but also during the evolution of the same disease. These recent discoveries together with the demonstration that the inhibition of some soluble cytokines is not beneficial in IBD have contributed to delineate new scenarios by which tissue damage is induced and perpetuated. We here review some of the major immunological defects documented in IBD and discuss why compounds inhibiting soluble cytokines were not beneficial in patients and how we can optimize therapeutic strategies with biologics.

### Ulcerative colitis… [^117KLd6h]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a disease of the colon characterized by chronic inflammation. The cause of the aberrant immune response is unclear, but genetic, dietary, and environmental risk factors have a role. In contrast with that of Crohn's disease, the inflammation of ulcerative colitis is limited to the colonic mucosa. The portion of the colon affected varies. Some patients have inflammation that is limited to the rectum, whereas others have more proximal disease. Pancolitis refers to ulcerative colitis that affects the entire colon. Infection with nontyphoid Salmonella or Campylobacter is associated with an eight to 10 times higher risk of developing ulcerative colitis in the following year. 4 The risk diminishes with time, but is still present up to 10 years later. The intestinal bacterial flora of patients with inflammatory bowel disease has been shown to be markedly abnormal, but this finding has not yet led to therapeutic interventions.
5.

Diagnosis Ulcerative colitis typically presents with hematochezia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The onset of symptoms can be sudden or gradual. 8 The presence of anemia, thrombocytosis, or hypoalbuminemia may suggest inflammatory bowel disease, but most patients with ulcerative colitis will not have these abnormalities. 9 C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are relatively insensitive for detecting ulcerative colitis and should not be relied on to exclude inflammatory bowel disease. At the time of diagnosis, fewer than one-half of patients with ulcerative colitis have abnormal findings on these tests. 9, 10 Endoscopic biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis.
11. Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis for ulcerative colitis includes Crohn's disease and infectious colitis caused by bacterial, viral, or parasitic pathogens.

Ulcerative colitis usually presents with contiguous disease, whereas patients with Crohn's disease may have areas of normal mucosa between areas of disease. Ulcerative colitis must also be distinguished from microscopic colitis, a common cause of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss in adults. Microscopic colitis is diagnosed with endoscopic biopsy. ACTIVE DISEASE For active disease distal to the descending colon, topical 5-aminosalicylic acid, including suppository and enema formulations, is the preferred treatment.

### ACG releases updated practice guidelines for ulcerative colitis in… [^115Mg8Db]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Proctosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will reveal the mucosal changes characteristic of ulcerative colitis: loss of the typical vascular pattern, granularity, friability, and ulceration. These changes usually appear in the distant rectum and proceed proximally to involve part or all of the colon, although isolated cecal inflammation may be seen. In patients who have ulcerative colitis, the following occur: the mucosa more commonly demonstrates separation, distortion, and atrophy of crypts; inflammatory cells in the lamina propria; neutrophils in the crypt epithelium; elevated plasma cells near the crypt bases; and basilar lymphoid aggregates.

Clinical and endoscopic findings will allow the clinician to assess the disorder's severity, which is characterized as mild; moderate; severe; or fulminant. When the inflammation extends beyond the reach of topical therapy, oral therapy should be used, with sulfasalazine at 4 to 6 g per day being the first line of treatment. At this dosage, 80 percent of patients will experience clinical remission or improvement within four weeks. Maintenance of Remission Maintenance regimens are required after the acute attack is controlled.

Patients with extensive or relapsing disease will need maintenance therapy. Compared with non–colitis-associated colorectal cancer, colitis-associated cancers are more often multiple, broadly infiltrating, anaplastic, and uniformly distributed throughout the colon, and they seem to arise from flat mucosa. Colitis-related tumors also occur in younger patients. High- and low-grade dysplasia standards should be used to diagnose dysplasia. Colonoscopic biopsy diagnosis of dysplasia in flat mucosa often indicates concurrent or future cancer. Patients with high-grade dysplasia should undergo colectomy; patients with low-grade dysplasia should consider it, because the five-year predictive value of the presence of low-grade dysplasia for either cancer or high-grade dysplasia is as high as 54 percent.
