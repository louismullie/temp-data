## Question

patient has stroke on clopidogrel and referred by dentist for dental clearance. What is the Canadian best practice guidelines for clopidogrel continuation and discontinuation for dental procedure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the Canadian best practice guidelines for managing clopidogrel around dental procedures in a patient with a history of stroke. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and risk stratification. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about antiplatelet continuation versus interruption for minor dental procedures. Next, I will consider the pharmacology of clopidogrel and the timing of discontinuation if needed. After that, I should review local hemostatic strategies and special scenarios like dual antiplatelet therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, procedure-specific recommendation and confirm documentation and follow-up needs, including any Canadian-specific nuances I can identify from the literature set.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk framing. The patient has a history of stroke and is on clopidogrel for secondary prevention, which places them at elevated thrombotic risk if antiplatelet therapy is interrupted, whereas most routine dental procedures carry a low risk of clinically significant bleeding and can often be managed with local measures, so I need to ensure I am not over-calling bleeding risk at the expense of stroke risk [^f5b55cd5] [^9f21ae65].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-credibility guidance for minor dental procedures. The 2022 ACCP perioperative antithrombotic guideline explicitly recommends continuing antiplatelet therapy, including P2Y12 inhibitors like clopidogrel, for minor dental procedures rather than stopping them 7–10 days pre-procedure, based on low to very low certainty evidence and a conditional recommendation, which aligns with the principle of prioritizing thrombotic risk over manageable bleeding risk in this setting [^f5b55cd5] [^5e857b0e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the pharmacology and timing if interruption is ever considered. Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits platelets for their lifespan, so functional recovery requires new platelet generation. The FDA labeling advises stopping clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgery with major bleeding risk, and ACCP similarly suggests 5 days for elective noncardiac surgery, which sets the outer bound for when interruption might be reasonable if bleeding risk is high or if dual antiplatelet therapy is being modified [^91725472] [^50ed5b49] [^0173a3b0].

> I need to check local hemostatic strategies that mitigate bleeding when antiplatelets are continued. Tranexamic acid mouthwash used pre-procedure and for 1–2 days post-procedure reduces dental bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, and ACCP also supports pro-hemostatic measures for minor dental procedures in patients on VKAs, reinforcing the concept that local control is effective and safer than systemic antiplatelet interruption in low-risk dental work [^87fdd388] [^9026220f].

> But wait, what if the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy after a coronary stent or recent ACS. I should confirm that guidance differs in that scenario. For patients with coronary stents within 3–12 months, ACCP suggests stopping the P2Y12 inhibitor pre-procedure while continuing aspirin, which is a different risk calculus than isolated clopidogrel for stroke prevention; this distinction matters and should be clarified with the prescribing physician before making any changes [^8b14b322] [^18161933].

> Let me consider procedure-specific risk. Simple dental procedures such as cleanings, fillings, single extractions, and endodontics are generally low bleeding risk and do not warrant stopping clopidogrel, whereas extensive oral surgery, multiple extractions, or periodontal surgery may carry more bleeding risk and could prompt individualized decisions, though even then many guidelines still favor continuation with enhanced local hemostasis rather than interruption given the thrombotic hazard [^f5b55cd5] [^ad253634].

> I should double-check that I am not overlooking any Canadian-specific guideline in the provided set. I do not see a uniquely Canadian dental antiplatelet guideline in the supplied references; the most authoritative statements here are the ACCP recommendations and supportive reviews, which are widely adopted in North American practice and reflect the balance of evidence for minor dental procedures in patients on clopidogrel [^f5b55cd5] [^5e857b0e].

> Next, I should review documentation and communication. The dentist should be informed of the stroke history, the indication for clopidogrel, and the plan to continue therapy, and the patient should be counseled on bleeding precautions and when to seek care. If interruption is ever contemplated, it should be coordinated with the neurologist or prescribing physician and timed appropriately if clinically justified, with prompt resumption post-procedure to avoid a gap in secondary prevention [^b3bb5264] [^c879cb55].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is as follows: for most routine dental procedures in a patient with prior stroke who is on clopidogrel, continue clopidogrel and use local hemostatic measures such as tranexamic acid mouthwash when indicated. Reserve interruption only for high bleeding risk scenarios after multidisciplinary discussion, and if interrupted, stop 5 days pre-procedure and resume within 24 hours post-procedure whenever feasible to minimize thrombotic risk [^f5b55cd5] [^87fdd388] [^50ed5b49] [^c879cb55].

---

For a patient with a history of stroke who is taking clopidogrel and needs dental clearance, **continue clopidogrel for most dental procedures** because the thrombotic risk of stopping outweighs the bleeding risk [^f5b55cd5] [^a7edd611]. Only consider stopping clopidogrel 5 days before high-risk procedures (e.g. multiple extractions, extensive periodontal surgery) and only if the stroke risk is low and local hemostasis is feasible [^50ed5b49] [^ad253634]. For low-risk procedures (cleaning, single extraction, fillings), **do not stop clopidogrel** and use local hemostatic measures (e.g. tranexamic acid mouthwash) if needed [^f5b55cd5] [^87fdd388]. Coordinate with the prescribing physician and document shared decision-making [^ad45cbc8].

---

## Clinical context and risk assessment

Patients with a history of stroke are at **high risk of recurrent thromboembolic events**, and antiplatelet therapy — such as clopidogrel — is essential for secondary prevention [^8205505f]. Interrupting antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and other serious cardiovascular events [^cc80dd9e]. Conversely, continuing antiplatelet therapy during dental procedures increases the risk of bleeding, although this is generally manageable with local hemostatic measures [^ad253634].

---

## Canadian and international guidelines

Currently, there are **no specific Canadian guidelines** exclusively addressing the perioperative management of clopidogrel in dental procedures. However, international guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) provide evidence-based recommendations that are widely adopted in clinical practice, including in Canada [^f5b55cd5] [^8205505f].

---

## ACCP 2022 guidelines

The ACCP 2022 guidelines provide clear recommendations for managing antiplatelet therapy during minor dental procedures:

- **Continue antiplatelet therapy**: For patients undergoing minor dental procedures (e.g. single tooth extraction, scaling, root planing, restorative procedures), the ACCP recommends continuing antiplatelet therapy, including clopidogrel, rather than stopping it preoperatively [^f5b55cd5].

- **Local hemostatic measures**: The guidelines suggest using local hemostatic agents, such as tranexamic acid mouthwash, to manage bleeding during dental procedures [^87fdd388].

- **Conditional recommendation**: The recommendation to continue antiplatelet therapy is conditional and based on very low certainty of evidence, but it balances the low risk of significant bleeding against the high risk of thromboembolic events if therapy is interrupted [^f5b55cd5].

---

## AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines

The AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines emphasize the importance of **continuing antiplatelet therapy** for secondary stroke prevention. While they do not specifically address dental procedures, they underscore the high risk of recurrent stroke associated with interrupting antiplatelet therapy, supporting the approach of continuing clopidogrel during minor dental procedures [^8205505f].

---

## Evidence supporting continuation of clopidogrel

Several studies and reviews have demonstrated that continuing antiplatelet therapy during dental procedures **does not significantly increase the risk of major bleeding complications** [^notfound]. The incidence of bleeding complications requiring more than local hemostatic measures is low, and the risk of thromboembolic events associated with interrupting therapy is significantly higher [^a7edd611].

---

## Situations where clopidogrel may be discontinued

While the general recommendation is to continue clopidogrel, there are specific scenarios where temporary discontinuation may be considered:

- **High-risk dental procedures**: Extensive oral surgeries, multiple extractions, or procedures involving significant soft tissue manipulation may warrant temporary discontinuation of clopidogrel [^notfound].

- **Low thrombotic risk**: If the patient's stroke risk is low (e.g. remote stroke history, no recent events), temporary discontinuation may be considered [^notfound].

- **Coordination with prescribing physician**: Any decision to discontinue clopidogrel should be made in consultation with the prescribing physician, typically a neurologist or cardiologist, to assess the individual patient's risk-benefit profile [^ad45cbc8].

---

## Timing of discontinuation and resumption

If discontinuation is deemed necessary, clopidogrel should typically be stopped **5 days before the procedure** to allow restoration of platelet function [^50ed5b49]. The medication should be resumed as soon as possible after the procedure, ideally within 24 hours, to minimize the risk of thromboembolic events [^c879cb55].

---

## Local hemostatic measures

When continuing clopidogrel, **local hemostatic measures** are essential to manage bleeding:

- **Tranexamic acid mouthwash**: 10 mL of 5% tranexamic acid solution, used for 2 minutes before the procedure and repeated 2–3 times daily for 1–2 days post-procedure [^87fdd388].

- **Local pressure and hemostatic agents**: Gelfoam, oxidized cellulose, or fibrin sealants can be used to control localized bleeding [^notfound].

- **Suturing**: Consider suturing to stabilize clot formation in extraction sites [^notfound].

---

## Documentation and communication

Clear communication and documentation are critical. The dentist should document the patient's medication history, stroke risk, and the rationale for continuing or discontinuing clopidogrel. Coordination with the prescribing physician and informed consent from the patient are essential [^ad45cbc8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Procedure risk** | **Recommendation** | **Additional measures** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk (cleaning, single extraction, fillings) | Continue clopidogrel | Local hemostatic measures |
| High-risk (multiple extractions, extensive surgery) | Consider discontinuation if stroke risk is low | Stop 5 days prior, resume within 24 hours, local hemostatic measures |

---

For a patient with a history of stroke taking clopidogrel, **continue clopidogrel for most dental procedures** and use local hemostatic measures to manage bleeding. Temporarily stop clopidogrel only for high-risk procedures, with careful coordination with the prescribing physician and prompt resumption post-procedure.

Pro-hemostatic options include pre- and post-procedure administration of oral tranexamic acid mouthwash, two to three times daily, and intervention-specific measures, and because the risk for dental procedure-related bleeding may vary, VKA interruption may be preferred in situations where oral bleeding is expected to be considerable.

Conclusions.

Although interruption of a P2Y 12 inhibitor should decrease a patient's risk of bleeding, the available evidence reported a nonsignificant increased bleeding risk in patients who stop a P2Y 12 inhibitor for an elective endoscopic procedure compared with those who continue the medication. This result is biologically implausible and, coupled to the very large confidence intervals, speaks to the very low certainty of evidence. Ultimately, the panel was unable to make a recommendation.

15. For patients on ASA 81–325 mg/d (monotherapy) for secondary cardiovascular prevention, we suggest against interruption of ASA (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^4465becc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People who take antiplatelet agents are at increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non-cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, taking antiplatelet therapy also introduces risk to the person undergoing surgery because the likelihood of bleeding is increased. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this risk but subsequently it might make thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction, more likely.

Objectives

To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies, and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy, for at least two weeks, and were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies. We excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthetic or sedation in which bleeding that required transfusion or additional surgery was unlikely. We included studies which compared perioperative continuation of antiplatelet therapy versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or versus substitution of antiplatelet therapy with a placebo for at least five days before surgery.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and synthesized findings. Our primary outcomes were: all-cause mortality at longest follow-up (up to six months); all-cause mortality (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included: blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products; blood loss requiring further surgical intervention; risk of ischaemic events. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs with 666 randomized adults. We identified three ongoing studies. All study participants were scheduled for elective general surgery (including abdominal, urological, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgery) under general, spinal or regional anaesthesia. Studies compared continuation of single or dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) with discontinuation of therapy for at least five days before surgery. Three studies reported adequate methods of randomization, and two reported methods to conceal allocation. Three studies were placebo-controlled trials and were at low risk of performance bias, and three studies reported adequate methods to blind outcome assessors to group allocation. Attrition was limited in four studies and two studies had reported prospective registration with clinical trial registers and were at low risk of selective outcome reporting bias. We reported mortality at two time points: the longest follow-up reported by study authors up to six months, and time point reported by study authors up to 30 days. Five studies reported mortality up to six months (of which four studies had a longest follow-up at 30 days, and one study at 90 days) and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality up to six months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 4.27; 659 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from eight fewer to 40 more). Combining the four studies with a longest follow-up at 30 days alone showed the same effect estimate, and we found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to mortality at 30 days after surgery (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.34 to 4.27; 616 participants; low-certainty evidence); the absolute effect is three more deaths per 1000 with continuation of antiplatelets (ranging from nine fewer to 42 more). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy probably makes little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring transfusion (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.26; 368 participants; absolute effect of 42 more participants per 1000 requiring transfusion in the continuation group, ranging from 19 fewer to 119 more; four studies; moderate-certainty evidence); and may make little or no difference in incidences of blood loss requiring additional surgery (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 7.58; 368 participants; absolute effect of six more participants per 1000 requiring additional surgery in the continuation group, ranging from seven fewer to 71 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We found that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy may make little or no difference to incidences of ischaemic events (to include peripheral ischaemia, cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction) within 30 days of surgery (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.77; 616 participants; absolute effect of 17 fewer participants per 1000 with an ischaemic event in the continuation group, ranging from 39 fewer to 40 more; four studies; low-certainty evidence). We used the GRADE approach to downgrade evidence for all outcomes owing to limited evidence from few studies. We noted a wide confidence in effect estimates for mortality at the end of follow-up and at 30 days, and for blood loss requiring transfusion which suggested imprecision. We noted visual differences in study results for ischaemic events which suggested inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery may make little or no difference to mortality, bleeding requiring surgical intervention, or ischaemic events. We found moderate-certainty evidence that either continuation or discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery probably makes little or no difference to bleeding requiring transfusion. Evidence was limited to few studies with few participants, and with few events. The three ongoing studies may alter the conclusions of the review once published and assessed.

### Antiplatelet agents in the perioperative period… [^0f082c9a]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Clopidogrel use must be continued postinsertion of BMS for at least 4 weeks. Among patients presenting with an ACS, both the PCI-CURE31 and CREDO7 trials support long-term therapy post-PCI with BMS for 1 year. In the era of DES implantation, the current Food and Drug Administration recommendation is also to continue taking both antiplatelet agents for at least 1 year. Discontinuation prior to completing 1 year of therapy is considered premature withdrawal. The CHARISMA trial, 30 which examined lower-risk patients who had not had a cardiovascular event or undergone PCI, showed no benefit of clopidogrel use in addition to aspirin in the context of primary prevention. 34, 35. Because clopidogrel is seen as a more powerful antiplatelet agent than aspirin, most surgeons advise discontinuation prior to surgery. The timing of surgery is often dictated by the clinical circumstances in which clopidogrel has been prescribed.

Clopidogrel therapy is advised for at least 4 weeks after placement of a BMS. If early surgery is undertaken with premature discontinuation of clopidogrel, the incidence of thrombotic complications and/or hemorrhagic events is extremely high. 90, 91 As a result, elective surgery should be postponed for a period of 1 to 3 months following placement of a BMS.
86. For example, if there is a major risk of both stent thrombosis and bleeding, surgery should be postponed for at least 6 to 12 months post-DES. If this is not possible, aspirin use should be continued and clopidogrel therapy stopped 5 days before surgery. If the bleeding risk is small and there is a major risk of stent thrombosis, then antiplatelet agents should be continued in the perioperative period. Full recovery of platelet function requires complete replacement of exposed platelets. However, hemostatic competence does not require 100% of all circulating platelets to be functioning normally.

The CURE trial33 found that clopidogrel therapy could be discontinued at least 5 days prior to coronary artery bypass graft with no increased bleeding complications. Hence, for the majority of cases, stopping clopidogrel therapy at least 5 days preoperatively will allow adequate hemostatic function prior to most surgical procedures.
18. Gammie et al95 showed that if abciximab was given within 12 hours of surgery, the rate of transfusion and hemorrhagic risk increased.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing interventional procedures (preprocedural discontinuation of antiplatelet agents), ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to interrupt clopidogrel and prasugrel for 6 days for intermediate- and high-risk procedures. Continued clopidogrel and prasugrel for low-risk procedures. Interrupt ticagrelor for 5 days for high-risk procedures. Interrupr ticlopidine for 7 days for high-risk procedures and for 3 days for intermediate-risk procedures. Consider continuing ticlopidine for low-risk procedures.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^87fdd388]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Dental procedures in patients receiving a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) — For minor dental procedures (single and multiple tooth extractions and endodontic procedures), we suggest continuation of VKA over VKA interruption (Conditional Recommendation, Low Certainty of Evidence). A meta-analysis found no significant increase in intra-procedural bleeding with continuation (RR = 1.67; 95% CI: 0.97–2.89) or post-procedural bleeding (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 0.71–2.92). Overall, continuing VKAs is associated with a low (approximately 5%) risk for any bleeding, with such bleeding considered self-limiting; thromboembolic outcomes appeared rare (< 0.1%). Partial interruption of VKA for 2 to 3 days before the procedure is another approach associated with a low risk for bleeding. If tranexamic acid is used, 10 mL of a 5% mouthwash solution can be given just before the procedure and two to three times daily for 1 to 2 days' post-procedure.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^b1b75d07]. Pain Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The frequency of performance of interventional techniques in chronic pain patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy continues to increase. Understanding the importance of continuing chronic anticoagulant therapy, the need for interventional techniques, and determining the duration and discontinuation or temporary suspension of anticoagulation is crucial to avoiding devastating complications, primarily when neuraxial procedures are performed. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets target the clotting system, increasing the bleeding risk. However, discontinuation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs exposes patients to thrombosis risk, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease. These guidelines summarize the current peer reviewed literature and develop consensus-based guidelines based on the best evidence synthesis for patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional procedures.

Study Design

Review of the literature and development of guidelines based on best evidence synthesis.

Objectives

To provide a current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding the assessment of bleeding and thrombosis risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications.

Methods

Development of consensus guidelines based on best evidence synthesis included review of the literature on bleeding risks during interventional pain procedures, practice patterns, and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. A multidisciplinary panel of experts developed methodology, risk stratification based on best evidence synthesis, and management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy. It also included risk of cessation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy based on a multitude of factors. Multiple data sources on bleeding risk, practice patterns, risk of thrombosis, and perioperative management of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy were identified. The relevant literature was identified through searches of multiple databases from 1966 through 2023. In the development of consensus statements and guidelines, we used a modified Delphi technique, which has been described to minimize bias related to group interactions. Panelists without a primary conflict of interest voted on approving specific guideline statements. Each panelist could suggest edits to the guideline statement wording and could suggest additional qualifying remarks or comments as to the implementation of the guideline in clinical practice to achieve consensus and for inclusion in the final guidelines, each guideline statement required at least 80% agreement among eligible panel members without primary conflict of interest.

Results

A total of 34 authors participated in the development of these guidelines. Of these, 29 participated in the voting process. A total of 20 recommendations were developed. Overall, 100% acceptance was obtained for 16 of 20 items. Total items were reduced to 18 with second and third round voting. The final results were 100% acceptance for 16 items (89%). There was disagreement for 2 statements (statements 6 and 7) and recommendations by 3 authors. These remaining 2 items had an acceptance of 94% and 89%. The disagreement and dissent were by Byron J. Schneider, MD, with recommendation that all transforaminals be classified into low risk, whereas Sanjeeva Gupta, MD, desired all transforaminals to be in intermediate risk. The second disagreement was related to Vivekanand A. Manocha, MD, recommending that cervical and thoracic transforaminal to be high risk procedures. Thus, with appropriate literature review, consensus-based statements were developed for the perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants and antiplatelets These included the following: estimation of the thromboembolic risk, estimation of bleeding risk, and determination of the timing of restarting of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. Risk stratification was provided classifying the interventional techniques into three categories of low risk, moderate or intermediate risk, and high risk. Further, on multiple occasions in low risk and moderate or intermediate risk categories, recommendations were provided against cessation of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

Limitations

The continued paucity of literature with discordant recommendations.

Conclusion

Based on the review of available literature, published clinical guidelines, and recommendations, a multidisciplinary panel of experts presented guidelines in managing interventional techniques in patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period. These guidelines provide a comprehensive assessment of classification of risk, appropriate recommendations, and recommendations based on the best available evidence.

Ischemic stroke or TIA with atrial fibrillation — antithrombotic strategy and timing states that in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA and atrial fibrillation (including paroxysmal AF), we recommend oral anticoagulation over no antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), aspirin (Grade 1B), or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B); we suggest oral anticoagulation with dabigatran 150 mg bid over adjusted-dose VKA therapy (target International Normalized Ratio range, 2.0–3.0) (Grade 2B); and for those unsuitable for or choosing not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 1B). Patients should be treated (ie, bridged) with aspirin until anticoagulation has reached a therapeutic level, and oral anticoagulation should generally be initiated within 1 to 2 weeks after stroke onset; earlier anticoagulation can be considered for patients at low risk of bleeding complications, whereas delaying anticoagulation should be considered for patients at high risk of hemorrhagic complications. Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less).

### Persistence and discontinuation of oral anticoagulant: remaining issues not addressed by phase III clinical trials [^e79c30fb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Early discontinuation of proven drugs is a problem not only restricted to OACs. In patients with myocardial infarction, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were proven to prevent left ventricular remodeling and improve outcomes. 16 However, the persistent use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in patients receiving angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction at 2 years is only 50%. 17 Current practice guidelines emphasize the importance of "initiating evidence‐based therapy," but do not indicate the importance of "persistence of evidence‐based therapy for enough period of time" due to lack of clinical evidence. Figure demonstrates the concept of systemic improvement of clinical care using the logic of "Evidence Based Medicine." Line A demonstrates the "natural course" of the disease. After completing a nicely designed large‐scale randomized trial demonstrating lower target events in patients treated with "new therapy B" versus "natural course A," the "new therapy B" becomes the "standard of care" for the next generation. This concept was represented by our experience that aspirin became the "standard of care" in patients with acute myocardial infarction after completing the ISIS‐2 (Second International Study of Infarct Survival Collaborative Group) 18 and similar other trials. 19 The next randomized trials demonstrated lower target event rates with the use of new "treatment C" versus "treatment B," and "treatment C" became "standard of care" for the next generation similar to the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel becoming the "standard of care" after completing the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events Trial) trial. 20 In acute care settings, adherence and discontinuation issues are not as many compared with long‐term therapy, such as stroke prevention in AF patients. If patients discontinue the "evidence‐based therapy," event rates become similar to that of the "natural course" (Figure). Although the increased event rate after discontinuing "evidence‐based therapy" mimics "rebound," it may simply reflect the return of the event rate observed in the "natural course." To avoid returning to the "natural course," it is important to adhere to evidence‐based therapy once the physician/patient has decided to undergo that therapy. We have to keep in mind that the effects of the therapy demonstrated by clinical trials can be achieved only by its long enough persistence.

Atrial fibrillation with prior ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease — adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulation: For patients with a history of ischemic stroke, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, the usefulness of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulants is uncertain for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Unstable angina and coronary artery stenting represent special circumstances in which management may warrant dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation.

### Management of antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing dental procedures [^ad253634]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients receiving antithrombotic therapy require dental procedures. Dental interventions in these patients can be challenging, as the risk of bleeding from the continuation of antithrombotic therapy needs to be weighed against the thromboembolic risk associated with drug interruption or de-escalation. Most minor dental procedures, including simple dental cleaning and filling, pose minimal bleeding risk, and antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy can be continued without interruption. Local hemostatic measures, such as tranexamic mouthwash, can be used, as needed, to reduce bleeding events following these interventions. Managing antithrombotic therapy during more invasive dental interventions and oral surgeries with a higher risk of perioperative bleeding necessitates the consideration of specific factors influencing the bleeding risk and thromboembolism. In patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for primary prevention, temporary interruption is reasonable. In others, the decisions may be more complex and more nuanced. In this article, we review the current evidence for managing patients receiving oral antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs scheduled for various dental procedures and present a practical approach for the periprocedural management of antithrombotic treatments.

### American College of Gastroenterology-Canadian association of gastroenterology clinical practice guideline: management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets during acute gastrointestinal bleeding and the periendoscopic period [^5f2bf725]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of antithrombotic agents in the elective endoscopy setting.

The 9 remaining statements inform antithrombotic therapy management in patients undergoing scheduled, elective endoscopic procedures. These recommendations exclude patients at high risk of thromboembolic events in whom elective procedures should be deferred. Such high-risk patients include those within 3 months of acute venous thromboembolism (comprising lower-limb deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), stroke, or transient ischemic attack (Table 4); and patients within 3 months of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event, within 6 months of a drug-eluting stent or 1 month of a bare-metal coronary stent placement without ACS history; or after ACS event within 12 months of a drug-eluting stent placement or 2 months of bare-metal stent placement. Recent data suggest that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ASA and P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor can be converted to platelet P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor monotherapy among patients at 3 months or less in patients with a drug-eluting stent placed after ACS event.

A review of published guidelines highlights the lack of consensus regarding high vs low baseline risk of endoscopic procedures (Table 3) (,–). Procedural bleeding risk and patient-specific thromboembolic risk were empirically framed using the risk stratification endorsed by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis Guidance Statement, the BRIDGE Trial, previously published guidelines, and expert opinion (Table 4). A structured and exhaustive GRADE assessment of procedural bleeding risk is beyond the scope of this clinical practice guideline.

Empiric endoscopic procedural bleeding risk stratification

Empiric periprocedural thromboembolic risk stratification for patients receiving anticoagulant therapy

Also pertinent to this section are considerations of patient preference. The targeted review performed for this guideline initiative (see Appendix 2, Supplementary Digital Content,) demonstrated substantial variability in the threshold number of bleeds observed for oral anticoagulation therapy to be considered acceptable both within individuals and between different studies. Furthermore, country-specific differences exist in patients' perceptions of atrial fibrillation, concerns about stroke, and preference for involvement in oral anticoagulation therapy treatment decisions, with recent experience of stroke and GI bleeding both significantly influencing patient values and preferences. Indeed, patients placed more weight (more disutility) on stroke prevention than GI bleeding unless they had previously experienced a GI bleed. Among the latter, 87% placed the highest utility on rebleeding risk followed by thrombosis risk. The panel members concluded that for most PICOs, there is possibly significant uncertainty about or variability in how much people value the critical outcomes.

### Dental surgery and antiplatelet agents: bleed or die [^a7edd611]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients taking antiplatelet medications who are undergoing dental surgery, physicians and dentists must weigh the bleeding risks in continuing antiplatelet medications versus the thrombotic risks in interrupting antiplatelet medications. Bleeding complications requiring more than local measures for hemostasis are rare after dental surgery in patients taking antiplatelet medications. Conversely, the risk for thrombotic complications after interruption of antiplatelet therapy for dental procedures apparently is significant, although small. When a clinician is faced with a decision to continue or interrupt antiplatelet therapy for a dental surgical patient, the decision comes down to "bleed or die". That is, there is a remote chance that continuing antiplatelet therapy will result in a (nonfatal) bleeding problem requiring more than local measures for hemostasis versus a small but significant chance that interrupting antiplatelet therapy will result in a (possibly fatal) thromboembolic complication. The decision is simple: It is time to stop interrupting antiplatelet therapy for dental surgery.

### Analysis of prescriptions for dual antiplatelet therapy after acute ischemic stroke… [^573431a0]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Have prescribing patterns in dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention among patients with acute ischemic stroke changed after clinical trial findings and American Heart Association/American Stroke Association practice guideline updates. Findings In this cohort study of 132 817 patients with acute ischemic stroke, 47. 0% of patients with minor stroke received DAPT at discharge, as indicated by guidelines;
42. 6% patients with nonminor stroke, for whom the risks and benefits of DAPT have not been fully established, received DAPT at discharge, with substantial hospital variation across current US practice.

After the publication of the CHANCE and POINT clinical trials, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association issued a new class 1, level of evidence A, recommendation for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention in patients with minor ischemic stroke. The extent to which variations in DAPT prescribing patterns remain and the extent to which practice patterns in the US are consistent with evidence-based guidelines are unknown.

Objective To evaluate the discharge DAPT prescribing patterns after publication of the new AHA/ASA guidelines and assess the extent of hospital-level variation in the use of DAPT for secondary prevention in patients with minor stroke, as indicated by guidelines, and in patients with nonminor stroke, for whom the risks and benefits of DAPT have not been fully established. Therefore, we analyzed data from the AHA/ASA Get With The Guidelines–Stroke registry to quantify the proportion of patients with minor and nonminor acute ischemic stroke who received discharge DAPT prescriptions after the release of new AHA/ASA guideline recommendations between October 1.

Some clinicians may avoid prescribing DAPT to patients with minor stroke in the presence of an allergy to aspirin or clopidogrel, a known bleeding diathesis or history of bleeding, a large territory infarction despite a low NIHSS score, a high risk of bleeding, a risk of fall, or CYP2C19 polymorphism.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^c44004a6]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy — CHEST clinical practice guideline scope and strong recommendations — addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions for patients receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who require an elective surgery/procedure; it is separated into four broad categories (vitamin K antagonist [VKA]; perioperative heparin bridging while receiving a VKA; direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]; antiplatelet drug) and generates strong or conditional practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations, of which two are strong recommendations: against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation and continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation; separate recommendations address minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^d3d02c03]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend DAPT combining long-term, low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor therapy (clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) for at least 12 months in patients with ACS undergoing PCI, irrespective of the stent type (BMS or DES) (class I). The use of potent P2Y 12 receptor antagonists (ticagrelor for patients at moderate-to-high risk of ischaemic events, including patients who were pretreated with clopidogrel, or prasugrel) should be preferred over clopidogrel (patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel, or who require long-term OAC therapy). Prasugrel is not recommended for patients in whom coronary anatomy is not known (class III), or with history of stroke or TIA (class III). In patients at high bleeding risk or who develop significant bleeding, premature discontinuation of DAPT after 3or 6months may be reasonable (class IIb). In patients with low bleeding risk who have tolerated DAPT during 12 months without bleeding complications, long-term continuation of DAPT may be considered (class IIb)(figure 2).

Nevertheless, current recommendations on the optimal duration of DAPT in patients with ACS are not based on contemporary randomised evidence. Notably, the median duration of DAPT in the pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in patients with ACS was 9–12 months with clopidogrel,14.5 months with prasugreland only 9.2 months with ticagrelor. Furthermore, no randomised evidence focused on patients with ACS is currently available comparing shorter versus standard or extended DAPT durations with respect to clinical outcomes in contemporary practice, whereas randomised data from prespecified ACS subgroup analyses of recent trials including patients treated with newer generation DES have consistently shown that shorter durations of DAPT (3–6 months) were non-inferior to 12or 24months with respect to composite endpoints of CV events or CV events plus major bleeding. The optimal duration of DAPT in patients with ACS treated with DES remains therefore still under debate. Large-scale randomised trials (REDUCE (NCT02118870), SMART-DATE (NCT01701453)) are currently investigating the efficacy and safety of a short-term DAPT strategy (3 months and 6 months, respectively) compared with the recommended 12-month DAPT duration in patients with ACS undergoing PCI with newer generation DES and should provide novel insights into this important clinical dilemma during the next years.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to secondary prevention (antiplatelet therapy), AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of clopidogrel alone, the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole, ticagrelor alone, or cilostazol alone for secondary stroke prevention in patients with stroke or TIA attributable to 50–99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery.

Patients having a minor dental, dermatologic, or ophthalmologic procedure — antiplatelet continuation evidence and question: The PICO asks whether antiplatelet drugs should be continued vs stopping antiplatelet drugs 7 to 10 days before the procedure. For minor dental procedures, small (< 100 patients) randomized trials and cohort studies suggest no increase in major bleeding with ASA continuation. For minor skin procedures, prospective cohort studies totaling about 200 patients suggest a low (< 1%) risk for major bleeding with continuation of ASA. For phacoemulsification (cataract) surgery, prospective cohort studies have suggested a low (< 1%) incidence of major bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation. For eyelid surgery, one 42-patient randomized trial compared ASA continuation with no perioperative ASA use and reported no significant effect on bleeding or thromboembolic outcomes. For skin procedures, one meta-analysis of two randomized trials and 28 observational studies totaling > 14,000 patients found no significant increase in bleeding with perioperative ASA continuation.

### Prevention of premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery stents: a science advisory from the American Heart Association, American college of cardiology, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, American college of surgeons, and American dental association, with representation from the American College of Physicians [^07bf746a]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine has been shown to reduce cardiac events after coronary stenting. However, many patients and healthcare providers prematurely discontinue dual antiplatelet therapy, which greatly increases the risk of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death. This advisory stresses the importance of 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy after placement of a drug-eluting stent and educating the patient and healthcare providers about hazards of premature discontinuation. It also recommends postponing elective surgery for 1 year, and if surgery cannot be deferred, considering the continuation of aspirin during the perioperative period in high-risk patients with drug-eluting stents.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^f93028b6]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) perioperative antiplatelet and anticoagulant management — guideline scope and methods state a review of the literature and development of consensus-based guidelines based on best evidence synthesis for patients receiving anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy during interventional procedures. The objective is to provide a current and concise appraisal of the literature regarding assessment of bleeding and thrombosis risk during interventional techniques for patients taking anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications. Methods included review of the literature on bleeding risks during interventional pain procedures, practice patterns, and perioperative management, with a multidisciplinary panel of experts developing methodology, risk stratification based on best evidence synthesis, and management, and addressing the risk of cessation of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy based on a multitude of factors. Data sources included bleeding risk, practice patterns, risk of thrombosis, and perioperative management, with relevant literature identified through searches of multiple databases from 1966 through 2023, and a modified Delphi technique was used to minimize bias related to group interactions. Clinical context notes that anticoagulants and antiplatelets target the clotting system, increasing the bleeding risk, while discontinuation exposes patients to thrombosis risk that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in those with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease.

Most patients with coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease are on long-term antiplatelet therapy and dual therapy. Achieving a balance between ischemic and bleeding risk remains an important factor in managing patients on antiplatelet therapy. For most outpatient surgical procedures, maintenance and continuation of this therapy are recommended. Consultation with the patient's cardiologist, physician, and/or vascular surgeon is always recommended before interrupting or withholding this treatment modality.

### The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^e83776f1]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article discusses the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy and is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). The primary objectives of this article are the following: (1) to address the perioperative management of patients who are receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, and require an elective surgical or other invasive procedures; and (2) to address the perioperative use of bridging anticoagulation, typically with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH). A secondary objective is to address the perioperative management of such patients who require urgent surgery. The recommendations in this article incorporate the grading system that is discussed in this supplement (Guyatt G et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Briefly, Grade 1 recommendations are considered strong and indicate that the benefits do (or do not) outweigh risks, burden, and costs, whereas Grade 2 recommendations are referred to as suggestions and imply that individual patient values may lead to different management choices. The key recommendations in this article include the following: in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism (VTE) at high risk for thromboembolism, we recommend bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose subcutaneous (SC) LMWH or IV UFH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 1C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at moderate risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH, therapeutic-dose IV UFH, or low-dose SC LMWH over no bridging during temporary interruption of VKA therapy (Grade 2C); in patients with a mechanical heart valve or atrial fibrillation or VTE at low risk for thromboembolism, we suggest low-dose SC LMWH or no bridging over bridging with therapeutic-dose SC LMWH or IV UFH (Grade 2C). In patients with a bare metal coronary stent who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C); in patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement, we recommend continuing aspirin and clopidogrel in the perioperative period (Grade 1C). In patients who are undergoing minor dental procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure and co-administering an oral prohemostatic agent (Grade 1B); in patients who are undergoing minor dermatologic procedures and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C); in patients who are undergoing cataract removal and are receiving VKAs, we recommend continuing VKAs around the time of the procedure (Grade 1C).

### Executive summary: perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^da2b5fb0]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline on the Perioperative Management of Antithrombotic Therapy addresses 43 Patients-Interventions-Comparators-Outcomes (PICO) questions related to the perioperative management of patients who are receiving long-term oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery/procedure. This guideline is separated into four broad categories, encompassing the management of patients who are receiving: (1) a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), mainly warfarin; (2) if receiving a VKA, the use of perioperative heparin bridging, typically with a low-molecular-weight heparin; (3) a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC); and (4) an antiplatelet drug.

Methods

Strong or conditional practice recommendations are generated based on high, moderate, low, and very low certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology for clinical practice guidelines.

Results

A multidisciplinary panel generated 44 guideline recommendations for the perioperative management of VKAs, heparin bridging, DOACs, and antiplatelet drugs, of which two are strong recommendations: (1) against the use of heparin bridging in patients with atrial fibrillation; and (2) continuation of VKA therapy in patients having a pacemaker or internal cardiac defibrillator implantation. There are separate recommendations on the perioperative management of patients who are undergoing minor procedures, comprising dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, pacemaker/internal cardiac defibrillator implantation, and GI (endoscopic) procedures.

Conclusions

Substantial new evidence has emerged since the 2012 iteration of these guidelines, especially to inform best practices for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a VKA and may require heparin bridging, for the perioperative management of patients who are receiving a DOAC, and for patients who are receiving one or more antiplatelet drugs. Despite this new knowledge, uncertainty remains as to best practices for the majority of perioperative management questions.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy [^6e5f775c]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Worldwide, cardiovascular events represent the major cause of morbidity and mortality. A key role in the pathogenesis of these events is played by platelets. Interventional procedures, with placement of coronary and vascular stents, often represent the preferred therapeutic strategy. Antiplatelet medications are considered first-line therapy in preventing cardiovascular thrombotic events. A wide array of antiplatelet agents is available, each with different pharmacological properties. When patients on antiplatelet agents present for surgery, the perioperative team must design an optimal strategy to manage antiplatelet medications. Each patient is stratified according to risk of developing a cardiovascular thrombotic event and inherent risk of surgical bleeding. After risk stratification analysis, various therapeutic pathways include continuing or discontinuing all antiplatelet agents or maintaining one antiplatelet agent and discontinuing the other. This review focuses on the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of both older and novel antiplatelet drugs, and reviews current literature and guidelines addressing options for perioperative antiplatelet management.

### Medical clearance for common dental procedures [^9f21ae65]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Medical consultations before dental procedures present opportunities to integrate cross-disciplinary preventive care and improve patient health. This article presents recommendations related to patients with certain medical conditions who are planning to undergo common dental procedures, such as cleanings, extractions, restorations, endodontic procedures, abscess drainage, and mucosal biopsies. Specifically, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for preventing prosthetic joint infections or infectious endocarditis except in certain circumstances. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies typically should not be suspended for common dental treatments. Elective dental care should be avoided for six weeks after myocardial infarction or bare-metal stent placement or for six months after drug-eluting stent placement. It is important that any history of antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapies be communicated to the dentist. Ascites is not an indication for initiating prophylactic antibiotics before dental treatment, and acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice for patients with liver dysfunction or cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the consultation should include the patient's glomerular filtration rate. Although patients undergoing chemotherapy may receive routine dental care, it should be postponed when possible in those currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy. A detailed history of head and neck radiation therapy should be provided to the dentist. Multimodal, nonnarcotic analgesia is recommended for managing acute dental pain.

Regarding perioperative care for periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy, more specifically with respect to patients on antiplatelets, ASIPP 2024 guidelines recommend to interrupt clopidogrel and prasugrel for 6 days for intermediate- and high-risk procedures. Continued clopidogrel and prasugrel for low-risk procedures. Interrupt ticagrelor for 5 days for high-risk procedures. Interrupr ticlopidine for 7 days for high-risk procedures and for 3 days for intermediate-risk procedures. Consider continuing ticlopidine for low-risk procedures.

1.0 Summary of recommendations

These guidelines refer to patients undergoing elective endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures. Management of antiplatelet therapy and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage is discussed in detail in European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines on the management of acute non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations for the management of patients on antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulants undergoing elective endoscopic procedures are outlined in the algorithms in figures 1 and 2. Risk stratification for endoscopic procedures and antiplatelet agents (APAs) are detailed in tables 1 and 2. There is no high-risk category of thrombosis for DOACs as they are not indicated for prosthetic metal heart valves. Warfarin risk stratification is detailed in table 3. Our recommendations are based on best estimates of risk:benefit analysis for thrombosis versus haemorrhage. When discontinuing antithrombotic therapy, patient preference should be considered as well as clinical opinion: the risk of a potentially catastrophic thrombotic event such as a stroke may not be acceptable to a patient even if that risk is very low.

Figure 2
Guidelines for the management of patients on warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) undergoing endoscopic procedures.

For all endoscopic procedures we recommend continuing aspirin (moderate evidence, strong recommendation), with the exception of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), large colonic endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (> 2 cm), upper gastrointestinal EMR and ampullectomy. In the latter cases, aspirin discontinuation should be considered on an individual patient basis depending on the risks of thrombosis versus haemorrhage (low quality evidence, weak recommendation).

1.1 Low-risk procedures

For low-risk endoscopic procedures we recommend continuing P2Y12 receptor antagonists (eg, clopidogrel), as single or dual antiplatelet therapy (low quality evidence, strong recommendation).

For low-risk endoscopic procedures we suggest that warfarin therapy should be continued (low quality evidence, weak recommendation). It should be ensured that the International normalised ratio (INR) does not exceed the therapeutic range in the week prior to the procedure (low quality evidence, strong recommendation).

For low-risk endoscopic procedures we suggest omitting the morning dose of DOACs on the day of the procedure (very low quality evidence, weak recommendation)

### Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy for ischemic stroke: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^95710ca7]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article about treatment and prevention of stroke is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendations" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with acute ischemic stroke, we recommend administration of IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if treatment is initiated within 3 h of clearly defined symptom onset (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke of > 3 h but < 4.5 h, we suggest clinicians do not use IV tPA (Grade 2A). For patients with acute stroke onset of > 4.5 h, we recommend against the use of IV tPA (Grade 1A). For patients with acute ischemic stroke who are not receiving thrombolysis, we recommend early aspirin therapy (Grade 1A). For acute ischemic stroke patients with restricted mobility, we recommend prophylactic low-dose subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparins (Grade 1A). For long-term stroke prevention in patients with noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) [ie, atherothrombotic, lacunar, or cryptogenic], we recommend treatment with an antiplatelet agent (Grade 1A), including aspirin (recommended dose, 50–100 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25 mg/200 mg bid), or clopidogrel (75 mg qd). In these patients, we recommend use of the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (25/200 mg bid) over aspirin (Grade 1A) and suggest clopidogrel over aspirin (Grade 2B), and recommend avoiding long-term use of the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B). For patients who are allergic to aspirin, we recommend clopidogrel (Grade 1A). In patients with atrial fibrillation and a recent stroke or TIA, we recommend long-term oral anticoagulation (target international normalized ratio, 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. In patients with venous sinus thrombosis, we recommend unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) or low-molecular-weight heparin (Grade 1B) over no anticoagulant therapy during the acute phase.

1.2 Guideline recommendations for invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with NSTEMI

The standard of care for patients with NSTEMI at high ischemic risk is an early invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, with prompt revascularization using PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as clinically indicated. 13, 14, 15 Major international guidelines also recommend initiation of at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel) in patients with NSTEMI who are managed with medical therapy and/or who are treated with revascularization (ie, irrespective of initial treatment strategy), unless there are previous or ongoing contraindications. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Ticagrelor is recommended over clopidogrel for patients with NSTEMI, including those pretreated with clopidogrel (which should be discontinued when ticagrelor is started). Ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Prasugrel is recommended for patients with NSTEMI who have received angiography and are undergoing PCI. However, prasugrel is not recommended for patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown and an indication for PCI is not clearly established; patients who are 75 years of age or older; or patients with a body weight of less than 60 kg. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Clopidogrel is a less potent P2Y 12 inhibitor than ticagrelor and prasugrel; it is recommended for patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel, or who require oral anticoagulation. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Clinical risk scores, such as the DAPT score, can help guide decisions around whether to continue antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year, by providing a risk‐benefit ratio based on age, smoking status, comorbidity, and medical history. 19 For patients with NSTEMI who are elderly and have a high comorbidity burden, conservative treatment could be a reasonable approach. 16, 19

### Risks and complications of transurethral resection of bladder tumors in patients receiving antiplatelet and / or anticoagulant therapy: a retrospective cohort study [^cc80dd9e]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

International guidelines for percutaneous cardiovascular intervention advocate DAPT for ≥ 4 weeks after BMS implantation and for 6–12 months after DES implantation, and premature withdrawal of AP agents was shown to be related to a higher risk of cardiac ischemic or thromboembolic events associated with stent thrombosis. This rare but life-threatening complication usually manifests as acute myocardial infarction, with a mortality of 10%–40%, though the incidence of stent thrombosis can be increased up to 90-fold following premature discontinuation of DAPT. APs provide effective long-term secondary prevention of vascular events and ischemic stroke after acute or transient ischemic stroke. A systematic review of 287 randomized trials in patients at high risk of vascular occlusive events found that AP agents significantly decreased the risk of stroke by 31%. Interruption of aspirin therapy was a significant risk factor for a stroke event within 4 weeks after aspirin discontinuation (odds ratio 3.4), with the main reasons for interrupting aspirin therapy being surgery, the treating physician's decision that the therapy had no clear clinical benefit, and bleeding complications. Five of 493 (1%) patients who stopped continuous ACs to allow the performance of dental procedures developed severe embolic complications, resulting in four deaths. Overall, discontinuation of AP/AC agents is associated with severe thrombotic events and these drugs should be continued if at all possible.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^cbb1efbb]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline addresses the management of patients who are receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery or procedure.

Methods

The methods herein follow those discussed in the Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines. Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines article of this supplement.

Results

In patients requiring vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption before surgery, we recommend stopping VKAs 5 days before surgery instead of a shorter time before surgery (Grade 1B). In patients with a mechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation, or VTE at high risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation instead of no bridging during VKA interruption (Grade 2C); in patients at low risk, we suggest no bridging instead of bridging (Grade 2C). In patients who require a dental procedure, we suggest continuing VKAs with an oral prohemostatic agent or stopping VKAs 2 to 3 days before the procedure instead of alternative strategies (Grade 2C). In moderate- to high-risk patients who are receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and require noncardiac surgery, we suggest continuing ASA around the time of surgery instead of stopping ASA 7 to 10 days before surgery (Grade 2C). In patients with a coronary stent who require surgery, we recommend deferring surgery > 6 weeks after bare-metal stent placement and > 6 months after drug-eluting stent placement instead of undertaking surgery within these time periods (Grade 1C); in patients requiring surgery within 6 weeks of bare-metal stent placement or within 6 months of drug-eluting stent placement, we suggest continuing antiplatelet therapy perioperatively instead of stopping therapy 7 to 10 days before surgery (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Perioperative antithrombotic management is based on risk assessment for thromboembolism and bleeding, and recommended approaches aim to simplify patient management and minimize adverse clinical outcomes.

ASIPP perioperative antithrombotic management conclusion emphasizes balancing anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy with interventional pain procedures, noting that managing chronic pain in these patients is "a complex and increasingly common challenge that requires a multidisciplinary approach" and that "withholding anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy carries significant risks, including cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events." It states that "it is crucial to develop strategies that minimize interruptions in anticoagulant therapy while ensuring the safety and efficacy of pain management interventions," highlights "the need for tailored guidelines that consider the specific risks associated with different types of procedures and patient conditions," and adds that adherence to guidance and comprehensive understanding can help clinicians better navigate care, "ultimately improving outcomes and reducing the incidence of adverse events."

CYP2C19 catalyzes the bioactivation of the antiplatelet prodrug clopidogrel, and CYP2C19 genotype impacts clopidogrel active metabolite formation. CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizers who receive clopidogrel experience reduced platelet inhibition and increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. This guideline is an update to the 2013 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for the use of clopidogrel based on CYP2C19 genotype and includes expanded indications for CYP2C19 genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy, increased strength of recommendation for CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers, updated CYP2C19 genotype to phenotype translation, and evidence from an expanded literature review (updates at www.cpicpgx.org).

Summary of evidence.

The panel considered 2 RCTs and numerous observational studies that examined the temporary interruption of DAPT (stopping the P2Y 12 inhibitor while continuing ASA) in patients undergoing elective endoscopic GI procedures. Chan et al. conducted a double-blinded RCT to examine the bleeding and thrombosis rates among patients treated with either clopidogrel 75 mg or placebo for 7 days before the colonoscopy (N = 387; of which N = 216 had cold snare polypectomy). Of the 387 patients enrolled, 78.5% were on continuous ASA. There were similar rates of immediate and delayed postpolypectomy bleeding and a modest trend toward fewer cardiothromboembolic events with thienopyridine interruption: 1.3% (95% CI: 0.3%–5.0%) of patients receiving placebo vs 2.7% (95% CI: 1.0%–7.0%) in those with continued clopidogrel; RR = 0.47 (95% CI: 0.09–2.55). By contrast, Won et al. reported no thrombotic events with similar bleeding rates among 87 patients randomized to continue DAPT through a scheduled cold snare polypectomy (0/45 with placebo and 1/42 [2.4%] with DAPT).

The numerous observational studies examining periprocedural antiplatelet regimens have been summarized in a systematic review by Eisenberg et al. They assessed the time to late stent thrombosis (occurring between 30 days and 1 year after stent implantation) in patients with drug-eluting stents on DAPT after discontinuing thienopyridine alone or discontinuing both thienopyridine and ASA. However, the absolute risk of stent thrombosis within 10 days when a P2Y 12 inhibitor is discontinued while continuing ASA cannot be calculated because the denominator (patients at risk) is unknown. Nonetheless, among the 94 patients with stent thrombosis after discontinuing a P2Y 12 inhibitor but continuing ASA, only 6 cases (6%) occurred within 10 days, suggesting that late stent thrombosis is a greater problem than immediate stent thrombosis. There were no events reported in the 3–4 days after coronary intervention in this study. We note that this PICO considered only data regarding events occurring in the first 30 days after the intervention.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: management of individuals with bleeding or thrombotic disorders undergoing abortion [^c63b127f]. Contraception (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin and antiplatelet therapy during abortion — continuation and consultation — are addressed. In general, aspirin therapy does not increase the level of severity of bleeding complications or perioperative mortality related to bleeding complications, and Clinical recommendations endorse continuation of aspirin in the setting of low-risk or dental procedures; we recommend that aspirin be continued during a first-trimester procedural abortion. Peri-operative management of individuals on combination antiplatelet therapy should be discussed in consultation with the pertinent specialist to determine if discontinuation is appropriate, and consultation with a hematologist is appropriate; consultation may be particularly appropriate for individuals at high risk for thrombophilia, those already on anticoagulation (particularly therapeutic levels), those who may have a coagulopathy, or individuals undergoing a more complex procedural abortion.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin for mild ischemic stroke… [^7c8b0767]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT03635749 Acute mild ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack is associated with a high risk of subsequent stroke within 90 days. 1–3 Currently, dual antiplatelet therapy is considered to be a key strategy to prevent. early new stroke for these patients. 4 The efficacy and safety of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin in reducing the risk of early new stroke have been evaluated in patients with acute minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA within 24 hours after symptom onset. 5–7 Based on these trials, the current guidelines recommend early and short combination treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin for patients with minor stroke or TIA. 8, 9 These findings provided a feasible but narrow time window for secondary stroke prevention through DAPT.

However, there is uncertainty about the benefits and risks of DAPT for these patients with a prolonged initiation time window. In this subgroup analysis, we aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin in reducing the risk of new stroke at 90 days in patients with mild ischemic stroke and high-risk TIA among different initiation time windows of DAPT, especially when initiated from more than 24 hours to 48 hours and from more than 48 hours to 72 hours. Figure 2A shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curve of new stroke as the primary end point by different times to randomization.

For patients with mild ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA, the risk of new stroke within 90 days may be reduced with DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin by 15% when initiated within more than 24 hours to 48 hours and by 30% when initiated within more than 48 hours to 72 hours after symptom onset, with increases in the risk of moderate-to-severe bleeding similar across these time periods, although not statistically significant. Extension of the treatment time window of DAPT may benefit more patients, since the current guidelines recommend a short time window of opportunity for secondary stroke prevention. 8, 9 Previous studies showed that the risk of new stroke was still high in the second and third days after symptom onset of minor stroke and TIA, 3, 11, 12 indicating potential benefit from delayed DAPT for these patients.

### Outcomes associated with clopidogrel-aspirin use in minor stroke… [^1908eb13]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

This analysis suggests that, in patients with acute minor stroke or transient ischemic attack, dual antiplatelet therapy should be initiated as soon as possible, but preferably within 24 hours after symptom onset, and continued for a duration of 21 days. Importance Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin is effective for secondary prevention after minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Uncertainties remained about the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or TIA. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis of the POINT and CHANCE trials, the benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy appeared to be confined to the first 21 days after minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA. The primary safety outcome was the presence of major hemorrhage at 90 days. The secondary safety outcomes were hemorrhagic stroke, minor hemorrhage, major or minor hemorrhage, and death from any cause.

8 using the published survival curves, also indicated that dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel-aspirin for a duration of 21 days was associated with a reduction in stroke recurrence among patients with minor stroke or TIA. 5 Recently, several guidelines recommend early, short. -term dual antiplatelet therapy for minor stroke or high-risk TIA, 9–11 whereas others indicate it as an option12 or do not recommend it. 13 The BMJ recently produced a strong rapid recommendation of initiating clopidogrel-aspirin within 24 hours of the symptoms onset and continuing for 10 to 21 days for patients with minor stroke or high-risk TIA. 14 This pooled analysis of individual patient–level data provides additional support for recommending dual antiplatelet therapy for patients with minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA over a range of settings and populations. more effective and equally safe compared with aspirin alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA.

16 Another recent meta-analysis based on published data, mainly from CHANCE and POINT, also indicated that discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy within 21 days and possibly as early as 10 days might maximize benefit and minimize harms in patients with minor ischemic stroke or TIA. 5 The present pooled analysis shows that the benefits of clopidogrel-aspirin are realized in the first 21 days of treatment and not afterwards, providing further support for a 21-day duration of dual antiplatelet therapy.

Antiplatelet resistance and testing in carotid atherosclerosis — Reduced antiaggregant effect is more common with lower-dose aspirin (81 mg) or 325 mg enteric-coated than with 325 mg noncoated daily, and the routine laboratory evaluation of platelet reactivity is not justifiable. For clopidogrel, current evidence does not suggest the routine use of platelet function or genetic testing; patients with reduced platelet inhibition appear to be at increased risk for cardiovascular events, and in the absence of randomized trial data the general approach has been to confirm compliance and increase the dosage, followed by the addition or substitution of another antiplatelet agent, although data are insufficient to allow clear recommendations. Prasugrel is an alternate platelet-inhibiting pharmacologic agent approved for use in acute coronary syndromes, but no data are available on its use for stroke prevention.

Table 3, details such as drug name, dosage, route of administration, indication, and treatment duration should be communicated to the dentist. 9, 30 Patients should optimize their oral health before initiating bisphosphonates if possible. 30 For those already taking bisphosphonates, current literature has not shown a benefit to discontinuing the treatment perioperatively.
31. 32 It is helpful to provide the dentist with a recent glomerular filtration rate to determine the severity of renal disease. 5, 33 For patients receiving extracorporeal dialysis, scheduling dental procedures between dialysis days can prevent patient fatigue and complications of heparin. Providing a current INR, hemoglobin level, and platelet count may help the dentist assess the risk of bleeding.
33. 9, 30, 34, 44 Patients currently undergoing chemotherapy without radiation may receive routine dental care.

The dentist should be provided with a current medication list, and a complete blood count should be performed on the day of the planned treatment to ensure the absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1, 000 per μL and platelet count is greater than 50 × 10 3 per μL. 34 Any history of antiangiogenic treatments should be disclosed. Routine dental care should be postponed in patients currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy. 34 A history of head and neck radiation is associated with numerous oral complications, such as increased dental caries, xerostomia, and osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, and dentists should be provided with a detailed oncology history. This information is important because most cases of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw occur at sites exposed to greater than 60 Gy of radiation, and perioperative hyperbaric oxygen or other precautions may be indicated.

34, 45. Accessing the state prescription drug monitoring program, required in some jurisdictions, can help verify medication histories and help ensure that benzodiazepines are not being used concurrently. 37 Physicians should consider prescribing a naloxone antidote for patients at risk of an opioid overdose. 37 Communicating any history of addiction or contraindications to NSAIDs or acetaminophen can help the dentist select an appropriate analgesic regimen.

Spinal injections with antithrombotics continued (Endres et al., prospective follow-up) — prospectively evaluated 1,936 patients during 12,723 injection procedures, with antithrombotics or anticoagulants discontinued in 3,273 patients versus continued in 8,165. For transforaminal injections or facet injection, the reported risk when warfarin was continued had a 95% CI of 0.0% to 0.3%, and when clopidogrel was continued had a 95% CI of 0.0% to 0.4%. Among those receiving anticoagulants, none had injection-related complications, but 9 had pre-procedure medical complications (one fatal myocardial infarction, one fatal stroke, 5 non-fatal strokes, one pulmonary embolism, and one nonfatal myocardial infarction). The prevalence of these complications of ceasing warfarin was 9 in 1,886 (0.48%), with a 95% CI of 0.2% to 0.9%, and the risk rate of ceasing warfarin 0.2% to 0.9% was significantly greater than the risk rate of continuing warfarin 0.0% to 0.3% for transforaminal injections or facet injections.

### Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) [^91725472]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

5.1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function

Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [see Boxed Warning] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19.

Proton Pump Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of Plavix with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of Plavix [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2	 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including Plavix, increase the risk of bleeding. If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, discontinue Plavix five days prior to surgery. In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar (event rate 4.4% Plavix + aspirin; 5.3% placebo + aspirin). In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG, the major bleeding rate was 9.6% for Plavix + aspirin, and 6.3% for placebo + aspirin.

Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet (7–10 days), so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure. Because the half-life of clopidogrel's active metabolite is short, it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets; however, platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective.

5.3 Discontinuation of Plavix

Avoid lapses in therapy, and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued, restart as soon as possible. Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

5.4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or Stroke

In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding.

Advise patients to read FDA approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Discontinuation

Advise patients not to discontinue Plavix without first discussing it with the healthcare provider who prescribed it [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Bleeding

Advise patients that they:

will bruise and bleed more easily
will take longer than usual to stop bleeding
must report any unanticipated, prolonged, or excessive bleeding, or blood in their stool or urine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

Instruct patients to get prompt medical attention if they experience symptoms of TTP that cannot otherwise be explained [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Invasive Procedures

Advise patients to inform physicians and dentists that they are taking Plavix before any surgery or dental procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Proton Pump Inhibitors

Advise patients not to take omeprazole or esomeprazole while taking Plavix. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole had less pronounced effects on the antiplatelet activity of Plavix than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Chronic coronary disease — antiplatelet therapy with direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC): In patients with CCD who have undergone elective PCI and who require oral anticoagulant therapy, DAPT for 1 to 4 weeks followed by clopidogrel alone for 6 months should be administered in addition to DOAC. In patients with CCD who have undergone PCI and who require oral anticoagulant therapy, continuing aspirin in addition to clopidogrel for up to 1 month is reasonable if the patient has a high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. In patients with CCD who require oral anticoagulation and have a low atherothrombotic risk, discontinuation of aspirin therapy with continuation of DOAC alone may be considered 1 year after PCI to reduce bleeding risk. In patients with CCD who require oral anticoagulation, DOAC monotherapy may be considered if there is no acute indication for concomitant antiplatelet therapy.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^a53296fd]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related risk on prasugrel

Prasugrel is the third generation oral thienopyridine with faster onset and a more consistent irreversible platelet P2Y 12 blockade than the second-generation oral thienopyridine clopidogrel. This pharmacodynamic advantage over clopidogrel translated into a 19% relative risk reduction in ischaemic events in ACS patients undergoing PCI at the expense of increased major and fatal bleeding. Prasugrel (60-mg loading dose, 10-mg daily dose) in addition to aspirin is recommended over clopidogrel in P2Y 12 inhibitor-naïve ACS patients undergoing PCI with no history of prior stroke/TIA and in whom coronary anatomy is known. A lower maintenance dose of 5 mg is recommended in patients < 60 kg or > 75 years. In the TRITON-TIMI 38 study, a total of 368 (2.7%) ACS patients received at least one dose of study medication and subsequently underwent CABG surgery out of a total of 13 608 patients. Despite an increase in observed TIMI major bleeding (OR: 4.73, CI: 1.9–11.8), platelet transfusion and surgical re-exploration for bleeding, prasugrel was associated with a lower rate of death after CABG compared with clopidogrel (2.3 vs. 8.7%; OR ad 0.26; P = 0.025). More than 60% of patients received the last dose of study medication 5 or more days prior to CABG surgery, with the imbalance in the number of deaths attributable to patients who received last dose of study medication 4 or more days prior to surgery. It is recommended to discontinue prasugrel 7 days prior to CABG surgery, but it is also recognized that the level of platelet inhibition during prasugrel maintenance therapy tends to be less and more variable than in the days following a loading dose, raising the question as to whether platelet function testing may be useful under some circumstances to guide timing of cessation prior to surgery.

### Preoperative management of antiplatelet drugs for a coronary artery stent: how can we hit a moving target? [^d0b5d83f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Existing Guidelines for the Perioperative Management of Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with a Coronary Artery Stent

A recent systematic review identified 11 clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with a coronary stent who need non-cardiac surgery. These authors applied the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument (with a maximum score of 161) to assess the quality of the identified guidelines, Five of the 11 practice guidelines had an AGREE II score of > 100: American College of Chest Physicians, American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology, and Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons has also published updated guidelines on the management of antiplatelet therapy in cardiac and non-cardiac surgical patients.

However, despite some having AGREE II scores of greater than 100, a paucity of available definitive evidence has resulted in perioperative coronary artery stent guidelines that are divergent and vague on key issues. Recommendations vary regarding the amount of time which must elapse between stent placement and elective surgery in order to have an acceptable risk of acute stent thrombosis when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is discontinued. If DAPT must be interrupted within this critical period due to the risk of bleeding, the recommended timing of aspirin and thienopyridine discontinuation also varies.

These existing guidelines provide well-defined — albeit contradictory — recommendations on how long elective procedures should be delayed following coronary stent placement. However, for patients needing urgent surgery, while still presumably requiring DAPT, the recommendations concerning antiplatelet medications become vague. Most of the guidelines simply advise somehow weighing the risk of stent thrombosis against the risk of bleeding and, if at all possible, continuing the DAPT therapy throughout the perioperative period. The most current ACC/AHA guidelines do thoroughly review many of the risks associated with both stent thrombosis and surgical bleeding, but the incorporation of these risks into the final recommendations is incomplete.

### Contemporary use of guideline-based higher potency P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy in patients with moderate-to-high risk non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: results from the Canadian ACS reflective II cross-sectional study [^71ddcbf3]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

The Canadian ACS Reflective II, a prospective Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QuERI) is a knowledge translation program designed to evaluate physician decision‐making and choice of guideline‐recommended antiplatelet therapies in the management of NSTEMI patients. The program was conducted by the Canadian Heart Research Centre (CHRC), a not‐for‐profit academic research organization, with the oversight of a steering committee comprised of four Canadian cardiologists. The program objectives were: (1) to identify and describe NSTEMI patients who do not receive guideline‐recommended DAPT (ASA and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor), specifically higher potency P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, and (2) to identify opportunities where DAPT may be of potential benefit in the management of moderate‐to‐high risk patients. The local research ethics board at each participating center approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects.

Both academic and community based cardiologists and internists in Canada were invited to participate in the project. These included physicians who participated in the original ACS Reflective program as well as additional physicians who have participated previously in other ACS studies. Each physician was asked to enroll approximately 15–20 subjects each. Patient inclusion criteria were: age ≥ 18 years of age, hospitalization with NSTEMI (positive biomarker[s] for myocardial necrosis), and moderate‐to‐high risk NSTEMI (defined as ≥ 1 of the following criteria: ischemic ST‐segment changes; age ≥ 60 years; previous MI or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); coronary artery disease with stenosis ≥ 50% in ≥ 2 vessels; previous ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, carotid stenosis of ≥ 50% or cerebral revascularization; diabetes; peripheral arterial disease; or chronic renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2). Exclusion criteria included STEMI, unstable angina (i.e. ACS without positive cardiac biomarker[s] for myocardial necrosis), and ongoing participation in a research study where the oral antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant) were unknown or not approved for clinical use.

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^606d7720]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Smaller studies suggest reduced bleeding risk when anticoagulation is discontinued rather than continued without significantly increasing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. Subanalyses of pivotal randomized clinical trials — comparing the efficacy and safety of 4 DOACs to warfarin — provided insights into periprocedural management strategies for DOACs, reaching similar conclusions. These subanalyses of pivotal randomized clinical trials had limitations: few patients underwent scheduled procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk, and there were no standardized protocols for DOAC discontinuation. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that temporarily stopping DOAC administration during the periprocedural period may lower the risk of major bleeding without substantially increasing thromboembolic events.,

Prospective studies have evaluated periprocedural management of DOACs, including a meta-analysis comparing DOACs with warfarin in elective procedures under a noninterruption or short interruption strategy. This analysis demonstrated a 38% lower risk of major bleeding with DOAC treatment under a noninterruption strategy, with no differences observed under an interrupted strategy while maintaining comparable efficacy in stroke prevention and overall mortality. However, no prospective studies have focused on procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. The PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation) trial was the largest multicenter, multinational clinical study using a 1-arm design with a well-defined periprocedural DOAC management protocol for 3007 patients with AF undergoing procedures with high and low to moderate bleeding risk. The PAUSE trial found endoscopic procedures comprised 20.9% of total procedures, with ocular and dental procedures at 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. Other studies, and a registryreported that endoscopic procedures comprised 19.9% to 34.9% of the total procedures, while ocular or dental procedures accounted for only 3.9% to 13.4%. Although the PAUSE trialfound very low rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism (major bleeding rates of 0.9%-1.9% and stroke or thromboembolism rates of 0.2%-0.6% at 30 days after the procedure), with other studies reporting similar event rates, there was a small proportion of procedures with minimal bleeding risk included. The PERIXa study aligns with and expands on the findings of the PAUSE study in periprocedural DOAC management. The present study used data from a large multicenter study with a well-defined interruption protocol for factor Xa inhibitors in patients with AF undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^de60f619]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Interventional pain procedures — observational data and perioperative practice indicate that in a systematic review evaluating 31 reports, most patients can undergo dental procedures, arthrocentesis, cataract surgery, and diagnostic endoscopy without alteration of their anticoagulant regimen, whereas for other invasive and surgical procedures, oral anticoagulation needs to be withheld with individualized decisions about perioperative heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Data suggest that the traditional attitude of discontinuing the medication 7 days before interventions poses considerable risk, yet multiple guidelines recommend these polices and discontinuation has been a general practice. An evaluation by Manchikanti et al of over 18,000 procedures with over 12,000 encounters and over 3,000 patients showed no significant prevalence of adverse events in those who continued with or ceased antithrombotic therapy. Based on comprehensive review, most commonly, epidural hematomas appear spontaneously, with a large number of reports after regional anesthesia, and instances reported with interventional techniques in patients without antiplatelet therapy, with discontinued therapy, and with continued therapy. In a survey, epidural hematoma occurred in 29 patients with discontinuation of antiplatelet and warfarin therapy compared to 26 patients with continued antiplatelet therapy.

ACC/AHA/SCAI 2021 coronary revascularization — P2Y12 inhibitor use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is specified as follows: In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI, a loading dose of a P2Y12 inhibitor, followed by daily dosing, is recommended to reduce ischemic events (1 B-R); in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) undergoing PCI, a loading dose of clopidogrel, followed by daily dosing, is recommended to reduce ischemic events (1 C-LD); and in patients undergoing PCI within 24 hours after fibrinolytic therapy, a loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel, followed by daily dosing, is recommended to reduce ischemic events (1 C-LD). In ACS undergoing PCI, it is reasonable to use ticagrelor or prasugrel in preference to clopidogrel to reduce ischemic events, including stent thrombosis (2a B-R); in patients < 75 years of age undergoing PCI within 24 hours after fibrinolytic therapy, ticagrelor may be a reasonable alternative to clopidogrel to reduce ischemic events (2b B-R); and in patients undergoing PCI who have a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, prasugrel should not be administered (3: Harm B-R).

### Perioperative factor Xa inhibitor discontinuation for patients undergoing procedures with minimal or low bleeding risk [^d2792d38]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are crucial in preventing and treating thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Multiple trials and clinical practice studies have consistently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). These studies demonstrate that DOACs offer a similar or lower risk of stroke and significantly reduce intracranial hemorrhage compared with warfarin. Consequently, DOACs have largely supplanted warfarin and addressed the previous underuse of OACs.

Approximately 1 in 4 patients receiving anticoagulants requires temporary discontinuation of their medication for a planned procedure within 2 years. Annually, 15% to 20% of patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy require a procedure or surgery. With the increasing number of patients receiving DOAC therapy, temporary interruptions for elective procedures or surgery have become more common. Specific management of DOACs during the perioperative period has been suggested based on the type of DOAC and the bleeding risk of the procedure. However, there is a lack of robust evidence supporting current recommendations for perioperative DOAC management, especially for procedures deemed to have minimal to low bleeding risk by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)(overlapping with minor bleeding-risk intervention according to the European Heart Rhythm Association [EHRA] classification), such as gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, dental procedures, and ocular surgery.

Although bleeding risk stratification and recommendations for these procedures have been somewhat established in the field of cardiology, guidelines from different specialties offer varying recommendations on managing DOACs for these procedures. For instance, cardiology and gastroenterology societies differ in their definitions of procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk and advice on whether to continue or interrupt DOAC therapy. Similarly, dental and ophthalmology guidelines lack consistent definitions and recommendations for procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk. These inconsistencies underscore the need for a practical, standardized protocol for managing DOACs during procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Therefore, we designed the PERIXa study (Perioperative Factor Xa Inhibitor Discontinuation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Minimal to Low Bleed Risk Procedures) to explore the association of short-term perioperative discontinuation of factor Xa inhibitors with rates of major bleeding and thromboembolism among patients with AF undergoing procedures with minimal to low bleeding risk.

Antiplatelet drugs

Antiplatelet drugs are used in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. They may be taken individually or as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), usually following acute coronary syndromes or after coronary artery stenting. Aspirin inhibits the production of thromboxane. If taken alone it should be continued for most procedures until the day before surgery as most evidence suggests it does not increase bleeding, except for surgeries with a particularly high bleeding risk or surgery in a confined space (brain, posterior chamber of the eye, medullary canal) where it should be discontinued 5 days before the procedure. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor (P2Y12) antagonists (including clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor) are thienopyridines. They should be discontinued 5–7 days pre‐operatively. Consideration should be given to the use of haemadsorption filters if urgent or emergency cardiopulmonary bypass is undertaken in patients with P2Y12 inhibitors.

Antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary stents having non‐cardiac surgery

The management of these drugs in patients with coronary stents in situ is more challenging. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 4 weeks after the insertion of a bare metal stent and for 12 months after a drug‐eluting stent. The risk of peri‐operative adverse cardiac events reduces as time passes following the insertion of the stent. Very low bleeding‐risk procedures can be undertaken without stopping DAPT. Low bleeding‐risk procedures in patients with low thrombotic risk may be undertaken with discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist (5–7 days pre‐operatively) with aspirin continuing.

Ideally, elective surgery in patients deemed to be at high thrombotic risk (within 6 months of stent insertion) should be deferred until they are lower risk. If this is not possible it should proceed on aspirin with temporary discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist. Bridging with a parenteral short‐acting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, such as tirofiban or eptifibatide, during the period of ADP receptor antagonist withdrawal can also be considered in conjunction with cardiology input.

For emergency surgery, management depends on the antiplatelet agent and when the last dose was taken. Platelet transfusions have been proven to improve haemostasis. Platelet function testing may be helpful to determine the degree of platelet inhibition. Neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided when ADP antagonists have been taken within 7 days, although aspirin is generally thought to be safe to continue.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^5ad73431]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy — platelet aggregation inhibitors (ticlopidine/Ticlid, clopidogrel/Plavix, prasugrel/Effient) may be continued or discontinued prior to interventional techniques (evidence – fair); based on patient factors and managing cardiologist's opinion, if a decision is made to discontinue, they may be discontinued for 7 days with clopidogrel and prasugrel and/or 10 to 15 days with ticlopidine (evidence – fair). There is also emerging evidence that discontinuation of 3 days may be effective (evidence – limited), and if a clinician chooses to discontinue, they may be discontinued for 7 days (evidence – limited).
