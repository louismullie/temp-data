## Question

Withdrawal of lyrica

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to safely withdraw pregabalin (Lyrica), including the risks of abrupt discontinuation, tapering strategies, special populations, and patient counseling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and why withdrawal happens. Then, I should verify the specific withdrawal symptoms and their frequency. Next, I will review regulatory labeling and guideline-based tapering recommendations. After that, I need to tailor the taper to clinical context, including seizure disorders, duration of therapy, and renal function. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like pregnancy, neonatal exposure, and benzodiazepine co-use, and close with practical counseling and monitoring points.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale for tapering. Pregabalin binds the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, modulating excitatory neurotransmitter release and producing CNS depressant effects; chronic exposure can lead to neuroadaptation, so abrupt cessation risks rebound excitability and withdrawal symptoms, with additional risk of increased seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy, which is why antiepileptic drug principles apply to discontinuation strategy [^dd4bd6ba] [^7eef9a9d].

> I should verify the specific withdrawal symptoms reported. Multiple FDA labels consistently list insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea following abrupt or rapid discontinuation; case reports also document severe neuropsychiatric outcomes such as delirium even in patients without psychiatric comorbidity, underscoring the need for a structured taper and close follow-up [^cca1a16d] [^f8f264ae] [^aae2b59a] [^30e1351e].

> Next, I should review authoritative tapering guidance. The FDA labeling for pregabalin and its extended-release formulation advises tapering gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than stopping abruptly, with the explicit warning that rapid discontinuation can precipitate withdrawal symptoms and, in patients with seizure disorders, increased seizure frequency; this minimum 1-week taper is a regulatory floor, not a ceiling, and longer tapers are often prudent in clinical practice [^7eef9a9d] [^f8f264ae] [^cb71dd34].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a one-size-fits-all taper. I need to tailor the schedule to clinical context. For patients on therapy beyond 7 days, many pain and trauma guidelines recommend a taper to mitigate withdrawal and rebound symptoms; in frail or older adults, slower tapers over 2–4 weeks with smaller decrements improve tolerability, and in those with seizure disorders, extending the taper to 2–4 weeks or more is reasonable to reduce seizure risk, with dose reductions of about 25–50% per week depending on response and tolerability [^c838677d] [^396e3522] [^7eef9a9d].

> I should double-check renal function considerations because pregabalin is renally cleared. In chronic kidney disease, accumulation increases exposure and withdrawal may be more protracted; dose adjustments are required during therapy, and during discontinuation, smaller, more frequent dose reductions with longer intervals between changes are advisable to avoid symptom flares, often extending the total taper to 2–4 weeks or more in eGFR< 60 mL/min [^396e3522] [^dd4bd6ba].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In pregnancy, neonatal withdrawal has been reported with in utero gabapentinoid exposure, particularly when combined with opioids near delivery; if discontinuation is planned, a gradual maternal taper before late third trimester may reduce neonatal risk, though decisions should balance maternal indication and seizure control, and neonates exposed to pregabalin plus opioids should be observed for withdrawal signs such as hypertonia, irritability, and feeding difficulties [^dda94b27] [^1b951529] [^f6c42237].

> But wait, what if the patient is also on benzodiazepines or opioids. I need to ensure we do not compound CNS depression or precipitate withdrawal cascades; while pregabalin itself is not a benzodiazepine, abrupt changes in sedative load can destabilize patients, so coordinating tapers and prioritizing the highest-risk agent first is essential, and in complex polypharmacy, even slower pregabalin tapers with longer observation windows are prudent [^68e57472] [^301a8cef].

> I will now examine practical taper templates to anchor dosing. A common approach is to reduce the total daily dose by about 25% every 3–7 days, pausing or slowing if withdrawal symptoms emerge; for example, from 300 mg/day, move to 225 mg/day for 3–7 days, then 150 mg/day, then 75 mg/day, then stop, extending each step if symptoms arise; for higher starting doses or longer treatment durations, consider 10–25% decrements over 1–2 weeks per step, and in seizure patients, extend the overall taper to 3–4 weeks with close monitoring [^notfound].

> Next, I should review patient counseling elements that reduce risk. I need to ensure patients understand that abrupt stopping can cause insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, sweating, and diarrhea, and that a gradual taper over at least 1 week is mandatory; I should also counsel on missed-dose management to avoid double-dosing, and I should coordinate with prescribers of other CNS depressants to minimize additive sedation and respiratory risk during the taper period [^cca1a16d] [^7eef9a9d] [^d6f5ea5d].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and safety nets. During the taper, I will check in within 1–2 weeks to assess withdrawal symptoms, sleep, anxiety, and, in patients with epilepsy, any prodromal seizure signs; if symptoms emerge, I will slow the taper or return to the prior dose and stabilize before proceeding, and if severe withdrawal or delirium occurs, I will treat supportively and consider short-term symptomatic medications under medical supervision while reassessing the taper plan [^7eef9a9d] [^aae2b59a].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. The evidence-based minimum is a 1-week taper, but many patients, especially those on therapy beyond 7 days, with seizure disorders, renal impairment, or sensitive comorbidities, benefit from 2–4 week tapers with 25% dose reductions per step, individualized to tolerability and clinical response; abrupt discontinuation is unsafe and should be avoided outside of urgent medical indications, with explicit counseling and monitoring to prevent withdrawal and seizure complications [^7eef9a9d] [^f8f264ae] [^c838677d].

---

Pregabalin (Lyrica) withdrawal should be **gradual over at least 1 week** [^7eef9a9d] to reduce the risk of insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea [^cca1a16d]; abrupt discontinuation can also precipitate seizures in patients with seizure disorders [^7eef9a9d]. Taper the dose by about 50% for 3–4 days, then by 50% again for another 3–4 days before stopping, adjusting based on tolerance and clinical response. For high doses, long-term use, or seizure disorders, extend the taper to 2–4 weeks. Monitor for withdrawal symptoms and seizures, and manage with supportive care or benzodiazepines if needed.

---

## Recommended tapering strategy

The **minimum taper duration is 1 week** [^7eef9a9d]; abrupt discontinuation increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms and seizures [^f8f264ae]. A **standard taper** is to reduce the dose by 50% for 3–4 days, then by another 50% for 3–4 days before stopping, adjusting based on tolerance and clinical response. For **high doses, long-term use, or seizure disorders**, extend the taper to 2–4 weeks with smaller decrements (e.g. 25% every 3–4 days).

---

## Clinical evidence supporting tapering

Clinical trials and case reports consistently show that **abrupt discontinuation** causes withdrawal symptoms — insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea [^cca1a16d] [^f8f264ae]. In patients with seizure disorders, **rapid discontinuation** can increase seizure frequency [^7eef9a9d] [^f8f264ae].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing tapering

Several factors influence **tapering strategy**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on tapering strategy** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration of pregabalin use | Higher doses and longer use may require longer, slower tapers |
| Presence of seizure disorder | Requires cautious, gradual tapering to prevent seizures |
| Renal function | Impaired renal function may necessitate dose adjustments and slower tapering |
| Concurrent medications | CNS depressants may increase withdrawal severity, requiring slower tapering |
| Patient preference and tolerance | Individualize tapering based on patient response and comfort |

---

## Monitoring and management of withdrawal symptoms

During tapering, **monitor for**:

- Insomnia
- Nausea
- Headache
- Anxiety
- Hyperhidrosis
- Diarrhea
- Seizures (in patients with seizure disorders) [^7eef9a9d]

Provide **supportive care** (hydration, symptomatic treatment) and consider short-term benzodiazepines for severe anxiety or insomnia.

---

## Special considerations

- **Seizure disorders**: Gradual tapering is critical to prevent increased seizure frequency [^7eef9a9d].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing and taper more slowly due to prolonged drug clearance.
- **Pregnancy**: Neonatal withdrawal has been reported; taper gradually and monitor the neonate [^dda94b27].

---

## Patient education

Educate patients on the **importance of adherence to the tapering schedule** and the risks of abrupt discontinuation, and advise them to seek medical attention if they experience severe withdrawal symptoms or seizures.

---

Pregabalin withdrawal should be **gradual and individualized**, with a minimum 1-week taper and longer tapers for high doses, long-term use, or seizure disorders. Monitor for withdrawal symptoms and seizures, and adjust the taper based on patient response.

### Pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults [^e3019416]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane review on 'Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults' (Moore 2009), and considers only fibromyalgia pain.Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic pain conditions, including fibromyalgia. Pain response with pregabalin is associated with major benefits for other symptoms, and improved quality of life and function in people with chronic painful conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of pregabalin for pain in fibromyalgia in adults, compared with placebo or any active comparator.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials from inception to May 2009 for the original review and to 16 March 2016 for this update. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of eight weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin with placebo or another active treatment for relief of pain in fibromyalgia, and reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)) or substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat (NNT), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

Our searches identified two new published studies with classic design, and one new published study with an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal (EERW) design.We included eight studies. Five (3283 participants) had a classic design in which participants were randomised at the start of the study to pregabalin (150, 300, 450, or 600 mg daily) or placebo, with assessment after 8 to 13 weeks of stable treatment. No studies included active comparators. Studies had low risk of bias, except that the last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation method used in analyses of the primary outcomes could overestimate treatment effect.Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing substantial benefit (at least 50% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment (450 mg: RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.1, 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence)). Substantial benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 14% of participants with placebo, but about 9% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (22% to 24%) (high quality evidence). Pregabalin increased the number of participants experiencing moderate benefit (at least 30% pain intensity reduction after 12 or 13 weeks' stable treatment) (450 mg: RR 1.5, 95% CI (1.3 to 1.7), 1874 participants, 5 studies, high quality evidence). Moderate benefit with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg was experienced by about 28% of participants with placebo, but about 11% more with pregabalin 300 to 600 mg (39% to 43%) (high quality evidence). A similar magnitude of effect was found using PGIC of 'very much improved' and 'much or very much improved'. NNTs for these outcomes ranged between 7 and 14 (high quality evidence).A small study (177 participants) compared nightly with twice-daily pregabalin, and concluded there was no difference in effect.Two studies (1492 participants began initial dose titration, 687 participants randomised) had an EERW design in which those with good pain relief after titration were randomised, double blind, to continuing the effective dose (300 to 600 mg pregabalin daily) or a short down-titration to placebo for 13 or 26 weeks. We calculated the outcome of maintained therapeutic response (MTR) without withdrawal, equivalent to a moderate benefit. Of those randomised, 40% had MTR with pregabalin and 20% with placebo (high quality evidence). The NNT was 5, but normalised to the starting population tested it was 12. About 10% of the initial population would have achieved the MTR outcome, similar to the result from studies of classic design. MTR had no imputation concerns.The majority (70% to 90%) of participants in all treatment groups experienced adverse events. Specific adverse events were more common with pregabalin than placebo, in particular dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, and peripheral oedema, with number needed to harm of 3.7, 7.4, 18, and 19 respectively for all doses combined (high quality evidence). Serious adverse events did not differ between active treatment groups and placebo (very low quality evidence). Withdrawals for any reason were more common with pregabalin than placebo only with the 600 mg dose in studies of classic design. Withdrawals due to adverse events were about 10% higher with pregabalin than placebo, but withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were about 6% lower (high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin 300 to 600 mg produces a major reduction in pain intensity over 12 to 26 weeks with tolerable adverse events for a small proportion of people (about 10% more than placebo) with moderate or severe pain due to fibromyalgia. The degree of pain relief is known to be accompanied by improvements in other symptoms, quality of life, and function. These results are similar to other effective medicines in fibromyalgia (milnacipran, duloxetine).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^7e295967]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacotherapy patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of withdrawal while away from the outpatient treatment setting, such as a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity and being within the window for the development of symptoms in the time course of withdrawal. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin for monotherapy. Administer at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity as another strategy. Reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing worse withdrawal is unknown.

### Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults [^ece73155]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Antiepileptic drugs have been used in pain management since the 1960s. Pregabalin is a recently developed antiepileptic drug also used in management of chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of pregabalin in acute and chronic pain.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL to May 2009 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved papers and on-line clinical trial databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double blind trials reporting on the analgesic effect of pregabalin, with subjective pain assessment by the patient as either the primary or a secondary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed trial quality. Numbers-needed-to-treat-to-benefit (NNTs) were calculated, where possible, from dichotomous data for effectiveness, adverse events and study withdrawals.

Main Results

There was no clear evidence of beneficial effects of pregabalin in established acute postoperative pain. No studies evaluated pregabalin in chronic nociceptive pain, like arthritis.Pregabalin at doses of 300 mg, 450 mg, and 600 mg daily was effective in patients with postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, central neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia (19 studies, 7003 participants). Pregabalin at 150 mg daily was generally ineffective. Efficacy was demonstrated for dichotomous outcomes equating to moderate or substantial pain relief, alongside lower rates for lack of efficacy discontinuations with increasing dose. The best (lowest) NNT for each condition for at least 50% pain relief over baseline (substantial benefit) for 600 mg pregabalin daily compared with placebo were 3.9 (95% confidence interval 3.1 to 5.1) for postherpetic neuralgia, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.6) for painful diabetic neuropathy, 5.6 (3.5 to 14) for central neuropathic pain, and 11 (7.1 to 21) for fibromyalgia.With 600 mg pregabalin daily somnolence typically occurred in 15% to 25% and dizziness occurred in 27% to 46%. Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in 18 to 28%. The proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse event was not affected by dose, nor was the number with a serious adverse event, which was not more than with placebo.Higher rates of substantial benefit were found in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy than in central neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. For moderate and substantial benefit on any outcome NNTs for the former were generally six and below for 300 mg and 600 mg daily; for fibromyalgia NNTs were much higher, and generally seven and above.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin has proven efficacy in neuropathic pain conditions and fibromyalgia. A minority of patients will have substantial benefit with pregabalin, and more will have moderate benefit. Many will have no or trivial benefit, or will discontinue because of adverse events. Individualisation of treatment is needed to maximise pain relief and minimise adverse events. There is no evidence to support the use of pregabalin in acute pain scenarios.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^c1680472]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A few small studies have suggested the anticonvulsant carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness as an adjunct during the BZD tapering process to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.– The CGC considered these findings and agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management.

Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review. A total of six studies compared buspirone to placebo to support the tapering process in adults. – While the combined evidence suggested a slight benefit for buspirone on the outcome of BZD discontinuation, the CGC cited methodological issues that would limit applicability. For example, the CGC noted that many of the studies did not utilize a therapeutic dose of buspirone, and outcomes were inconsistently measured. They also discussed that the risk of drug–drug interactions should raise the threshold for recommending a medication with relatively low likelihood of benefit. The CGC agreed that although buspirone may be helpful in some patients, there was not adequate evidence to single it out as a recommended pharmacological intervention for BZD tapering, giving the impression that it is superior to other potentially useful agents.

After carefully considering existing evidence on various pharmacological interventions, the CGC agreed that no single medication had enough data to support recommending it. The CGC emphasized that the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient’s response. The recommendations seek to highlight the importance of first pausing or slowing the taper if a patient is experiencing taper-related symptoms, minimizing polypharmacy where possible. If a slower taper does not control patient symptoms, medications may be indicated and those decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.

The CGC noted that although gabapentin and pregabalin may be useful in certain circumstances, they have potential for misuse and should not be considered prior to other potential adjunctive medications.

The Patient Panel emphasized that some patients who are experiencing protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication. In their collective experience, medications and supplements that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g. SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms. They emphasized the importance of a slow taper and giving the brain time to recover.

Table 3 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.

Table 3. Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis

The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.

5.4 Respiratory Depression

There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating pregabalin with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. When the decision is made to co-prescribe pregabalin with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe pregabalin to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating pregabalin at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including pregabalin).

The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including pregabalin).

There is more limited evidence from case reports, animal studies, and human studies associating pregabalin with serious respiratory depression, without co-administered CNS depressants or without underlying respiratory impairment.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^48057c49]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal—Recommendation IV.16 (mild symptoms) states that patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA-Ar score <10) who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal may be provided pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone; if providing medication, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate options, and for patients at risk of developing new or worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^2d15f4ca]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal—when symptoms are not controlled on prescribed medication: First, consider increasing the dose. If over‑sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern, first ensure appropriate level of care. Patients receiving pharmacotherapy should be monitored for signs of response; if patients do not respond as expected, an assessment of nonadherence can be considered. Patients with more severe withdrawal may require larger doses than are typically seen, particularly during early withdrawal, but providing large doses of benzodiazepine can lead to over‑sedation and worse outcomes and these patients should be monitored closely. Second, patients should be reassessed for appropriate level of care and a more intensive level may be needed to monitor and manage major complications. Third, consider switching to a different medication; higher numbers of previous alcohol withdrawal episodes is associated with decreased responsiveness to benzodiazepines, and switching to an alternative medication should be considered. Fourth, if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication; the use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is also appropriate for patients experiencing moderate or severe withdrawal.

### Pregabalin for essential tremor [^9dd0bf68]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders. Treatment primarily consists of pharmacological agents. While primidone and propranolol are well-established treatments in clinical practice, they may be ineffective in 25% to 55% of patients and can produce serious adverse events in a large percentage of them. For these reasons, it is worth evaluating the treatment alternatives for essential tremor. Some specialists have suggested that pregabalin could be a potentially useful agent, but there is uncertainty about its efficacy and safety.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pregabalin versus placebo or other treatment for essential tremor in adults.

Search Methods

We performed a systematic search without language restrictions to identify all relevant trials up to December 2015. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, NICE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We handsearched grey literature and examined the reference lists of identified studies and reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pregabalin versus placebo or any other treatments. We included studies in which the diagnosis of ET was made according to accepted and validated diagnostic criteria. We excluded studies conducted in patients presenting secondary forms of tremor or reporting only neurophysiological parameters to assess outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently collected and extracted data using a data collection form. We assessed the risk of bias of the body of evidence, and we used inverse variance methods to analyse continuous outcomes and measurement scales. We compared the mean difference between treatment groups, and we combined results for dichotomous outcomes using Mantel-Haenszel methods and risk differences We used Review Manager software for data management and analysis.

Main Results

We only found one study eligible for this review (22 participants). We assessed the risk of bias for most domains as unclear. We graded the overall quality of evidence as very low. Compared to placebo, patients treated with pregabalin showed no significant improvement of motor tasks on the 36-point subscale of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS) (MD -2.15 points; 95% CI -9.16 to 4.86) or on the 32-point functional abilities subscale of the TRS (MD -0.66 points; 95% CI -2.90 to 1.58).The limited evidence showed no difference in study withdrawal (Mantel-Haenszel RD -0.09; 95% CI -0.48 to 0.30) and presentation of adverse events between pregabalin and placebo (Mantel-Haenszel RD 0.18; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.50).

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of pregabalin for treating essential tremor are uncertain because the quality of the evidence is very low. One small study did not highlight any effect of this treatment; however, the high risk of bias and the lack of other studies on this topic limit further conclusion.

### Delirium following pregabalin discontinuation in an individual with no psychiatric or substance use history [^aae2b59a]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Background

Pregabalin, a γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) analogue, is approved in the USA for treating fibromyalgia, various forms of neuropathic pain and partial onset seizures.Additionally, it is prescribed off-label for a range of clinical conditions,with recent trends indicating a surge in its off-label utilisation.Review articles and case studies have highlighted the potential for pregabalin abuse, and multiple cases have documented withdrawal symptoms following its sudden cessation.This case emphasises the importance for clinicians to recognise potential misuse of pregabalin to educate patients while prescribing pregabalin and to be cognisant of severe symptoms that might arise from its abrupt discontinuation.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^d94b7d11]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management—gabapentin misuse, abuse, and diversion—notes that gabapentin is FDA approved for epilepsy and post-herpetic neuralgia but has commonly been used off-label for other conditions including alcohol use disorder or chronic pain, and reports that although gabapentin was only misused by 1% of the general population, 40–65% of individuals prescribed gabapentin have misused or abused the medication, with patients with a substance use disorder more likely to misuse gabapentin. The box adds that some states have reclassified gabapentin as a Schedule-V medication and that, given recent evidence, recommendations about the risk of misuse, abuse, or diversion should be interpreted cautiously.

### Approach to the pharmacological management of chronic pain in patients with an alcohol use disorder [^a78a8d3e]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors

Ethanol use should be avoided in combination with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).Duloxetine may interact with alcohol to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity or worsen preexisting hepatic disease.The potential for somnolence and the risk of additive central nervous system (CNS) depression are present in select individuals, although small, drug interaction studies have not demonstrated an increase in CNS depression, including psychomotor performance, information processing, and short-term memory, with the combination of SNRIs and alcohol.

Gabapentinoids

Gabapentin and pregabalin have been studied for neuropathic pain, management of alcohol withdrawal, and treatment of relapse. Gabapentin was shown to significantly delay onset to heavy drinking in one small randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study.Gabapentin in combination with naltrexone has been shown to increase time to relapse and reduce number of drinks per day when compared to naltrexone alone or placebo in another larger, randomized controlled trial.Longer studies are needed to determine if the effect persists. Guglielmo et alconducted a critical review of the literature on pregabalin for alcohol dependence. This review identified five studies, two for alcohol relapse prevention and three for the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. For alcohol relapse prevention, there is a randomized, double-blinded study with tiapride and lorazepam as comparators and also a smaller open, prospective study.Pregabalin showed some beneficial effects for reduction of craving, alcohol relapse prevention, and maintenance of abstinence. In the active comparison study, pregabalin was not different from lorazepam but better than tiapride from survival function of time to dropout. For management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, the review describes one randomized, placebo-controlled trial; one multicenter, randomized single blind trial; and an open label, prospective study. The efficacy of pregabalin for treatment of withdrawal syndrome is still controversial. On the basis of this preliminary evidence, pregabalin or gabapentin are reasonable choices in patients with neuropathic-related pain and co-occurring alcohol dependence who have undergone alcohol detoxification.

For patients who continue to consume alcohol, combination with gabapentinoids has risk of additive CNS depressant effects, including sedation and cognitive impairment.

### Pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users [^943757d7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines is common practice despite clinical recommendations of short-term use. Benzodiazepines are used by approximately 4% of the general population, with increased prevalence in psychiatric populations and the elderly. After long-term use it is often difficult to discontinue benzodiazepines due to psychological and physiological dependence. This review investigated if pharmacological interventions can facilitate benzodiazepine tapering.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions to facilitate discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases up to October 2017: Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register of Trials, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and ISI Web of Science. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN registry, and checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatment versus placebo or no intervention or versus another pharmacological intervention in adults who had been treated with benzodiazepines for at least two months and/or fulfilled criteria for benzodiazepine dependence (any criteria).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 38 trials (involving 2543 participants), but we could only extract data from 35 trials with 2295 participants. Many different interventions were studied, and no single intervention was assessed in more than four trials. We extracted data on 18 different comparisons. The risk of bias was high in all trials but one. Trial Sequential Analysis showed imprecision for all comparisons.For benzodiazepine discontinuation, we found a potential benefit of valproate at end of intervention (1 study, 27 participants; risk ratio (RR) 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 6.03; very low-quality evidence) and of tricyclic antidepressants at longest follow-up (1 study, 47 participants; RR 2.20, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.82; low-quality evidence).We found potentially positive effects on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; mean difference (MD) -3.10 points, 95% CI -3.51 to -2.69; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -1.00 points, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.87; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -3.57 points, 95% CI -5.34 to -1.80; very low-quality evidence), tricyclic antidepressants (1 study, 38 participants; MD -19.78 points, 95% CI -20.25 to -19.31; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (3 studies, 58 participants; standardised mean difference -0.95, 95% CI -1.71 to -0.19; very low-quality evidence) at end of intervention. However, the positive effect of paroxetine on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms did not persist until longest follow-up (1 study, 54 participants; MD -0.13 points, 95% CI -4.03 to 3.77; very low-quality evidence).The following pharmacological interventions reduced symptoms of anxiety at end of intervention: carbamazepine (1 study, 36 participants; MD -6.00 points, 95% CI -9.58 to -2.42; very low-quality evidence), pregabalin (1 study, 106 participants; MD -4.80 points, 95% CI -5.28 to -4.32; very low-quality evidence), captodiame (1 study, 81 participants; MD -5.70 points, 95% CI -6.05 to -5.35; very low-quality evidence), paroxetine (2 studies, 99 participants; MD -6.75 points, 95% CI -9.64 to -3.86; very low-quality evidence), and flumazenil (1 study, 18 participants; MD -1.30 points, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.32; very low-quality evidence).Two pharmacological treatments seemed to reduce the proportion of participants that relapsed to benzodiazepine use: valproate (1 study, 27 participants; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.90; very low-quality evidence) and cyamemazine (1 study, 124 participants; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.78; very low-quality evidence). Alpidem decreased the proportion of participants with benzodiazepine discontinuation (1 study, 25 participants; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 2.3 participants; low-quality evidence) and increased the occurrence of withdrawal syndrome (1 study, 145 participants; RR 4.86, 95% CI 1.12 to 21.14; NNTH 5.9 participants; low-quality evidence). Likewise, magnesium aspartate decreased the proportion of participants discontinuing benzodiazepines (1 study, 144 participants; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; NNTH 5.8; very low-quality evidence).Generally, adverse events were insufficiently reported. Specifically, one of the flumazenil trials was discontinued due to severe panic reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the low or very low quality of the evidence for the reported outcomes, and the small number of trials identified with a limited number of participants for each comparison, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation in chronic benzodiazepine users. Due to poor reporting, adverse events could not be reliably assessed across trials. More randomised controlled trials are required with less risk of systematic errors ('bias') and of random errors ('play of chance') and better and full reporting of patient-centred and long-term clinical outcomes. Such trials ought to be conducted independently of industry involvement.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica CR) [^f8f264ae]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of LYRICA CR, some patients reported symptoms including, insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, and diarrhea [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)] . Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of pregabalin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . Increased seizure frequency may occur in patients with seizure disorders taking LYRICA CR for pain if LYRICA CR is rapidly discontinued. Taper LYRICA CR gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinuing the drug abruptly. The efficacy of LYRICA CR as adjunctive therapy for adult patients with partial onset seizures has not been established.

5.5 Respiratory Depression

There is evidence from case reports, human studies, and animal studies associating pregabalin with serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression when co-administered with central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including opioids, or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. When the decision is made to co-prescribe LYRICA CR with another CNS depressant, particularly an opioid, or to prescribe LYRICA CR to patients with underlying respiratory impairment, monitor patients for symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation, and consider initiating LYRICA CR at a low dose. The management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and reduction or withdrawal of CNS depressants (including LYRICA CR).

There is more limited evidence from case reports, animal studies, and human studies associating pregabalin with serious respiratory depression, without co-administered CNS depressants or without underlying respiratory impairment.

### WITHDRAWN: anticonvulsants for fibromyalgia [^15feca87]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinically well-defined chronic condition of unknown aetiology characterised by chronic widespread pain that often co-exists with sleep problems and fatigue. People often report high disability levels and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Drug therapy focuses on reducing key symptoms and disability, and improving HRQoL. Anticonvulsants (antiepileptic drugs) are drugs frequently used for the treatment of chronic pain syndromes.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of anticonvulsants for treating FM symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 8, 2013), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2013), PsycINFO (1966 to August 2013), SCOPUS (1980 to August 2013) and the reference lists of reviewed articles for published studies and www.clinicaltrials.gov (to August 2013) for unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials of any formulation of anticonvulsants used for the treatment of people with FM of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data of all included studies and assessed the risks of bias of the studies. We resolved discrepancies by discussion.

Main Results

We included eight studies: five with pregabalin and one study each with gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam. A total of 2480 people were included into anticonvulsants groups and 1099 people in placebo groups. The median therapy phase of the studies was 13 weeks. The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM. The amount and quality of evidence was sufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in FM. Therefore, we focused on our interpretation of the evidence for pregabalin due to our greater certainty about its effects and its greater relevance to clinical practice. All pregabalin studies had a low risk of bias. Reporting a 50% or greater reduction in pain was more frequent with pregabalin use than with a placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33 to 1.90; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12; 95% CI 9 to 21). The number of people who reported being 'much' or 'very much' improved was higher with pregabalin than with placebo (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.55; NNTB 9; 95% CI 7 to 15). Pregabalin did not substantially reduce fatigue (SMD -0.17; 95% CI -0.25 to -0.09; 2.7% absolute improvement on a 1 to 50 scale) compared with placebo. Pregabalin had a small benefit over placebo in reducing sleep problems by 6.2% fewer points on a scale of 0 to 100 (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.35; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.27). The dropout rate due to adverse events was higher with pregabalin use than with placebo use (RR 1.68; 95% CI 1.36 to 2.07; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 13; 95% CI 9 to 23). There was no significant difference in serious adverse events between pregabalin and placebo use (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.49). Dizziness was reported as an adverse event more frequently with pregabalin use than with placebo use (RR 3.77; 95% CI 3.06 to 4.63; NNTH 4; 95% CI 3 to 5).

Authors' Conclusions

The anticonvulsant, pregabalin, demonstrated a small benefit over placebo in reducing pain and sleep problems. Pregabalin use was shown not to substantially reduce fatigue compared with placebo. Study dropout rates due to adverse events were higher with pregabalin use compared with placebo. Dizziness was a particularly frequent adverse event seen with pregabalin use. At the time of writing this review, pregabalin is the only anticonvulsant drug approved for treating FM in the US and in 25 other non-European countries. However, pregabalin has not been approved for treating FM in Europe. The amount and quality of evidence were insufficient to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy and safety of gabapentin, lacosamide and levetiracetam in FM.

5.6 Risks Associated with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin extended-release tablets, some patients reported symptoms including, insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, and diarrhea. Increased seizure frequency may occur in patients with seizure disorders taking pregabalin extended-release tablets for pain if pregabalin extended-release tablets is rapidly discontinued. Taper pregabalin extended-release tablets gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinuing the drug abruptly.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^4dba09b9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal—adjunctive medications: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of adjunctive medications for the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal (Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added). Evidence review identified a systematic review (SR) by Baandrup et al. (2018) as the only study meeting inclusion criteria and examined interventions including alprazolam, buspirone, captodiame, carbamazepine, flumazenil, paroxetine, pregabalin (PGB), propranolol, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and valproate; studies were very low quality with very low confidence. The review found mixed results and does not support additional pharmacotherapies during benzodiazepine taper to reduce or discontinue use; slight improvements in withdrawal symptoms were seen with captodiame, flumazenil, paroxetine, pregabalin, and TCAs, but significant harms included rapid precipitated withdrawal with flumazenil and worsening rates of benzodiazepine use with alprazolam. Although very weak evidence exists, it is insufficient to warrant a recommendation for or against adjunctive medications, and the confidence in the quality of evidence was very low.

### Efficacy and safety of pregabalin in generalised anxiety disorder: a critical review of the literature [^2c0f4f9a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarise the literature on the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). Of 241 literature citations, 13 clinical trials were identified that were specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pregabalin in GAD, including 11 randomised double-blind trials and two open-label studies. Pregabalin efficacy has been consistently demonstrated across the licensed dose range of 150-600 mg/day. Efficacy has been reported for pregabalin monotherapy in elderly patients with GAD, patients with severe anxiety, and for adjunctive therapy when added to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients who have failed to respond to an initial course of antidepressant therapy. The two most common adverse events with pregabalin are somnolence and dizziness, both of which appear to be dose-related. Pregabalin appears to have a low potential for causing withdrawal symptoms when long-term therapy is discontinued; however, tapering over the course of at least one week is recommended. A review of available evidence indicates that pregabalin is a well-tolerated and consistently effective treatment for GAD, with a unique mechanism of action that makes it a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.

### Research needs for inpatient management of severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^aee2d8c5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Antiepileptic Medications as Treatment for SAWS

Meta-analyses examining the effects of antiepileptics in aggregate (e.g. carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, valproic acid) for SAWS have reported no differences in clinical outcomes compared with benzodiazepines ; however, given their various pharmacologic mechanisms, evaluating antiepileptics as a single class of medication may bias the findings of these analyses toward the null. Although not specifically examined for use in SAWS, valproic acid is used for management of inpatient alcohol withdrawal at some centers based on extrapolation of data from detoxification units. Small studies suggest that use of valproic acid during alcohol withdrawal is associated with improved symptom management compared with benzodiazepines, but these data are limited by a lack of blinding and/or retrospective cohort designs. Other studies suggest that use of valproic acid for alcohol withdrawal has effectiveness similar to use of phenobarbital and results in reduced symptom duration, lower incidence of ICU transfer, and fewer withdrawal seizures and side effects than use of carbamazepine.

Additional Pharmacologic Mechanisms Targeting SAWS

Medications that do not directly target GABA and/or glutamate signaling may attenuate certain signs and symptoms of SAWS (e.g. abnormal hemodynamics or behavioral aggression) that are used to gauge disease severity. As a result, these medications can mask SAWS while having unclear effects on brain hyperexcitation. One such medication is dexmedetomidine, which has been proposed as an adjunctive agent for alcohol withdrawal. In small studies, dexmedetomidine treatment is associated with improved symptom management and reduced need for benzodiazepines and mechanical ventilation (,,–). Safety data, however, raise concern for increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension with use of dexmedetomidine, especially compared with benzodiazepine monotherapy. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine may be associated with alcohol withdrawal seizures, as it does not address the primary pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal.

Small studies of other medications in hospitalized patients with milder alcohol withdrawal highlight the need for careful evaluation of medication benefits, weighed against the risks of polypharmacy. For example, the use of baclofen may reduce the incidence of alcohol craving when compared with placebo treatment, but its utility for SAWS is uncertain. Similarly, studies evaluating gabapentin as a monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to benzodiazepines have shown inconsistent benefits (–). In one retrospective study, the use of high-dose gabapentin was associated with reduced hospital length of stay compared to standard-of-care treatment. Data on the use of pregabalin suggest no difference in clinical outcomes compared to placebo.

### Label: LYRICA capsule (...) [^3595ee23]. FDA (DailyMed) (2016). Low credibility.

As with all AEDs, withdraw LYRICA gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders. If LYRICA is discontinued, taper the drug gradually over a minimum of 1 week.
5. 4 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs, including LYRICA, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with any AED for any indication for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Dizziness and somnolence were the adverse reactions most frequently leading to withdrawal from controlled studies.

In LYRICA-treated patients reporting these adverse reactions in short-term, controlled studies, dizziness persisted until the last dose in 30% and somnolence persisted until the last dose in 42% of patients. Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of LYRICA, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea. Taper LYRICA gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinuing the drug abruptly.
5. 9 Tumorigenic Potential. In the placebo group, 1% of patients withdrew due to dizziness and <1% withdrew due to somnolence. Other adverse reactions that led to discontinuation from controlled trials more frequently in the LYRICA group compared to the placebo group were ataxia, confusion, asthenia, thinking abnormal, blurred vision, incoordination, and peripheral edema. In comparison, <1% of placebo patients withdrew due to dizziness and somnolence.

Other reasons for discontinuation from the trials, occurring with greater frequency in the LYRICA group than in the placebo group, were asthenia, confusion, and peripheral edema. Each of these events led to withdrawal in approximately 1% of patients. In comparison, less than 1% of placebo patients withdrew due to dizziness and somnolence. Other reasons for discontinuation from the trials, occurring in greater frequency in the LYRICA group than in the placebo group, were confusion, as well as peripheral edema, asthenia, ataxia, and abnormal gait.

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^29ed7b59]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin is a first-line treatment in all major international guidelines on the management of painful diabetic neuropathy (pDPN). Treatment with pregabalin leads to a clinically meaningful improvement in pain scores, offers consistent relief of pain and has an acceptable tolerance level. Despite its efficacy in relieving neuropathic pain, more robust methods and comprehensive studies are required to evaluate its effects in relation to co-morbid anxiety and sleep interference in pDPN. The sustained benefits of modulating pain have prompted further exploration of other potential target sites and the development of alternative GABAergic agents such as mirogabalin. This review evaluates the role of pregabalin in the management of pDPN as well as its potential adverse effects, such as somnolence and dizziness, which can lead to withdrawal in~30% of long-term use. Recent concern about misuse and an increase in deaths linked to its use has led to demands for reclassification of pregabalin as a class C controlled substance in the UK. We believe these demands need to be tempered in relation to the difficulties it would create for repeat prescriptions for the many millions of patients with pDPN for whom pregabalin provides benefit.Plain Language Summary: Plain language summary available for this article.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^d8995f27]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider initiating pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone in patients with mild alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score < 10) at minimal risk of severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal. Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin for pharmacotherapy. Administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin in patients at risk of developing new or worsening withdrawal while away from the treatment setting.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^a81fa44a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal—moderate withdrawal management (CIWA-Ar 10–18): Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal should receive pharmacotherapy, with benzodiazepines as first-line treatment; carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives. For patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (in Level 2‑WM settings for providers experienced with its use) are appropriate. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Prescribing patterns and off-label use of gabapentinoid agents at dhulikhel hospital, Nepal: a cross-sectional study [^fe850370]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The evidence on the safety and efficacy of gabapentinoids for off-label uses, such as perioperative care, musculoskeletal pain management, and neurological disorders, ranges from conflicting to significant.Gabapentinoids demonstrate only modest effectiveness in managing perioperative pain, and their role in treating spinal stenosis remains unclear.However, they are beneficial in multimodal pain management, as they improve pain relief and reduce opioid use in surgical settings.Given the lack of compelling evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of gabapentinoids for both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain conditions, it is important to exercise caution when prescribing and utilizing these drugs.

The recommended doses for neuropathic pain are 1200–3600 mg/day for gabapentin, starting at 300 mg/day, and 300–600 mg/day for pregabalin, starting at 150 mg/day. These doses are gradually increased based on the patient’s response.International guidelines indicate that gabapentin and pregabalin are either minimally effective or ineffective at doses below the recommended levels for neuropathic pain.Pregabalin was predominantly found to be prescribed at an initiating dose generally considered to be sub-therapeutic (75 mg once daily) for neuropathic pain. This variability may be attributed to the symptomatic nature of the indications and the lower risk of abuse and potential side effects for the general Nepalese population at sub-standard dosing. The dosage requirements for gabapentinoids have been found to differ across populations and conditions.The frequent prescription of low-dose pregabalin for neuropathic pain raises the possibility that it may be used for night-time sedation rather than for pain management, indicating the need for further investigation.

Pregabalin was often prescribed with methylcobalamin to potentially enhance its analgesic effects for neuropathic pain. Studies in India have shown that pregabalin is frequently initiated at sub-therapeutic doses, which are gradually increased as needed to improve patient tolerance. Additionally, pregabalin is often used in combination with methylcobalamin to enhance its synergistic effects and improve patient adherence.However, this combined use lacks support from national and international guidelines. A study conducted in Germany showed a moderate prevalence of pregabalin dependency.In our study, two patients on a pregabalin regimen were diagnosed with dependency. For those patients, pregabalin discontinuation was planned with a gradual tapering strategy. This approach aimed to prevent withdrawal symptoms, including insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhea, anxiety, and hyperhidrosis, which can arise from abrupt discontinuation, particularly after long-term use.

### Benzodiazepine use disorder: common questions and answers [^fd72665c]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

In the United States, more than 30 million adults have reported taking a benzodiazepine within the past year. Misuse-use of a drug in a way that a doctor did not direct-accounts for 17.2% of all benzodiazepine use. Family physicians face challenges when balancing the patient's perceived benefits of benzodiazepines with known risks and lack of evidence supporting their use. Benzodiazepines cause significant central nervous system-related adverse effects including sedation, confusion, memory loss, depression, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes. Factors that increase the risk of adverse effects and misuse are other substance use disorders, using concomitant central nervous system medications, and central nervous system or pulmonary diseases. Compared with intermittent use, chronic daily use in older adults is associated with a higher risk of falls, fractures, hospitalizations, and death. Withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and agitation are common and often prolonged. Adjunctive treatment with antiepileptics, antidepressants, and pregabalin has been shown to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Deprescribing benzodiazepines for patients who use them chronically should be individualized with slow tapering over weeks to months, or longer, to minimize the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Incorporating behavioral interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy, improves deprescribing outcomes.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^50bbf41a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal severity-based care—mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA–Ar score < 10) may be managed with pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone, using carbamazepine or gabapentin if providing medication, and benzodiazepines if risk of worsening symptoms while away from care. Moderate withdrawal (e.g., CIWA–Ar scores 10–18) should receive pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as first-line, with carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternatives; for contraindications to benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital in Level 2–WM are appropriate, and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as adjuncts. Severe, but not complicated, withdrawal (e.g., CIWA–Ar ≥ 19) may be treated in ambulatory Level 2–WM with pharmacotherapy; benzodiazepines are first-line, phenobarbital is an alternative, and for benzodiazepine contraindications phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate.

### Pregabalin monotherapy for epilepsy [^be2f909f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many people with epilepsy suffer from poorly controlled seizures, despite current antiepileptic treatments. Due to high rates of treatment resistance, there is interest in new pharmacological treatment options such as pregabalin. However, it remains unclear whether existing evidence of pregabalin is rigorous enough to support its monotherapy.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in people with epilepsy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (August 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7 ), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1, 2012), EMBASE (1974 to August 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1978 to August 2012). No language restrictions were imposed.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pregabalin with placebo or another antiepileptic drug monotherapy for epilepsy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (QZ and LY) independently extracted trial data and assessed trial quality. We assessed the following outcomes: (1) time to withdrawal after randomisation; (2) time to achieve six-, 12- or 24-month remission; (3) the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months; (4) time to first seizure after randomisation; (5) validated quality of life measures; (6) health economic outcomes; (7) adverse effects. We expressed time-to-event outcomes as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), where an HR > 1 indicates an event is more likely to occur earlier on pregabalin than the comparator.

Main Results

Two short-term studies involving 753 participants met the inclusion criteria. Only one study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with lamotrigine in patients with newly diagnosed partial seizures, and the other study investigated the effects of pregabalin compared with gabapentin in hospitalised patients with refractory partial epilepsy. There were no studies on generalised-onset tonic-clonic seizures (with or without other generalised seizure types).We found that pregabalin was inferior in comparison to lamotrigine when measuring time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after dose stabilisation from randomisation: hazard ratio (HR) 4.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93 to 10.60; time to achieve six-month remission after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.76; the proportion of participants who remained seizure-free for six or more continuous months: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87 (Europe: 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99; Asia: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.86; the Americas: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.19); and time to first seizure after dose stabilisation from randomisation: HR 1.74; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.39. There was no significant difference in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and lamotrigine, but more participants in the pregabalin group developed somnolence, weight increase and convulsion. Pregabalin was better than gabapentin when measuring time to withdrawal due to all reasons after randomisation: HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; and time to withdrawal due to inadequate seizure control after randomisation: HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92. No significant difference was found in safety-related outcomes between pregabalin and gabapentin. But we found some limitations in the study design which may have had an influence on the results.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin seems to have similar tolerability but inferior efficacy in comparison to lamotrigine for newly diagnosed partial seizures. However, considering the limitations in the study design (such as the short-term follow-up and the low initial target dose selection), the results should be interpreted with caution. The available data were too limited to draw any conclusions between pregabalin and gabapentin. The result indicated that the treatment effects were influenced by the study regions. The clinical disadvantage of pregabalin was more prominent in Asia when compared with lamotrigine. We should determine whether pregabalin has ethnic differences in the treatment of epilepsy in the future. This review does not inform any treatment policy for patients with generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Further long-term trials are needed to investigate the genuine effectiveness of pregabalin as monotherapy.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica) [^f7b12b6d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

For various levels of improvement in pain intensity from baseline to study endpoint, Figure 9 shows the fraction of patients achieving that level of improvement. The figure is cumulative. Patients who did not complete the study were assigned 0% improvement. Some patients experienced a decrease in pain as early as Week 1, which persisted throughout the study.

Study F2 : This randomized withdrawal study compared LYRICA with placebo. Patients were titrated during a 6-week open-label dose optimization phase to a total daily dose of 300 mg, 450 mg, or 600 mg. Patients were considered to be responders if they had both: 1) at least a 50% reduction in pain (VAS) and, 2) rated their overall improvement on the PGIC as “much improved” or “very much improved.” Those who responded to treatment were then randomized in the double-blind treatment phase to either the dose achieved in the open-label phase or to placebo. Patients were treated for up to 6 months following randomization. Efficacy was assessed by time to loss of therapeutic response, defined as 1) less than 30% reduction in pain (VAS) from open-label baseline during two consecutive visits of the double-blind phase, or 2) worsening of FM symptoms necessitating an alternative treatment. Fifty-four percent of patients were able to titrate to an effective and tolerable dose of LYRICA during the 6-week open-label phase. Of the patients entering the randomized treatment phase assigned to remain on LYRICA, 38% of patients completed 26 weeks of treatment versus 19% of placebo-treated patients.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant focal epilepsy [^aa9d637f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane Review last published in Issue 7, 2019; it includes two additional studies. Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects approximately 1% of the UK population. Approximately one-third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. Pregabalin is one of the newer antiepileptic drugs that has been developed to improve outcomes. In this review we summarised the current evidence regarding pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update we searched the following databases on 16 November 2020: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 16 November 2020). CRS Web includes randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Review Groups, including Epilepsy. We imposed no language restrictions. We contacted the manufacturers of pregabalin and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug as an add-on for people of any age with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Double-blind and single-blind trials were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency; secondary outcomes were seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal due to adverse effects, and proportion of individuals experiencing adverse effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT). We presented summary risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 randomised controlled trials (3949 participants). Nine trials compared pregabalin to placebo. For the primary outcome, participants randomised to pregabalin were significantly more likely to attain a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.72, 9 trials, 2663 participants, low-certainty evidence). The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.28), indicating a dose-response relationship. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 3.94, 95% CI 1.50 to 10.37, 4 trials, 1125 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Participants were significantly more likely to withdraw from pregabalin treatment than placebo for any reason (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.60; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and for adverse effects (RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.64; 9 trials, 2663 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Three trials compared pregabalin to three active-control drugs: lamotrigine, levetiracetam and gabapentin. Participants allocated to pregabalin were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency than those allocated to lamotrigine (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.12; 1 trial, 293 participants) but not those allocated to levetiracetam (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 1 trial, 509 participants) or gabapentin (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.12; 1 trial, 484 participants). We found no significant differences between pregabalin and lamotrigine for seizure freedom (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.40 to 4.83). However, significantly fewer participants achieved seizure freedom with add-on pregabalin compared to levetiracetam (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.85). No data were reported for this outcome for pregabalin versus gabapentin. We detected no significant differences in treatment withdrawal rate for any reason or due to adverse effects, specifically, during either pooled analysis or subgroup analysis. Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, headache and fatigue were significantly associated with pregabalin than in active control. We rated the overall risk of bias in the included studies as low or unclear due to the possibility of publication bias and lack of methodological details provided. We assessed all the studies to be at a high risk of funding bias as they were all sponsored by Pfizer. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low to moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

For people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, pregabalin when used as an add-on treatment was significantly more effective than placebo at producing a 50% or greater seizure reduction and seizure freedom. Results demonstrated efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses, although there were issues with tolerability at higher doses. However, the trials included in this review were of short duration, and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision-making. This review focused on the use of pregabalin in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of pregabalin when used as monotherapy.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^f2a09d16]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal—initial pharmacotherapy selection: Carbamazepine and gabapentin are appropriate for managing mild and moderate alcohol withdrawal in patients who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines are first-line agents for treating moderate or severe alcohol withdrawal due to their known effectiveness in preventing seizures and delirium, and are also appropriate for mild withdrawal in inpatient settings. When benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital can be used for mild or moderate withdrawal. Phenobarbital is the preferred alternative for severe withdrawal but, given its narrow therapeutic window, should only be used by clinicians experienced with its use.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in newborns exposed to gabapentinoids in utero for an extended period of time when also exposed to opioids close to delivery. Neonatal withdrawal signs and symptoms reported have included tachypnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertonia, irritability, sneezing, poor feeding, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, and tremor. Reported signs and symptoms that may also be related to withdrawal include tongue thrusting, wandering eye movements while awake, back arching, and continuous extremity movements. Observe neonates exposed to LYRICA and opioids for signs and symptoms of neonatal withdrawal and manage accordingly.

Human Data

One database study, which included over 2,700 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 3,063,251 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics demonstrated prevalence ratios for major malformations overall of 1.14 (CI 95% 0.96-1.35) for pregabalin, 1.29 (CI 95% 1.01-1.65) for lamotrigine, 1.39 (CI 95% 1.07-1.82) for duloxetine, and 1.24 (CI 95% 1.00-1.54) for exposure to either lamotrigine or duloxetine. Important study limitations include uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription took the medication and inability to adequately control for the underlying disease and other potential confounders.

A published study included results from two separate databases. One database, which included 353 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 368,489 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics, showed no increase in risk of major birth defects; adjusted relative risk 0.87 (CI 95% 0.53-1.42). The second database, which included 118 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 380,347 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics, suggested a small increase in risk of major birth defects; adjusted relative risk 1.26 (CI 95% 0.64-2.49). The risk estimates crossed the null, and the study had limitations similar to the prior study.

Other published epidemiologic studies reported inconsistent findings. No specific pattern of birth defects was identified across studies. All of the studies had limitations due to their retrospective design.

Now, I am focused on following the doctor’s advice. And the good news is, my back feels a lot better.

Learning points

Recognition of abuse: Given the surge in off-label prescriptions of pregabalin and related drugs, such as gabapentin, physicians should be attuned to potential misuse. Observing patterns of rapid medication depletion, requests for early refills and vague descriptions of symptoms can be warning signs.
Delirium on cessation: Abrupt discontinuation of drugs such as pregabalin can have profound neuropsychiatric implications, including delirium, even in patients without apparent risk factors such as advanced age or a history of substance use.
Tailored patient education: Educating patients about the potential for dependence and the hazards of sudden cessation is essential to mitigate the risks.
Continuous monitoring: A proactive follow-up of patients receiving pregabalin is warranted. Such oversight ensures the early detection of potential misuse and timely intervention, significantly reducing the risk of severe outcomes such as delirium.
Access to specific drug testing: Given the evolving landscape of recreational drug use, reevaluation of access to advanced targeted drug-testing tools in emergency rooms is essential for enhancing patient outcomes.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in newborns exposed to gabapentinoids in utero for an extended period of time when also exposed to opioids close to delivery. Neonatal withdrawal signs and symptoms reported have included tachypnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertonia, irritability, sneezing, poor feeding, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, and tremor. Reported signs and symptoms that may also be related to withdrawal include tongue thrusting, wandering eye movements while awake, back arching, and continuous extremity movements. Observe neonates exposed to LYRICA CR and opioids for signs and symptoms of neonatal withdrawal and manage accordingly.

Human Data

One database study, which included over 2,700 pregnancies exposed to pregabalin (monotherapy) during the first trimester compared to 3,063,251 pregnancies unexposed to antiepileptics demonstrated prevalence ratios for major malformations overall of 1.14 (CI 95% 0.96-1.35) for pregabalin, 1.29 (CI 95% 1.01-1.65) for lamotrigine, 1.39 (CI 95% 1.07-1.82) for duloxetine, and 1.24 (CI 95% 1.00-1.54) for exposure to either lamotrigine or duloxetine. Important study limitations include uncertainty of whether women who filled a prescription took the medication and inability to adequately control for the underlying disease and other potential confounders.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1e9afb3f]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management—anticonvulsants and adjuncts—states gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient’s ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder; if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives; and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, with the instruction that before using an adjunct clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. It also states valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential and that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The discussion adds that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium; it notes carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and that gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment.

### Pregabalin add-on for drug-resistant partial epilepsy [^163165a9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disease with an estimated prevalence of 1% in the UK. Approximately one third of these people continue to have seizures despite drug treatment. In order to try to improve outcomes a number of new antiepileptic drugs have been developed and pregabalin is one of these. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review (Pulman 2008); no further studies have been added since the previous update in 2012 and only one study has been identified as an ongoing trial.

Objectives

To summarise evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin when used as an add-on antiepileptic treatment in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. The definitions of drug resistance used were those employed by the authors of the included trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (Jan 2014), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 12), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 09/01/2014) and contacted Pfizer Ltd. (the manufacturers of pregabalin) to identify published, unpublished and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing pregabalin with placebo or an alternative antiepileptic drug for people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Outcomes included 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency, seizure freedom, treatment withdrawal for any reason, treatment withdrawal for adverse events and nature of adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JP and AGM) independently selected and assessed suitable trials and extracted data. Primary analyses were by intention-to-treat (ITT). Results are presented as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Included studies were assessed for risk of bias by two authors using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

Main Results

Six suitable industry-sponsored trials (2009 participants) were identified and included in the analysis. Trials tested doses of pregabalin ranging from 50 mg/day to 600 mg/day. For the primary outcome, 50% or higher seizure reduction was significantly more likely in patients randomised to pregabalin than to placebo (RR 2.61; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.01). A dose-response analysis suggested increasing effect with increasing dose. Pregabalin was significantly associated with seizure freedom (RR 2.59; 95% CI 1.05 to 6.36). Patients were significantly more likely to have withdrawn from pregabalin treatment than placebo treatment for any reason (RR 1.39; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.72) or for adverse effects (RR 2.69; 95% CI 1.88 to 3.86). Ataxia, dizziness, somnolence and weight gain were significantly associated with pregabalin. The odds of response doubled with an increase in dose from 300 mg/day to 600 mg/day (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.76 to 2.54). Overall, the evidence was rated as low/unclear risk of bias due to the possibility of publication bias. The quality of the evidence was rated as moderate using the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Pregabalin, when used as an add-on drug for treatment-resistant partial epilepsy, is significantly more effective than placebo at achieving a 50% or greater seizure reduction and significantly increasing seizure freedom. Results demonstrate efficacy for doses from 150 mg/day to 600 mg/day, with increasing effectiveness at 600 mg doses. The trials included in this review were of short duration and longer-term trials are needed to inform clinical decision making better.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management—carbamazepine, gabapentin, valproic acid—Gabapentin is a favorable choice for treating alcohol withdrawal when a clinician also plans to use it for a patient’s ongoing treatment of alcohol use disorder. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate alternatives for patients in mild or moderate withdrawal. Carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepine therapy to help control alcohol withdrawal, and before using an adjunct, clinicians should ensure that an adequate dose of benzodiazepine has been administered. Valproic acid should not be used in patients who have liver disease or women of childbearing potential. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of valproic acid as monotherapy for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

### Temporal analysis of pain responders and common adverse events: when do these first appear following treatment with pregabalin [^2983a3c0]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This study aimed to investigate the treatment response over the first 6 weeks of clinical trials of flexible-dose pregabalin in all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is an approved treatment option to determine when patients first respond to treatment and when new AEs emerge or worsen. In these trials, it was decided on a weekly basis over the first 3–4 weeks of the trial if each patient’s dose should be adjusted based on pain relief and AEs, after which patients completed the trial receiving their optimal dose. As the pregabalin dose was tailored to the patient’s needs, this type of study design is a better representation of real-world clinical practice–than a fixed-dose design, used to establish, typically for regulatory purposes, an effective dosing range for a population rather than an individual.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline—alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy: For patients with moderate-severe alcohol use disorder for whom first-line pharmacotherapy is contraindicated or ineffective, we suggest offering gabapentin (Weak for | Not reviewed, Not changed). Evidence cited includes an RCT (n=150) in which gabapentin with counseling significantly improved abstinence and heavy drinking in DSM-IV alcohol dependence, and another RCT showing that adding gabapentin to oral naltrexone improved drinking outcomes relative to naltrexone alone in the first six weeks after drinking cessation. A multisite RCT of extended-release gabapentin did not demonstrate significant differences in alcohol use or cravings versus placebo, whereas a single-site RCT found reduced alcohol consumption among participants with higher pre-study withdrawal symptom severity, suggesting gabapentin may be more effective in individuals with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The effects of gabapentin likely occur through modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the need for more frequent dosing than once daily may make adherence difficult. The guideline notes increased concerns for misuse with reports of doses higher than prescribed for euphoric effects, but also describes a high margin of safety and potential utility for patients with co-occurring neuropathic pain, some with sleep disorders, and those with clinically significant hepatic disease because it is eliminated renally; overall, the Work Group judged that relative benefits for alcohol outcomes and pain treatment slightly outweighed harms including potential for misuse and central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^01394253]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal—management of uncontrolled symptoms specifies that if a patient’s symptoms are not controlled as expected, first consider increasing the dose; if over-sedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern, reassess for appropriateness of level of care, consider switching medication, and if using benzodiazepines, consider adding an adjunct medication.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^78bc4c32]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal—anticonvulsants and adjuncts—reports that evidence suggests anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine, are effective at preventing alcohol withdrawal progression, seizures and delirium, but at this time there is insufficient evidence to support their use over benzodiazepines for patients at increased risk of severe withdrawal, seizures, or delirium. Carbamazepine or gabapentin are appropriate medications for treating low risk patients and are appropriate alternatives for patients with a benzodiazepine contraindication. Gabapentin may provide an effective bridge therapy from alcohol withdrawal treatment to long-term alcohol use disorder treatment, improving rates of abstinence and reducing heavy drinking days compared with placebo during the maintenance phase. Use of carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is an appropriate therapy for patients experiencing mild or moderate withdrawal. While valproic acid is promising, more evidence is needed before it can be recommended as monotherapy; its use as an adjunct to benzodiazepines is supported, and it should not be used in patients with hematological or hepatic disorders including acute liver impairment or in women of childbearing potential because of teratogenic risk.

### Concerns about pregabalin: further experience with its potential of causing addictive behaviors [^5f536011]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pregabalin (PRG) is approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain, partial seizures, and generalized anxiety disorder in many countries. Supported by case reports and a few studies there is an ongoing debate on PRG's potential to cause addictive behaviors. Considering that PRG is currently under investigation for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal as well as relapse prevention in alcohol dependence, assessment of PRG's abuse and dependence potential is indispensable. We report the case of a 38-year-old female patient with borderline personality disorder and past alcohol abuse who developed PRG abuse. The patient took up to 800 mg PRG per day, initially administered to treat unspecific anxiety, and experienced euphoric feelings after PRG intake. In the further course, she increased the daily PRG dosage and consulted other physicians to receive additional PRG prescriptions. During reduction of PRG, the patient developed a moderate withdrawal syndrome with vegetative symptoms. Because of the early detection of the developing PRG abuse (4 months after first application of PRG), the development of PRG dependence was prevented. This case illustrates the possibility of PRG to trigger the development of addictive behaviors and should encourage physicians to be very careful when administering PRG to patients with current or past substance-related disorders.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^1bd18aaf]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal symptom treatment by severity uses CIWA-Ar thresholds to guide therapy. For patients experiencing mild alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA-Ar score <10) who are at minimal risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal or complications of alcohol withdrawal, pharmacotherapy or supportive care alone may be provided; if providing medication, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin are appropriate, and for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) are appropriate, and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines. Patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA-Ar scores 10–18) should receive pharmacotherapy; benzodiazepines are appropriate; for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use) are appropriate; and carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if no liver disease or childbearing potential) may be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines. Patients experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal (e.g., CIWA-Ar scores >19) should receive pharmacotherapy; benzodiazepines are first-line treatment; for patients with a contraindication for benzodiazepine use, phenobarbital is appropriate for providers experienced with its use; if close monitoring is available, phenobarbital can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines; and other adjunct medications can be considered after a clinician ensures that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines has been administered.

### Pregabalin (Lyrica) [^7e1dd7a9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

When considering return of pain or withdrawal due to adverse events as loss of response (LTR), treatment with LYRICA resulted in a longer time to loss of therapeutic response than treatment with placebo. Fifty-three percent of the pregabalin-treated subjects compared to 33% of placebo patients remained on study drug and maintained a therapeutic response to Week 26 of the study. Treatment with LYRICA also resulted in a longer time to loss of response based on the FIQ1, and longer time to loss of overall assessment of patient status, as measured by the PGIC2.

1Time to worsening of the FIQ was defined as the time to a 1-point increase from double-blind baseline in each of the subscales, and a 5-point increase from double-blind baseline evaluation for the FIQ total score.

2Time to PGIC lack of improvement was defined as time to PGIC assessments indicating less improvement than “much improvement.”

### Pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy: a narrative review [^dd4bd6ba]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Pregabalin is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA; however, its mechanism of action is distinct from GABAergic modulation and is yet to be fully elucidated. Pain relief usually occurs within 1 week of initiating therapy and is thought to be mediated via high-affinity binding to the alpha2-delta subunit (α2δ) of voltage-gated calcium channels at the presynaptic terminals. This results in modulation of the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate through the glutamate synthesising enzyme, branched-chain amino acid transaminase.

Pregabalin’s mechanism of action is similar to that of gabapentin; however, it has 2–4 times more potency and thus a lower dosing strategy is required. Typically starting doses range from 75 to 150 mg per day for neuropathic pain, with relatively quick up-titration over several weeks to maximal tolerated doses (600 mg/day) due to the more linear pharmacokinetics compared with gabapentin. It has high bioavailability (≥ 90% rapidly absorbed) with a half-life of approximately 9 h. Very common adverse effects (> 10% of patients) include dizziness, somnolence and headache. Pregabalin demonstrates quick absorption, reducing the probability of drug-drug interactions as it is not bound to plasma proteins and does not undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver. Although pregabalin poses low risk for addiction and drug dependence at therapeutic doses, recent statistics in England and Wales showed a > 20-fold increase in the number of deaths linked to pregabalin—4 to 111 deaths from 2012 to 2016, whilst for gabapentin—8 to 59 deaths during the same period. Rapid rise in mortality is associated with individuals with previous history of recreational polydrug misuse, or misuse in combination with opioids, as some report self-administration of dosages in excess (e.g. up to 10–20 times) of clinically advisable dosages. Consequently, this led to guidance from Public Health England and the NHS on safe prescribing of both pregabalin and gabapentin. However, in December 2017 NHS England launched a consultation to seek views on whether to schedule pregabalin and gabapentin as Controlled drugs in the UK. A similar consultation is underway with the WHO and a decision is expected in early 2019. Due to their “risk of addiction, potential illegal diversion and medicinal misuse” by a minority, the reclassification of these drugs will have major repercussions on the many millions of people suffering from neuropathic pain, as it will restrict prescribing and also prevent them from acquiring the drug on a repeat prescription.

Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

Advise patients to take pregabalin as prescribed. Abrupt or rapid discontinuation may result in increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders, and insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, or diarrhea [SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.6)].

Missed Dose

Counsel patients if they miss a dose, they should take it as soon as they remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, they should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at their regularly scheduled time. Instruct patients not to take two doses at the same time.

Weight Gain and Edema

Counsel patients that pregabalin may cause edema and weight gain. Advise patients that concomitant treatment with pregabalin and a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent may lead to an additive effect on edema and weight gain. For patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, this may increase the risk of heart failure. [SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7 AND 5.8)].

Ophthalmological Effects

Counsel patients that pregabalin capsule may cause visual disturbances. Inform patients that if changes in vision occur, they should notify their physician [SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.10)].

### Pregabalin capsules, cv [^f6c42237]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In animal reproduction studies, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity, including skeletal malformations, retarded ossification, and decreased fetal body weight were observed in the offspring of rats and rabbits given pregabalin orally during organogenesis, at doses that produced plasma pregabalin exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 16 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 600 mg/day (see Data) . In an animal development study, lethality, growth retardation, and nervous and reproductive system functional impairment were observed in the offspring of rats given pregabalin during gestation and lactation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was approximately twice the human exposure at MRD.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in newborns exposed to gabapentinoids in utero for an extended period of time when also exposed to opioids close to delivery. Neonatal withdrawal signs and symptoms reported have included tachypnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertonia, irritability, sneezing, poor feeding, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, and tremor. Reported signs and symptoms that may also be related to withdrawal include tongue thrusting, wandering eye movements while awake, back arching, and continuous extremity movements. Observe neonates exposed to pregabalin and opioids for signs and symptoms of neonatal withdrawal and manage accordingly.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^301a8cef]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Benzodiazepine (BZD) taper—adjunctive medications and protracted withdrawal—emphasizes that “the primary clinical strategy for supporting an effective taper is going slow and adjusting based on the patient’s response,” with guidance to first pause or slow the taper if symptoms emerge and to minimize polypharmacy; if symptoms persist despite a slower taper, medications may be indicated with specialist consultation. The CGC agreed that “no single medication had enough data to support recommending it.” The Patient Panel noted that some with protracted withdrawal have trouble tolerating adjunctive psychoactive medication and that agents “that act directly or indirectly on GABA receptors (e.g., SSRIs, gabapentin, magnesium) can exacerbate and extend the duration of protracted withdrawal symptoms.” Clinicians “should first consider whether patients’ symptoms are likely to be primarily attributable to BZD withdrawal or underlying conditions,” with symptoms that change in parallel with BZD dosage or resolve rapidly after pausing the taper more likely related to BZD withdrawal; distinct neurological or sensory symptoms “may be related to protracted withdrawal,” warranting more frequent monitoring and possible specialist consultation. Although evidence for medications to treat BZD withdrawal is lacking, treating underlying conditions can be effective (e.g., SSRIs for GAD); clinicians “should attempt to optimize evidence-based treatment” prior to or, if clinically indicated, concurrent with tapering and “should attempt to minimize the risks of polypharmacy whenever possible” when selecting adjunctive medications.

### Neuropathic pain responds better to increased doses of pregabalin: an in-depth analysis of flexible-dose clinical trials [^389ad167]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pregabalin is recommended as a treatment for diverse neuropathic pain conditions,–where it is advised that it be carefully escalated to the optimal dose.In the USA, the maximum approved dose of pregabalin is 300 mg/day for DPN and 600 mg/day for PHN,while in Europe it is 600 mg/day for all neuropathic pain.Despite this, many patients may not receive the most effective dose of pregabalin, with a recent drug utilization study in the UK indicating that the approximate median prescribed dose of pregabalin for neuropathic pain was only 150 mg/day.This analysis provides evidence that new patients will tend to respond with every increase in pregabalin dose.

Neuropathic pain can be challenging to treat effectively.While there are a number of treatment options, not all are effective in all patients. For instance, data on the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with lower back pain are inconsistent.In a randomized withdrawal trial, pregabalin was not shown to be effective in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy.Even for those conditions where its efficacy is well established, many patients will not respond to treatment with pregabalin.As physicians are advised to ensure that effective and tolerable treatment for neuropathic pain is initiated as soon as possible,it is important to ascertain quickly if a treatment is ineffective so that other options can be tested. In these circumstances, it may be understandable why the time is not taken to escalate some patients to a higher, efficacious dose of pregabalin. However, of the 701 patients in this analysis who took the 150 mg/day dosing, 136 (19.4%) responded at that dose. Of those who continued to higher doses, 231 (33.0%) responded at a higher dose. These data do not correct for the tendency for higher doses to be used when patients have inadequate response at a lower dose. The MSM analyses make some correction for this tendency in dose escalation and indicate that it can be worthwhile to persist with pregabalin until the dose that delivers optimal analgesia and tolerable side effects is utilized.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: outpatient management [^57146a36]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately one-half of patients with alcohol use disorder who abruptly stop or reduce their alcohol use will develop signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The syndrome is due to overactivity of the central and autonomic nervous systems, leading to tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, anxiety, and agitation. If untreated or inadequately treated, withdrawal can progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, delirium tremens, and death. The three-question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption and the Single Alcohol Screening Question instrument have the best accuracy for assessing unhealthy alcohol use in adults 18 years and older. Two commonly used tools to assess withdrawal symptoms are the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Revised, and the Short Alcohol Withdrawal Scale. Patients with mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms without additional risk factors for developing severe or complicated withdrawal should be treated as outpatients when possible. Ambulatory withdrawal treatment should include supportive care and pharmacotherapy as appropriate. Mild symptoms can be treated with carbamazepine or gabapentin. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy for moderate to severe symptoms, with carbamazepine and gabapentin as potential adjunctive or alternative therapies. Physicians should monitor outpatients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome daily for up to five days after their last drink to verify symptom improvement and to evaluate the need for additional treatment. Primary care physicians should offer to initiate long-term treatment for alcohol use disorder, including pharmacotherapy, in addition to withdrawal management.

### Interventions for treating neuropathic pain in people with sickle cell disease [^bffa787f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pain is the hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD) and it can be severe, frequent and unpredictable. Although nociceptive pain is more common, at times, people with SCD may have neuropathic pain. The latter can occur due to peripheral or central nerve injury. This review is focused on identifying treatment of only painful sensory neuropathy in people with SCD.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of any pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies for treating neuropathic pain in people with SCD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched trial registries, the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews and contacted experts in the field.Date of last search: 31 January 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (parallel or cross-over in design), quasi-RCTs of pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies for treating neuropathic pain in people with SCD compared to placebo or another intervention in any category (i.e. pharmacological or non-pharmacological).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all trials identified by the searches and extracted relevant data. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the selected trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Two review authors independently rated the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE guidelines.

Main Results

One RCT of 22 participants with SCD, conducted in the USA was included in this review. Participants were randomly assigned to either pregabalin (n = 11) or placebo (n = 11). Oral pregabalin was administered at an initial dose of 75 mg twice daily. The drug was titrated at increments of 75 mg to a maximum of 600 mg daily or decreased by 75 mg per day if necessary, based on clinical presentation and pain level. Neuropathic pain was assessed using self-reports on the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANNS) scale and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), where higher scores were indicative of more pain. Outcomes included self-reported pain, quality of life and withdrawal due to adverse effects measured at baseline and monthly for three months post-intervention. The overall risk of bias was low with a high risk of bias due to attrition.In relation to this reviews primary outcomes, for self-reported neuropathic pain relief, given the paucity of data, we are very uncertain whether there is a difference between the pregabalin and placebo groups at the end of three months as measured by the S-LANSS scale, mean difference (MD) -2.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.18 to 5.18), or the NPSI scale, MD -11.10 (95% CI -33.97 to 11.77) (very low-quality evidence). There was no report of 'Patient Global Impression of Change' in the included trial.Although the mean quality of life scores (Short Form-36) at three months showed small increases in seven of the eight domains post-intervention in the pregabalin group as compared to the placebo group, this was very low-quality evidence and we are very uncertain whether pregabalin increases quality of life. Neither of our pre-defined outcomes of 'time to improvement of symptoms' or 'changes in sleep quality', were measured in the included trial.While treatment-related adverse effects appeared higher in pregabalin group than the placebo group at three months, this was very low-quality evidence and we are very uncertain whether there is a difference, RR 1.33 (95% CI 0.39 to 4.62) (very low-quality evidence). There was one withdrawal for adverse effects in the pregabalin group while three people withdrew or dropped out from the placebo group due to adverse effects and complications and hospitalisation related to SCD.

Authors' Conclusions

The included trial provided very low-quality evidence. Self-reported pain relief was greater in the pregabalin group compared to the placebo control group but only using the S-LANSS scale and we are very unsure whether there is a difference. While the pregabalin group tended to have improved quality of life over the duration of the trial, this was very low-quality evidence and we are uncertain whether there is a difference. Adverse effects and withdrawals were similar across the treatment and placebo control group in trial. There are both insufficient trials addressing this review question and insufficient outcomes addressed in the single included RCT. Therefore, there is still a significant gap in evidence on interventions for neuropathic pain in people with SCD.

### Expert consensus on ion channel drugs for chronic pain treatment in China [^f410c1fb]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Gabapentin

Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, ataxia, and peripheral edema. The symptoms of withdrawal include disturbances of consciousness, disorientation, non-specific gastrointestinal reactions, hyperhidrosis, and tremors. Gabapentin dosage should be adjusted according to the patient’s renal function. During the medication period, the withdrawal of gabapentin or the addition of a new treatment plan should be gradually carried out, and the time should be at least 1 week. The plasma concentration of gabapentin may increase in patients treated with morphine at the same time.Even if gabapentin was administered per the prescribed dosage, the reaction rate was reduced. Therefore, individuals engaged in driving and manipulating complex machinery should use them cautiously.

Pregabalin

The adverse effects include dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, headaches, language barriers, and tremors. Pregabalin can cause peripheral edema and a prolonged PR interval and should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure and heart function grade III or IV. Adverse endocrine effects include an increase in body weight, with an occurrence rate of 4% to 12%. Muscular skeletal adverse effects include elevated creatine kinase levels, myoclonus, and stripe muscle dissolution. Pregabalin treatment occasionally causes mild transient increases in liver enzymes, saliva deficiency, constipation, thrombocytopenia, blurred vision, diplopia, and amblyopia.The pregabalin dosage needs to be adjusted according to the patient’s renal function. During treatment, it is necessary to monitor for signs of depression, suicidal thoughts, or abnormal behavioral and mood changes.

Gabapentin and pregabalin are addictive, and sudden withdrawal increases the frequency of seizures and produces withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, headache, and diarrhea. Therefore, when discontinuing the drug, the dosage should be gradually reduced for at least 1 week.

### Pregabalin [^7eef9a9d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer’s LYRICA (pregabalin) Capsules and Oral Solution products. However, due to Pfizer’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information.

5.6 Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions with Abrupt or Rapid Discontinuation

As with all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), withdraw pregabalin gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders.

Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea.

If pregabalin is discontinued, taper the drug gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinue the drug abruptly.

5.7 Peripheral Edema

Pregabalin treatment may cause peripheral edema. In short-term trials of patients without clinically significant heart or peripheral vascular disease, there was no apparent association between peripheral edema and cardiovascular complications such as hypertension or congestive heart failure. Peripheral edema was not associated with laboratory changes suggestive of deterioration in renal or hepatic function.

In controlled clinical trials in adult patients, the incidence of peripheral edema was 6% in the pregabalin group compared with 2% in the placebo group. In controlled clinical trials, 0.5% of pregabalin patients and 0.2% placebo patients withdrew due to peripheral edema.

### Pregabalin, tiapride and lorazepam in alcohol withdrawal syndrome: a multi-centre, randomized, single-blind comparison trial [^47d92f09]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this trial was to compare lorazepam with non-benzodiazepine medications such as pregabalin and tiapride in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). These drugs were chosen for their inhibitorial effects on the hypersecretion of neurotransmitters usually observed in AWS. Craving reduction and improvement of psychiatric symptoms were the secondary end-points.

Methods

One hundred and ninety subjects affected by current alcohol dependence were considered consecutively: 111 were enrolled and divided into three groups of 37 subjects each. Within a treatment duration of 14 days, medication was given up to the following maximum doses (pregabalin 450 mg/day; tiapride 800 mg/day; lorazepam 10 mg/day). Withdrawal (CIWA-Ar), craving [visual analogue scale (VAS); Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)], psychiatric symptoms [Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)] and quality of life (QL-index) rating scales were applied.

Results

On the CIWA-Ar score, all the groups showed a significant reduction between times (P < 0.001) with a higher reduction for the pregabalin group (P < 0.01) on items regarding headache and orientation. Retention in treatment was lower in the tiapride group (P < 0.05), while the number of subjects remaining alcohol free was higher in the pregabalin group (P < 0.05). Significant reduction between baseline and the end of the treatment was found in all the groups at the OCDS and the VAS for craving, at the SCL-90-R and QL-index (P < 0.001).

Discussion

All the medications in the trial showed evidence of safety and efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated forms of AWS, with some particular differences. The efficacy of pregabalin was superior to that of tiapride, used largely in research trials and, for some measures, to that of the 'gold standard', lorazepam. Accordingly, pregabalin may be considered as a potentially useful new drug for treatment of AWS, deserving further investigation.

### Study design characteristics and endpoints for enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trials for chronic pain patients: a systematic review [^1d269fa2]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Selection Phase as Single-Blind

All 6 EERW trials defining the selection phase as single-blind, used this phase for titrating the optimal dose.,,,Only one trial used this single-blind phase to exclude placebo responders taking placebo in the first week and experiencing ≥50% improvement in mean weekly pain score (n=14, 3.7%).Two articles stated that patients were permitted in this phase to titrate down to a lower dose.Two articles stated that patients were informed that they could receive both study medication (pregabalin) and placebo during the course of the trial.

Inclusion Criteria for the Double-Blind Phase

Inclusion criteria for the double-blind phase varied considerably, mainly based on maximal pain score or minimal pain relief as measured with the NRS or VAS at the end of the selection phase compared to baseline pain score. The required pain reduction was measured from a one measurement moment up to the mean of the last 7 days. As a criterion for inclusion for the double-blind Phase 8 trials used ≤4 NRS or ≥1 NRS pain relief,,,,,,,,≤45 VAS or ≥15 VAS pain relief,≥2 NRS pain relief or ≥30% pain relief,,,,,,,,,,,or ≥50% pain relief.One trial defined ≤1 on a scale from 0 to 3 for several days as an inclusion criterion for the double-blind phase.The stringency of enrichment was significantly associated with the percentage of patients included in the double-blind phase (42.0% in the most stringent category 4 versus 64.9% in the least stringent category 1, Kruskal–Wallis P=0.036, meta-regression P<0.001).

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^b64ce903]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM benzodiazepine use in alcohol withdrawal—while no particular agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to longer duration of action. If waiting for lab test results or tests are unavailable and the patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization. Clinicians should monitor for over-sedation and respiratory depression and discontinue a benzodiazepine prescription following treatment. To manage misuse or diversion in ambulatory settings, prescribe the minimum amount necessary based on stability and visit timing, or consider carbamazepine or gabapentin. In ambulatory settings, benzodiazepines should not be prescribed to patients with even mild adverse events or those at high risk of diversion; risk can be managed by dispensing or prescribing a small number of doses. Patients and caregivers should be educated on drug–drug interactions with other CNS depressants, the risks of combining alcohol and benzodiazepines and the importance of abstinence, the risks of driving or heavy machinery for the first few days, and instructions to reduce dose if drowsiness occurs.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^82deab67]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Assessment for co-occurring substance use—screening, risks, and treatment approach in opioid use disorder are emphasized as follows: “Opioid use disorder often co-occurs with alcohol, nicotine, and other substance use disorders,” so “evaluation of co-occurring alcohol, nicotine, or substance use (including prescription medication misuse) is recommended,” and “Clinicians should assess signs and symptoms of alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication or withdrawal.” “Alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may result in seizures, hallucinosis, or delirium, and may represent a medical emergency,” and “concomitant use of alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with opioids may contribute to respiratory depression.” Patients with more severe co-use may need escalated care: “Patients with significant co-occurring substance use disorders, especially severe alcohol or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use, may require a higher level of care.” Regarding gabapentinoids, “A 2017 systematic review reported that increasing numbers of patients are self-administering higher than recommended doses of gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) to achieve euphoric highs,” and “Among opioid users the reported prevalence of gabapentinoid misuse ranged from 3% to 68%.” Prognosis and treatment access are addressed: “Evidence suggests that individuals who are actively using other substances during opioid use disorder treatment may have a poorer prognosis,” yet “The Guideline Committee cautioned against excluding patients from treatment for their opioid use disorder because they are using cannabis or other psychoactive substances.” Initiation of care should not be delayed in most cases: “In most cases, co-occurring substance use will not represent a medical emergency. In such cases, patients can begin treatment for both their opioid use disorder and co-occurring alcohol or substance use disorders.” The guideline also warns that “Suspension of opioid use disorder treatment may increase the risk for death from overdose, accidents, or other health problems,” and that “Continued use of cannabis or other psychoactive substances may impede treatment for opioid use disorder.”

### Pregablin [^5a2fc436]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In animal reproduction studies, increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities and other manifestations of developmental toxicity, including skeletal malformations, retarded ossification, and decreased fetal body weight were observed in the offspring of rats and rabbits given pregabalin orally during organogenesis, at doses that produced plasma pregabalin exposures (AUC) greater than or equal to 16 times human exposure at the maximum recommended dose (MRD) of 600 mg/day (see Data). In an animal development study, lethality, growth retardation, and nervous and reproductive system functional impairment were observed in the offspring of rats given pregabalin during gestation and lactation. The no-effect dose for developmental toxicity was approximately twice the human exposure at MRD.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies  is 2-4% and  15-20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Neonatal withdrawal syndrome has been reported in newborns exposed to gabapentinoids in utero for an extended period of time when also exposed to opioids close to delivery. Neonatal withdrawal signs and symptoms reported have included tachypnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertonia, irritability, sneezing, poor feeding, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, and tremor. Reported signs and symptoms that may also be related to withdrawal include tongue thrusting, wandering eye movements while awake, back arching, and continuous extremity movements. Observe neonates exposed to pregabalin capsules  and opioids for signs and symptoms of neonatal withdrawal and manage accordingly.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^5635b44d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, outpatient, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the medication dose if the patient is taking medication as prescribed but symptoms are not controlled as expected. Reassess for appropriate level of care and consider switching medications if oversedation or inadequate monitoring is a concern. Consider adding an adjunct medication if using benzodiazepines.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^ae78ab35]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Adjuvant analgesics—gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) may lessen neuropathic pain but require caution. They “reduce neuropathic pain by inhibiting presynaptic calcium channels,” and “gabapentinoid use decreases opioid requirements in select populations (e.g., in patients with spinal cord injury or burn),” yet “limited evidence exists to support a broad analgesic effect.” Safety concerns include that “abuse and misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was reported,” the directive to “Use gabapentinoids with caution in patients with or at risk of developing an SUD,” and that they “produce additive CNS depression and increase risk of death when used in combination with opioids.” Because “both pregabalin and gabapentin are renally eliminated,” the page advises to “use lower doses or avoid them in patients with underlying renal disease and in elderly patients.”

### Geriatric trauma management [^396e3522]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Medication management—gabapentinoids for neuropathic pain in older adults—Gabapentin and pregabalin are effective treatments for neuropathic pain, but sedation and dizziness may limit their usefulness in the frail older adult. Because of delayed onset, gradual titration over weeks is recommended to improve tolerability and avoid the risk of oversedation and overdose. Because elimination is entirely through the renal system, dosing will require adjustment in patients with renal impairment.

### Pregabalin for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome [^70bc1f1f]. Journal of Pain Research (2010). Low credibility.

This last article in a three-part series on approved medications for managing fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) reviews pregabalin (Lyrica(®)). Pregabalin was the first drug approved for FMS management and, as an anticonvulsant, differs from the other approved agents that are antidepressants. Pregabalin inhibits presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitter release by blocking α(2)δ calcium channels. Five randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated pregabalin reduces pain and improves sleep and health-related quality of life in FMS patients. While indicated dosing is 300-450 mg divided twice daily, initial dosing of 25-50 mg at night is recommended owing to side effects including somnolence, dizziness, and cognitive dysfunction. Since side effects such as weight gain and peripheral edema are dose-related, uptitration in weekly increments based on tolerability and therapeutic response is recommended. Due to its lack of protein binding and negligible hepatic metabolism, pregabalin can be safely combined with other medications and used in patients with renal failure when the dose is appropriate. Pregabalin may worsen sedation when combined with central nervous system depressants. Pregabalin should be discontinued gradually. Pregabalin-treated patients should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior. Pregabalin in combination with the other approved medications may be synergistic in treating FMS.

### Pregabalin in generalized anxiety disorder: a placebo-controlled trial [^25b21d69]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Current drug therapies for generalized anxiety disorder have limitations. In a controlled trial, the novel agent pregabalin was studied for the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder.

Method

In this double-blind study, patients with DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to receive pregabalin (150 mg/day or 600 mg/day), lorazepam (6 mg/day), or placebo. A 1-week placebo lead-in was followed by 4 weeks of treatment and then a 1-week dose taper. The primary efficacy measure was the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score at endpoint.

Results

A total of 276 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group and received at least one dose of their assigned medication. Fewer patients given lorazepam (59%, N=40 of 68) completed the trial than did those given placebo (73%, N=50 of 69), 600 mg/day of pregabalin (71%, N=50 of 70), or 150 mg/day or pregabalin (90%, N=62 of 69). The mean baseline-to-endpoint decreases in total Hamilton anxiety scale score in the patients given 150 mg/day of pregabalin (-9.2), 600 mg/day of pregabalin (-10.3), and lorazepam (-12.0) were significantly greater than the decrease in those given placebo (-6.8). As early as the week 1 observation, pregabalin significantly reduced the total Hamilton anxiety scale score compared with placebo. The most frequent adverse events reported for pregabalin and lorazepam were somnolence and dizziness. There were no serious adverse events reported by patients given pregabalin, and no withdrawal syndrome was associated with pregabalin treatment.

Conclusions

These results indicate that pregabalin is an effective, rapidly acting, and safe treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. In short-term treatment, pregabalin does not appear to have the withdrawal symptoms associated with the benzodiazepines.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^68e57472]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Although in some circumstances it might be appropriate to prescribe opioids to a patient who is also prescribed benzodiazepines (e.g. severe acute pain in a patient taking long-term, stable low-dose benzodiazepine therapy), clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently. In addition, clinicians should consider whether benefits outweigh risks for concurrent use of opioids with other central nervous system depressants (e.g. muscle relaxants, nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, and potentially sedating anticonvulsant medications such as gabapentin and pregabalin).
Buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other medications that depress the central nervous system.
Clinicians should check the PDMP for concurrent controlled medications prescribed by other clinicians (see Recommendation 9) and should consider involving pharmacists as part of the management team when opioids are coprescribed with other central nervous system depressants.
In patients receiving opioids and benzodiazepines long term, clinicians should carefully weigh the benefits and risks of continuing therapy with opioids and benzodiazepines and discuss with patients and other members of the patient’s care team.
Risks of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use are likely to be greater with unpredictable use of either medication, with use of higher-dosage opioids and higher-dosage benzodiazepines in combination, or with use with other substances including alcohol (compared with long-term, stable use of lower-dosage opioids and lower-dosage benzodiazepines without other substances).
In specific situations, benzodiazepines can be beneficial, and stopping benzodiazepines can be destabilizing.
Clinicians should taper benzodiazepines gradually before discontinuation because abrupt withdrawal can be associated with rebound anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, delirium tremens, and, rarely, death. The rate of tapering should be individualized.
If benzodiazepines prescribed for anxiety are tapered or discontinued, or if patients receiving opioids require treatment for anxiety, evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy), specific antidepressants or other nonbenzodiazepine medications approved for anxiety, or both, should be offered.
Clinicians should communicate with other clinicians managing the patient to discuss the patient’s needs, prioritize patient goals, weigh risks of concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid exposure, and coordinate care.

### Relative efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapeutic interventions for diabetic peripheral neuropathy: a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis [^438f07ad]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a most common devitalizing complication of diabetes mellitus, which is primarily characterized by sensory loss, paresthesia, prickling, pain, or allodynia.

Objectives

To evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of the interventions used in the DPN pain management and rank their order.

Study Design

A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA).

Methods

Randomized, controlled trials were identified through a comprehensive, systematic literature exploration, primarily utilizing the PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid, and Cochrane Library databases. The efficacy and safety outcomes consist of the proportion of patients reporting either 30% or 50% pain reduction and overall withdrawal or withdrawal due to adverse drug events, respectively. Effect estimates from Bayesian NMA were presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Heterogeneity and convergence were assessed by using I2 and deviation information criteria. The risk of bias was evaluated by using Pedro Scale.

Results

A total of 3,246 potentially relevant trials were identified and screened, finally 43 trials consisting of 7,877 randomized patients met the inclusion criteria. Statistically significant treatment difference for 50% pain reduction was reported for duloxetine vs. placebo (OR: 2.50; CrI: 1.62-3.91), mirogabalin vs. placebo (OR: 3.25; CrI: 1.16-9.35), pregabalin vs. placebo (OR: 2.33; CrI: 1.69-3.27), duloxetine vs. carbamazepine (OR: 3.37; CrI: 1.07-10.90), mirogabalin vs. carbamazepine (OR: 4.39; CrI: 1.01-19.63), mirogabalin vs. lamotrigine (OR: 4.05: CrI: 1.07-15.77), pregabalin vs. lamotrigine (OR: 2.90, CrI: 1.19-7.22) and pregabalin vs. nortriptyline (OR: 4.10, CrI: 1.13-5.28). Nortriptyline reported the highest possibility of achieving 30% and 50% pain reduction. Sodium valproate and benztropine reported the highest probability of total withdrawals and withdrawals due to adverse drug events, respectively.

Limitation

The different follow-up time of the included studies can result in the variation of intended results.

Conclusion

Nortriptyline reported the advantage relative to other drugs in achieving 30% and 50% pain reduction from the baseline. Gabapentin reported a significance of 50% pain reduction relative to placebo.
