## Question

Hypovolumia hyponayremia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage hypovolemic hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia or hypertonic causes. Then, I should verify the clinical diagnosis of hypovolemia and distinguish it from SIADH using urine studies and response to isotonic saline when needed. Next, I will assess symptom severity and chronicity to decide on urgency and initial therapy. After that, I should choose between hypertonic saline for severe symptoms and isotonic saline for hypovolemia without severe encephalopathy, and calculate dosing while planning for overcorrection risks. Finally, I will set a monitoring cadence and define what to do if sodium rises too fast or the patient becomes unstable, and close with a concise, practical summary.

> Let me first confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia, because I need to ensure we are not dealing with hyperglycemia-induced translocational hyponatremia or pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia or paraproteinemia, so I should check measured serum osmolality and, if high, correct sodium for glucose before proceeding, since this will pivot the entire management strategy [^111duo5q].

> Next, I should review volume status to establish the category of hyponatremia, and I must not over-rely on physical examination alone because bedside signs of hypovolemia are insensitive and interobserver variability is high, so I will combine history, exam, and labs, particularly urine sodium and osmolality, while remembering that the most reliable bedside discriminator between hypovolemia and euvolemic SIADH is the biochemical response to isotonic saline when uncertainty persists [^114NwZaW] [^113HX3hv].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic threshold I am using for urine sodium, because I initially thought UNa less than 20 mmol/L would suffice for hypovolemia. However, a commonly cited threshold from saline-responsive phenotyping supports using less than 30 mmol/L to better separate hypovolemic from SIADH cases, so I should use UNa less than 30 mmol/L to support hypovolemia, recognizing that diuretics and adrenal insufficiency can confound this and that a therapeutic trial of isotonic saline remains a pragmatic gold standard in equivocal cases [^113HX3hv] [^114NwZaW].

> I will now examine symptom severity and chronicity, because these determine urgency and the safe rate of correction. Severe symptoms such as seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest warrant emergent hypertonic therapy, whereas mild symptoms or chronic cases call for slower, cautious correction to avoid osmotic demyelination, and I should treat chronicity as more than 48 hours when uncertain to err on the conservative side [^111WyraN].

> For severely symptomatic hypovolemic hyponatremia, I should not delay hypertonic saline. Let me think about dosing, and the most reproducible approach is 100 mL of 3% NaCl IV boluses repeated up to three times at 10-minute intervals, targeting an initial 4–6 mmol/L rise to reverse cerebral edema, with early cessation once symptoms improve or a total rise of about 10 mmol/L is achieved, followed by transition to isotonic saline to correct volume [^111Qzmkn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with isotonic saline for hypovolemia. I should confirm that in the absence of severe encephalopathy, normal saline at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour is appropriate to restore extracellular volume and suppress vasopressin, which will then allow free water excretion and improve sodium gradually, while remembering that isotonic saline can worsen hyponatremia in SIADH, so I need to be confident in the volume assessment before choosing this route [^1144sLbT] [^114NwZaW].

> Let me calculate the expected sodium rise using a structured approach, because I need to anticipate the effect of infused sodium. The Adrogué–Madias equation can estimate change, but I should double-check for pitfalls in hypovolemia where water diuresis and shifts in total body water can make the actual rise faster than predicted, so I will plan smaller, titrated increments and monitor frequently to avoid overcorrection [^1145RSFN] [^117RCyx2].

> I should confirm the correction limits to prevent osmotic demyelination. In chronic or unknown-duration cases, I will target no more than 8 mmol/L in 24 hours, and if I overshoot or the patient suddenly excretes large volumes of dilute urine, I may need to administer electrolyte-free water or desmopressin to safely relower sodium within the allowable window, ideally with expert consultation [^117M8SDu] [^113PyTGH].

> Next, I should review the monitoring cadence. For hypertonic therapy, I will check sodium every 4 hours during infusion, and in any actively treated case I should obtain frequent early measurements, with at least checks at 6 and 12 hours and then daily until stable, because dynamic changes, especially after volume repletion, can accelerate correction unexpectedly [^114jzD4z] [^117Nardw].

> But wait, what if the patient is unstable with shock? I need to ensure hemodynamics come first, so in hypovolemic shock I will prioritize rapid isotonic resuscitation even if it risks a faster sodium rise, managing the correction rate afterward, whereas in hypervolemic liver disease or heart failure I should avoid routine hypertonic saline and focus on fluid restriction, cause-directed therapy, and in cirrhosis consider albumin in selected inpatients per society guidance [^112NDPcb] [^111MkbVR] [^115b7yVF].

> I should double-check for common pitfalls: mistaking SIADH for hypovolemia leads to isotonic saline worsening hyponatremia, diuretics and adrenal insufficiency can mimic a high urine sodium hypovolemic state, and in neurocritical contexts such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, fluid restriction may precipitate delayed cerebral ischemia, so I must align fluid strategy with the underlying neurovascular risk profile [^114NwZaW] [^113HX3hv] [^115ycmPv].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia, classify as hypovolemic using history, exam, urine studies, and, when needed, a cautious isotonic saline trial, treat severe symptoms immediately with hypertonic boluses, otherwise correct hypovolemia with isotonic saline while limiting the daily sodium rise in chronic cases, and monitor closely with a plan to rescue overcorrection, adjusting therapy stepwise as the clinical picture evolves [^116Rry73] [^1144sLbT] [^117Nardw].

Hypovolemic hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mEq/L due to **sodium and water loss with relatively greater water retention**, producing hypotonicity and low effective arterial blood volume. The most common causes are gastrointestinal losses (vomiting, diarrhea), diuretics, and **third-space losses** (pancreatitis, burns, peritonitis). Diagnosis relies on **clinical hypovolemia plus low urine sodium (< 30 mmol/L)** [^113HX3hv] and high urine osmolality (> 100 mOsm/kg) [^113nG35Z]. Management is **isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)** [^114NwZaW] to restore volume and suppress vasopressin; **hypertonic saline is reserved for severe symptoms** [^114yeaQw] [^116Rry73]. Monitor sodium closely to avoid overcorrection [^117DP8jL] and osmotic demyelination [^111V9Y4A].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hypovolemic hyponatremia arises when sodium and water are lost, but **vasopressin-driven water retention** predominates, lowering serum sodium and causing hypotonicity [^111fLWER]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Vasopressin secretion**: Non-osmotic stimulation from volume depletion increases water reabsorption, diluting sodium [^111fLWER].
- **Renal response**: Increased water reabsorption with ongoing sodium loss further lowers serum sodium [^114NwZaW].
- **Hypotonicity**: Excess water relative to solute produces hypotonic hyponatremia [^111fLWER].

---

## Etiology

Common causes include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Gastrointestinal losses | - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Nasogastric suction [^111duo5q] |
| Renal losses | - Diuretics (thiazides, loop) <br/> - Osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia, mannitol) <br/> - Salt-wasting nephropathy [^112xVMrb] |
| Third-space losses | - Pancreatitis <br/> - Burns <br/> - Peritonitis <br/> - Bowel obstruction [^111duo5q] |
| Endocrine disorders | - Adrenal insufficiency <br/> - Hypothyroidism [^111fLWER] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms reflect both **hypovolemia and hyponatremia**:

- **Hypovolemia**: Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, thirst [^114NwZaW].
- **Hyponatremia**: Nausea, headache, confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma (more likely with acute or severe hyponatremia) [^111WyraN].
- **Severity correlation**: Symptoms correlate with the rapidity and magnitude of sodium decline [^1169CfKA].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Laboratory tests

- **Serum sodium**: < 135 mEq/L [^111fLWER].
- **Serum osmolality**: Low (< 275 mOsm/kg) [^113nG35Z].
- **Urine sodium**: Typically low (< 30 mmol/L) due to sodium conservation [^113HX3hv].
- **Urine osmolality**: Elevated (> 100 mOsm/kg) due to vasopressin-driven water retention [^113nG35Z].
- **Other tests**: Serum potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, creatinine, glucose, TSH, cortisol, ACTH as indicated [^113nG35Z].

---

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should evaluate for **orthostatic vital signs** and signs of dehydration, and distinguish hypovolemia from euvolemia or hypervolemia, which guides therapy [^114NwZaW].

---

## Management

### General principles

General principles include treating the **underlying cause** by identifying and addressing the source of sodium and water loss, initiating **careful correction** to avoid rapid sodium rises and osmotic demyelination [^111fLWER], and providing **close monitoring** of serum sodium, urine output, and clinical status to prevent complications [^114Mg1Pm].

---

### Fluid therapy

- **Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)**: First-line to restore volume and suppress vasopressin; sodium correction is typically 4–6 mmol/L in 24 hours [^114NwZaW] [^1144sLbT].
- **Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl)**: Reserve for severe symptoms (seizures, coma) with a 100 mL bolus repeated up to three times, targeting a 4–6 mmol/L initial rise [^114yeaQw] [^111Qzmkn].
- **Avoid hypotonic fluids**: Do not use until volume is restored and vasopressin is suppressed [^111Qzmkn].

---

### Monitoring and prevention of complications

Monitoring should include checking serum sodium **every 4–6 hours initially**, then daily once stable, and watching for overcorrection; if the rise exceeds 8 mmol/L in 24 hours, manage with desmopressin and electrolyte-free water [^114jzD4z] [^117Nardw] [^117M8SDu] [^113PyTGH]. Prevent complications by adhering to correction limits (≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours) and adjusting therapy based on serial sodium measurements and urine output [^117M8SDu] [^117Nardw] [^113PyTGH].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the **cause, severity, and chronicity**. Acute severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema and death if untreated [^111WX8Kf], whereas chronic hyponatremia increases risks of falls, fractures, and cognitive impairment [^1169CfKA]. Overcorrection risks osmotic demyelination, so careful monitoring is essential [^111V9Y4A].

---

Hypovolemic hyponatremia reflects sodium and water loss with disproportionate water retention; **isotonic saline is first-line**, with hypertonic saline reserved for severe symptoms, and **close monitoring is critical** to avoid overcorrection and osmotic demyelination [^111WyraN].

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### Evaluation and management of hypo-osmolality in hospitalized patients [^1126c3pz]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting. Abnormalities of the mechanisms that maintain normal water and sodium metabolism are often present in hospitalized patients, including defects in renal water excretion. All of the current therapeutic approaches in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and other forms of vasopressin-induced hyponatremia have significant limitations. Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated that antagonists of the AVP V2 receptor in the kidney are effective in correcting hyponatremia. These new agents have been termed "aquaretics" because of their ability to induce a free water diuresis without the natriuresis or kaliuresis characteristic of diuretic drugs. When approved for clinical use, selective V2, and possibly also combined V1 + V2 receptor antagonists will be helpful in therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

Avoidance of hypovolemia and hyponatremia

Hyponatremia and hypovolemia occur frequently after SAH due to physiological changes favoring excessive natriuresis and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone elevation, and have been associated with impending DCI. Retrospective data indicate that fluid restriction, the typical treatment for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), can be deleterious and increases the risk of DCI due to aggravation of hypovolemia. Isotonic crystalloid fluid resuscitation targeting normal serum sodium values and euvolemia is presently the favored fluid management strategy for preventing DCI. The latter is notoriously difficult to assess in critically ill patients, and the readers are referred to papers dedicated to this specific subject for a more in-depth approach to the matter. Administration of fludrocortisone (between 0.2 and 0.4 mg/day) has been shown to reduce the occurrence of hyponatremia, with some indication towards DCI reduction. Anecdotal evidence indicates that correction of acute symptomatic hyponatremia with hypertonic saline (3%) infusion is usually effective.

Introduction

Hyponatremia represents a serious health hazard. Hospitalized patients, nursing home residents, women, – and childrenexhibit high frequency and/or severity of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia developing during the course of other morbid conditions increases their severity. – Estimates of direct costs for treating hyponatremia in the United States ranged between $1.61 and $3.6 billion.

Clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are universal – and range from subtle (disturbances of balance, problems in cognition detected only during specific testing) to life‐threatening manifestations of increased intracranial pressure with life‐threatening hypoxia – and noncardiac pulmonary edema. Although the treating physicians must make an accurate diagnosis based on well‐established and described clinical criteria, treatment is also guided by the severity of these manifestations. The magnitude and rate of increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na]) during treatment are critical. Overcorrection of chronic hyponatremia may lead to osmotic myelinolysis, – whereas undercorrection may fail to prevent life‐threatening manifestations.

The mainstays of treatment are restricted free water intake and saline infusion, with or without furosemide. There are 2 indications for saline infusion in hyponatremia. Overt manifestations of hyponatremia are treated with hypertonic saline, whereas symptomatic hypovolemia associated with hyponatremia without overt symptoms is usually treated with isotonic saline. – In both situations, the infusion of saline results in rising [Na]. This rise can be slower or faster than desired, with potentially dire clinical consequences.

To achieve the desired rise in [Na], several formulas, most often the Adrogue–Madias formula, are used to calculate volume, rate, and strength of saline infusion. The predictive accuracy of the Adrogue–Madias formula is, in general, good. However, the rise in [Na] exceeds the value predicted by this formula in some instances, particularly in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia. –

This report presents the principles of management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. We analyzed factors that cause deviations in the change of [Na] from the predicted values. We present a clinical protocol for managing hyponatremia with saline infusion based on this analysis.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116m8pt2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — scope and prevention/treatment focus — notes it is beyond the scope of this guideline to provide an in-depth discussion of fluid hydration to prevent EAH and minimize the occurrence of ≥ 2% total body water loss, and states there is no single recommendation (drinking to thirst or preplanned scheduled drinking) that fits all individuals. The intent is to provide evidence to mitigate morbidity and mortality, recommend safe hydration guidance for preventing overhydration during exertional activities, and present evidence for the most effective treatment protocols when overhydration leads to mild to severe EAH.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^111Qzmkn]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^114nfxLE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

Sodium Concentration and Volume of Infused Saline

Table 1 shows the symbols for volumes and concentrations used in this report. Sodium concentration in commercial saline solutions represents 2 hypertonic (0.855 and 0.513 mol/L), 1 "isotonic" (0.154 mol/L), and 3 "hypotonic" (0.130, 0.077, and 0.034 mol/L) values. Sodium concentration in the infusate is usually 0.513 mol/L for hyponatremia with pronounced symptomsand 0.154 mol/L for volume replacement in patients with symptomatic hypovolemia.

Table 1.
Symbols and Interpretations

The sodium concentration in the infusate should not be limited by the strength of the commercial saline solutions. Mixing of saline and dextrose in water can produce any desired sodium concentration by the use of formula 1 (Table 2), which can be of help in hypovolemic hyponatremia with minimal hyponatremic symptomatology, when a large volume of infusate must be reconciled with the need to produce only a modest rise in [Na]. A suitable sodium concentration of the infusate in this instance could be the target [Na] at 24 hours. For example, the target [Na] at 24 hours would be 117 mEq/L in a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia and initial [Na] of 111 mEq/L. By formula 1, the addition of 0.316 L of dextrose in water to 1 L of 0.154 mol/L saline produces a sodium concentration of 117 mEq/L in the infusate.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^116cGVeF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The Hyponatremia Intervention Trial (HIT) is a large, international, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) currently underway aiming to recruit 2278 hospitalized participants with pNa less than 130 mmol/L to be allocated 1:1 to receive either targeted correction of sodium concentration or standard care. The trial will include patients with hyponatremia irrespective of underlying cause or volume status. Targeted correction will aim to be achieved by adhering to predetermined diagnostic and treatment algorithms. The primary outcome will be death or rehospitalization within 30 days, and secondary outcomes will include measures of falls, fractures, hyponatremia recurrence, quality of life, and adverse events (eg, ODS). The results of this trial will provide high-quality evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that intervention to correct hyponatremia improves clinical outcomes.

Data regarding the mortality risk of SIAD specifically are conflicting, with some studies showing increased mortality and some potentially showing reduced mortality compared with other causes of hyponatremia. A prospective observational study in Ireland evaluated mortality outcomes in 1323 hyponatremic patients (43.3% with SIAD) compared to matched controls. SIAD was associated with increased mortality compared to normonatremic controls (RR 1.76; 95% CI, 1.08–2.8). However mortality risk in SIAD was not as high as for other causes of hyponatremia. Hypervolemic patients had an RR of mortality of 2.9 compared to SIAD, and hypovolemic patients had an RR of 1.6. A recent Swiss retrospective population-based cohort study of 47 176 medical inpatients with hyponatremia (11.9% with SIAD) using propensity-score matching found no significant effect of hyponatremia on mortality as a whole, but sensitivity stratification by non-SIAD and SIAD hyponatremic patients showed opposing results. While non-SIAD hyponatremic patients had a 10% higher risk for in-hospital mortality, SIAD seemed to be associated with reduced mortality — however, 30-day readmission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay were all increased in SIAD. SIAD is known to be underrecorded in hospital coding, hence the accuracy of SIAD classification in this study may be low. This is particularly relevant when assessing mortality rates, as if a patient dies of an underlying malignancy, anecdotally, the hospital discharge documentation is even less likely to record comorbid SIAD.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^116sgW5L]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is common in patients with stroke and associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality risk. The present review presents the underlying causes and provides a thorough algorithm for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in stroke patients. Concomitant diseases and therapies, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, along with diuretics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors are the most common causes of hyponatraemia in community. In the setting of acute stroke, the emergence of hyponatraemia might be attributed to the administration of hypotonic solutions and drugs (ie. mannitol and antiepileptics), poor solute intake, infections, as well as stroke-related conditions or complications, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, cerebral salt wasting syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatraemia, usually caused by hyperglycaemia or recent mannitol administration in patients with stroke. Determining urine osmolality, urine sodium level and volume status are the following steps in the differentiation of hypotonic hyponatraemia. Of note, specific parameters, such as fractional uric acid and urea excretion, along with plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic yield. Therapeutic options are based on the duration and symptoms of hyponatremia. In the case of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline administration is recommended. Hypovolaemic chronic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic solution administration. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for the rest forms of chronic hyponatraemia, therapies increasing renal free water excretion may be necessary. Loop diuretics and urea serve this purpose in patients with stroke, whereas sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors appear to be a promising therapy. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the appropriate restoration of sodium level improves outcomes in such patients. Randomized trials designed to compare therapeutic strategies in managing hyponatraemia in patients with stroke are required.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

Pathogenetic Mechanism, Chronicity

Establishing the pathogenetic mechanism of hyponatremia requires a detailed history that includes medications and drinking habits, physical examination with emphasis on neurological and respiratory signs and on volume status, and serum plus urine laboratory testing. The first step in the differential diagnosis consists of eliminating hypertonic hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia.,

True (hypotonic) hyponatremia results from inability to excrete water loads, usual or excessive. Serum vasopressin is higher than is appropriate for the [Na] in most instances. Hyponatremia with inappropriately high serum vasopressin levels can be hypovolemic (ie, body water losses relatively lower than sodium losses), euvolemic (ie, body water excess often with some sodium loss), or hypervolemic (ie, water gain in excess of sodium gain).

Hypovolemic hyponatremia presents special challenges. Previous diagnosis of a hypervolemic state, such as congestive heart failure, complicates the diagnosis. The pattern of urinary chemistries (low sodium concentration and high osmolality) is indistinguishable between hypovolemic hyponatremia from extrarenal causes and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Both conditions lead to vasopressin secretion. The differential diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination. Cautious volume replacement may help when the diagnosis of hypovolemia is doubtful. Thirst from hypovolemia may increase the water load, and alterations in renal circulation may contribute to the decreased renal ability to excrete water.

From a pathophysiological perspective, the loss of brain organic osmolytes occurs with greater chronicity of hyponatremia. – Unfortunately, this cannot be determined using existing clinical tools, but a recognition of this fact is essential in understanding potential deleterious aspects of treatment. History, prior measurements of [Na], and the neurological picture at presentation are the only available clinical criteria for determining chronicity. Acute hyponatremia exhibits pronounced brain cell swelling and more severe symptoms but lower risk of osmotic myelinolysis after rapid correction of the [Na], compared with chronic hyponatremia with a similar [Na] value. It is believed that the risk of myelinolysis is greatest where organic osmolyte recovery lags, and in humans, this area is usually the pons. However, chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurological manifestations. When doubt exists, it is safer to consider hyponatremia as chronic.

### Incidence, classification and diagnosis of hyponatremia in patients admitted to the oncology ward… [^1137MYmm]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract e20656 Background: Hyponatremia is associated with a poor prognosis in several malignancies. It is classified by volemic status into hypovolemic, euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. HN in Oncology patients is often considered primarily euvolemic, secondary to the Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-diuretic Hormone Secretion. Yet the incidence, classification and diagnosis of HN has not been studied in patients in the Oncology ward. Methods: This is a retrospective, descriptive study of patients admitted to the Medical Oncology ward at the Clínico San Carlos Hospital from May 2013 through May 2014. HN was detected at the Emergency Room or during hospitalization. Volemic status was assessed by physical examination, confirmed by lab tests when needed, and the cause diagnosed. Initial serum glucose, urea, creatinine, sodium and potassium were determined in all patients.

Serum total proteins, uric acid, and osmolality; urine sodium, K and osmolality were available in some patients, and Verbalis criteria for diagnosis of SIADH applied. HN was classified as mild, moderate and severe. SNa was corrected for glycemia. Most hyponatremic patients were hypovolemic, 42% euvolemic and 9% hypervolemic. Causes of hypovolemic HN: 31% gastrointestinal loss and 36% sepsis. In euvolemic HN, 71% of the cases were secondary to pain, and 29% to SIADH. Conclusions: HN is a common disorder among patients in the Oncology ward, albeit usually mild. Although most hyponatremic patients already presented HN at admission, the development of HN during hospitalization is frequent. Most hyponatremic patients are hypovolemic. In euvolemic patients, pain is a more frequent cause of HN than SIADH.

These results underline the importance of a correct classification and diagnosis of HN in admitted Oncology patients, to assure correct management.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^112xVMrb]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The approach for the management of hyponatremia depends on the patient's volume status. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is typically attributed to an excess of total body water due to conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or heart, liver, and kidney failure. Euvolemic hyponatremia is caused by various conditions including Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH), polydipsia, or hypothyroidism as there is a stable total body sodium level alongside an increase in total body water. Various risk factors for SIADH include central nervous system disturbances, lower respiratory tract infections, drugs, and certain malignancies. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is due to a depletion of total body sodium, often caused by gastrointestinal losses, the use of diuretics, and mineralocorticoid insufficiencies. Patients experiencing hypovolemic hyponatremia with shock require fluid resuscitation using 0.9% saline, Ringers, Plasmalyte, or other isotonic solutions to restore hemodynamic stability. Treatment for hypervolemic hyponatremia varies depending on the etiology. For example, heart failure may be treated with diuretics whereas dialysis can be used to treat patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients presenting with euvolemic hyponatremia, such as in the instance of SIADH or psychogenic polydipsia must undergo fluid restriction. However, in cases of hypothyroidism, the underlying condition should be addressed for treatment. Iatrogenic hyponatremia is another concern in pediatric patients undergoing treatment with intravenous fluids. The 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines recommend using isotonic fluids, such as 0.9% saline or Ringer's lactate, to maintain proper sodium levels and prevent the development of iatrogenic hyponatremia.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Hyponatremia and brain injury: historical and contemporary perspectives [^1165uxHq]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in neurocritical care patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research into the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting (CSW), their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still not fully understood. This paper reviews the history behind our understanding of hyponatremia in patients with neurologic injury, including the first reports of CSW and SIADH, and current and future challenges to diagnosis and management in this setting. Such challenges include distinguishing CSW, SIADH, and hypovolemic hyponatremia due to a normal pressure natriuresis from the administration of large volumes of fluids, and hyponatremia due to certain medications used in the neurocritical care population. Potential treatments for hyponatremia include mineralocorticoids and vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists, but further work is required to validate their usage. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlining hyponatremia in neurocritical care patients remains our biggest obstacle to optimizing patient outcomes in this challenging population.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Contemporary management of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. An update for the intensivist [^111cJVRt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), excessive salt wasting, hypovolemia or a combination of both. Determination of intravascular volume status along with urinary osmolarity and sodium excretion may be used to determine the cause of hyponatremia and guide the approach to its correction that may include free water optimization, avoiding fluid restriction, sodium supplementation (hypertonic saline or enteral replacement), or occasionally administration of mineralocorticoids, even if debatable.

Adequate nutrition is essential for recovery. Oral or enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral nutrition when possible. Hyperglycaemia is associated with worse outcomes. Glucose levels should be closely monitored, and if elevated, appropriate insulin therapy may be initiated to maintain glycaemia in a typical range between 140 and 180 mg/dL.

It is important to note that individual patient characteristics, the severity of aSAH, and other co-existing conditions may influence the specific approach to metabolic and fluid management. Thus, these strategies should be tailored to each patient's unique circumstances, and close monitoring and collaboration with a multidisciplinary team are crucial for optimal management.

Fever is extremely common in patients after aSAH; early, i.e. within the first 3 days, fever is frequently neurogenic. Its occurrence (regardless of the cause, neurogenic, infective, or drug-related) is associated with worse outcomes. Recent recommendations suggest active fever treatment, continuous core temperature monitoring, and avoiding temperatures > 37.5°. Other principles for the general management of these patients and their complications include deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis after aneurysm treatment to prevent thromboembolic events, and screening/ treatment for systemic infective complications.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114xRHnt]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Hyponatremia in congestive heart failure [^115uYpny]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia has been identified as a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and other edematous disorders and can lead to severe neurologic derangements. Low cardiac output and blood pressure associated with CHF triggers a compensatory response by the body that activates several neurohormonal systems designed to preserve arterial blood volume and pressure. Hyponatremia in patients with CHF is primarily caused by increased activity of arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP increases free-water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, increasing blood volume and diluting plasma sodium concentrations. Hyponatremia may also be triggered by diuretic therapy used in the management of symptoms of CHF. Hyponatremic disorders occur when the normal ratio of solutes to body water content is altered by parallel changes in serum sodium and osmolality. Hyponatremia is generally defined as a serum sodium ion concentration < 135 to 136 mmol/L and can be broadly categorized into 2 types, dilutional or depletional. Dilutional hyponatremia is the most common form of hyponatremia and is caused by excess water retention. Depletional hyponatremia is usually hypovolemic, with an absolute deficiency of water but a relative excess of body water compared with sodium concentration.

### Investigation and management of moderate to severe inpatient hyponatraemia in an Australian tertiary hospital [^113nG35Z]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatraemia is defined by a serum sodium (Na) concentration < 135 mmol/L. It is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalised patients at a rate of 15–30%. A prospective cohort study of 98,411 hospitalised patients demonstrated that even mild hyponatraemia (Na 130–134 mmol/L) is associated with increased mortality in hospital (OR 1.37), at 1 year (OR 1.35) and at 5 years post discharge (OR 1.24).

Traditionally, hyponatraemia is classified clinically by volume status into hypovolaemic, euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia. The most common cause of euvolaemic hyponatraemia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is characterized by dysregulated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and water retention, despite low serum Na and osmolality. Diagnostic criteria include: euvolaemic state, normal thyroid hormone and cortisol levels, serum Na < 135 mmol/L, reduced serum osmolality < 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality > 100 mOsm/Kg and urine Na > 30 mmol/L.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — in-hospital assessment and management: Urgent measurement of blood sodium by the most rapidly available means, assessment for clinical signs suggestive of developing cerebral edema, and obtaining and storing specimens for later analysis of blood serum osmolality and urine sodium and osmolality are advised; provide supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%, restrict fluids until onset of urination, and avoid intravenous normal saline until sodium correction is initiated, though normal saline may be required for hypovolemic shock or in renal protection therapy for rhabdomyolysis; in severe cases, administer intravenous 3% sodium chloride as a 100-mL bolus repeated twice at 10-min intervals aiming to reverse cerebral edema, and aim to increase serum sodium by approximately 4 to 5 mmol·L⁻¹ or until neurological symptoms are reversed by active treatment, then allow remaining correction to occur spontaneously via urinary free water excretion.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia. Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5.
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias. However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Recognition and treatment of hyponatremia in acutely ill hospitalized patients [^116nDHcR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this paper was to discuss the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of hyponatremia among critically ill, hospitalized patients (eg, after surgery or in the intensive care unit).

Methods

English-language literature published between 1967 and 2006 was searched using several key words (AVP receptor antagonists, hyponatremia, SIADH, conivaptan, tolvaptan, and lixivaptan) and by accessing MEDLINE and ScienceDirect. Meeting abstracts from scientific sessions (American Society of Nephrology Renal Week 2004 and the Endocrine Society's 87th Annual Meeting [2005]) were reviewed. The package insert for conivaptan hydrochloride injection was referenced from. Clinical trials included in this review were randomized and placebo controlled.

Results

Based on the literature we researched, hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in critical care and is associated with a variety of conditions, including congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Because hyponatremia can arise in hypervolemic, euvolemic, and hypovolemic states, clinicians may not recognize its presence and cause. Incorrect management can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Physicians need to recognize risk factors and symptoms and use appropriate treatment guidelines for hyponatremia. Traditionally, therapy for hyponatremia has been limited by efficacy and safety concerns. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptor antagonists, therapeutic agents that promote aquaresis in patients with hyponatremia by targeting V(1a) receptors in the vascular smooth muscle, V(2) receptors in the kidney, or both, are under development. A dual-receptor antagonist targeting both V(1a) and V(2) receptors is now approved for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in hospitalized patients.

Conclusions

Hyponatremia, an electrolyte abnormality found in critically ill patients, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. AVP receptor antagonists show promise as effective and tolerable treatments for patients with hyponatremia.

Risk factors for EAH — For hypervolemic EAH, the major risk factor is excessive hypotonic fluid intake beyond the capacity for renal water excretion. High ambient temperatures appear to increase the risk of EAH, as do longer exercising times and nausea (with or without vomiting). Although women may have greater symptomatic hyponatremia incidence in some environments, when adjusted for body mass index and racing time the apparent sex difference was not statistically significant, meaning men and women are at equal risk for developing EAH and adverse consequences. Along with other nonsomotic stimuli to AVP secretion, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been implicated as a potential risk factor by potentiating the water retention effects of AVP at the kidney, although direct causal evidence remains conflicting. The far less common hypovolemic EAH variant has been associated with chronic diuretic use, higher ambient temperatures, and longer duration of physical activity, especially in older men participating in long-duration exercise in remote settings.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

Pathogenesis of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — The primary mechanism leading to the majority of EAH cases is overconsumption of hypotonic fluids, likely in combination with nonosmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin (AVP), and a hypovolemic form, although far less common than the symptomatic hypervolemic form, may be more prevalent in certain circumstances. AVP secretion may play a role in the majority of individuals with EAH, and release of AVP leads to water retention in the distal tubule of the kidney with a net result of lowering serum sodium; potential stimuli include nonspecific stresses, nausea/vomiting, hypoglycemia, exposure to heat, and possibly medication use such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

When testing is unavailable, correct field diagnosis is mostly predicated on obtaining an accurate history of total fluid intake, and supportive features include the absence of major signs and symptoms common to symptomatic hypovolemia, weight gain, and that urine output may be an unreliable differentiator. The guideline states, "When available, point-of-care testing should be done on at-risk, symptomatic patients. If unavailable, integrate all available clinical and historical information into an assessment of the patient's hydration status (history of fluid intake, food intake, preexisting signs and symptoms, body weight if available, and urine output).

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^1169CfKA]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Observations Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific to severe and life-threatening. Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7. 4 years. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

Identifying a urine sodium threshold for diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) vs hypovolemic hyponatremia: urine sodium concentrations (UNa) in a prospective assessment of 58 patients with plasma sodium concentration less than 130 mmol/L, classified according to response to intravenous 0.9% saline rehydration (gold standard assessment of volume status). This study recommended a threshold of UNa greater than 30 mmol/L to differentiate hypovolemia (saline responders) from SIAD (saline nonresponders). Spot UNa in saline responders and nonresponders. All individual values as well as the mean ± 1 SEM are included. Figure reproduced from Chung 1987 with permission.

Factors that may affect the accuracy of UNa include metabolic alkalosis and dietary solute intake. In the setting of metabolic alkalosis, UNa is not a reliable indicator of volume status (due to excretion of bicarbonate with sodium). In such cases, the urine chloride concentration, which is also typically low in hypovolemia, can be used instead. This assessment assumes normal salt and water intake, as low solute intake can lead to a low UNa even in SIAD — which reduces the specificity for diagnosing hypovolemia as a differential.

It is important to note that hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency and diuretics is usually volume responsive and characterized by a high UNa, hence these are important differentials to consider (discussed later). It has been suggested that calculating fractional excretion of uric acid (FE-UA) is another measure that can assist in diagnosing SIAD, potentially useful in patients on diuretics in whom UNa may be less reliable (see Fig. 2). This is because uric acid is excreted in the proximal tubule and hence is not subject to interference from common diuretics. In one study, a raised FE-UA (> 12%) had a 100% positive predictive value for diagnosis of SIAD regardless of recent diuretics. A challenge, however, is that such results may not be obtained at the point of care quickly enough to influence treatment decisions.

### A step-by-step guide for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke [^114pTHrV]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Caveats in treatment of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke

Current guidelines for the management of hyponatraemia do not refer specifically to patients with stroke. Thus, physicians should pay attention to some crucial points. First, any fluid resuscitation used for the restoration of low sodium levels should consider the type of stroke. Cerebral perfusion is important in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, but control and reduction of blood pressure is crucial in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. Nevertheless, a close monitoring of patients' volume status and a vigilant fluid balance management are strongly recommended in both conditions. Second, any intervention aiming fluid restriction may be inappropriate in stroke patients due to increased risk for deteriorating an already impaired cerebral circulation. In addition, fluid restriction is also contra-indicated in hypovolemic states such as CSW, which can be misdiagnosed as SIADH. On the contrary, isotonic saline administration, commonly used in stroke patients, should be avoided in patients with SIADH-related hyponatraemia as it can aggravate hyponatraemia. Considering its neuroprotective effects and lower ODS risk compared with other therapies, urea may be an attractive option in treating stroke patients with hyponatraemia due to SIADH. It should be emphasized, however, that the clinical experience with urea administration is limited, especially in patients with stroke. Despite the evidence showing that conivaptan diminishes the cerebral edema and blood–brain barrier disruption in an experimental stroke model, studies evaluating the role of vaptans in hyponatraemic patients with stroke are lacking. On the contrary, the neuroprotective effects along with the well-established cardiorenal benefits of glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors cast them a promising therapy of non-hypovolemic chronic hyponatraemia. Finally, the presented algorithms for the restoration of sodium levels herein could also be used in patients with brain injuries, considering the increased prevalence of hyponatremia and its common aetiologies, such as SIADH and CSW, in the latter. Nevertheless, intracerebral haemorrhage is a separate disease with different causes and pathophysiology than stroke and thus any intervention should be personalized.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^112nQieF]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The Hyponatremia Registry is the largest observational hyponatremia study to date. The current analysis focuses on the subgroup of cancer-related SIADH, which accounts for approximately one third of all cases of SIADH. With 358 patients, this analysis represents the largest group of cancer patients with SIADH ever studied.

Of note, 39% of all cancer patients initially enrolled as euvolemic hyponatremia had to be excluded, mostly because of clear signs of hypo- or hypervolemia. Thorough assessment of volume status, however, is key for determining the cause of hyponatremia. Although SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion, clinicians apparently readily interpret hyponatremia in cancer patients as SIADH without excluding alternative causes. In addition, a minimal set of lab results is mandatory for a diagnosis of SIADH, but was performed in only 46% and a hyponatremia expert was consulted in only 43% of patients. In line with these findings, sub-optimal management of hyponatremia in general is widespread, as has been reported repeatedly. However, in contrast to what we have previously demonstrated in the overall SIADH population, proper work-up of hyponatremia was not associated with superior treatment effectiveness in the cancer-related SIADH subgroup.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Establishing a bedside diagnosis of hypovolemia… [^1167fdfR]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Various signs, including postural vital signs, capillary refill time, skin turgor and moistness of the axillae, tongue and mucous membranes, may be used in the assessment of patients with suspected hypovolemia. McGee and colleagues conducted a literature review to identify which, if any, signs and symptoms were reliable in the clinical evaluation of volume depletion and dehydration. A MEDLINE search was used to retrieve articles on the bedside diagnosis of hypovolemia. Some studies were of patients with known amounts of blood loss, while others were of patients who presented to emergency departments and were suspected of having hypovolemia as a result of symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea and decreased oral intake. The authors found that the most helpful physical findings in the evaluation of patients with suspected blood loss were severe postural dizziness and a postural pulse increase of 30 beats per minute or more.

Mild postural dizziness had no value in the diagnosis of hypovolemia. Normal capillary refill time ranges from two seconds in children and adult men to three seconds in adult women and four seconds in the elderly. One study revealed that a prolonged refill time does not accurately predict 450 mL of blood loss. This sign was found to have a 6 percent sensitivity and a 93 percent specificity. While the literature indicates that the finding of a dry axilla increases the probability of hypovolemia, studies suggest that this is an insensitive physical sign, with only a 50 percent sensitivity. Signs that point away from hypovolemia are moist mucous membranes, lack of sunken eyes and lack of furrows on the tongue.

The authors conclude that a large increase in the postural pulse or severe postural dizziness is required to diagnose hypovolemia related to blood loss, although these findings are often absent in the setting of moderate blood loss. The literature review indicated that few findings have proven reliability in the diagnosis of hypovolemia related to diarrhea, vomiting and decreased oral intake. Decreased capillary refill time and poor skin turgor have been shown not to be of diagnostic value. Thus, the authors state that physicians should not hesitate to order serum electrolyte, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine determinations if hypovolemia is suspected.

Volume status and urine sodium concentration

Assessment of volume status (to approximate ECF volume) is a frequently used method of classifying hyponatremia, though the accuracy of clinical examination has been shown to be poor. Although features indicative of hypovolemia such as dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension, and postural tachycardia are frequently mentioned in diagnostic algorithms, a systematic review found that few clinical signs of hypovolemia have proven utility, with widely ranging sensitivities between 29% and 85%, specificity 58% to 95%, and variable interobserver agreement. The most difficult distinction, which is critical in guiding initial management (ie, FR vs volume administration), is between apparent euvolemia in SIAD and mild hypovolemia. In one study, clinical assessment correctly identified only 47% of hypovolemic patients compared to the gold-standard method of diagnosing hypovolemic hyponatremia: serum sodium improvement with IV isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl). In hypovolemia, volume replacement with IV 0.9% saline treatment reduces the hypovolemic stimulus to AVP secretion, leading to improvement in serum sodium, in part by urinary dilution leading to excretion of excess free water. However, in SIAD, where AVP does not respond to the volume stimulus, the urine remains concentrated despite the IV fluid. Hence, IV 0.9% saline is not an effective treatment in SIAD as it may lead to a further reduction in serum sodium, as the water component is retained, coupled with ongoing renal sodium loss. In this scenario, 0.9% NaCl (osmolality 308 mOsmol/L) may be hypotonic relative to the concentrated urine (commonly > 500 mOsmol/L in SIAD) leading to net free water retention, worsening the hyponatremia. Consequently, this treatment should be reserved for patients with either clinical or biochemical indicators of ECF volume depletion — low urine sodium (UNa) concentration — despite the limitations of these assessments.
