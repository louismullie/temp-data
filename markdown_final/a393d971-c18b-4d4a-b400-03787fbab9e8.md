## Question

Cardiovascular disease and ACE benefit

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cardiovascular benefits of ACE inhibitors across different populations, mechanisms, and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms that plausibly drive outcomes. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence in heart failure and post–myocardial infarction settings. Next, I will examine data in stable coronary artery disease without heart failure, followed by high-risk primary prevention. After that, I should review comparative effectiveness with ARBs and dual RAAS blockade. I will then consider special populations such as diabetes, CKD, and the elderly, and finally synthesize guideline recommendations and practical prescribing considerations with attention to dosing, tolerability, and safety monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation. ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II and increase bradykinin, producing vasodilation, improved endothelial function, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects, and inhibition of adverse remodeling. These effects likely extend beyond blood pressure lowering and contribute to organ protection, which aligns with observed clinical benefits in vascular disease and heart failure [^115FYWUK] [^1136oiqA] [^114f8VES].

> I will now examine heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, where the evidence base is strongest. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that ACE inhibitors reduce mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and improve symptoms across NYHA classes, with guideline-directed titration to target doses associated with optimal outcomes. I should double-check that contemporary guidance still prioritizes ACE inhibitors as foundational therapy in HFrEF, which it does, while noting that ARNI has emerged as preferred in selected patients when appropriate [^114Gf5LS] [^111UzXaJ].

> Next, I should review post–myocardial infarction indications. Early initiation of ACE inhibitors after MI reduces 30-day mortality and long-term adverse outcomes, with the greatest absolute benefit in patients with LV dysfunction or anterior STEMI; I need to ensure I cite the large collaborative meta-analysis and guideline endorsements, which consistently support ACE inhibitor therapy in appropriate post-MI patients, including those with LVEF ≤ 40% or heart failure symptoms [^113exRnE] [^111UzXaJ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stable coronary artery disease without heart failure. The HOPE and EUROPA trials demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke with ramipril and perindopril, respectively, in high-risk or stable CAD populations without overt heart failure. However, the PEACE trial in lower-risk, well-treated patients did not show benefit, suggesting that absolute risk and background therapy modify the effect size, so I should be cautious in extrapolating to very low-risk cohorts [^116fMqZV] [^115YgSsh] [^115NPKU5].

> Let me consider primary prevention in high-risk individuals without established heart failure. The HOPE program showed ramipril reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by about 22% in a high-risk cohort, including those with diabetes, supporting a role for ACE inhibitors in risk reduction beyond blood pressure effects. I should confirm that guideline bodies incorporate this into recommendations for secondary prevention and high-risk primary prevention, which they do, albeit with attention to baseline risk and tolerability [^116fMqZV] [^114xQZJE].

> I need to check comparative effectiveness with ARBs. Head-to-head and meta-analytic data suggest ACE inhibitors and ARBs achieve similar blood pressure control, but ACE inhibitors show a consistent signal for mortality reduction in several large meta-analyses, whereas ARBs generally do not reduce all-cause mortality. Importantly, ONTARGET showed telmisartan was noninferior to ramipril for the composite outcome, but dual therapy increased adverse events without added benefit, so I should avoid dual RAAS blockade in routine practice [^111HGVkm] [^111n2iSg] [^116NJemk].

> But wait, what if dual blockade improves surrogate endpoints like proteinuria. While some studies show greater albuminuria reduction with ACEi+ARB, hard renal and cardiovascular outcome benefits are lacking and harm signals, including hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction, are more frequent; therefore, I should confirm that guidelines discourage dual RAAS blockade outside of selected research contexts or exceptional scenarios, which they do [^116NJemk] [^113exRnE].

> Next, I should review diabetes and CKD, where ACE inhibitors have long-standing indications. In diabetes, ACE inhibitors reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and slow nephropathy progression. In CKD, ACE inhibitors reduce kidney failure and cardiovascular events, with some analyses suggesting ACE inhibitors may outperform ARBs for mortality, though both classes are acceptable for renoprotection. I should double-check that contemporary diabetes guidelines continue to endorse ACE inhibitors or ARBs as foundational therapy in the presence of CKD or hypertension [^1162wsLH] [^117321q1] [^112qtFwC].

> I will now examine the elderly, since undertreatment is common. Subgroup analyses from HOPE and other studies show ACE inhibitors reduce major vascular events in older adults with vascular disease or diabetes, with acceptable tolerability when blood pressure and renal function are monitored; I need to ensure I note the importance of dose titration and monitoring for hypotension and renal dysfunction in this group [^114kRLMZ] [^113Hs2Hn].

> Let me synthesize guideline positions to ensure clinical alignment. Contemporary ACC/AHA guidance recommends ACE inhibitors or ARBs for chronic coronary disease patients with hypertension, diabetes, LVEF ≤ 40%, or CKD, and considers ACE inhibitors or ARBs in stable CAD without these features at very high risk; ESC guidance similarly supports ACE inhibitors in very high-risk chronic coronary syndromes; heart failure guidelines continue to endorse ACE inhibitors as foundational therapy in HFrEF, with ARNI substitution in appropriate patients [^114xQZJE] [^114JufDb] [^114Gf5LS].

> I should confirm practical prescribing details. Start low and titrate to target doses proven in trials, monitor for hypotension, renal function, and potassium, and avoid abrupt withdrawal. If ACE inhibitor–induced cough occurs, switch to an ARB rather than abandoning RAAS blockade. In post-MI or HFrEF, early initiation and up-titration improve outcomes, and I need to ensure contraindications such as bilateral renal artery stenosis, pregnancy, and prior angioedema are screened [^114Gf5LS] [^114xQZJE].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit to set expectations. In stable CAD without heart failure, meta-analytic estimates suggest modest but real reductions in mortality and cardiovascular events with ACE inhibitors, with numbers needed to treat reflecting small absolute risk reductions in low-risk populations; this reinforces the need to individualize therapy based on baseline risk, comorbidities, and tolerability rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach [^116eSkFB] [^113UxM3V].

> In summary, ACE inhibitors confer robust benefits in HFrEF and post-MI settings, meaningful benefits in high-risk primary prevention and many patients with stable CAD, and important advantages in diabetes and CKD. Compared with ARBs, ACE inhibitors have stronger mortality data in several meta-analyses, while dual RAAS blockade should be avoided. Guideline-concordant use with appropriate monitoring and dose titration maximizes net clinical benefit across the cardiovascular continuum [^114Gf5LS] [^114xQZJE] [^111HGVkm].

ACE inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events and mortality across a broad range of patients, including those with heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease [^114Gf5LS] [^113exRnE] [^112qtFwC] [^117321q1]. They are **first-line** for HFrEF and post-MI with LV dysfunction, and are recommended for high-risk patients with diabetes or CKD [^116CCaJm] [^112qtFwC] [^114Gf5LS]. Benefits extend beyond blood pressure lowering, including reduced myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and mortality [^116fMqZV] [^115YgSsh] [^113UxM3V]. ARBs are alternatives for ACE inhibitor intolerance, but dual RAAS blockade is not recommended due to harm [^114xQZJE] [^116NJemk]. ACE inhibitors are underused despite strong evidence; guideline-concordant use improves outcomes [^115XpGcm] [^114xQZJE].

## Clinical evidence supporting ACE inhibitors

### Heart failure

- **CONSENSUS**: 31% reduction in mortality in severe heart failure [^111UzXaJ].
- **SOLVD**: Reduced mortality and hospitalizations in chronic heart failure [^111UzXaJ].
- **SAVE**: Reduced mortality and recurrent MI in post-MI patients with LV dysfunction [^111UzXaJ].

---

### Post-myocardial infarction

In post-myocardial infarction, **AIRE** reduced mortality in post-MI patients with clinical heart failure [^111UzXaJ], and **TRACE** reduced mortality and major cardiovascular events in post-MI patients with LV dysfunction [^111UzXaJ]. Collectively, these trials establish ACE inhibitors as **standard post-MI care**, especially with LV dysfunction [^113exRnE].

---

### Diabetes and chronic kidney disease

In diabetes and chronic kidney disease, **HOPE** reduced cardiovascular events and mortality in high-risk patients, including those with diabetes [^116fMqZV], and **ADVANCE** reduced major vascular events in type 2 diabetes [^1121EF5V]. ACE inhibitors also slow CKD progression and reduce proteinuria [^117321q1].

---

### Stable coronary artery disease

In stable coronary artery disease, **EUROPA** reduced cardiovascular events in stable CAD without heart failure [^115YgSsh], and **PEACE** showed no benefit in low-risk patients, highlighting risk-dependent effects [^115NPKU5].

---

## Mechanisms of benefit

ACE inhibitors confer benefits through **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Reduced myocardial workload**: Lower preload and afterload [^112atdFE].
- **Inhibition of RAAS**: Decreased angiotensin II and aldosterone [^notfound].
- **Enhanced bradykinin**: Increased nitric oxide and vasodilation [^115FYWUK].
- **Anti-remodeling**: Reduced myocardial and vascular fibrosis [^notfound].
- **Anti-atherosclerotic**: Improved endothelial function and reduced plaque progression [^114f8VES].

---

## Comparative effectiveness with ARBs

ARBs are **effective alternatives** for patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors, with similar blood pressure effects but fewer side effects (e.g. cough, angioedema) [^115tMHxs]. However, ACE inhibitors have stronger evidence for mortality reduction in high-risk patients, whereas ARBs are non-inferior for many cardiovascular outcomes [^111HGVkm] [^112HdZPs].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical condition** | **Recommendation** | **Level of evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) | Strongly recommended | Class I, Level A [^114Gf5LS] |
| Post-myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction | Strongly recommended | Class I, Level A [^113exRnE] |
| Diabetes mellitus with chronic kidney disease | Strongly recommended | Class I, Level A [^112qtFwC] |
| Stable coronary artery disease without heart failure | Considered in high-risk patients | Class IIa, Level B [^113VHbV1] |
| Hypertension with compelling indications (e.g. diabetes, CKD) | Recommended | Class I, Level A [^114xQZJE] |

---

## Limitations and adverse effects

- **Cough**: Common, benign, but may limit use.
- **Angioedema**: Rare but serious; more common in Black patients.
- **Hyperkalemia**: Risk in CKD or with potassium-sparing drugs.
- **Renal dysfunction**: Monitor renal function, especially in CKD [^notfound].

---

## Underutilization and clinical implications

Despite strong evidence, ACE inhibitors remain **underused**, particularly in diabetes, CKD, and post-MI patients [^notfound]. Broader, guideline-concordant use could significantly reduce cardiovascular events and mortality [^113Rhpw5].

---

ACE inhibitors are a cornerstone of cardiovascular care, with **robust evidence** for reducing events and mortality across heart failure, post-MI, diabetes, and CKD. They are underused; aligning practice with guidelines can yield substantial public health gains.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for treatment of ischemic heart disease: future research needs prioritization [^113QqmY2]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A recent review evaluated the comparative effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with or at high risk for stable ischemic heart disease (IHD). The prioritization of future research needs has customarily been an informal process that is not responsive to the needs of all relevant stakeholders.

Methods

As part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Effective Healthcare Program, the Duke Evidence-Based Practice Center engaged a diverse stakeholder group in 3 exercises designed to prioritize future research needs pertaining to the comparative effectiveness of ACE-I/ARB in patients with stable IHD.

Results

Our stakeholders prioritized the following areas of research pertaining to the comparative effectiveness of ACE-I/ARB in stable IHD: (1) strategies to enhance greater evidence-based use, (2) impact of adherence on effectiveness or harms, (3) impact of comorbidities on effectiveness or harms, (4) medication impact on patient quality of life, (5) impact of demographic differences on effectiveness or harms, and (6) medication impact on incidence of new diagnoses. This project also yielded suggestions regarding potential study designs to address these future research needs.

Conclusions

Our stakeholders prioritized research designed to facilitate (1) tailored ACE-I/ARB treatment based on individual patient characteristics and (2) implementation of ACE-I/ARB use among patients most likely to benefit. With respect to suggested study designs, it was felt that analysis of existing data would sufficiently address many of the top-tier future research needs (FRNs).

### Renal function and effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in patients with chronic stable coronary disease in the prevention of events with ACE inhibition (PEACE) trial [^111MqwBW]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with reduced renal function are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In the post-myocardial infarction setting, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to be as effective in patients with impaired renal function as in those with preserved renal function.

Methods and Results

We assessed the relation between renal function and outcomes, the influence of ACE inhibition on this relation, and whether renal function modifies the effectiveness of ACE inhibition in patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved systolic function enrolled in the Prevention of Events with ACE inhibition trial (PEACE). Patients (n = 8290) were randomly assigned to receive trandolapril (target, 4 mg/d) or placebo. Clinical creatinine measures were available for 8280 patients before randomization. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated with the 4-point Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Renal function was related to outcomes, and the influence of ACE-inhibitor therapy was assessed with formal interaction modeling. The mean eGFR in PEACE was 77.6 ± 19.4, and 1355 (16.3%) patients had reduced renal function (eGFR < 60 mg.mL⁻¹.1.73 m⁻²). We observed a significant interaction between eGFR and treatment group with respect to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (P = 0.02). Trandolapril was associated with a reduction in total mortality in patients with reduced renal function (adjusted HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.00) but not in patients with preserved renal function (adjusted HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.13).

Conclusions

Although trandolapril did not improve survival in the overall PEACE cohort, in which mean eGFR was relatively high, trandolapril reduced mortality in patients with reduced eGFR. These data suggest that reduced renal function may define a subset of patients most likely to benefit from ACE-inhibitor therapy for cardiovascular protection.

### Efficacy of perindopril in reduction of cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease: randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (the EUROPA study) [^111YZ7Cd]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

The study EUROPA was published by Fox KM and colleagues in 2003 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease. In the EUROPA study, the trial question was: what is the role of perindopril in patients with stable coronary artery disease without apparent HF? In the EUROPA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EUROPA study, the population was: 12218 patients (1779 female, 10439 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with stable coronary artery disease without apparent HF. The key exclusion criteria were clinical evidence of HF, planned revascularization, hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, recent (< 1 month) use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, renal insufficiency, and serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L. In the EUROPA study, the interventions were: n = 6110 perindopril (8 mg PO once daily) n = 6108 placebo (matching placebo daily). In the EUROPA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest (8% vs. 10%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91). In the EUROPA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in total death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina, cardiac arrest (14.8% vs. 17.1%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94). In the EUROPA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in withdrawal from treatment (22.8% vs. 20.7%). significant difference in cough (2.7% vs. 0.5%) and hypotension (1.0% vs. 0.3%). In the EUROPA study, the conclusion was: in patients with stable coronary artery disease without apparent HF, perindopril was superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition to enhance vascular health – clinical and research models [^114f8VES]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Protection of the endothelium, the metabolically active inner lining of the vasculature, appears to be a key factor in maintaining cardiovascular (CV) health. The endothelium responds to hemodynamic and hormonal factors by secreting substances that maintain vascular homeostasis. Damage to the endothelium is an initial step in the development of CV disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the formation of the vasoconstricting substance, angiotensin II, have proved to be a key therapy for hypertension and congestive heart failure. The activity of these agents in enhancing vascular health appears to be a critical factor in their therapeutic effectiveness. Large-scale clinical trials over the past decade have shown that ACE inhibition is an effective therapeutic means of not only prolonging survival and reducing morbidity after acute myocardial infarction, but also reducing all-cause mortality and morbidity in patients at high risk for CV disease, including patients with diabetes. ACE is found in far greater amounts in tissue than in plasma. Studies indicate that ACE inhibitors act at the tissue level to provide long-term cardioprotective effects that include a reduction in the progression of atherosclerosis. An issue to resolve is how much ACE inhibition is needed at the tissue level to reverse or prevent further vascular damage.

### Health outcomes associated with various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents: a network meta-analysis [^112WMsfz]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Establishing relative benefit or harm from specific antihypertensive agents is limited by the complex array of studies that compare treatments. Network meta-analysis combines direct and indirect evidence to better define risk or benefit.

Objective

To summarize the available clinical trial evidence concerning the safety and efficacy of various antihypertensive therapies used as first-line agents and evaluated in terms of major cardiovascular disease end points and all-cause mortality.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We used previous meta-analyses, MEDLINE searches, and journal reviews from January 1995 through December 2002. We identified long-term randomized controlled trials that assessed major cardiovascular disease end points as an outcome. Eligible studies included both those with placebo-treated or untreated controls and those with actively treated controls.

Data Extraction

Network meta-analysis was used to combine direct within-trial between-drug comparisons with indirect evidence from the other trials. The indirect comparisons, which preserve the within-trial randomized findings, were constructed from trials that had one treatment in common.

Data Synthesis

Data were combined from 42 clinical trials that included 192 478 patients randomized to 7 major treatment strategies, including placebo. For all outcomes, low-dose diuretics were superior to placebo: coronary heart disease (CHD; RR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.92); congestive heart failure (CHF; RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42–0.62); stroke (RR, 0.71; 0.63–0.81); cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.69–0.83); cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.92); and total mortality (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.96). None of the first-line treatment strategies-beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), alpha-blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers-was significantly better than low-dose diuretics for any outcome. Compared with CCBs, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00) and CHF (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.81). Compared with ACE inhibitors, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96), cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00), and stroke (RR, 0.86; 0.77–0.97). Compared with beta-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80–0.98). Compared with alpha-blockers, low-dose diuretics were associated with reduced risks of CHF (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43–0.60) and cardiovascular disease events (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93). Blood pressure changes were similar between comparison treatments.

Conclusions

Low-dose diuretics are the most effective first-line treatment for preventing the occurrence of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice and treatment guidelines should reflect this evidence, and future trials should use low-dose diuretics as the standard for clinically useful comparisons.

### ACE inhibitors in cardiac surgery: current studies and controversies [^1134MCje]. Hypertension Research (2011). Low credibility.

Major complications associated with cardiac surgery are still common and carry great prognostic significance. Current medical interventions to prevent these cardiovascular complications include antiplatelet therapy, statins, β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Both experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that ACE inhibitors hold promise as cardiovascular protective agents for cardiac surgery patients. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, long-term use of ACE inhibitors has been well established to provide cardiovascular protection and reduce ischemic events and complications, independent of their effect on heart function and blood pressure. Second, early ACE inhibitor therapy has been demonstrated to produce remarkable survival and heart function benefits in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Third, ACE blockage can prevent or delay the development or progression of renal disease at all stages, from subclinical microalbuminuria to end-stage renal disease. Nevertheless, perioperative studies of the effects of ACE inhibitors remain few and inconclusive. Results from recent clinical trials and observational studies are conflicting and raise more questions than answers. Further studies, both retrospective and larger-scale prospective studies, are critically needed to examine whether ACE inhibitors reduce mortality and major complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Efficacy of perindopril in reduction of cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease: randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (the EUROPA study) [^115YgSsh]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces the rate of cardiovascular events among patients with left-ventricular dysfunction and those at high risk of such events. We assessed whether the ACE inhibitor perindopril reduced cardiovascular risk in a low-risk population with stable coronary heart disease and no apparent heart failure.

Methods

We recruited patients from October, 1997, to June, 2000. 13655 patients were registered with previous myocardial infarction (64%), angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (61%), coronary revascularisation (55%), or a positive stress test only (5%). After a run-in period of 4 weeks, in which all patients received perindopril, 12218 patients were randomly assigned perindopril 8 mg once daily (n = 6110), or matching placebo (n = 6108). The mean follow-up was 4.2 years, and the primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

Mean age of patients was 60 years (SD 9), 85% were male, 92% were taking platelet inhibitors, 62% beta blockers, and 58% lipid-lowering therapy. 603 (10%) placebo and 488 (8%) perindopril patients experienced the primary endpoint, which yields a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI 9–29, p = 0.0003) with perindopril. These benefits were consistent in all predefined subgroups and secondary endpoints. Perindopril was well tolerated.

Interpretation

Among patients with stable coronary heart disease without apparent heart failure, perindopril can significantly improve outcome. About 50 patients need to be treated for a period of 4 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Treatment with perindopril, on top of other preventive medications, should be considered in all patients with coronary heart disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to RAAS inhibitors, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating ACEis or ARBs to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease without hypertension, diabetes, or CKD and LVEF > 40%.

### Should an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor be standard therapy for patients with atherosclerotic disease? [^112CTwKB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appear to possess unique cardioprotective benefits, even when used in patients without high blood pressure or left ventricular dysfunction (the traditional indications for ACE inhibitor therapy). The ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function and regress both left ventricular hypertrophy and arterial mass better than other antihypertensive agents that lower blood pressure equally as well. These agents promote collateral vessel development and improve prognosis in patients who have had a coronary revascularization procedure (i.e., percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Insulin resistance, present not only in type 2 diabetes but also commonly in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease, or both, sensitizes the vasculature to the trophic effects of angiotensin II and aldosterone. This may partly explain the improvement in prognosis noted when patients who have atherosclerosis or diabetes are treated with an ACE inhibitor. Therapy with ACE inhibitors has also been shown, in two large, randomized trials, to reduce the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes through largely unknown mechanisms. The ACE inhibitors are safe, well tolerated and affordable medications. The data suggest that most people with atherosclerosis should be considered candidates for ACE inhibitor therapy, unless they are intolerant to the medication, or have systolic blood pressures consistently < 100 mm Hg. Patients who show evidence of insulin resistance (with or without overt type 2 diabetes) should also be considered as candidates for prophylactic ACE inhibitor therapy. Although angiotensin receptor blockers should not be considered equivalent to ACE inhibitors for this indication, they may be a reasonable alternative for patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors.

### Randomised comparison of zofenopril and ramipril plus acetylsalicylic acid in postmyocardial infarction patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction: a post hoc analysis of the SMILE-4 study in patients according to levels of left ventricular ejection fraction at entry [^117EEZqQ]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Large randomised, placebo-controlled trials clearly demonstrated that ACE inhibitors are beneficial for patients who have coronary artery disease and either signs of heart failure (HF) or impaired systolic function. Systematic overviews of trials of ACE inhibition early in ST-segment elevated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) indicate that this therapy is safe, well tolerated and associated with a small but significant reduction in 30-day mortality. Based on such evidence, current guidelines for the management of patients with AMI recommend the prescription of an ACE inhibitor to all patients with ST-segment elevation AMI (STEMI) and an impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF < 40%), or those who have experienced HF in the early phase.

Guidelines also state that it is reasonable to prescribe ACE inhibitors for patients with stable or unstable ischaemic heart disease and preserved LVEF, with well-controlled cardiovascular risk factors. Nonetheless, few studies have been conducted in order to evaluate the use of ACE inhibitors in patients who have ischaemic heart disease, but without clinical evidence of HF or frank left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). The cumulative evidence provided by meta-analyses of such studies shows only a modest favourable effect of ACE inhibitors on the outcome of such patients.

In order to gain better insight into this controversy, and to determine whether, and to what extent, long-term prescription of two pharmacologically different ACE inhibitors may decrease the risk of major cardiovascular events and mortality in patients who have coronary artery disease and preserved LVEF, we undertook a post hoc analysis of the SMILE-4 Study. This direct comparative trial demonstrated that in patients with post-AMI with LVD, the efficacy of zofenopril associated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was superior to that of ramipril plus ASA, in terms of prevention of major cardiovascular outcomes. In the present post hoc analysis, we evaluated the prognostic benefit of the two ACE inhibitors in the two subsets of participants with preserved and impaired LVEF.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114xQZJE]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Chronic coronary disease — renin-angiotensin–aldosterone inhibitors (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) recommendations: For patients with chronic coronary disease who also have hypertension, diabetes, LVEF ≤ 40%, or CKD, the use of ACE inhibitors, or ARBs if ACE inhibitor–intolerant, is recommended to reduce cardiovascular events (Class of Recommendation 1, Level of Evidence A). In patients with chronic coronary disease without hypertension, diabetes, or CKD and LVEF ≥ 40%, the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be considered to reduce cardiovascular events (Class of Recommendation 2b, Level of Evidence B-R).

### Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system for cardiorenal protection: an update [^116oL8YC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in hypertension and the continuum of cardiovascular and kidney disease. The inhibition of this system, either with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), has been shown to be beneficial for cardiorenal protection. Dual blockade with an ACE inhibitor and ARB may have additional benefits due to the more complete inhibition of the system. Most published trials, including recent large studies and meta-analyses, have reported either limited or no additional benefit. Dual-blockade therapy seems to have some benefit on proteinuria and blood pressure reduction, and on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, compared with monotherapy. The major issue arising from these published trials and meta-analyses is the increased frequency of dual therapy discontinuation and adverse effects on kidney function. There is a lack of hard end-point data for renal outcomes and long-term safety data in most published trials. Until the results of ongoing trials become available and as further safety data emerge, a wise approach would be to withhold use of ACE inhibitor and ARB combination therapy in general practice. When used in selected conditions, patients need to be closely monitored.

### Should angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors be used to improve outcome in patients with coronary artery disease and' preserved' left ventricular function? [^113VHbV1]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Early clinical studies investigating the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure unexpectedly demonstrated a possible reduction in coronary heart disease endpoints. Two large scale clinical trials, HOPE and EUROPA, both studies in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) but without clinical evidence of heart failure, showed a highly significant improvement in coronary heart disease outcomes on treatment with ramipril and perindopril, respectively, in contrast, in a similar population, PEACE was unable to demonstrate such benefit with trandolapril. Meta-analyses of all trials involving ACE-inhibitors showed a highly significant improvement in coronary heart disease endpoints. Current ESC guidelines recommend ACE-inhibitor therapy in CAD patients with co-existing indications for ACE-inhibitors, such as hypertension, heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, prior MI was left ventricular dysfunction, or diabetes (class I, level of evidence A). These guidelines also recommend ACE-inhibitor therapy in all patients with angina and proven coronary disease (class IIa, level of evidence B). However, in angina patients without independent indication for ACE-inhibitor treatment, the anticipated benefit should be weighted against the costs and risks of side effects; in these patients, only agents and doses of proven efficacy for secondary prevention should be employed.

Type 2 diabetes — Table 5 opportunities to initiate SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA with demonstrated cardiovascular or renal benefit: Suggested initiation scenarios include in a patient with T2D and ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA); at the time of diagnosis of clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) in a patient with T2D on a regimen without these agents; at the time of diagnosis of T2D in a patient with clinical ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA), DKD, and/or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor); at hospital discharge with close outpatient follow-up after admission for ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor) events; in a patient with T2D and diabetic kidney disease (SGLT2 inhibitor, alternatively GLP-1RA for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²); and in patients determined to be at high risk of ASCVD (SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1RA) or HF (SGLT2 inhibitor). At the time of hospital discharge or in the outpatient setting, increased vigilance regarding hypoglycemia surveillance is warranted, especially in background insulin, sulfonylurea, or glinide therapy, and clinicians should use judgment when initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor if renal function is impaired or an ACE inhibitor/ARB will be started or up-titrated.

### Mechanisms by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease [^1179E8Ss]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the first-line therapeutic agents for treating hypertension in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome and those with diabetes. ACE inhibitor therapy reduces both microvascular and macrovascular complications in diabetes and appears to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Several recent studies indicate that ACE inhibitor therapy reduces the development of type 2 diabetes in persons with essential hypertension, a population with a high prevalence of insulin resistance. ACE inhibitor therapy has been shown to improve surrogates of cardiovascular disease (eg, vascular compliance, endothelial-derived nitric oxide production, vascular relaxation and plasma markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombosis) and reduce cardiovascular disease, renal disease progression, and stroke. This article explores potential mechanism by which ACE inhibition reduces the development of diabetes, improves these surrogate markers, and reduces cardiovascular disease and renal disease.

### A summary of the ADVANCE trial [^1121EF5V]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

ADVANCE also asked questions about BP lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aims of the BP arm were to establish whether routine provision of BP-lowering therapy produced additional benefits in terms of macro- and microvascular disease, irrespective of baseline BP, and added to the benefits produced by other cardiovascular preventive therapies, including ACE inhibitors.

### Are there effects of renin-angiotensin system antagonists beyond blood pressure control? [^1136oiqA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recognized to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, which is primarily attributed to their antihypertensive effects. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease through blood pressure-independent mechanisms mediated by angiotensin II. Thus, inhibiting the RAS with either an ARB or an ACE inhibitor may confer additional benefit in people with advanced nephropathy that cannot be explained totally by reductions in blood pressure. Preclinical evidence suggests that blood pressure lowering is not solely responsible for the organ and tissue protective effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Furthermore, clinical studies evaluating effects on end organs and surrogate markers have shown that these agents have blood pressure-independent effects. There is also intriguing evidence that agents in the same class may differ in their effects on renal function despite similar blood pressure control. Support for blood pressure-independent effects comes from outcome studies. Agents evaluated in such studies and that appear to have effects independent of blood pressure lowering include irbesartan, losartan, ramipril, and telmisartan. Taken together, this body of evidence indicates that the clinical benefits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in patients with advanced nephropathy extend beyond blood pressure reduction. Therefore, although antihypertensive efficacy is of primary importance in choosing a treatment to provide cardiovascular and renal protection, consideration should be given to the effects of an agent that extend beyond blood pressure.

### Tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: are they more effective than serum angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors? [^117Vtdir]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Since their discovery in the 1980s, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to decrease angiotensin formation, prevent breakdown of bradykinin, and may also act on peptides of the renin-angiotensin system. They are effective in reducing the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure, and have been shown to reduce atherosclerotic complications in patients who have vascular disease without heart failure. They may preserve endothelial function and counteract initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Broadly, ACE inhibitors can be divided into tissue specific or serum ACE inhibitors. Tissue-specific ACE inhibitors as a group are not superior to serum ACE inhibitors in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Pending direct comparator clinical trials between a tissue ACE inhibitor and a plasma ACE inhibitor, both ramipril and perindopril can be recommended for secondary risk prevention, based on the evidence.

### ACE inhibition and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in essential hypertension: the end of the search or a need for further investigations? [^111EZ2j7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Scientific evidence currently available supports the concept that renin-angiotensin blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as a first-line treatment exhibits in arterial hypertension beneficial effects in the prevention of mortality and morbidity comparable to those achieved with diuretics and beta-blockers. In addition, the renin-angiotensin blockade has also proved to be beneficial in the secondary prevention of several complications of hypertensive disease such as after myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, as well as in the prevention of the incidence of type 2 diabetes, and the progression of diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy. In this later regard, recent evidence with angiotensin II receptor antagonists in reducing the progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes strongly confirms that antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system is an effective approach to cardiovascular and renal disease. Finally, the renin-angiotensin blockade in high-risk patients may reduce cardiovascular mortality independently of the effect on blood pressure (BP). The effect of other antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular risk in patients with high-normal BP should be investigated to establish whether they exhibit a comparable effect or whether there is a class-related benefit of drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system. Such a strategy could also be encouraged to design future interventional studies with the newer classes of compounds (angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonists, vasopeptidase inhibitors, endothelin antagonists), which would have the additional potential advantage of providing information more easily transferable to large-scale clinical practice.

### Effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular deaths, and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis [^1162wsLH]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may have different effects on cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis to separately evaluate the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events in patients with DM. DATA SOURCES Data sources included MEDLINE (1966–2012), EMBASE (1988–2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference proceedings, and article reference lists.

Study Selection

We included randomized clinical trials reporting the effects of ACEI and ARB regimens for DM on all-cause mortality, CV deaths, and major CV events with an observation period of at least 12 months. Studies were excluded if they were crossover trials.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Dichotomous outcome data from individual trials were analyzed using the risk ratio (RR) measure and its 95% CI with random-effects models. We estimated the difference between the estimates of the subgroups according to tests for interaction. We performed meta-regression analyses to identify sources of heterogeneity.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end points were all-cause mortality and death from CV causes. Secondary end points were the effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major CV events.

Results

Twenty-three of 35 identified trials compared ACEIs with placebo or active drugs (32,827 patients) and 13 compared ARBs with no therapy (controls) (23,867 patients). When compared with controls (placebo/active treatment), ACEIs significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 13% (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), CV deaths by 17% (0.83; 0.70–0.99), and major CV events by 14% (0.86; 0.77–0.95), including myocardial infarction by 21% (0.79; 0.65–0.95) and heart failure by 19% (0.81; 0.71–0.93). Treatment with ARBs did not significantly affect all-cause mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82–1.08), CV death rate (1.21; 0.81–1.80), and major CV events (0.94; 0.85–1.01) with the exception of heart failure (0.70; 0.59–0.82). Both ACEIs and ARBs were not associated with a decrease in the risk for stroke in patients with DM. Meta-regression analysis showed that the ACEI treatment effect on all-cause mortality and CV death did not vary significantly with the starting baseline blood pressure and proteinuria of the trial participants and the type of ACEI and DM.

Conclusions and Relevance

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduced all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and major CV events in patients with DM, whereas ARBs had no benefits on these outcomes. Thus, ACEIs should be considered as first-line therapy to limit excess mortality and morbidity in this population.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^117StCdE]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The inferiority of ACE-inhibitors to CCB regarding stroke-risk was significant and based on moderate quality evidence (RR 1.19; 95% CrI 1.03 to 1.38). Similarly, the superiority of ACE-inhibitors over CCB with regards to risk of developing heart failure was also significant and based on moderate quality evidence (RR 0.82; 95% CrI 0.69 to 0.94).

We found moderate quality evidence that diuretics reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, compared to beta-blockers (RR 0.82; 95% CrI 0.68 to 0.98). Diuretics were also, based on moderate quality evidence, significantly better at reducing the risk of heart failure than CCB (RR 0.73; 95% CrI 0.62 to 0.84), beta-blockers (RR 0.73; 95% CrI 0.54 to 0.96) and alpha-blockers (RR 0.51; 95% CrI 0.40 to 0.64). Diuretics, however, significantly increased the risk of diabetes relative to ACE-inhibitors (RR 1.43; 95% CrI 1.12 to 1.83) and CCB (RR 1.27; 95% CrI 1.05 to 1.57), based on moderate and high quality evidence, respectively.

Ranking of drug-classes

Consistent with our effect estimates per comparison (Tables 3 and 4), the findings from our ranking of drug-classes are ambiguous in the sense that certain drug-classes were superior for some outcomes, while other drugs fared better for other outcomes (Table 5).

### Dual renin-angiotensin system inhibition for prevention of renal and cardiovascular events: do the latest trials challenge existing evidence? [^116NJemk]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Circulatory and tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) play a central role in cardiovascular (CV) and renal pathophysiology, making RAS inhibition a logical therapeutic approach in the prevention of CV and renal disease in patients with hypertension. The cardio- and renoprotective effects observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) monotherapy, together with the availability of a direct renin inhibitor (DRI), led to the investigation of the potential benefits of dual RAS inhibition. In small studies, ARB and ACE inhibitor combinations were shown to be beneficial in patients with CV or renal disease, with improvement in surrogate markers. However, in larger outcome trials, involving combinations of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or DRIs, dual RAS inhibition did not show reduction in mortality in patients with diabetes, heart failure, coronary heart disease or after myocardial infarction, and was in fact, associated with increased harm. A recent meta-analysis of all major trials conducted over the past 22 years involving dual RAS inhibition has clearly shown that the risk-benefit ratio argues against the use of dual RAS inhibition. Hence, the recent evidence clearly advocates against the use of dual RAS inhibition, and single RAS inhibition appears to be the most suitable approach to controlling blood pressure and improving patient outcomes.

### Vascular and cardiac benefits of angiotensin receptor blockers [^114Ye2Jq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin II not only is a vasoconstrictor, but it also affects cell growth and apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and coagulation. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, either with inhibitors of the generation of angiotensin (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) or with blockers of angiotensin receptors, reduces blood pressure and inhibits other pathophysiological actions. These other effects provide benefits in coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and stroke beyond blood pressure reduction. These benefits were first demonstrated with ACE inhibitors. However, the mechanism of action of angiotensin receptor blockers, which block angiotensin II stimulation at the angiotensin type 1 receptor but not at the type 2 receptor, may have advantages, particularly for endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling, as well as cardiac and renal protection. Recent multicenter trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular and renal disease beyond blood pressure reduction. Several studies with different angiotensin receptor blockers, including comparisons with ACE inhibitors, are under way, and should provide further guidance for their clinical use.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: where do we stand now? [^113CvTMe]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease represents a continuum that starts with risk factors, such as hypertension, and progresses to atherosclerosis, target organ damage, and ultimately leads to heart failure or stroke. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been shown to be beneficial at all stages of this continuum. Both classes of agent can prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, thereby potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Such a reduction has been shown with ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease, but no such data are currently available for ARBs. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce damage in target organs, such as the heart and kidney, and to decrease cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with congestive heart failure. Trials, such as the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and the Telmisartan Randomised Assessment Study in ACE-Intolerant Subjects with Cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND), that compare telmisartan, ramipril, and their combination in high-risk patients with vascular end-organ damage, should provide important new insights into the benefits of intervention with RAS blockade along the cardiorenovascular continuum.

### New opportunities in cardiovascular patient management: a survey of clinical data on the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^1118dVu9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) differ in their actions on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ACE inhibitors prevent the formation of angiotensin II, although angiotensin II may still be generated by alternative pathways. However, ACE inhibitors interrupt bradykinin breakdown, which in turn potentially enhances nitric oxide and prostacyclin mechanisms. In contrast, ARBs selectively prevent the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor while leaving the potentially beneficial effects of the AT(2) receptor unaffected. The supposition is that dual blockade of the RAAS effectively overcomes the harmful effects of angiotensin II mediated by the AT(1) receptor while offering the additional effects of the ACE inhibitor. This concept was first evaluated clinically more than a decade ago in small-scale studies that were not sufficiently powered to conclusively demonstrate benefits from dual blockade. Subsequently, larger-scale trials have been conducted to determine the effects of a combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in combating the effects of angiotensin II at different stages of cardiovascular and renal disease. This review explores these data in areas, such as hypertension, renal disease, and cardiovascular disease, and draws on this preliminary evidence to support the rationale for the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program, which aims to fully explore the clinical end points and effects of dual RAAS blockade in patients at high risk for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Indications for and utilization of ACE inhibitors in older individuals with diabetes. findings from the national health and nutrition examination survey 1999 to 2002 [^115XpGcm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) improve cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk individuals with diabetes. Despite the marked benefit, it is unknown what percentage of patients with diabetes would benefit from and what percentage actually receive this preventive therapy.

Objectives

To examine the proportion of older diabetic patients with indications for ACE or ARB (ACE/ARB). To generate national estimates of ACE/ARB use.

Design and Participants

Survey of 742 individuals ≥ 55 years (representing 8.02 million U.S. adults) self-reporting diabetes in the 1999 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Measurements

Prevalence of guideline indications (albuminuria, cardiovascular disease, hypertension) and other cardiac risk factors (hyperlipidemia, smoking) with potential benefit from ACE/ARB. Prevalence of ACE/ARB use overall and by clinical indication.

Results

Ninety-two percent had guideline indications for ACE/ARB. Including additional cardiac risk factors, the entire (100%) U.S. noninstitutionalized older population with diabetes had indications for ACE/ARB. Overall, 43% of the population received ACE/ARB. Hypertension was associated with higher rates of ACE/ARB use, while albuminuria and cardiovascular disease were not. As the number of indications increased, rates of use increased, however, the maximum prevalence of use was only 53% in individuals with 4 or more indications for ACE/ARB.

Conclusions

ACE/ARB is indicated in virtually all older individuals with diabetes; yet, national rates of use are disturbingly low and key risk factors (albuminuria and cardiovascular disease) are being missed. To improve quality of diabetes care nationally, use of ACE/ARB therapy by ALL older diabetics may be a desirable addition to diabetes performance measurement sets.

### Effect of long-term ACE-inhibitor therapy in elderly vascular disease patients [^114kRLMZ]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in the elderly. The use of ACE-inhibitors in elderly patients with chronic stable vascular disease has not been previously reported.

Methods and Results

The HOPE trial evaluated the effects of ramipril and vitamin E in high-risk vascular disease patients. We report the effects of ramipril in the elderly HOPE study patients, defined as those ≥ 70 years of age. A total of 2755 elderly patients with vascular disease or diabetes and at least one additional CV risk factor and without heart failure or low ejection fraction were randomized to ramipril 10 mg daily or placebo. Those assigned to ramipril had fewer major vascular events compared to those assigned to placebo [18.6 vs. 24.0%, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.75, P = 0.0006], CV deaths (9.3 vs. 13.0%, HR = 0.71, P = 0.003), myocardial infarctions (12.0 vs. 15.6%, HR = 0.75, P = 0.006), and strokes (5.4 vs. 7.7%, HR = 0.69, P = 0.013). Treatment was safe and generally well tolerated.

Conclusion

Ramipril reduces the risk of major vascular events in elderly patients with vascular disease and is safe and well tolerated by most.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112qtFwC]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular pharmacotherapy in diabetes — ACE inhibitors/ARBs, finerenone, and β-blockers: Clear cardiovascular benefit exists for ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy in people with diabetes, and in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, 9,297 individuals aged ≥ 55 years were randomized, with ramipril significantly reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, MI, and stroke. ACE inhibitors or ARB therapy are recommended for hypertension management in people with known ASCVD and have well-established long-term benefit in people with diabetes and CKD or hypertension. People with type 2 diabetes and CKD should be considered for treatment with finerenone to reduce cardiovascular outcomes and the risk of CKD progression. β-Blockers should be used in individuals with active angina or HFrEF and for 3 years after MI to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### New users of angiotensin II receptor blocker-versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based antihypertensive medication regimens and cardiovascular disease events: a secondary analysis of ACCORD-BP and SPRINT [^115aVppj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Most head‐to‐head trials of ARBs versus ACEIs were conducted 20 to 30 years ago. Since these trials were published, the contemporary ACCORD‐BP (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes–Blood Pressure) trial and the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) tested the effects of randomly assigning participants to intensive systolic BP (SBP) control (< 120 mm Hg) versus standard SBP control (< 120 mm Hg) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients at high CVD risk with and without diabetes, respectively. However, it is unclear if differences exist in the comparative effects of ARBs versus ACEIs when added to multidrug antihypertensive regimens used to target intensive SBP goals, which would inform first‐line treatment decisions for patients at high risk for CVD. Using a high‐quality observational design and causal inference methods, we sought to compare the effects of initiating ARB versus ACEI on adjudicated fatal and nonfatal CVD events and mortality in ACCORD‐BP and SPRINT.

### Effects of blood pressure-lowering treatment on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality: 14-effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in older and younger patients: overview and meta-analysis [^112xabTm]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The five major classes of blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs have all been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events when compared with placebo, and when directly (head-to-head) compared, no significant differences in their overall effectiveness have been detected, except for minor differences in cause-specific events. It is unknown, however, whether age-related differences exist and if some classes of drugs are differently effective in older or younger individuals. This clinically relevant question has been the object of a systematic search and meta-analysis of all available data.

Methods

Two databases we had previously identified [72 placebo-controlled BP-lowering randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in 260210 individuals and 50 RCTs head-to-head comparing treatments with BP-lowering drugs of different classes in 247006 individuals) were searched for separately reported data on patients older or younger than 65 years, and the data were further stratified according to the class of drug [diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers] compared with placebo or with other drug classes. Seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were considered for benefits. Adverse events were investigated as permanent treatment discontinuations for adverse events. Risk ratios and absolute risk changes were calculated by a random effects model. Effects at older and younger ages were compared by heterogeneity test.

Results

We identified 20 placebo-controlled RCTs on 55645 older individuals and 21 on 99621 younger individuals, and 21 head-to-head drug comparison RCTs on 94228 older individuals and 27 on 100232 younger individuals (for a total of 349726 individuals). When compared with placebo, all five classes of BP-lowering drugs significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events or stroke, with no significant difference between older and younger patients. However, in head-to-head comparisons, no significant difference was found between older and younger patients in the effects of diuretics, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on all cardiovascular outcomes, whereas beta-blockers revealed an age-dependent effectiveness, being equally effective as the other agents at an age below 65 years, but less effective at an older age.

Conclusion

Most BP-lowering classes are equally effective in preventing risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events both in older and younger patients, whereas beta-blockers, though being equally effective as the other agents in patients younger than 65, loose some of their effectiveness at an older age.

### Ramipril for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^116MRSeF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of ramipril in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease and determine its need for inclusion on a formulary.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE and PubMed database search was conducted (1987-May 2002). Only journals written in the English language were selected for review. DATA EXTRACTION AND STUDY SELECTION: Articles reporting the use of ramipril in humans were evaluated. Emphasis was placed on randomized, controlled trials assessing efficacy.

Data Synthesis

Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that exerts its effects through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. It exhibits a safety profile that is similar to that of other ACE inhibitors and is comparable in cost to the majority of the available agents. Clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy. Ramipril, however, is the only ACE inhibitor currently approved for the prevention of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients without evidence of left-ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, based on the results of the HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) trial. Whether this effect is specific to ramipril has yet to be proven. This article emphasizes the major trials involving ramipril including the AIRE (Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy), REIN (Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy), and HOPE trials.

Conclusions

Although similar to other ACE inhibitors in many aspects, it cannot be assumed that the benefits shown with ramipril in the HOPE trial are a class effect. Ongoing trials should help to clarify this matter. Until this time, current evidence justifies the inclusion of ramipril on a formulary.

### Effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on end-organ protection: can we do better? [^116QKzUN]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major regulator of blood pressure (BP) and vascular response to injury. There is increasing evidence that RAS inhibition may provide end-organ protection independent of BP lowering. Two drug classes directly target angiotensin II through complementary mechanisms. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to the active peptide angiotensin II and increase the availability of bradykinin. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) selectively antagonize angiotensin II at AT 1 receptors and may also increase activation of the AT 2 receptor and modulate the effects of angiotensin II breakdown products.

Objectives

This paper presents an overview of clinical data supporting the use of RAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors and ARBs) as monotherapy or combination therapy based on the known role of the RAS in BP regulation and the vascular response to injury, and considers the implications of the data for future treatment.

Methods

Relevant experimental and clinical studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1969-June 30, 2007) using the primary search terms renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, and dual RAS blockade. Trials included in the review were large (> 200 patients), prospective, randomized controlled studies evaluating the effect of RAS inhibition on end-organ protection in various high-risk populations.

Results

Eleven clinical trials each were identified that evaluated the effect of ACE-inhibitor and ARB monotherapy on end-organ protection. Five trials were identified that evaluated the effects of combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB compared with treatment with either agent alone in different patient populations using different end points. In hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, combination ACE-inhibitor/ARB therapy resulted in better BP control than either agent alone (mean difference, 11.2 mm Hg systolic [P = 0.002], 5.9 mm Hg diastolic [P = 0.003]), as well as greater reductions in microalbuminuria (mean difference in albumin:creatinine ratio, 34%; P = 0.04). Compared with monotherapy, dual RAS inhibition reduced the occurrence of a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration or end-stage renal disease by 60% to 62% in patients with nondiabetic renal disease (P = 0.018 vs ACE inhibitor alone; P = 0.016 vs ARB alone). A recently published study reported a nonsignificant benefit for combination therapy over monotherapy only in a subset of hypertensive patients with high levels of microalbuminuria at baseline (58.1% vs 43.4% reduction, respectively). In patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, the relative risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure was reduced by 15% in those who received an ARB added to an ACE inhibitor compared with those who received placebo added to an ACE inhibitor (P = 0.011). Another study found no benefit on mortality or cardiovascular end points with combination therapy compared with ACE-inhibitor monotherapy. Ongoing studies are investigating dual RAS blockade in patients at high risk for end-organ damage, as well as the most effective doses for use in combination regimens.

Conclusions

There is accumulating evidence that antihypertensive regimens that inhibit the RAS may provide incremental end-organ protection. Combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs to provide more extensive RAS inhibition may provide greater antihypertensive efficacy and end-organ protection than use of either class alone. Future strategies for treating high-risk patients will focus on early interventions that prevent or delay end-organ damage.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^1124P3CX]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Reductions in both cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been well demonstrated with RAAS inhibitors across specific populations that were selected and included for a criterion other than hypertension per se. For example, SOLVD (enalapril in heart failure), HOPE (ramipril in patients with high CVD risk), and EUROPA (perindopril in stable coronary disease) demonstrated significant reductions in the composite endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction or stroke with ACE inhibitors. In these trials, less than half of the patients enrolled had prevalent hypertension. – The beneficial effects of RAAS inhibitors on (all-cause) mortality (a guideline-recommended goal of antihypertensive therapy)have not been convincingly demonstrated in the indication of hypertension. Furthermore, most (antihypertensive) trials in which the clinical effects of RAAS inhibitors were evaluated were underpowered for this endpoint. – To evaluate the impact of RAAS inhibitors on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality for their main indication, hypertension, we undertook a meta-analysis of all prospective randomized clinical trials that compared RAAS inhibitors with control therapy in different populations in which the absolute majority of the patients had hypertension, and where the expected benefits would mainly come from a decrease in BP.

We hypothesized that, taken all evidence together, RAAS inhibitors would produce a significant mortality reduction compared with (contemporary) control therapy. Although the primary aim of this meta-analysis decided a priori was to evaluate RAAS inhibitors as a class of drugs, we realized that ACE inhibitors and ARBs have partly different modes of action. Therefore, we decided to also study these two classes of drugs separately.

We argued that, if a significant effect on both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality could be demonstrated, then treating physicians would have an additional argument to motivate hypertensive patients to comply with long-term treatment with these agents.

### Genetic determinants of treatment benefit of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor perindopril in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^113Wt5xj]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

The efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors in stable coronary artery disease (CAD) may be increased by targeting the therapy to those patients most likely to benefit. However, these patients cannot be identified by clinical characteristics. We developed a genetic profile to predict the treatment benefit of ACE-inhibitors exist and to optimize therapy with ACE-inhibitors.

Methods and Results

In 8907 stable CAD patients participating in the randomized placebo-controlled EUROPA-trial, we analysed 12 candidate genes within the pharmacodynamic pathway of ACE-inhibitors, using 52 haplotype-tagging-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The primary outcome was the reduction in cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and resuscitated cardiac arrest during 4.2 years of follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression was performed with multiple testing corrections using permutation analysis. Three polymorphisms, located in the angiotensin-II type I receptor and bradykinin type I receptor genes, were significantly associated with the treatment benefit of perindopril after multivariate adjustment for confounders and correction for multiple testing. A pharmacogenetic score, combining these three SNPs, demonstrated a stepwise reduction of risk in the placebo group and a stepwise decrease in treatment benefit of perindopril with an increasing scores (interaction P < 0.0001). A pronounced treatment benefit was observed in a subgroup of 73.5% of the patients [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56–0.79], whereas no benefit was apparent in the remaining 26.5% (HR 1.26; 95% CI 0.97–1.67) with a trend towards a harmful effect. In 1051 patients with cerebrovascular disease from the PROGRESS-trial, treated with perindopril or placebo, an interaction effect of similar direction and magnitude, although not statistically significant, was observed.

Conclusion

The current study is the first to identify genetic determinants of treatment benefit of ACE-inhibitor therapy. We developed a genetic profile which predicts the treatment benefit of ACE-inhibitors and which could be used to optimize therapy.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116CCaJm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with heart failure (HF) or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% — either an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be initiated in appropriate patients with AMI, and in patients with AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% and HF symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist reduced all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and should be given in the absence of advanced chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, or other contraindication. In patients early after MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion, sacubitril-valsartan did not significantly reduce cardiovascular death or incident HF compared with an ACEi, hypotensive events were more common, and initiation of this combination agent early after MI appears safe if treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction is planned. Concomitant initiation of both an ACEi and ARB in patients with AMI should be avoided due to an increase in adverse events without added benefit compared with either drug alone. In EPHESUS, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone reduced both all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in patients with AMI with LVEF < 40% who also had symptoms of HF and/or diabetes mellitus; evidence-based therapy use at enrollment was 86% for ACEi or ARB and 75% for a beta blocker, and patients with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL or serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L were excluded. Supporting evidence includes an individual-patient meta-analysis of 98 496 patients with AMI reporting a 30-day mortality rate of 7.1% with ACEi compared with 7.6% with placebo (proportion reduction, 7% [95% CI, 2–11]; P = 0.004), and a trial of 1012 patients with acute STEMI without a history of HF in which eplerenone reduced the primary end point but the benefit was largely driven by a reduction in natriuretic peptides.

### Indications for ACE inhibitors in vascular disease… [^113QjUXX]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are associated with improved survival in patients with congestive heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Halkin and Keren reviewed the indications for this class of medication. The Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction trial compared an ACE inhibitor with placebo and found that the risks of acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina were reduced significantly in patients taking the ACE inhibitor. Rates of acute coronary syndromes were also reduced. In the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial, ACE inhibitors were shown to reduce all-cause mortality in MI survivors and the risk of recurrent infarction. A number of other trials have yielded similar results. The risk of cardiac events that seems to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture is reduced by the use of ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors seem to have an anti-inflammatory effect that restricts vessel wall inflammation.

These agents also have antithrombotic properties. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation trial was terminated prematurely when it was discovered that ramipril-treated patients had significantly lower rates of cardiovascular mortality, cardiac arrest, worsening angina, heart failure, MI, and stroke, compared with those who received placebo. To date, there are no studies showing "definitive evidence" that one ACE inhibitor is preferable to another in terms of efficacy. ACE inhibitors are standard treatment in patients with reduced systolic left ventricular function, patients who have had an MI, and patients with diabetes who are also hypertensive or nephropathic. After MI, patients who can be projected to receive the most benefit from ACE inhibitors are those with CHF, decreased ejection fraction, and anterior myocardial damage. Almost all patients who receive ACE inhibitors will also be appropriately treated with aspirin.

One study found that five-year mortality was lower in patients taking an ACE inhibitor plus aspirin than in those taking an ACE inhibitor alone. Similar results were found in patients with CHF who were taking both medicines. The authors recommend that patients without contraindications to ACE inhibitors should receive this class of medication if they have either established atherosclerosis or diabetes mellitus plus an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Further testing is needed to determine whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists will have the same beneficial effects as ACE inhibitors.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers: evidence for preserving target organs [^114t3nQi]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major problem throughout the developed world. Although current antihypertensive treatment regimens reduce morbidity and mortality, patients are often noncompliant, and medications may not completely normalize blood pressure. As a result, current therapy frequently does not prevent or reverse the cardiovascular remodeling that often occurs when blood pressure is chronically elevated. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is effective in controlling hypertension and treating congestive heart failure. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) inhibit the activity of the RAS, but these two classes of antihypertensive medications have different mechanisms of action and different pharmacologic profiles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block a single pathway in the production of angiotensin II (Ang II). In addition, angiotensin I is not the only substrate for ACE. The ACE inhibitors also block the degradation of bradykinin that may have potential benefits in cardiovascular disease. Bradykinin is, however, the presumed cause of cough associated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Data from clinical trials on ACE inhibitors serve to support the involvement of the RAS in the development of cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin receptor blockers act distally in the RAS to block the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor selectively. Thus, ARBs are more specific agents and avoid many side effects. Experimental and clinical trials have documented the efficacy of ARBs in preserving target-organ function and reversing cardiovascular remodeling. In some instances, maximal benefit may be obtained with Ang II blockade using both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This review describes clinical trials that document the efficacy of ARBs in protecting the myocardium, blood vessels, and renal vasculature.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114Gf5LS]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) use in HFrEF: ACEi reduce morbidity and mortality in HFrEF, and RCTs clearly establish the benefits of ACE inhibition in patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of HF and in patients with or without CAD. Data suggest that there are no differences among available ACEi in their effects on symptoms or survival. ACEi should be started at low doses and titrated upward to doses shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials. ACEi can produce angioedema and should be given with caution to patients with low systemic blood pressures, renal insufficiency, or elevated serum potassium (> 5.0 mEq/L). If maximal doses are not tolerated, intermediate doses should be tried; abrupt withdrawal of ACE inhibition can lead to clinical deterioration and should be avoided. Although the use of an ARNi in lieu of an ACEi for HFrEF has been found to be superior, for those patients for whom ARNi is inappropriate, continued use of an ACEi for all classes of HFrEF remains strongly advised.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients on the basis of postulated advantages for the reduction of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite widespread use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014 and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialised Register.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We included 42 studies, involving 65,733 participants, with a mean age of 66 years. Much of the evidence for our key outcomes is dominated by a small number of large studies at a low risk of bias for most sources of bias. Imbalances in the added second-line antihypertensive drugs in some of the studies were important enough for us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. Primary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and non-fatal congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, total cardiovascular (CV) events (consisted of fatal and non-fatal stroke, fatal and non-fatal MI and fatal and non-fatal CHF requiring hospitalizations), and ESRF. Secondary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR). Compared with first-line calcium channel blockers (CCBs), we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased heart failure (HF) (35,143 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.90, ARR 1.2%), and moderate quality evidence that they increased stroke (34,673 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.32, ARI 0.7%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (35,226 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (35,223 participants in 6 RCTs, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.02; moderate quality evidence), total MI (35,043 participants in 5 RCTs, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09; moderate quality evidence). The results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (19,551 participants in 4 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.05; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line thiazides, we found moderate quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors increased HF (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31, ARI 1.0%), and increased stroke (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.28, ARI 0.6%). They had similar effects on all-cause death (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.07; moderate quality evidence), total CV events (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11; moderate quality evidence), and total MI (24,379 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). Results for ESRF do not exclude potentially important differences (24,309 participants in 1 RCT, RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; low quality evidence). Compared with first-line beta-blockers, we found low quality evidence that first-line RAS inhibitors decreased total CV events (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, ARR 1.7%), and low quality evidence that they decreased stroke (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88, ARR 1.7%). Our analyses do not exclude potentially important differences between first-line RAS inhibitors and beta-blockers on all-cause death (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; low quality evidence), HF (9193 participants in 1 RCT, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; low quality evidence), and total MI (9239 participants in 2 RCTs, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.27; low quality evidence). Blood pressure comparisons between RAS inhibitors and other classes showed either no differences or small differences that did not necessarily correlate with the differences in the morbidity outcomes. In the protocol, we identified non-fatal serious adverse events (SAE) as a primary outcome. However, when we extracted the data from included studies, none of them reported total SAE in a manner that could be used in the review. Therefore, there is no information about SAE in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

We found predominantly moderate quality evidence that all-cause mortality is similar when first-line RAS inhibitors are compared to other first-line antihypertensive agents. First-line thiazides caused less HF and stroke than first-line RAS inhibitors. The quality of the evidence comparing first-line beta-blockers and first-line RAS inhibitors was low and the lower risk of total CV events and stroke seen with RAS inhibitors may change with the publication of additional trials. Compared with first-line CCBs, first-line RAS inhibitors reduced HF but increased stroke. The magnitude of the reduction in HF exceeded the increase in stroke. The small differences in effect on blood pressure between the different classes of drugs did not correlate with the differences in the primary outcomes.

### The consistency of the treatment effect of an ACE-inhibitor based treatment regimen in patients with vascular disease or high risk of vascular disease: a combined analysis of individual data of ADVANCE, EUROPA, and PROGRESS trials [^116DgeAG]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in different groups of patients. Whether these effects can be generalized to the broad group of patients with vascular disease is unknown. Therefore, we undertook a combined analysis using individual data from ADVANCE, EUROPA, and PROGRESS to determine the consistency of the treatment effect of perindopril-based regimen in patients with vascular disease or at high risk of vascular disease.

Methods and Results

We studied all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular outcomes during a follow-up of about 4 years in the 29 463 patients randomly assigned a perindopril-based treatment regimen or placebo. The perindopril-based regimens were associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82–0.96; P = 0.006], cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.76–0.95; P = 0.004), non-fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.71–0.90; P < 0.001), stroke (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.74–0.92; P = 0.002), and heart failure (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.96; P = 0.015). Results were consistent in subgroups with different clinical characteristics, concomitant medication use, and across all strata of baseline blood pressure.

Conclusion

This study provides strong evidence for a consistent cardiovascular protection with an ACE-inhibitor treatment regimen (perindopril-indapamide) by improving survival and reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events across a broad spectrum of patients with vascular disease.

### Comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive medication for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and multiple treatments meta-analysis [^116699LN]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a systematic review of evidence from randomized controlled trials to answer the following research question: What are the relative effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease outcomes for healthy people at risk of cardiovascular disease?

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (up to February 2011) and CENTRAL (up to May 2009), and reference lists in recent systematic reviews. Titles and abstracts were assessed for relevance and those potentially fulfilling our inclusion criteria were then assessed in full text. Two reviewers made independent assessments at each step. We selected the following main outcomes: total mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke. We also report on angina, heart failure and incidence of diabetes. We conducted a multiple treatments meta-analysis using random-effects models. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE-instrument.

Results

We included 25 trials. Overall, the results were mixed, with few significant differences, and with no drug-class standing out as superior across multiple outcomes. The only significant finding for total mortality based on moderate to high quality evidence was that beta-blockers (atenolol) were inferior to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (relative risk (RR) 1.14; 95% credibility interval (CrI) 1.02 to 1.28). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors came out inferior to calcium-channel blockers (CCB) regarding stroke-risk (RR 1.19; 1.03 to 1.38), but superior regarding risk of heart failure (RR 0.82; 0.69 to 0.94), both based on moderate quality evidence. Diuretics reduced the risk of myocardial infarction compared to beta-blockers (RR 0.82; 0.68 to 0.98), and lowered the risk of heart failure compared to CCB (RR 0.73; 0.62 to 0.84), beta-blockers (RR 0.73; 0.54 to 0.96), and alpha-blockers (RR 0.51; 0.40 to 0.64). The risk of diabetes increased with diuretics compared to ACE-inhibitors (RR 1.43; 1.12 to 1.83) and CCB (RR 1.27; 1.05 to 1.57).

Conclusion

Based on the available evidence, there seems to be little or no difference between commonly used blood pressure lowering medications for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Beta-blockers (atenolol) and alpha-blockers may not be first-choice drugs as they were the only drug-classes that were not significantly superior to any other, for any outcomes.

### 2023 AHA / ACC / ACCP / ASPC / NLA / PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1131YH3Z]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Chronic coronary disease — antihypertensive pharmacotherapy selection emphasizes comparative outcomes and first-line agents. In the Verapamil SR(Trandolapril Study) trial, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta‑blocker/thiazide diuretic therapy had similar cardiovascular morbidity and death outcomes. In patients with chronic coronary disease (CCD), ACE inhibitor therapy produced a 20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular death (CVD death), myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac arrest compared with placebo. Because of these benefits, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) "are recommended as a first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertension in such individuals", and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) beta blockers include carvedilol, metoprolol tartrate, metoprolol succinate, nadolol, bisoprolol, propranolol, and timolol. Outcomes with atenolol appear inferior to other antihypertensive drugs, and when beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and ARB therapies do not sufficiently control blood pressure, additional GDMT therapies can be added, including thiazide diuretics, CCB, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### The divergent cardiovascular effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on myocardial infarction and death [^112zTKKQ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and vascular disease. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) suppress angiotensin II (ANG II) concentrations, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) block the binding of ANG II to AT1 receptors. ACEis and ARBs are both effective anti-hypertensive agents and have similar risk reductions in stroke - a blood pressure dependent phenomenon. ACEis also reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality in high risk hypertensive patients, as well as in diabetics, the elderly, those with vascular disease, and in congestive heart failure. ARBs, in contrast, do not reduce the risk of MI or death in clinical trials where the comparator has been another active therapy or even a placebo. Systematic reviews of ARBs that include meta-analyses or meta-regression analyses confirm that ARBs lack the cardiovascular protective effects of ACEis, which in part are "independent" of blood pressure lowering. Practice guidelines, especially those in high risk hypertensive patients, should reflect the evidence that ACEis and ARBs have divergent cardiovascular effects - ACEis reduce mortality, whereas ARBs do not. ACEis should be the preferred RAAS inhibitor in high risk patients.

### Establishing a new option for target-organ protection: rationale for ARB plus ACE inhibitor combination therapy [^1121SKvq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the promotion of cardiovascular disease and target-organ damage, mediated in part by hypertension. Combination therapy targeting RAS activation may reduce target-organ damage and provide superior blood pressure (BP) control; combining angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) represents one possible approach. In monotherapy studies, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have demonstrated similar positive effects on BP and on RAS-related target-organ damage, including nephropathy and congestive heart failure. Studies of combination therapy, most of which involved addition of an ARB to existing ACE inhibitor therapy, have demonstrated benefits among patients with congestive heart failure and renal disease. However, variances in study design and populations, dosing and titration methods, and clinical end points, in addition to inherent differences between agents, limit the ability to reach clinically meaningful conclusions about the value of dual RAS inhibition. Trials designed to document such efficacy are currently underway.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD: a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^117321q1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is much uncertainty regarding the relative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in populations with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis.

Setting & Population

Patients with CKD treated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized trials in patients with CKD treated with RAS inhibitors.

Predictor

ACE inhibitors and ARBs compared to each other and to placebo and active controls.

Outcome

Primary outcome was kidney failure; secondary outcomes were major cardiovascular events, all-cause death.

Results

119 randomized controlled trials (n = 64,768) were included. ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduced the odds of kidney failure by 39% and 30% (ORs of 0.61 [95% credible interval, 0.47–0.79] and 0.70 [95% credible interval, 0.52–0.89]), respectively, compared to placebo, and by 35% and 25% (ORs of 0.65 [95% credible interval, 0.51–0.80] and 0.75 [95% credible interval, 0.54–0.97]), respectively, compared with other active controls, whereas other active controls did not show evidence of a significant effect on kidney failure. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs produced odds reductions for major cardiovascular events (ORs of 0.82 [95% credible interval, 0.71–0.92] and 0.76 [95% credible interval, 0.62–0.89], respectively) versus placebo. Comparisons did not show significant effects on risk for cardiovascular death. ACE inhibitors but not ARBs significantly reduced the odds of all-cause death versus active controls (OR, 0.72; 95% credible interval, 0.53–0.92). Compared with ARBs, ACE inhibitors were consistently associated with higher probabilities of reducing kidney failure, cardiovascular death, or all-cause death.

Limitations

Trials with RAS inhibitor therapy were included; trials with direct comparisons of other active controls with placebo were not included.

Conclusions

Use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in people with CKD reduces the risk for kidney failure and cardiovascular events. ACE inhibitors also reduced the risk for all-cause mortality and were possibly superior to ARBs for kidney failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality in patients with CKD, suggesting that they could be the first choice for treatment in this population.

### Angiotensin receptor blockers for prevention of cardiovascular disease: where does the evidence stand? [^117AV9oZ]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The second meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors over CV morbidity–mortality trials. The trials should have at least two-thirds of patients with hypertension. The meta-analysis included 158 998 patients. RAAS inhibition either with ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or ARB was associated with a 5% reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00) and a 7% reduction in CV mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99). When the trials were divided by the class of RAAS inhibitor, the effect was identified to be entirely due to ACEi (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97). Treatment with an ARB had no effect in the prevention of all-cause mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04).

Another meta-analysis explored the efficacy of ACEi and ARB in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Compared to placebo or other active treatment, in 23 studies with 32 827 patients with diabetes, ACEi significantly reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 13% (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98), the incidence of CV deaths by 17% (0.83; 0.70 to 0.99), major CV events by 14% (0.86; 0.77 to 0.95), including myocardial infarction by 21% (0.79; 0.65 to 0.95) and heart failure by 19% (0.81; 0.71 to 0.93). In contrast with the effectiveness of ACEi, ARBs were ineffective in reducing the risk for all-cause mortality (RR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.08) in 13 studies controlled by placebo or other active treatment, with a total of 23 867 patients with diabetes. With the exception of a reduction in the risk of heart failure (0.70; 0.59 to 0.82), ARBs were ineffective in the prevention of CV death (1.21; 0.81 to 1.80) and major CV events (0.94; 0.85 to 1.01).

Tables 3 and 4 display effect estimates for our primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. The tables also include the results of the quality assessment of the evidence underlying each effect estimate. We have limited the tables to include only the most clinically relevant comparisons, that is, we have excluded "diuretics and/or beta-blockers", "conventional drugs" or "placebo/control". The complete presentation is found in Additional files 3 and 4. A detailed presentation of the quality of evidence assessments is found in Additional file 5.

As expected, the results were favoring active drug treatment over placebo or no treatment.

For most drug-drug comparisons, we found few significant differences, and for most comparisons the quality of the evidence was rated as low (or very low). Overall, the results were ambiguous, with no drug-class standing out as superior across different outcomes.

There was high quality evidence that beta-blockers are inferior to ARB in terms of total mortality (RR 1.14; 95% CrI 1.02 to 1.28). Other significant mortality differences represented only low or very low quality evidence.

### Hypertension mega-trials with cardiovascular end points: effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [^116rL48k]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has a pivotal role in the short- and long-term regulation of blood pressure through its principal mediator, angiotensin II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) decrease the deleterious effects of angiotensin II on the vasculature and heart, but have different mechanisms of action. Although the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBs is equivalent to that of most other antihypertensive agents, emerging data suggest that these drug classes may have a greater effect on decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates in specific patient populations.

Methods

We reviewed large (approximately ≥ 5000 patients) hypertension clinical trials using ACE inhibitors and ARBs and with cardiovascular morbidity/mortality end points.

Results

Six trials of ACE inhibitors and 5 trials of ARBs (3 completed, 2 ongoing) were selected for this analysis. Data from these hypertension mega-trials suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARBs may decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. However, some trials showed important blood-pressure differences and are therefore partly inconclusive for particular drug effects.

Conclusions

Analysis of recently reported and ongoing mega-trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors may support the notion that their vasculoprotective properties confer greater benefit by virtue of their effects beyond blood-pressure reduction. Results from trials that will be completed in the next few years may provide further support of blocking the renin-angiotensin-system in cardiovascular protection in the management of hypertension.

### Blood pressure-lowering drugs and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jPsfB]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the efficacy of five commonly used blood pressure-lowering drugs in reducing cardiovascular events among patients with nonacute cardiovascular disease, but without heart failure.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on 18 March 2017. The primary outcome was fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, and the secondary outcomes were all-cause death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Pooled risk ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials with 143095 participants and a treatment duration of at least 12 months were included in our analyses. Fifteen trials enrolled patients with coronary artery disease, eight enrolled patients with cerebral artery disease, and four enrolled patients with cardiovascular disease. Of the 27 trials, 10 trials only included hypertensive patients. Compared with placebo, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (risk ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.78–0.92), angiotensin receptor blockers (risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.87–0.98), and diuretics (risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.66–0.90) significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. Apart from this, ACEIs significantly reduced all secondary outcomes, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics reduced stroke significantly. No significant difference was found in head-to-head comparisons of each given drug class with any other class.

Conclusions

Although only ACEIs have evidences showing its effect in reducing cardiovascular events and all secondary outcomes, head-to-head comparisons did not provide strong evidence in difference in the effects between these blood pressure-lowering drugs.

### What should the role of ACE inhibitors be in the treatment of diabetes? Lessons from HOPE and MICRO-HOPE [^113sULrc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk by directly affecting endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis and thrombus formation. These direct effects are in addition to effects on vascular tone or pressure. The Health Outcomes and Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study assessed the role of an ACE inhibitor ramipril in reducing CV events in 9297 patients ≥ 55 years who were at high risk of CV events but did not have left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, or high blood pressure at the time of study entry. In the overall HOPE population, the risk of the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) was reduced by 22% (p < 0.001), and in patients with diabetes plus one other CV risk, it was reduced by 25% (p = 0.0004). Ramipril treatment achieved risk reduction in patients with mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dl). Ramipril treatment did not increase adverse events in patients with renal insufficiency. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound changes in patients treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) demonstrated that ramipril 10 mg significantly reduced the rate of carotid intimal medial thickening, suggesting a direct effect on atherosclerotic progression.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^113wvH5W]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Reduction in mortality is the primary goal of antihypertensive therapy. Paradoxically, the effect of RAAS inhibitors on mortality in hypertensive patients remained uncertain and had never been systematically evaluated. To our knowledge, no prior published meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of RAAS inhibitors on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in their main indication of hypertension. Previous analyses in for example heart failure or coronary artery disease populations (with or without hypertension) demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular events, stroke, and mortality. In addition, a pooled analysis of trials in patients with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension) concluded that the reduction in cardiovascular mortality and stroke with RAAS inhibitors is BP dependent. In our analyses, the significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality associated with RAAS inhibition supports previous literature.

As stated, the primary aim of this meta-analysis decided a priori was to test the hypothesis that RAAS inhibitors as a class of drugs would have a beneficial effect on total mortality in hypertension, when compared with contemporary control antihypertensive therapy. However, as we realized that, among the RAAS inhibitors, the ACE inhibitors and ARBs have different mechanisms of action, we also decided to study whether there was a differential effect on mortality between these two classes of drugs. Indeed, our analysis clearly showed that nearly all of the mortality reduction was observed with ACE inhibitors. Contrary, there was no clear benefit from the ARBs. This was supported by the sensitivity analysis which showed a significant stronger treatment effect in the ACE inhibitor trials compared with the ARB trials. With respect to this finding several points deserve consideration.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^111HGVkm]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are well established for the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity, but their impact on all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients is uncertain. Our objective was to analyse the effects of RAAS inhibitors as a class of drugs, as well as of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) separately, on all-cause mortality.

Methods and results

We performed a pooled analysis of 20 cardiovascular morbidity–mortality trials. In each trial at least two-thirds of the patients had to be diagnosed with hypertension, according to the trial-specific definition, and randomized to treatment with an RAAS inhibitor or control treatment. The cohort included 158 998 patients (71 401 RAAS inhibitor; 87 597 control). The incidence of all-cause death was 20.9 and 23.3 per 1000 patient-years in patients randomized to RAAS inhibition and controls, respectively. Overall, RAAS inhibition was associated with a 5% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91–1.00, P = 0.032), and a 7% reduction in cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88–0.99, P = 0.018). The observed treatment effect resulted entirely from the class of ACE inhibitors, which were associated with a significant 10% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84–0.97, P = 0.004), whereas no mortality reduction could be demonstrated with ARB treatment (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94–1.04, P = 0.683). This difference in treatment effect between ACE inhibitors and ARBs on all-cause mortality was statistically significant (P -value for heterogeneity 0.036).

Conclusion

In patients with hypertension, treatment with an ACE inhibitor results in a significant further reduction in all-cause mortality. Because of the high prevalence of hypertension, the widespread use of ACE inhibitors may result in an important gain in lives saved.

### New users of angiotensin II receptor blocker-versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based antihypertensive medication regimens and cardiovascular disease events: a secondary analysis of ACCORD-BP and SPRINT [^112Lkk5H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Our key finding that neither an ARB nor an ACEI is superior to each other in preventing CVD among high‐risk patients adds to the comparative effectiveness literature by contextualizing the research question within the environment of intensive SBP treatment. Prior studies demonstrated that when compared head‐to‐head, ARBs are equally efficacious as ACEIs but have a better tolerability profile. In a prior analysis of ACCORD‐BP, Gao et al observed that participants who were prevalent users of ARBs at baseline experienced lower rates of the primary outcome during the trial, but did not observe the same relationship with ACEIs, calcium channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics. However, this analysis is subject to prevalent user bias, and the results should be interpreted with great caution. The current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension BP guidelines recommend both classes interchangeably, and there may be further evidence that ARBs provide more protection against hypertension‐mediated cognitive decline and cancer outcomes. Future research is needed to understand what barriers exist to clinician prescribing of ARBs.

Several underlying mechanisms may explain our finding that ARB new users had a lower risk of all‐cause death compared with ACEI new users. Animal studies suggest that ARBs and ACEIs have distinct physiologic effects on the renin‐angiotensin system that could result in ARBs having greater benefits against noncardiovascular risk factors for mortality, including dementia and cancer. Specifically, ARBs block the angiotensin II type 1 receptor and indirectly increase the counterregulatory effects of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT 2 R), resulting in a reduction in peripheral inflammation and angiogenesis and promoting memory‐enhancing effects and cancer cell apoptosis. Alternatively, ACEIs reduce the production of angiotensin II, indirectly decreasing activation of both angiotensin II type 1 receptor and AT 2 R and potentially diminishing counterregulatory benefits of the AT 2 R. Human studies show that, in contrast to ACEIs, ARBs improve brain blood flow velocity and preserve cerebrovascular reserve. Data from meta‐analyses and more recent randomized controlled trials indicate that ARBs are more effective to prevent cognitive decline than ACEIs. Limited observational data in humans suggest that ARBs, compared with ACEIs, are associated with a lower risk of some cancers, although this is inconsistent across studies. Further research is needed to clarify if these noncardiovascular risk factors indeed mediate the relationship of ARBs versus ACEIs with regard to all‐cause death.

### Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease: pathophysiological insights and therapeutic options [^114eut6Y]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Patients With HF and CKD

Current therapeutic options in patients with HF are largely on the basis of cardiovascular outcome trials, which assessed the effect of both medical and interventional therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, patients with CKD have been excluded in most clinical HF studies, and recommendations for patients with CKD have to be extrapolated from subgroup analyses. There is to date no treatment option available that convincingly reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with HF and preserved EF (left ventricular EF ≥ 50%) or moderately impaired left-ventricular function (left ventricular EF 40%–49%) in CKD.

However, at the stage of symptomatically reduced EF (HFrEF; left ventricular EF < 40%), therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and β-blockers is recommended as first-line therapy. ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in numerous large randomized trials. A clear benefit of ACE inhibitors in patients with CKD stage 1 to 3 has been suggested, but few data are available in patients with advanced CKD stages. In the Swedish Cardiac Insufficiency Registry, a total of 2410 patients with HFrEF and CKD (serum creatinine 2.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) with or without RAS inhibitor were studied. Propensity score matching was used to compare 602 patients with and without angiotensin1-receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors. In patients with RAS inhibition, total mortality was significantly lower at 1 year compared with patients without RAS inhibition (hazard ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.67–0.86]).

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are beneficial in normotensive atherosclerotic patients: a collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials [^114uHFRA]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

It is unclear whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are beneficial in individuals with, or at increased risk for, atherosclerotic vascular disease who are normotensive.

Methods and Results

Two investigators independently searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1980 to 2011, bibliographies, and contacted primary study authors for randomized placebo-controlled outcome trials evaluating ACE-I or ARB which enrolled at least 1000 patients with, or at increased risk for, atherosclerotic vascular disease and followed them for at least 12 months. We approached all eligible trials to obtain data stratified by baseline systolic pressures. We pooled data from 13 trials of 80 594 patients; outcomes included 9043 all-cause deaths, 5674 cardiovascular deaths, 3106 myocardial infarctions, and 4452 strokes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB reduced the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke by 11% (95% confidence interval 7–15%), with no variation in efficacy across baseline systolic blood pressure strata. In patients with baseline systolic pressure < 130 mmHg, ACE-I or ARB reduced the composite primary outcome by 16% (10–23%) and all-cause mortality by 11% (4–18%)-this benefit was consistent across all subgroups examined including those without systolic heart failure (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.75–0.88) and those without diabetes (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.70–0.89).

Conclusion

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB are beneficial in patients with, or at increased risk for, atherosclerotic disease even if their systolic pressure is < 130 mmHg before treatment.

### Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition in stable coronary artery disease [^115NPKU5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective in reducing the risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death from cardiovascular causes in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce atherosclerotic complications in patients who have vascular disease without heart failure.

Methods

In the Prevention of Events with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (PEACE) Trial, we tested the hypothesis that patients with stable coronary artery disease and normal or slightly reduced left ventricular function derive therapeutic benefit from the addition of ACE inhibitors to modern conventional therapy. The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 8290 patients were randomly assigned to receive either trandolapril at a target dose of 4 mg per day (4158 patients) or matching placebo (4132 patients).

Results

The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 64 ± 8 years, the mean blood pressure 133 ± 17/78 ± 10 mm Hg, and the mean left ventricular ejection fraction 58 ± 9 percent. The patients received intensive treatment, with 72 percent having previously undergone coronary revascularization and 70 percent receiving lipid-lowering drugs. The incidence of the primary end point — death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization — was 21.9 percent in the trandolapril group, as compared with 22.5 percent in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the trandolapril group, 0.96; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.06; P = 0.43) over a median follow-up period of 4.8 years.

Conclusions

In patients with stable coronary heart disease and preserved left ventricular function who are receiving "current standard" therapy and in whom the rate of cardiovascular events is lower than in previous trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with vascular disease, there is no evidence that the addition of an ACE inhibitor provides further benefit in terms of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization.

### Mortality and morbidity among individuals with hypertension receiving a diuretic, ACE inhibitor, or calcium channel blocker: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116WgKKr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there a difference in the long-term risk of mortality and morbidity outcomes for adults with hypertension starting 1 of 3 antihypertensive treatments: thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor?

Findings

In this prespecified secondary analysis of outcomes of 32 804 participants in a randomized clinical trial and posttrial up to 23 years later, there was no significant difference in mortality due to cardiovascular disease among the 3 antihypertensive treatment groups. However, there was an increased risk of stroke outcomes for ACE inhibitors compared with diuretics; after accounting for multiple comparisons, this increased risk was no longer significant.

Meaning

Long-term follow-up supports the main findings that the diuretic group had similar cardiovascular outcomes and the ACE inhibitor group had higher stroke mortality risk.

### Efficiency and specificity of RAAS inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases: how to achieve better end-organ protection? [^112eq6Ge]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

RAAS, a major pharmacological target in cardiovascular medicine, is inhibited by pharmacological classes including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-II type 1 blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone receptors antagonists, in addition to the recently introduced direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). However, currently used RAAS inhibitors still cannot achieve their desired effects and are associated with certain drawbacks, such as adverse side effects, incomplete blockage of the system and poor end-organ protection. In this review, we discuss the efficiency and specificity of the current RAAS inhibitors and propose some recommendations for achieving better treatments with better end-organ protection.

ACE inhibitors/ARBs and aldosterone blockade — "ACE inhibitors should be used (unless contraindicated) in women after MI and in those with clinical evidence of heart failure, LVEF ≤ 40%, or diabetes mellitus (Class I; Level of Evidence A)", and "In women after MI and in those with clinical evidence of heart failure, an LVEF ≤ 40%, or diabetes mellitus who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors, ARBs should be used instead (Class I; Level of Evidence B)". The guideline notes, "ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy and ought to be used with caution in women who may become pregnant". For select post–MI patients, "Use of aldosterone blockade (e.g., spironolactone) after MI is indicated in women who do not have significant hypotension, renal dysfunction, or hyperkalemia who are already receiving therapeutic doses of an ACE inhibitor and β-blocker and have LVEF ≤ 40% with symptomatic heart failure (Class I; Level of Evidence B)".

### Meta-analysis of randomized trials on the efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients ≥ 65 Years of age [^113Hs2Hn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The comparative efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) with other agents in patients ≥ 65 years of age with cardiovascular diseases or at-risk are unknown. Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify all randomized controlled trials that compared ACEIs with control (placebo or active) and reported long-term cardiovascular outcomes. We required the mean age of patients in the studies to be ≥ 65 years. Random-effects model was used to pool study results. Sixteen trials with 104,321 patients and a mean follow-up of 2.9 years were included. Compared with placebo, ACEIs significantly reduced all outcomes except stroke. Compared with active controls, ACEIs had similar effect on all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 1.03), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04), heart failure (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03), myocardial infarction (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00), and stroke (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15). ACEIs were associated with an increased risk of angioedema (RR 2.79, 95% CI 1.05 to 7.42), whereas risk for hypotension and renal insufficiency was similar compared with active controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that the effect of ACEIs on outcomes remained consistent with age increasing ≥ 65 years. Sensitivity analysis excluding trials comparing ACEIs with angiotensin receptor blockers and heart failure trials yielded similar results, except for reduction in myocardial infarction. In conclusion, the efficacy of ACEIs was similar to active controls for mortality outcomes. Compared with placebo, there was evidence for reduction in cardiovascular outcomes; however, ACEIs failed to prevent stroke and increased the risk of angioedema, hypotension, and renal failure.

### High-dose versus low-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112q8SzC]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically review evidence comparing the effect of low-dose versus high-dose ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation, functional capacity and side effects in patients with heart failure (HF).

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and LILACS up to January 2019. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing low-dose versus high-dose ACEIs in adults with HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed with RoB 2.0, and quality of evidence with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We conducted random effects meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.

Results

We included eight RCTs (5829 patients with HF). In comparison with low-dose ACEIs, high-dose ACEIs showed a non-significant effect on all-cause mortality (8 RCTs, n = 5828, relative risk (RR) 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02; moderate quality of evidence), cardiovascular mortality (6 RCTs, n = 4048, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; moderate quality of evidence), all-cause hospitalisation (5 RCTs, n = 5394, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10; moderate quality of evidence) and cardiovascular hospitalisation (4 RCTs, n = 5242, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.17; low quality of evidence). High-dose ACEI increased functional capacity (4 studies, n = 555, standardised mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55; low quality of evidence) and the risk of hypotension (4 RCTs, n = 3783, RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.05; moderate quality of evidence). High-dose ACEI had no effect on dizziness (3 RCTs, n = 4994, RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.93; low quality of evidence), but decreased the risk of cough (4 RCTs, n = 5146, RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; moderate quality of evidence).

Conclusions

The magnitude of benefit of using high dose versus low to intermediate doses of ACEIs might be less than traditionally suggested in clinical guidelines. These findings might help clinicians address the complex task of HF management in a more rational and timely fashion, saving efforts to implement strategies with the greatest net clinical benefit.

### Angiotensin II and trials of cardiovascular outcomes [^111UzXaJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Proven cardiovascular benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. The first study to show dramatic benefits from ACE inhibition was the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS-I), in which a 31% decrease in the rate of death was observed in patients with severe heart failure at the end of 1 year of enalapril treatment (p = 0.001). This result led to large long-term studies-including Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE), Acute Infarction Ramipril Efficacy (AIRE), Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE), and Study of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD)-which verified that ACE inhibition decreases heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI), and mortality, and that striking benefit could be observed within 30 days. Short-term studies of patients in the acute phase of a heart attack verified that ACE inhibition provided rapid benefits. A meta-analysis of short-term (up to 8 weeks) studies of ACE inhibition (including CONSENSUS-II, Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico [GISSI]-3, International Study of Infarct Survival [ISIS]-4, and the Chinese Captopril Study [CCS]-1) demonstrated that post-MI risk was reduced by 10% within the first day of treatment. The immediacy of the benefit suggested that ACE inhibition not only improved cardiovascular function in failing hearts but also affected important mechanisms in patients without overt heart failure. Effects on more general mechanisms of heart disease suggested that patients with problems other than hypertension or heart failure might benefit from ACE inhibitors. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study investigated the hypothesis that ACE inhibition would confer benefits to patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular events, but who were without left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. Long-term reductions in MI, stroke, cardiac arrest, and heart failure, as well as improvements in mortality, were observed in this population after treatment with ACE inhibitors. Substudies of the HOPE study revealed that ACE inhibition reduced progression of atherosclerosis and improved myocardial remodeling. Taken together, these studies provide evidence that supports treatment of a broad population of patients at risk for cardiovascular events with ACE inhibitors. The next step is to combine ACE inhibition with other treatments to maximize patient benefit. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) will compare the efficacy of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) with an angiotensin receptor blocker (telmisartan), and determine whether these treatments in combination will further reduce morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.

### Effects of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, on cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^116fMqZV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

The study HOPE was published by Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation Study Investigators and colleagues in 2000 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, Peripheral artery disease, Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus type 2, Dyslipidemia, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the HOPE study, the trial question was: what is the role of ramipril in patients who were at high-risk for cardiovascular events but are not known to have a low ejection fraction or HF? In the HOPE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the HOPE study, the population was: 9297 patients (2480 female, 6817 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who were at high-risk for cardiovascular events but are not known to have a low ejection fraction or HF. The key exclusion criteria were HF, low ejection fraction (< 0.40), taking ACEi or vitamin E, uncontrolled hypertension or overt nephropathy, or myocardial infarction or stroke within four weeks before the study. In the HOPE study, the interventions were: n = 4645 ramipril (10 mg once per day PO) n = 4652 placebo (matching placebo PO daily). In the HOPE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (14% vs. 17.8%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.86). In the HOPE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in cardiovascular death (6.1% vs. 8.1%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.87) Significant decrease in death from myocardial infarction (9.9% vs. 12.3%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.9) Significant decrease in death from stroke (3.4% vs. 4.9%; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.84). In the HOPE study, the conclusion was: in patients who were at high-risk for cardiovascular events but are not known to have a low ejection fraction or HF, ramipril was superior to placebo with respect to death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^117UxpoX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Renin–angiotensin system blockade in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — given the proven cardiovascular benefits and shared properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in inhibiting the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), either type of agent should be strongly considered for people with diabetes and CKD because they reduce the risk of both cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and progression of kidney disease.

### Progression of cardiovascular damage: the role of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^115FYWUK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays key roles throughout the cardiovascular continuum, and blockade of this system — either through angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition or through angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonism — now occupies a central place in the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Understanding of the RAS has expanded in recent years with the identification of new pathways for formation of angiotensin II and novel effector peptides, such as angiotensin-(1–7), which may constitute new therapeutic targets. A substantial proportion of the benefits of ACE inhibitors, including vasodilation, improvements in endothelial function, and inhibition of cell proliferation, appear to be attributable to decreases in angiotensin II and increases in bradykinin. In addition, however, there is evidence that other mechanisms, such as modulation of ACE signaling, may also contribute. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) selectively block AT(1) receptors and allow unopposed stimulation of AT(2) receptors, with potentially beneficial vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects. As a result, these agents share many of the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to exert multiple antiatherogenic actions, and to reduce clinical events in high-risk participants; their use is recommended in current guidelines for the secondary prevention of CVD.

### A remarkable medical story: benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in cardiac patients [^112atdFE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The development of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) has been one of the most remarkable stories in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have several acute and sustained hemodynamic effects that are beneficial in the presence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. They increase cardiac output and stroke volume and reduce systemic vascular resistance as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The hemodynamic benefits are associated with improvement in the signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) as well as decreased mortality, regardless of the severity of CHF. In patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction, therapy with ACE inhibitors prevented the development of CHF and reduced hospitalization and cardiovascular death. They also increase survival when administered early after an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Most recently, ACE inhibition was associated with improved clinical outcomes in a broad spectrum of high-risk patients with preserved LV function. The mechanism of ACE inhibitors benefits is multifactorial and includes prevention of progressive LV remodeling, prevention of sudden death and arrhythmogenicity and structural stability of the atherosclerotic process. Evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors are underutilized in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Efforts should be directed to prescribe ACE inhibitors to appropriate patients in target doses. It is reasonable to believe that ACE inhibitors have a class effect in the management of LV dysfunction with or without CHF and acute MI. Whether the same is true for ACE inhibitors in the prevention of ischemic events is not known yet.

### ACE inhibitor therapy: benefits and underuse… [^113Rhpw5]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

During the past decade, several landmark trials have confirmed the benefits of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for use in patients with heart failure and patients with recent acute myocardial infarction. Despite the strongly favorable evidence and guideline recommendations, ACE inhibitor therapy remains underused. This editorial reviews the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy and recent studies describing its lack of utilization in patients and emphasizes the need for broader use of ACE inhibitor therapy. 3 of 32 randomized clinical trials studying ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with symptomatic heart failure confirmed their benefit in reducing mortality and recurrent hospitalization for heart failure.

Results of the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction Treatment Trial 4 show improved survival for patients with moderate heart failure who are treated with ACE inhibitors; the results suggest that treatment of 1, 000 such patients for three years will prevent 50 deaths and 350 hospitalizations. ACE inhibitor therapy has also been shown to improve survival in patients with acute myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis 5 of eight randomized trials enrolling more than 100, 000 patients confirmed a reduction in mortality in those who received oral ACE inhibitors within 24 hours after admission. Among selected patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 percent, anterior infarction or clinical signs of congestive heart failure who are treated with ACE inhibitors for one to four years, a survival benefit of 42 to 76 lives per 1, 000 treated patients has been observed.

Major guideline statements emphasize the importance of ACE inhibitor therapy for the treatment of patients with heart failure and those with acute myocardial infarction. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and care of patients with heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction 6 state the following: The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction. In summary, the major studies and evidence to date confirm improved outcomes for patients with congestive heart failure and recent myocardial infarction who are treated with ACE inhibitor therapy. Family practitioners and cardiovascular subspecialists must become familiar with existing guidelines and implement ACE inhibitor therapy broadly for appropriate candidates.

The impact of widespread use of these therapies would be a profound change in the subsequent course and outcome for millions of patients who have had a myocardial infarction and for those with congestive heart failure.

### Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors versus angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^112HdZPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg). However, while ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in placebo-controlled trials, ARBs have not. Therefore, a comparison of the efficacies of these two drug classes in primary hypertension for preventing total mortality and cardiovascular events is important.

Objectives

To compare the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on total mortality and cardiovascular events, and their rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs), in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISI Web of Science up to July 2014. We contacted study authors for missing and unpublished information, and also searched the reference lists of relevant reviews for eligible studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials enrolling people with uncontrolled or controlled primary hypertension with or without other risk factors. Included trials must have compared an ACE inhibitor and an ARB in a head-to-head manner, and lasted for a duration of at least one year. If background blood pressure lowering agents were continued or added during the study, the protocol to do so must have been the same in both study arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Nine studies with 11,007 participants were included. Of the included studies, five reported data on total mortality, three reported data on total cardiovascular events, and four reported data on cardiovascular mortality. No study separately reported cardiovascular morbidity. In contrast, eight studies contributed data on WDAE. Included studies were of good to moderate quality. There was no evidence of a difference between ACE inhibitors and ARBs for total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.10), total cardiovascular events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.19), or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.13). Conversely, a high level of evidence indicated a slightly lower incidence of WDAE for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 1.8%, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 55 over 4.1 years), mainly attributable to a higher incidence of dry cough with ACE inhibitors. The quality of the evidence for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes was limited by possible publication bias, in that several studies were initially eligible for inclusion in this review, but had no extractable data available for the hypertension subgroup. To this end, the evidence for total mortality was judged to be moderate, while the evidence for total cardiovascular events was judged to be low by the GRADE approach.

Authors' Conclusions

Our analyses found no evidence of a difference in total mortality or cardiovascular outcomes for ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors, while ARBs caused slightly fewer WDAEs than ACE inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy in these outcomes over placebo, our results cannot be used to extrapolate the same conclusion for ARBs directly, which have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials for hypertension. Thus, the substitution of an ARB for an ACE inhibitor, while supported by evidence on grounds of tolerability, must be made in consideration of the weaker evidence for the efficacy of ARBs regarding mortality and morbidity outcomes compared with ACE inhibitors. Additionally, our data mostly derives from participants with existing clinical sequelae of hypertension, and it would be useful to have data from asymptomatic people to increase the generalizability of this review. Unpublished subgroup data of hypertensive participants in existing trials comparing ACE inhibitors and ARBs needs to be made available for this purpose.

### From the HOPE to the ONTARGET and the TRANSCEND studies: challenges in improving prognosis [^113T1SzE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study conclusively demonstrated that ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and death in patients at risk for cardiovascular events but without heart failure. The Study to Evaluate Carotid Ultrasound Changes in Patients Treated with Ramipril and Vitamin E (SECURE) substudy demonstrated that ramipril also reduced atherosclerosis. These results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has a more important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis than previously believed, and they indicate the need for further clinical studies to define the range of benefits available from modifying the RAS. Achieving maximum benefit may require treatment with both an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker (ARB). The Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction (RESOLVD) study indicated that combining an ACE inhibitor with an ARB decreased blood pressure and improved the ejection fraction more than treatment with either drug alone in patients with congestive heart failure. The Valsartan in Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) showed that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB reduced hospitalization for heart failure in patients with congestive heart failure by 27.5%, although no decrease in all-cause mortality was observed. The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) is a large, long-term study (23,400 patients, 5.5 years). It will compare the benefits of ACE inhibitor treatment, ARB treatment, and treatment with an ACE inhibitor and ARB together, in a study population with established coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes with end-organ damage. Patients with congestive heart failure will be excluded. In a parallel study, patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor will be randomized to receive telmisartan or placebo (the Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE-I Intolerant Patients with Cardiovascular Disease [TRANSCEND]). The primary endpoint for both trials is a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary endpoints will investigate reductions in the development of diabetes mellitus, nephropathy, dementia, and atrial fibrillation. These 2 trials are expected to provide new insights into the optimal treatment of patients at high risk of complications from atherosclerosis.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^114AKXGc]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

It might be argued that the observed 5% relative mortality reduction in the overall group of RAAS inhibitors, and the 10% relative mortality reduction in the ACE inhibitor group is small, and only found to be statistically significant in our analysis because of statistical 'overpowering'. Indeed, in meta-analyses clinically irrelevant treatment effects might become statistically significant (i.e. the estimated effect divided by the standard error is > 1.96) simply because of the large size of the aggregate (or pooled) trials. In our view, however, the observed mortality reduction in this meta-analysis is clinically relevant indeed, for several reasons. Firstly, it should be realized that the treatment effect was reached in patients who did receive a broad range of other contemporary risk-reduction therapies, including statins, antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, diuretics, and other BP-lowering medication (note that, as per design, we included trials that were conducted during 2000–2011). Secondly, the estimated absolute mortality reduction was 2.4 per 1000 patient-years for the RAAS inhibitors as a group and 3.8 per 1000 patient-years for the class of ACE inhibitors. This is an interesting figure, particularly since the prevalence of hypertension in Western (CAD) populations is high, despite the widespread use of BP-lowering medication. Thus a wider application of these agents, in particular of ACE inhibitors, may have substantial effects on the population level. Interestingly, the observed mortality reduction was largest in trials with the highest baseline SBP. The observed mortality reduction may be used as an additional argument to stimulate patients to adhere to the prescribed treatment.

### Individualized angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor therapy in stable coronary artery disease based on clinical and pharmacogenetic determinants: the PERindopril GENEtic (PERGENE) risk model [^116dVziG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA) and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) have demonstrated the effectiveness of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors perindopril and ramipril, respectively, by reduction of mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). 1, 2 Consequently, ACE inhibitors are recommended in clinical guidelines on secondary prevention in patients with stable CAD and hence widely used in this population. 3, 4, 5

However, patients with stable CAD constitute a heterogeneous group in which the absolute risk of cardiovascular complications varies between individuals. 6, 7

Several approaches toward identification of those patients that are most likely to benefit from ACE‐inhibitor therapy have previously been reported. A previously published post‐hoc analysis of the EUROPA trial studied baseline clinical risk factors such as age, sex, smoking, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels. 6 A risk score founded on such baseline clinical risk factors was able to identify patients at high, medium, and relatively low absolute risk (> 3%, 1–3% and 1% per annum, respectively) of experiencing cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and resuscitated cardiac arrest. 6 In contrast to the absolute treatment benefit, the relative treatment effect of perindopril, however, was not modified by the baseline level of risk. 6 Similar conclusions were drawn after investigation of the relation between treatment benefit by perindopril and baseline renal function or the degree of blood pressure reduction. 8, 9, 10

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^114f9deR]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are well established for the reduction in cardiovascular morbidity, but their impact on all-cause mortality in hypertensive patients is uncertain. Our objective was to analyse the effects of RAAS inhibitors as a class of drugs, as well as of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) separately, on all-cause mortality.

Methods and Results

We performed a pooled analysis of 20 cardiovascular morbidity-mortality trials. In each trial at least two-thirds of the patients had to be diagnosed with hypertension, according to the trial-specific definition, and randomized to treatment with an RAAS inhibitor or control treatment. The cohort included 158 998 patients (71 401 RAAS inhibitor; 87 597 control). The incidence of all-cause death was 20.9 and 23.3 per 1000 patient-years in patients randomized to RAAS inhibition and controls, respectively. Overall, RAAS inhibition was associated with a 5% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.91–1.00, P = 0.032), and a 7% reduction in cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88–0.99, P = 0.018). The observed treatment effect resulted entirely from the class of ACE inhibitors, which were associated with a significant 10% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84–0.97, P = 0.004), whereas no mortality reduction could be demonstrated with ARB treatment (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.94–1.04, P = 0.683). This difference in treatment effect between ACE inhibitors and ARBs on all-cause mortality was statistically significant (P-value for heterogeneity 0.036).

Conclusion

In patients with hypertension, treatment with an ACE inhibitor results in a significant further reduction in all-cause mortality. Because of the high prevalence of hypertension, the widespread use of ACE inhibitors may result in an important gain in lives saved.

### Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: from evidence to clinical practice-position statement 2014 of Brazilian diabetes society [^113mCeaT]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

- A meta-analysis of 5 trials, both observational and randomized clinical trial, including 7,312 patients with diabetes showed that intensive treatment with a reduction in systolic BP to below 130 mmHg vs. reduction of systolic BP to below 140 mmHg showed reduction of the risk of stroke but not in mortality or in acute myocardial infarction.

26 Due to the similarity of benefit in cardiovascular outcomes, it is recommended that the decision in the choice of initial drug therapy, including the major classes of antihypertensive drugs, is based on tolerability, cost, and presence of comorbidities. Regarding renal protection, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are superior. [LEVEL A]

Summary of evidence:

- A meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials with 158,709 patients including 33,395 patients with diabetes, the options of diuretics, calcium dihydropyridine blockers, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) were equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in subjects with or without diabetes.

- A meta-analysis including 63 randomized controlled trials with 36,917 patients with diabetes compared different antihypertensive drugs versus placebo. ACE inhibitors have consistently shown higher probability in being superior compared to other antihypertensive drugs in relation to renal outcomes, mortality from all causes, onset of dialysis or doubling of creatinine. The meta-analysis also demonstrated superiority of ACE inhibitors in relation to reno-protection, with similar benefit when ARBs are used.

27 In the need of using more than one antihypertensive to achieve target blood pressure, it is preferably recommended the association between an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with a dihydropiridin calcium blocker. [LEVEL A]

Summary of evidence:

- The randomized ACCOMPLISH trial included 11,506 patients with high blood pressure and with cardiovascular high risk, including 60% of patients with diabetes. These patients were randomly assigned to associations to receive benazepril plus amlodipine or benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide for 36 months. The study showed that the combination benazepril plus amlodipine is superior to the combination of benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality (reduction of relative risk of 19.6% p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with diabetes had similar benefits as the non diabetic patients.

### Treatment benefit by perindopril in patients with stable coronary artery disease at different levels of risk [^114Z6hH1]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) are at increased risk. Estimation of individual risk is difficult. We developed a cardiovascular risk model based on the EUROPA study population and investigated whether benefit of long-term administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor perindopril was modified by risk level.

Methods and Results

A total of 12 218 patients with stable CAD were treated with 8 mg perindopril or placebo. Baseline patient characteristics were assessed for association with 1091 cardiovascular deaths or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI). Risk factors were age over 65 years, male gender [hazard ratio (HR) 1.2], previous MI (HR 1.5), previous stroke and/or peripheral vascular disease (HR 1.7), diabetes, smoking, angina (all HR 1.5), and high serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure. Treatment benefit by perindopril was consistent among high, intermediate, and low risk patients (HRs 0.88, 0.68, and 0.83, respectively). Risk reduction was thus not modified by absolute risk level.

Conclusion

Risk factors such as age, male gender, smoking, total cholesterol, and blood pressure continue to play an important role once clinical sequellae of coronary heart disease have developed. Patients at moderate-to-high risk because of uncontrolled risk factors and those with other indications for ACE-inhibitors have the most to gain from ACE-inhibition.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce mortality in hypertension: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors involving 158, 998 patients [^1159DzbN]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

The reduced effect of ARBs on mortality when compared with ACE inhibitors has also previously been discussed. A recent meta-analysis of 37 ARB trials also failed to detect a reduction in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in a broad population of patients. The differences in the modes of action between ACE inhibitors and ARBs, and the small-but-definite BP-independent reduction in CAD mortality with ACE inhibitors, which has not been observed with ARBs or other antihypertensive agents, might contribute to this finding. On the other hand, others have demonstrated that BP-dependent beneficial effects in the prevention of stroke and heart failure are similar for ACE inhibitors and ARBs. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have also been shown to be equally effective in preventing atrial fibrillation and new-onset diabetes. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that we did not design this meta-analysis to make a head-to-head comparison between ACE inhibitors and ARBs. The finding that the beneficial effect is seen in the ACE inhibitor population as opposed to the ARB population should be considered a post hoc observation. Given the nature of meta-analyses, which are per definition data-driven, the differential effect between ACE inhibitors and ARBs should be interpreted with caution to avoid overstating this subgroup finding vis-à-vis the a priori hypothesis. In this respect it should also be noted that the difference in effect on cardiovascular mortality between ACE inhibitors and ARBs was not statistically significant. Furthermore, two previous studies were designed to compare ACE inhibitors and ARBs in an hypertensive population, but both the ONTARGET (telmisartan vs. ramipril) and DETAIL (telmisartan vs. enalapril) trial did not show a differential treatment effect between ARBs and ACE inhibitors. Thus, at present, the results of this analysis do not warrant changing clinical practice treatment guidelines that recommend that an ARB may be used in ACE inhibitor-intolerant hypertensive patients. Hopefully, our findings will form the basis of further analysis and studies into the effects of BP treatment and total mortality which is the first line priority in the guidelines for the management of hypertension.

### ACE inhibition versus angiotensin receptor blockade: which is better for renal and cardiovascular protection? [^114cWniF]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic renal disease is characterized by a gradual loss of renal function and an increased cardiovascular risk. Renin-angiotensin system blockade by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockade has distinct renoprotective and cardiovascular protective effects, but which of the two drug classes confers more protection is still a matter of debate. This review highlights and compares the effects of the two drug-classes in nondiabetic renal disease and in overt or incipient nephropathy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both renal and cardiovascular outcomes are considered. Regardless of their relative efficacy, both drug classes have a dose-response relationship for intermediate renal and cardiovascular parameters. Moreover, combined treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade seems to provide better long-term renoprotection than monotherapy. Actually, in most patients, achieving maximal renal and cardiovascular protection requires a multidrug regimen, usually including several antihypertensives. Within this approach, full dose titration of either RAS blocker followed by add-on with the second drug is more important than the choice of the initial drug.

### Comparative effectiveness of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with prior myocardial infarction [^114yFNS5]. Open Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although many are still concerned with an ARB–MI paradox, our study of close to 60 000 patients with MI should serve as reassurance that ARBs are not associated with adverse outcomes compared with ACEIs. Potential benefits of ARBs as compared with ACEIs in older women with MI should be further evaluated.

### Effects of different blood-pressure-lowering regimens on major cardiovascular events: results of prospectively-designed overviews of randomised trials [^115ABmEf]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

The benefits of reducing blood pressure on the risks of major cardiovascular disease are well established, but uncertainty remains about the comparative effects of different blood-pressure-lowering regimens. We aimed to estimate effects of strategies based on different drug classes (angiotensin-converting-enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-receptor blockers [ARBs], and diuretics or beta blockers) or those targeting different blood pressure goals, on the risks of major cardiovascular events and death.

Methods

We did seven sets of prospectively-designed overviews with data from 29 randomised trials (n = 162341). The trial eligibility criteria, primary outcomes, and main hypotheses were specified before the result of any contributing trial was known.

Findings

In placebo-controlled trials the relative risks of total major cardiovascular events were reduced by regimens based on ACE inhibitors (22%; 95% CI 17–27) or calcium antagonists (18%; 5–29). Greater risk reductions were produced by regimens that targeted lower blood pressure goals (15%; 5–24). ARB-based regimens reduced the risks of total major cardiovascular events (10%; 4–17) compared with control regimens. There were no significant differences in total major cardiovascular events between regimens based on ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists, or diuretics or beta blockers, although ACE-inhibitor-based regimens reduced blood pressure less. There was evidence of some differences between active regimens in their effects on cause-specific outcomes. For every outcome other than heart failure, the difference between randomised groups in achieved blood pressure reduction was directly related to the observed difference in risk.

Interpretation

Treatment with any commonly-used regimen reduces the risk of total major cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk.

### Renin inhibitors versus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for primary hypertension [^114ynicX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renin inhibitors (RIs) reduce blood pressure more than placebo, with the magnitude of this effect thought to be similar to that for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, a drug's efficacy in lowering blood pressure cannot be considered as a definitive indicator of its effectiveness in reducing mortality and morbidity. The effectiveness and safety of RIs compared to ACE inhibitors in treating hypertension is unknown.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors in people with primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Group Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to August 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers about further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies (RCTs) with at least four weeks follow-up in people with primary hypertension, which compared renin inhibitors with ACE inhibitors and reported morbidity, mortality, adverse events or blood pressure outcomes. We excluded people with proven secondary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the included trials, evaluated the risks of bias and entered the data for analysis.

Main Results

We include 11 RCTs involving 13,627 participants, with a mean baseline age from 51.5 to 74.2 years. Follow-up duration ranged from four weeks to 36.6 months. There was no difference between RIs and ACE inhibitors for the outcomes: all-cause mortality: risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.18; 5 RCTs, 5962 participants; low-certainty evidence; total myocardial infarction: RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.39; 2 RCTs, 957 participants; very low-certainty evidence; adverse events: RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.03; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; serious adverse events: RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.64; 10 RTCs, 6007 participants; low-certainty evidence; and withdrawal due to adverse effects: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.06; 10 RTCs, 6008 participants; low-certainty evidence. No data were available for total cardiovascular events, heart failure, stroke, end-stage renal disease or change in heart rate. Low-certainty evidence suggested that RIs reduced systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -1.72, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.97; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants; and diastolic blood pressure: MD -1.18, 95% CI -1.65 to -0.72; 9 RCTs, 5001 participants, to a greater extent than ACE inhibitors, but we judged this to be more likely due to bias than a true effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of hypertension, we have low certainty that renin inhibitors (RI) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors do not differ for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. We have low to moderate certainty that they do not differ for adverse events. Small reductions in blood pressure with renin inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitors are of low certainty. More independent, large, long-term trials are needed to compare RIs with ACE inhibitors, particularly assessing morbidity and mortality outcomes, but also on blood pressure-lowering effect.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertension: to use or Not to use? [^115tMHxs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Most guidelines for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as first-choice therapy, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are merely considered an alternative for ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The aim of this review was to compare outcomes and adverse events between ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients. In patients with hypertension and hypertension with compelling indications, we found no difference in efficacy between ARBs and ACE inhibitors with regard to the surrogate endpoint of blood pressure and outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. However, ACE inhibitors remain associated with cough and a very low risk of angioedema and fatalities. Overall withdrawal rates because of adverse events are lower with ARBs than with ACE inhibitors. Given the equal outcome efficacy but fewer adverse events with ARBs, risk-to-benefit analysis in aggregate indicates that at present there is little, if any, reason to use ACE inhibitors for the treatment of hypertension or its compelling indications.

### Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors in stable vascular disease without left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure: a combined analysis of three trials [^113UxM3V]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Three large trials have assessed the effect of ACE inhibitors in stable patients without these conditions but with atherosclerosis. We undertook a systematic review of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE), the European trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril among patients with stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA), and the Prevention of Events with ACE inhibition (PEACE) studies to determine the consistency with which ACE inhibitors reduce total mortality and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events.

Methods

We computed cardiovascular outcomes and total mortality in the 29,805 patients of these three trials, randomly assigned an ACE inhibitor or placebo and followed up for a mean of about 4.5 years. The results were also analysed within the context of five large trials of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure or LVSD.

Findings

When the findings of the HOPE, EUROPA, and PEACE trials were combined, ACE inhibitors significantly reduced all-cause mortality (7.8 vs 8.9%, p = 0.0004), cardiovascular mortality (4.3 vs 5.2%, p = 0.0002), non-fatal myocardial infarction (5.3 vs 6.4%, p = 0.0001), all stroke (2.2 vs 2.8%, p = 0.0004), heart failure (2.1 vs 2.7%, p = 0.0007), coronary-artery bypass surgery (6.0 vs 6.9%, p = 0.0036) but not percutaneous coronary intervention (7.4 vs 7.6%, p = 0.481). The composite outcomes of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 1599 (10.7%) of the patients allocated ACE inhibitor and in 1910 (12.8%) of those allocated placebo (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CIs 0.76–0.88; p < 0.0001). Except for stroke and revascularisation, these results were similar to those of the five trials in patients with heart failure or LVSD.

Interpretation

ACE inhibitors reduce serious vascular events in patients with atherosclerosis without known evidence of LVSD or heart failure. Results showing these benefits in intermediate-risk patients complement existing evidence of similar benefit in higher-risk patients with LVSD or heart failure. Therefore, use of ACE inhibitors should be considered in all patients with atherosclerosis.

### Renin-angiotensin system modulation: the weight of evidence [^112GF2XX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is considered to be the most complete way to manage high-risk patients including those with hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective at reducing the morbidity and mortality of patients with overt clinical heart failure, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Furthermore, recent trials like the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluations (HOPE) study and the EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) support extending the use of ACE inhibitors to the routine/first-line treatment of patients with an increased global cardiovascular risk. Although some investigators have seen the development of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as a more effective and tolerable way of reproducing the benefits of ACE inhibition, there remain important concerns regarding the distinct pharmacologic profiles and modes of action of these two classes of drugs. Careful evaluation of data from recent large-scale studies revealed that, unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs are either neutral or may actually increase rates of myocardial infarction despite similar levels of blood pressure reduction. The fact that this effect is most apparent when ARBs are compared with placebo in the absence of concomitant ACE inhibitors suggests that differential effects on the angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptors may be important. Other important pharmacologic differences are also known to be present and may be of direct relevance. The weight of available evidence therefore supports the use of appropriate ACE inhibitor regimens, although not ARBs, in the treatment of global cardiovascular risk.

### Renin inhibition: what are the therapeutic opportunities? [^1134WDAS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has become a crucial element in cardiovascular and renal medicine. This review evaluates the potential of renin inhibition as an adjunct to therapies that depend on renin system interruption.

### What is a preferred angiotensin II receptor blocker-based combination therapy for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with diabetic and non-diabetic renal impairment? [^111n2iSg]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2012). Low credibility.

Telmisartan has also shown efficacy in non-hypertensive patients. Based on the findings of the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET ®), which randomised 25,620 patients with vascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage, to receive either telmisartan or the reference standard ACE inhibitor, ramipril, or a combination of the two agents, telmisartan is the only ARB with an indication for CV prevention independent of BP, including diabetes patients with established end organ damage such as renal disease. ONTARGET ® demonstrated that the two agents were equally effective in reducing the primary composite outcome of CV death, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalisation due to heart failure (relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.94–1.09), but that telmisartan was better tolerated than ramipril. Previously, ramipril had demonstrated CV prevention properties in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study. Evidence from the ONTARGET ® and the Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE-I iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND ®) trials also provides support for the renoprotective effects of telmisartan.

Guidelines recommend RAS blockers, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, as the treatment of choice for patients with renal impairment. Other antihypertensives may be added if BP is not controlled. In addition, the issue of tolerability and adverse events, particularly the occurrence of ACE inhibitor-induced cough, supports the use of ARBs rather than ACE inhibitors in combination therapy in patients with renal impairment.

Trial sequential analysis

To compare RASi with active controls, the lack of significant benefit of RASi could merely be due to type II error. To evaluate this, we used trial sequential analysis to evaluate whether the RASi versus active controls comparisons had adequate power. For trial sequential analysis, monitoring boundaries are drawn for each outcome, similar to interim analysis of randomized trials. This provides information on whether to continue evaluating for evidence when the boundary is not crossed or whether sufficient evidence is reached for anticipated effect or for futility when the boundary is crossed. Trial sequential analysis was performed by estimation of the required diversity adjusted information size (sample size), anticipating a 15–20% relative risk reduction for the outcome (death, cardiovascular death, stroke), α = 5% and 1−β = 90%. The methodology has been described previously. The 15–20% relative reduction was chosen because it is the nominal effect size seen in cardiovascular trials that is both clinically meaningful and realistic.

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to study participants or the relevant patient community.

Regarding specific circumstances for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate ACEis (or ARBs if ACEis are not tolerated) to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary disease and diabetes.

### Renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in hypertension: is there evidence for benefit independent of blood pressure reduction? [^112i21Ha]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension (HTN). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are first line anti-HTN drug classes that are potent, effective and largely safe. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have shown similar blood pressure (BP) reduction but more side effects. The efficacy of ACEIs and ARBs (for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal protection) has been promoted to extend beyond what could be explained by BP reduction alone. In the current review, we will briefly discuss the (1) pathophysiology of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) system, (2) clinical evidence for ACEIs, ARBs and DRIs in HTN, (3) comparison of ACEIs vs. ARBs and combination therapy, (4) role of RAAS inhibitors in specific patient populations, (5) safety profile of RAAS inhibitors, and (6) guideline recommendations and future perspectives. Closer scrutiny of outcome data shows little, if any, evidence that the efficacy of RAAS blockers in HTN extends beyond BP reduction.

### ACE inhibitors effective in patients with CAD without heart failure… [^116eSkFB]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: Are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors effective in decreasing mortality and morbidity in patients with heart disease who do not have heart failure or systolic dysfunction. Setting: Outpatient Study Design: Meta-analysis. Synopsis: The authors conducting this meta-analysis searched four databases, secondary sources, and presentations at scientific meetings. They did not look for unpublished research. They included all randomized controlled studies of at least two years in length of patients with, or at high risk of, coronary artery disease but without signs or symptoms of heart failure and no documented left ventricular dysfunction. The authors did not state whether the literature search and data abstraction were completed by more than one person. They combined the results from seven studies enrolling a total of 33, 960 patients. Five ACE inhibitors were used in these studies.

Overall mortality was lower in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor than in those receiving placebo, although the effect on individual patients was small. The number of deaths caused by cardiovascular effects also was decreased. Myocardial infarction risk and stroke risk were similarly decreased. These NNTs are high because of the relatively small benefit and because the death rate in these studies was less than 2 percent. There was no correlation between blood pressure reduction and outcomes in this study. Bottom Line: ACE inhibitors decrease overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction risk, and stroke risk in patients with CAD but who have no signs or symptoms of heart failure. The benefit is not pronounced, with only one death prevented in more than 400 patients treated for two years.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% — angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) outcomes and exclusions are as follows: Randomized trials show a reduction in all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with ACEi addition in AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% and anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and an individual-patient meta-analysis of 98 496 AMI patients showed survival benefit with greatest absolute benefit in hypertension, diabetes, and anterior STEMI. In VALIANT, an ARB was statistically noninferior to an ACEi and all-cause death rates were similar, whereas concomitant ACEi+ARB initiation in AMI should be avoided due to increased adverse events without added benefit. In EPHESUS, eplerenone reduced all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% with heart failure (HF) symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, with high background therapy use (86% ACEi/ARB and 75% beta blocker at enrollment) and exclusion of advanced chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL) or hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L). In 1012 acute STEMI patients without prior HF, eplerenone reduced the primary endpoint versus placebo, largely driven by natriuretic peptide reduction. An ACEi collaborative meta-analysis of 98 496 AMI patients reported 30-day mortality 7.1% with ACEi versus 7.6% with placebo (proportion reduction, 7% [95% CI, 2–11]; P = 0.004), with benefit irrespective of baseline risk, and ACEi reduced nonfatal cardiac failure versus placebo.

### Rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of 2 large, simple, randomized trials evaluating telmisartan, ramipril, and their combination in high-risk patients: the ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial / telmisartan randomized assessment study in ACE intolerant subjects with cardiovascular disease (ONTARGET / TRANSCEND) trials [^114ZeqDD]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, need for revascularization, nephropathy, and diabetes and its complications. Although angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have been less extensively evaluated, theoretically they may have "protective" effects similar to those of ACE inhibitors, but with better tolerability. Currently, there is uncertainty about the role of ARBs when used alone or in combination with an ACE inhibitor in high-risk populations with controlled hypertension.

Objectives

Primary objectives of the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) are to determine if the combination of the ARB telmisartan and the ACE inhibitor ramipril is more effective than ramipril alone, and if telmisartan is at least as effective as ramipril. The Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in aCE iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND) will determine if telmisartan is superior to placebo in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. The primary outcome for both trials is the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Method

High-risk patients with coronary, peripheral, or cerebrovascular disease or diabetes with end-organ damage are being recruited and followed for 3.5 to 5.5 years in 2 parallel, randomized, double-blind clinical trials.

Progress

Recruitment from 730 centers in 40 countries for ONTARGET (n = 25,620) was completed in July 2003. For TRANSCEND, 5776 patients (out of a projected total of 6000) have been recruited (by May 10, 2004). Baseline patient characteristics are comparable to the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial, the basis of the design of the current study, confirming that patients are at high-risk.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^111Pcmif]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition for coronary heart disease (CHD) management is supported as follows: In people with diabetes and CKD, RAS inhibition is beneficial for the management of CHD and associated complications and for treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction, and when used alone or in combination these agents are equally beneficial for improving survival and reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) events after myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, with patients with diabetes benefiting at least as much as those without diabetes. Similarly, in people with diabetes with chronic CHD and without left ventricular dysfunction, ACE inhibition reduces CVD death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and therefore RAS inhibition is recommended for treatment of acute myocardial infarction and for chronic CHD in patients with diabetes.
