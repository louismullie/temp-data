## Question

acute chest syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ACS and its diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and precipitating factors. Next, I will review initial assessment and risk stratification, followed by first-line management including oxygen, antibiotics, analgesia, and incentive spirometry. After that, I need to examine transfusion thresholds and the role of exchange transfusion, consider special populations and low-resource settings, and finally address prevention, monitoring, and evidence gaps with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. ACS is a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest imaging in a patient with SCD who has respiratory symptoms, fever, chest pain, hypoxemia, or abnormal lung exam; symptoms may precede or lag radiographic changes, so a high index of suspicion is warranted, and in low-resource settings where radiography is limited, pulse oximetry and clinical scoring may be needed to triage and monitor severity [^114a9MeV] [^117CZYQe] [^113PzjUS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should review the multifactorial drivers. Infectious causes, particularly atypical bacteria, are common, but noninfectious mechanisms include fat embolism from bone marrow, pulmonary infarction, and hypoventilation from pain or narcotics; importantly, more than half of cases may have no identifiable cause, which reinforces the need for empiric, broad coverage and supportive care while investigations proceed [^113fxakE] [^113YobkJ] [^115CsfJw].

> I need to check the initial assessment elements and risk stratification. Vital signs, pulse oximetry, lung exam, and a careful pain assessment are essential; labs should include CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, and cultures when feasible; an ECG and troponin are reasonable to exclude cardiac ischemia in chest pain; thrombocytopenia and rapid clinical deterioration should raise concern for a rapidly progressive phenotype, which carries higher risk of multiorgan failure and mortality, especially in adults [^113hNLet] [^112FoKFP] [^111YR5Pe].

> Next, I should review first-line management and confirm guideline-concordant care. Supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 greater than 95% is recommended; empiric antibiotics with a parenteral cephalosporin plus a macrolide to cover atypical pathogens are standard; adequate analgesia is critical to enable deep breathing and prevent hypoventilation; and incentive spirometry during hospitalization reduces ACS risk and should be implemented early and consistently [^115cuFsa] [^113RDpee] [^114UKVWs] [^113zzQuk].

> Wait, let me verify the transfusion strategy because this is often nuanced. For moderate ACS, simple transfusion of about 10 mL/kg packed RBCs is reasonable, particularly when hemoglobin is more than 1 g/dL below baseline; for severe disease, rapidly progressive respiratory failure, or high baseline hemoglobin, urgent exchange transfusion in consultation with hematology or apheresis is preferred to rapidly lower sickle hemoglobin while improving oxygen-carrying capacity; however, I should double-check the evidence base — Cochrane reviews highlight very limited RCT data, so decisions remain largely consensus-driven and should weigh alloimmunization and iron overload risks [^115Hn7pp] [^113ZKkFc] [^112caamC] [^111Uq5BU] [^117CZYQe].

> I will now examine special populations and settings, starting with pregnancy and the postpartum period. ACS risk rises markedly in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester and postpartum; multidisciplinary obstetric–hematology care, close monitoring, and a lower threshold for transfusion are prudent, though prophylactic transfusion remains individualized due to transfusion risks and limited randomized evidence; in low-resource settings, manual exchange transfusion and pulse oximetry-guided supportive care can be lifesaving when automated exchange is unavailable [^114JkybC] [^115DaffU] [^111P3DAV].

> But wait, what if resources are constrained and imaging is unavailable. In low-resource environments, clinical scoring, pulse oximetry, and early empiric therapy are essential; portable ultrasound may assist where available; standardized pathways and training improve recognition and outcomes, and where transfusion capacity is limited, prioritizing oxygen, antibiotics, analgesia, and incentive spirometry remains foundational while arranging transfer when feasible [^113PzjUS] [^113YobkJ] [^1139xaqt] [^116VHzXy] [^1114eSJS].

> Next, I should review prevention of recurrence and chronic risk mitigation. Hydroxyurea reduces ACS frequency and is strongly recommended for patients with recurrent or severe ACS; chronic transfusion may be considered for those with recurrent ACS despite hydroxyurea or when hydroxyurea is contraindicated; for highly selected patients with recurrent ACS despite optimal therapy, matched sibling donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered, though evidence is largely nonrandomized and long-term data are limited [^111whY3h] [^117CZYQe] [^112oxn4v] [^114Cf8TU].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring and follow-up priorities. During acute episodes, reassess respiratory status frequently and escalate to exchange transfusion or ICU-level care if hypoxemia worsens or organ dysfunction develops; after recovery, evaluate for chronic lung disease and pulmonary hypertension risk, ideally with echocardiography performed at steady state rather than during acute illness, and consider pulmonary function testing where available, recognizing that routine screening PFTs have not consistently changed outcomes in observational cohorts [^113ozyuo] [^111FAijr] [^1152Z65s].

> I need to ensure I acknowledge evidence gaps and future directions. High-quality RCTs are lacking for antibiotics, bronchodilators, and transfusion strategies in ACS; severity phenotypes and biomarkers to predict rapid progression need validation; and implementation science to standardize care pathways and reduce readmissions remains critical, with observational data suggesting that guideline-adherent antibiotics reduce readmissions and that structured inpatient protocols improve process and outcome metrics [^116RceAM] [^1172NCaQ] [^112caamC] [^113y1ns3] [^1139xaqt].

> Finally, let me reconsider the practical, bedside synthesis to ensure internal consistency. ACS is a clinical-radiographic diagnosis with heterogeneous causes; start oxygen, empiric cephalosporin plus macrolide, analgesia, and incentive spirometry for all suspected cases; use simple transfusion early for moderate disease and exchange transfusion urgently for severe or rapidly progressive cases in consultation with specialists; tailor decisions to baseline hemoglobin, trajectory, and comorbidities; and embed prevention with hydroxyurea, vaccination, and education to mitigate recurrence and long-term lung complications [^115cuFsa] [^115Hn7pp] [^111whY3h].

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a **life-threatening complication** of sickle cell disease, defined by new pulmonary infiltrates with fever, chest pain, dyspnea, or hypoxemia [^114a9MeV]. It is a **medical emergency** requiring immediate hospitalization, oxygen to maintain SpO2 > 95%, empiric antibiotics (cephalosporin plus macrolide), and close monitoring for deterioration [^115cuFsa] [^113RDpee]. Transfusion is indicated for severe cases: simple transfusion if hemoglobin is > 1 g/dL below baseline, and exchange transfusion for rapid progression, severe hypoxemia, or neurologic symptoms [^115Hn7pp] [^117CZYQe]. Early recognition and aggressive management are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^1158TpHp].

---

## Pathophysiology

ACS arises from a **multifactorial interplay** of vaso-occlusion, infection, and fat embolism:

- **Vaso-occlusion**: Sickled RBCs cause pulmonary microvascular obstruction, leading to hypoxemia and infarction [^113LXhaY].

- **Infection**: Community-acquired pneumonia, especially atypical pathogens (e.g. Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), is common [^113fxakE].

- **Fat embolism**: Bone marrow emboli from infarcted long bones can trigger pulmonary inflammation and injury [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

ACS presents with **respiratory and systemic symptoms**, including:

- **Respiratory symptoms**: Dyspnea, chest pain, cough, wheezing, rales, and hypoxemia [^114a9MeV].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, tachypnea, and signs of respiratory distress [^114a9MeV].

- **Severity**: Rapidly progressive ACS can lead to respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and death [^112FoKFP].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis requires **new pulmonary infiltrates** on chest radiograph or CT, with at least one of the following:

- Fever ≥ 38.5°C

- Respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, chest pain, cough, wheezing)

- Hypoxemia (SpO2 < 95% on room air)

- Tachypnea or respiratory distress

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase ACS risk**:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | More common in children and young adults [^notfound] |
| Genotype | HbSS and HbSβ0-thalassemia at higher risk [^113YobkJ] |
| Prior ACS | History of ACS increases recurrence risk [^notfound] |
| Asthma | Common comorbidity increasing ACS risk [^112m5M3v] |
| Pregnancy | Increased risk, especially postpartum [^114JkybC] |
| Infection | Recent or ongoing infection [^113fxakE] |
| Surgery | Recent surgery or anesthesia [^112oAnWM] |

---

## Management strategies

ACS management is **multidisciplinary and time-sensitive**:

---

### Initial supportive care

- **Oxygen therapy**: Maintain SpO2 > 95% to reduce sickling and improve oxygenation [^115cuFsa].

- **Analgesia**: Adequate pain control to enable deep breathing and prevent atelectasis [^113XfctV].

- **Hydration**: Careful IV hydration to avoid fluid overload and pulmonary edema [^113fxakE].

- **Incentive spirometry**: Reduces atelectasis and ACS risk, especially during VOC [^114a9MeV] [^113zzQuk].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotics should cover **common and atypical pathogens** — a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide (azithromycin) — and therapy should be adjusted to culture results and local resistance patterns [^115cuFsa] [^113y1ns3].

---

### Blood transfusion

Transfusion is indicated for **severe cases**:

- **Simple transfusion**: 10 mL/kg PRBCs if hemoglobin is > 1 g/dL below baseline [^115Hn7pp].

- **Exchange transfusion**: For rapid progression, severe hypoxemia, neurologic symptoms, or baseline hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL [^117CZYQe].

- **Risks**: Alloimmunization, iron overload, and transfusion reactions [^112oAnWM].

---

### Advanced therapies

Advanced options include **extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)** for refractory respiratory failure, though outcomes are poor and careful patient selection is essential [^1176TNZh] [^112NhfgP], and **plasma exchange** as an alternative when transfusion is contraindicated (e.g. severe alloimmunization) [^117V32vi].

---

## Prognosis and complications

ACS carries **significant morbidity and mortality**:

- **Mortality**: 1–4% in children, higher in adults and severe cases [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Chronic lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, recurrent ACS, and multiorgan failure [^117CZYQe].

- **Recurrence**: Common, necessitating long-term prevention strategies [^116keNvm].

---

## Prevention

Preventive strategies focus on **hydroxyurea** — which reduces ACS incidence and is recommended for recurrent ACS or severe disease — and on **chronic transfusions** for patients with recurrent ACS or stroke risk. Vaccination with pneumococcal, influenza, and other routine immunizations reduces infection risk, and regular follow-up with pulmonary function monitoring and echocardiography enables early detection of complications [^111whY3h] [^117CZYQe] [^115ZVabr] [^111FAijr].

---

Acute chest syndrome is a **severe complication** of sickle cell disease requiring rapid recognition and aggressive management. Early oxygen, antibiotics, and transfusion, along with preventive strategies, are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality [^113YobkJ].

### An evidence-based approach to the treatment of adults with sickle cell disease [^114ETKKc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in the areas of health care maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies as well as the opinions of experts in SCD. RCTs impacting current practices address use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria, but most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data. While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also the need for development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies. This brief review is not a substitute for the process but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.

### Antibiotics for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^116RceAM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical presentation of acute chest syndrome is similar whether due to infectious or non-infectious causes, thus antibiotics are usually prescribed to treat all episodes. Many different pathogens, including bacteria, have been implicated as causative agents of acute chest syndrome. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Objectives

To determine whether an empirical antibiotic treatment approach (used alone or in combination): 1. is effective for acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; 2. is safe for acute chest syndrome compared to placebo or standard treatment; Further objectives are to determine whether there are important variations in efficacy and safety: 3. for different treatment regimens, 4. by participant age, or geographical location of the clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to 19 October 2012), African Index Medicus (1982 to 3 November 2012). and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (19 October 2012). Date of most recent search of the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 29 October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author intended to independently extract data and assess trial quality by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies, but no eligible randomised controlled trials were identified.

Main Results

For this update, we were unable to find any randomised controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

This update was unable to identify randomised controlled trials on efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome. Randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease [^113YobkJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease (SCD) is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of ACS in SCD, including diagnosis and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

ACS is defined by respiratory symptoms and/or fever and a new radiodensity on chest imaging in a patient with SCD. There are a variety of inciting causes, including infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Although ACS is more common in those with homozygous SCD, clinicians should consider ACS in all SCD patients, as ACS is a leading cause of death in SCD. Patients typically present with or develop respiratory symptoms including fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, which can progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in 20% of adult patients. However, the initial presentation can vary. While the first line imaging modality is classically chest radiograph, lung ultrasound has demonstrated promise. Further imaging to include computed tomography may be necessary. Management focuses on analgesia, oxygen supplementation, incentive spirometry, bronchodilators, rehydration, antibiotics, consideration for transfusion, and specialist consultation. Empiric antibiotics that cover atypical pathogens are necessary along with measures to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in those with hypoxemia such as simple transfusion or exchange transfusion.

Conclusions

An understanding of ACS can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Blood transfusions for treating acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^112caamC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease is an inherited autosomal recessive blood condition and is one of the most prevalent genetic blood diseases worldwide. Acute chest syndrome is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease, as well as a major cause of morbidity and the greatest single cause of mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Standard treatment may include intravenous hydration, oxygen as treatment for hypoxia, antibiotics to treat the infectious cause and blood transfusions may be given. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2010 and updated in 2016.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of blood transfusions, simple and exchange, for treating acute chest syndrome by comparing improvement in symptoms and clinical outcomes against standard care.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 30 May 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing either simple or exchange transfusion versus standard care (no transfusion) in people with sickle cell disease suffering from acute chest syndrome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both authors independently selected trials and assessed the risk of bias, no data could be extracted.

Main Results

One trial was eligible for inclusion in the review. While in the multicentre trial 237 people were enrolled (169 SCC, 42 SC, 15 Sβ⁰-thalassaemia, 11Sβ + -thalassaemia); the majority were recruited to an observational arm and only ten participants met the inclusion criteria for randomisation. Of these, four were randomised to the transfusion arm and received a single transfusion of 7 to 13 mL/kg packed red blood cells, and six were randomised to standard care. None of the four participants who received packed red blood cells developed acute chest syndrome, while 33% (two participants) developed acute chest syndrome in standard care arm. No data for any pre-defined outcomes were available.

Authors' Conclusions

We found only one very small randomised controlled trial; this is not enough to make any reliable conclusion to support the use of blood transfusion. Whilst there appears to be some indication that chronic blood transfusion may play a roll in reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease and albeit offering transfusions may be a widely accepted clinical practice, there is currently no reliable evidence to support or refute the perceived benefits of these as treatment options; very limited information about any of the potential harms associated with these interventions or indeed guidance that can be used to aid clinical decision making. Clinicians should therefore base any treatment decisions on a combination of; their clinical experience, individual circumstances and the unique characteristics and preferences of adequately informed people with sickle cell disease who are suffering with acute chest syndrome. This review highlights the need of further high quality research to provide reliable evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions for the relief of the symptoms of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

### The intersection between asthma and acute chest syndrome in children with sickle-cell anaemia [^112m5M3v]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Acute chest syndrome is a frequent cause of acute lung disease in children with sickle-cell disease. Asthma is common in children with sickle-cell disease and is associated with increased incidence of vaso-occlusive pain events, acute chest syndrome episodes, and earlier death. Risk factors for asthma exacerbation and an acute chest syndrome episode are similar, and both can present with shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, and wheezing. Despite overlapping risk factors and symptoms, an acute exacerbation of asthma or an episode of acute chest syndrome are two distinct entities that need disease-specific management strategies. Although understanding has increased about asthma as a comorbidity in sickle-cell disease and its effects on morbidity, substantial gaps remain in knowledge about best management.

### How I treat acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease [^113fxakE]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Acute chest syndrome describes new respiratory symptoms and findings, often severe and progressive, in a child with sickle cell disease and a new pulmonary infiltrate. It may be community-acquired or arise in children hospitalized for pain or other complications. Recognized etiologies include infection, most commonly with atypical bacteria, and pulmonary fat embolism (PFE); the cause is often obscure and may be multifactorial. Initiation of therapy should be based on clinical findings. Management includes macrolide antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, modest hydration and often simple transfusion. Partial exchange transfusion should be reserved for children with only mild anemia (Hb > 9 g/dL) but deteriorating respiratory status. Therapy with corticosteroids may be of value; safety, efficacy and optimal dosing strategy need prospective appraisal in a clinical trial. On recovery, treatment with hydroxyurea should be discussed to reduce the likelihood of recurrent episodes.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^113PzjUS]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Management of ACS in low-resource settings — Research question: How should patients with acute onset of signs and symptoms concerning for ACS be managed in low-resource settings? Supporting questions include which physical signs and symptoms are most indicative of ACS in settings without chest radiography and which sustainable interventions decrease ACS-related maternal mortality where hematologists and transfusion therapy are not uniformly available. ACS is a common cause of hospitalization in SCD in high-resource settings, but in many low-resource regions where SCD is highly prevalent, chest radiographs are unavailable.

### Crises in sickle cell disease [^114wu9op]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

In spite of significant strides in the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD), SCD crises are still responsible for high morbidity and early mortality. While most patients initially seek care in the acute setting for a seemingly uncomplicated pain episode (pain crisis or vaso-occlusive crisis), this initial event is the primary risk factor for potentially life-threatening complications. The pathophysiological basis of these illnesses is end-organ ischemia and infarction combined with the downstream effects of hemolysis that results from red blood cell sickling. These pathological changes can occur acutely and lead to a dramatic clinical presentation, but are frequently superimposed over a milieu of chronic vasculopathy, immune dysregulation, and decreased functional reserve. In the lungs, acute chest syndrome is a particularly ominous lung injury syndrome with a complex pathogenesis and potentially devastating sequelae, but all organ systems can be affected. It is, therefore, critical to understand the SCD patients' susceptibility to acute complications and their risk factors so that they can be recognized promptly and managed effectively. Blood transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy for all severe acute crises. Recommendations and indications for the safest and most efficient implementation of transfusion strategies in the critical care setting are therefore presented and discussed, together with their pitfalls and potential future therapeutic alternatives. In particular, the importance of extended phenotypic red blood cell matching cannot be overemphasized, due to the high prevalence of severe complications from red cell alloimmunization in SCD.

### Management of sickle cell disease: recommendations from the 2014 expert panel report [^115ZVabr]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Family physicians are the primary and sometimes only health care resource for families affected by sickle cell disease. Recently published guidelines provide important recommendations for health maintenance, acute care, and monitoring of disease-modifying therapy in persons with this condition. This overview highlights some of the most important clinical activities that can and should be carried out in the community care setting. Children with sickle cell anemia should receive prophylactic penicillin from birth through at least five years of age, and all persons with sickle cell disease require vaccination to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease. Annual screening with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is recommended for all children with sickle cell disease beginning at two years of age and continuing through adolescence to evaluate the risk of stroke and to initiate transfusion therapy in those at high risk. Vasoocclusive crises require immediate and adequate analgesia appropriate to the level of patient-reported pain. Antibiotics, hospitalization, and incentive spirometry are indicated for those with acute chest syndrome. There is strong evidence to support the promotion and use of hydroxyurea therapy in patients nine months and older who have sickle cell anemia because its use can decrease the frequency of vasoocclusive crises and acute chest syndrome with limited adverse effects.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114a9MeV]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) definition and research priorities — ACS is a clinical syndrome consisting of chest pain, fever, tachypnea, wheezing, rales, or cough plus a new infiltrative finding at least one lung segment and is a leading acute cause of mortality in this population. Diagnosis relies on radiographic abnormalities that may precede or lag behind symptoms, and radiography may be unavailable in low-resource settings. Incentive spirometry during vaso-occlusive crisis decreases ACS risk, but additional preventive approaches are necessary. Priority areas for research include ACS severity and subtypes, primary and secondary prevention, and management in low-resource settings.

### New horizons in emergency department management of pediatric sickle cell disease [^1158TpHp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an important topic for emergency medicine audiences because complications of the disease account for a large proportion of hematologic emergencies that are seen in the emergency department each year. Early recognition and aggressive management of emergency complications of SCD can help to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Although the treatment recommendations for some complications of SCD are based on expert opinion, there has been advancement in the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and evidence regarding the treatment options available for managing acute complications. This continuing medical education article will provide a summary of the clinical manifestation and management of the most common acute complications of SCD: infection, vaso-occlusive episode, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, stroke, and priapism.

### Emergency medicine management of sickle cell disease complications: an evidence-based update [^115jLRRm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States. Due to alterations in the structural conformation of hemoglobin molecules under deoxygenated conditions, patients with SCD are predisposed to numerous sequelae, many of which require acute intervention.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an evidence-based update regarding the diagnosis and management of SCD complications.

Discussion

SCD patients experience significant morbidity and mortality secondary to cerebrovascular accident, acute chest syndrome, acute vaso-occlusive pain crises, SCD-related multi-organ failure, cholecystitis, acute intrahepatic cholestasis, acute sickle hepatic crisis, acute hepatic sequestration, priapism, and renal disease. Emergency physicians must recognize acute manifestations of SCD in order to deliver timely management and determine patient disposition.

Conclusions

A comprehensive review of the emergency department management of acute SCD complications is provided. Comprehensive understanding of these aspects of SCD can assist physicians in expediting patient evaluation and treatment, thus decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with this hemoglobinopathy.

Databases of MEDLINE (including in-process and other nonindexed citations), EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980 with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

Findings

Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in those children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for treatment of severe pain associated with a vasoocclusive crisis, and use of incentive spirometry in patients hospitalized for a vasoocclusive crisis. Strong recommendations for chronic complications include use of analgesics and physical therapy for treatment of avascular necrosis, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for microalbuminuria in adults with SCD. Strong recommendations for children and adults with proliferative sickle cell retinopathy include referral to expert specialists for consideration of laser photocoagulation and for echocardiography to evaluate signs of pulmonary hypertension. Hydroxyurea therapy is strongly recommended for adults with 3 or more severe vasoocclusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic anemia interfering with daily activities, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. A recommendation of moderate strength suggests offering treatment with hydroxyurea without regard to the presence of symptoms for infants, children, and adolescents. In persons with sickle cell anemia, preoperative transfusion therapy to increase hemoglobin levels to 10 g/dL is strongly recommended with a moderate strength recommendation to maintain sickle hemoglobin levels of less than 30% prior to the next transfusion during long-term transfusion therapy. A strong recommendation to assess iron overload is accompanied by a moderate strength recommendation to begin iron chelation therapy when indicated.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hydroxyurea and transfusion therapy are strongly recommended for many individuals with SCD. Many other recommendations are based on quality of evidence that is less than high due to the paucity of clinical trials regarding screening, management, and monitoring for individuals with SCD.

### Opportunities to improve outcomes in sickle cell disease [^111ATtxq]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease represents a spectrum of inherited hemoglobin disorders. The pathophysiology involves abnormalities not just in red blood cells but also vascular endothelium, white blood cell function, coagulation, and inflammatory response. Known sequelae of sickle cell disease include invasive infections, painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, strokes, and chronic pulmonary hypertension. Preventive strategies that decrease the risk of infection are the routine use of daily antibiotics until five years of age, immunization of children with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in addition to the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, annual influenza vaccination after six months of age, and meningococcal vaccination after two years of age. A significant advance in stroke prevention is the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to identify asymptomatic, at-risk children who should be considered for chronic blood transfusions. Chronic transfusion therapy for primary or secondary stroke prevention requires careful surveillance for iron overload and chelation therapy. Patients with chest pain, fever, or respiratory symptoms and new pulmonary infiltrates require aggressive medical management for acute chest syndrome. Pain management still represents an important area for aggressive treatment using sickle cell disease-specific guidelines. Newer treatments include hydroxyurea therapy to decrease the frequency of painful episodes and associated comorbidities, and hematopoietic cell transplantation for a limited subset of patients. Family physicians play a crucial role in instituting evidence-based preventive care strategies, initiating timely treatment of acute illness, recognizing life-threatening episodes, and providing a medical home for multidisciplinary management.

### Multi-modal intervention for the inpatient management of sickle cell pain significantly decreases the rate of acute chest syndrome [^116VHzXy]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) is the leading cause of acute care visits and hospitalizations. Pain episodes are a risk factor for the development of acute chest syndrome (ACS), contributing to morbidity and mortality in SCD. Few strategies exist to prevent this complication.

Methods

We performed a before-and-after prospective multi-modal intervention. All children with SCD admitted for pain during the 2-year study period were eligible. The multi-modal intervention included standardized admission orders, monthly house staff education, and one-on-one patient and caregiver education.

Results

A total of 332 admissions for pain occurred during the study period; 159 before the intervention and 173 during the intervention. The ACS rate declined by 50% during the intervention period 25% (39 of 159) to 12% (21 of 173); P = 0.003. Time to ACS development increased from 0.8 days (0.03–5.2) to 1.7 days (0.03–5.8); P = 0.047. No significant difference was found in patient demographics, intravenous fluid amount administered, frequency of normal saline bolus administration, or cumulative opioid amount delivered in the first 24 hr. Patient controlled analgesia-use was more common after the intervention 52% (82 of 159) versus 73% (126 of 173; P = 0.0001) and fewer patients required changes in analgesic dosing within the first 24 hr after admission (26%, 42 of 159 vs. 16%, 28 of 173; P = 0.015).

Conclusions

A multi-modal intervention to educate and subsequently change physician's behavior likely decreased the rate of ACS in the setting of a single teaching hospital.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^117CZYQe]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute chest syndrome

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the most common complications of SCD and is a leading cause of hospitalization and death. ACS is defined as a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph in the presence of respiratory symptoms, hypoxia, chest pain, or fever. Episodes can be triggered by infection, fat embolism, atelectasis, and infarction. The clinical course and spectrum of the disease are variable. While studies defining standardized criteria to assess ACS severity are lacking, patients with significant hypoxia or rapidly declining hemoglobin are considered to have severe disease.

Simple transfusion provided early in the course of moderate ACS often prevents progression of the disease and the need for RCE. The ASH 2020 guidelines recognized the paucity of large-scale studies but suggest RCE over simple transfusion for patients with severe ACS, rapidly progressive ACS, or ACS in patients with high baseline hemoglobin.

Recurrent episodes of ACS can lead to chronic lung disease including pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis. Hydroxyurea is the primary treatment for prevention of recurrent ACS. Analysis of patients in the STOP trial showed a significantly decreased incidence of ACS in the chronic transfusion arm, and small studies suggest it may reduce frequency of ACS recurrence but not severity. Chronic transfusion therapy can be considered in patients with recurrent ACS when hydroxyurea is not well tolerated or when hydroxyurea is insufficient to prevent severe, recurrent ACS.

Sickle cell disease — management after abnormal echocardiography (ECHO): For asymptomatic children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) and an isolated peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV) of ≥ 2.5 to 2.9 m/s, the panel suggests against right-heart catheterization (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects). For children and adults with SCD and a peak TRV of ≥ 2.5 m/s who also have a reduced 6MWD and/or elevated NT-BNP, the panel suggests right-heart catheterization (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects). Good practice statements note it is good practice to consult a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or PH expert when referring SCD patients for right-heart catheterization, interpreting results, and/or considering therapy options, and to base decisions on ECHOs obtained at steady state and not during acute illness such as hospitalization for pain or acute chest syndrome.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^1114eSJS]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The etiology of ACS is multifactorial. The three primary studied mechanisms include pneumonia or systemic infection, fat embolism, and direct pulmonary infarction from HbS-containing erythrocytes. The management of this condition is still largely determined by the experience of individual practitioners, and currently there are no conclusive randomized controlled clinical trials to guide therapy. The most common therapy includes nonspecific supportive care strategies aimed at hastening recovery to baseline, including: hospitalization, hydration, analgesics, broad-spectrum antibiotics, bronchodilators, incentive spirometry, supplemental oxygen, and blood transfusions.

Although SSA is particularly affected by SCD, there is paucity of data on this topic in the region, specifically targeting the magnitude of SCD-related complications. This study was thus undertaken, aiming at determining the burden of ACS and describing its clinical and therapeutic aspects among SCD children in a SSA tertiary pediatric health care facility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent cause of hospitalization in sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite advances in acute care, many settings still lack knowledge about ACS best practices. After the AIEOP Guidelines were published in 2012, suggesting standardized management in Italy, a retrospective study was performed to assess the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways of ACS in children. From 2013 to 2018, 208 ACS episodes were presented by 122/583 kids in 11 centres. 73 were male, mean age 10.9years, 85% African, 92% HbSS or Sβ°. In our hub-and-spoke system, a good adherence to Guidelines was documented, but discrepancies between reference centres and general hospitals were noted. Improvement is needed for timely transfer to reference centres, use of incentive spirometry, oxygen therapy and pain management.

### Managing pregnancy in patients with sickle cell disease from a transfusion perspective [^115DaffU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Advances in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) have made it possible for most female patients (whether homozygous or compound heterozygous) to reach childbearing age and become pregnant. However, even in the less symptomatic forms of SCD a high risk of complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period can occur for both the mother (1% to 2% mortality) and the fetus. Coordinated care from the obstetrician and the sickle cell disease expert is essential, together with the active participation of the patient. Vaso-occlusive complications, such as vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome, often increase in frequency when hydroxyurea treatment is interrupted. Obstetric complications, such as pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm delivery, are more common in women with SCD. Recent meta-analysis-based studies support prophylactic transfusion. However, there have been no randomized trials assessing the benefits of prophylactic transfusion. Given the known risk of transfusion complications, including delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction and hyperhemolysis, transfusion is not systematically performed in pregnant women with SCD. We describe here a case-by-case approach to the management of pregnancy in women with SCD based on the medical and transfusion history of each patient.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) sickle cell disease hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) guidelines state that HSCT is currently the only curative intervention for SCD and are intended to support patients, clinicians, and researchers who consider or perform HSCT for SCD. The guideline development used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with Evidence-to-Decision frameworks. The panel agreed on 8 recommendations to help patients and providers assess how individuals with SCD should consider the timing and type of HSCT. The evidence review yielded no randomized controlled clinical trials for HSCT in SCD; therefore, all recommendations are based on very low certainty in the evidence. Key recommendations include considering HSCT for those with neurologic injury or recurrent acute chest syndrome at an early age, and the panel addressed HSCT use for patients with SCD with neurologic injury, frequent pain, or acute chest syndrome as well as issues related to the type of transplantation and donor used and age of the patient.

### Sickle cell disease: when and how to transfuse [^117QW8FF]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers.

Across "Sixteen studies… in patients with SCD", "No worsening of pulmonary function was noted…; however, the follow-up period of most studies was limited (< 5 years in most cases)". For standard therapies, "the reduction in ACS event recurrence varied from 71% to 92%", and "in a randomized phase 3 trial… reduction in ACS was seen in ~63% of patients relative to those who received placebo". The panel also noted "there is no uncertainty in the benefit of prevention of ACS and that standard of care therapies such as HU can be very effective at prevention of ACS events for some patients".

### "Sickle cell disease in the emergency department: atypical complications and management" [^111ekpD6]. Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States. This disorder of hemoglobin structure leads to a chronic hemolytic anemia and complex chronic disease manifested by sudden, severe, and life-threatening complications. These acute complications can occur in any organ system beginning in early childhood and lasting throughout life. The intermittent nature and acuity of these complications lend the emergency department to be an important site of care. The hallmark of sickle cell disease is the vasoocclusive painful event. Other more "typical" complications include fever, acute chest syndrome, priapism, and ischemic stroke. Children with sickle cell disease can also present with other "atypical" complications that can have devastating consequences if they are unrecognized. Detailed discussion of these "atypical" sickle cell disease complications, organized by organ system involved, will be the focus of this article.

Pregnancy and postpartum acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell disease — Pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with increased ACS risk. In low-resource settings, ACS is the most common cause of acute respiratory failure and death in pregnant or postpartum patients, with ACS responsible for > 60% of the deaths in pregnant women with sickle cell disease in this population. In Ghana, a multidisciplinary approach using a combined obstetric and hematology team was effective in reducing ACS incidence and all-cause maternal mortality. A diagnostic strategy for ACS independent of imaging could facilitate early identification and intervention allowing for targeted resource use, and the role of portable pulse oximetry devices in ACS diagnosis should be evaluated.

Acute pulmonary problems in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, in particular acute chest syndrome (ACS), cause significant mortality and morbidity. It is important to differentiate ACS from pneumonia to avoid inappropriate or inadequate treatment. Asthma may increase the risk of ACS and co-morbid asthma and SCD are associated with worse patient outcomes and, in preclinical models, more severe inflammation. Recurrent wheezing, however, can occur in the absence of a diagnosis of asthma; it is likely due to SCD related inflammation and additional therapies than those that treat asthma may be required. Further research is merited to clarify these issues.

Sickle cell disease cardiopulmonary evaluation — Given the risk for cardiopulmonary disease in individuals with SCD, it is good practice to routinely take a targeted history for signs and symptoms that might indicate a need for further evaluation, including consideration for a diagnostic ECHO. It is good practice to consult with a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or expert in PH when interpreting results of right-heart catheterization and considering therapeutic options based on type of PH and presumed pathophysiology. It is good practice to base decisions about the need for right-heart catheterization on ECHOs obtained at steady state and not during acute illness, such as hospitalization for pain or acute chest syndrome. It is good practice to adopt a multidisciplinary (ie, hematology, PH specialist, pulmonary medicine, or cardiology) approach when considering PAH-specific therapies for SCD patients who have PAH confirmed by right-heart catheterization. It is good practice for providers to understand the importance of educating patients, discussing patient and caregiver priorities, and incorporating shared decision-making when considering obtaining PFT.

American Thoracic Society workshop — pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) are highlighted with methods and research priorities: Pulmonary complications of SCD are diverse and encompass acute and chronic disease, the understanding of their natural history is limited, no specific therapies exist, and these complications are a primary cause of morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary group of pediatric and adult hematologists, pulmonologists, and emergency medicine physicians with expertise in SCD-related lung disease, along with an SCD patient advocate, reviewed the literature and identified key unanswered clinical and research questions, organizing into four subcommittees (acute chest syndrome; lower airways disease and pulmonary function; sleep-disordered breathing and hypoxia; pulmonary vascular complications). Clinically important questions were developed after literature review and finalized by group discussion and consensus. Current knowledge is based on small, predominantly observational studies, few multicenter longitudinal studies, and even fewer high-quality interventional trials targeting pulmonary complications of SCD; each subcommittee identified the three or four most important unanswered questions in their topic area. The authors conclude that important and clinically relevant questions remain unanswered and that high-quality, multicenter, longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials designed and implemented by teams of multidisciplinary clinician-investigators are needed to improve the care of individuals with SCD.

### Improving care for children with sickle cell disease / acute chest syndrome [^1139xaqt]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of hospitalization and death of children with sickle cell disease (SCD). An evidence-based ACS/SCD guideline was established to standardize care throughout the institution in February 2008. However, by the summer of 2009 use of the guideline was inconsistent, and did not seem to have an impact on length of stay. As a result, an implementation program was developed.

Objective

This quality-improvement project evaluated the influence of the development and implementation of a clinical practice guideline for children with SCD with ACS or at risk for ACS on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Clinical outcomes of 139 patients with SCD were evaluated before and after the development of the implementation program. Outcomes included average length of stay, number of exchange transfusions, average cost per SCD admission, and documentation of the clinical respiratory score and pulmonary interventions.

Results

Average length of stay decreased from 5.8 days before implementation of the guideline to 4.1 days after implementation (P = 0.033). No patients required an exchange transfusion. Average cost per SCD admission decreased from $30 359 before guideline implementation to $22 368. Documentation of the clinical respiratory score increased from 31.0% before implementation to 75.5%, which is an improvement of 44.5% (P < .001). Documentation of incentive spirometry and positive expiratory pressure increased from 23.3% before implementation to 50.4%, which is an improvement of 27.1% (P < .001).

Conclusions

Implementation of a guideline for children with SCD with ACS or at risk for ACS improved outcomes for patients with SCD.

### Red cell transfusion and alloimmunization in sickle cell disease [^112oAnWM]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Red cell transfusion remains a critical component of care for acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease. Randomized clinical trials demonstrated the benefits of transfusion therapy for prevention of primary and secondary strokes and postoperative acute chest syndrome. Transfusion for splenic sequestration, acute chest syndrome, and acute stroke are guided by expert consensus recommendations. Despite overall improvements in blood inventory safety, adverse effects of transfusion are prevalent among patients with sickle cell disease and include alloimmunization, acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions, and iron overload. Judicious use of red cell transfusions, optimization of red cell antigen matching, and the use of erythrocytapheresis and iron chelation can minimize adverse effects. Early recognition and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions can avert poor clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss transfusion methods, indications, and complications in sickle cell disease with an emphasis on alloimmunization.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^1141HXKC]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

ACS is frequent among SCD children in our milieu. Its etiologies seem to be multifactorial including infection, pulmonary thrombosis and fat embolism. After an initial normal chest x-ray, especially in a patient presenting with VOC, repeated clinical evaluation must be conducted and possible changes in the clinical status should indicate the necessity of a new radiographic examination. Patients' parents should be educated to recognize early signs and symptoms of the disease, and consult rapidly. Additionally, clinicians must be trained to correctly diagnose ACS, and manage it promptly and efficiently to avoid its related catastrophic consequences. Additive treatment such as incentive spirometry, bronchodilators and even low dose dexamethasone could perhaps be introduced in our settings to reduce the hospital stay and hasten recovery. On recovery, treatment with hydroxyurea should be discussed to reduce the likelihood of recurrent episodes.

### Triaging acute chest syndrome clinical decision-making using bedside SaO ₂ / FiO ₂ ratio [^111ZSe7q]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of death among adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Episodes of ACS are marked by pain, shortness of breath, oxygen supplementation, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and end-organ injury from vaso-occlusive disease. Although episodes of ACS may be initiated by infection, fat embolism, inflammation, infarction, or hypo-ventilation, the exact pathophysiology of ACS is incompletely understood. Standard treatment is supportive, including supplemental oxygen, pain medication, empiric antibiotics, and either simple or exchange transfusions.

Accurately predicting the clinical trajectory of ACS remains problematic. Whereas many patients present with mild symptoms and improve, some experience clinical deterioration very rapidly. Transfusion is a mainstay of ACS treatment. However, clinical practices vary regarding the decision to transfuse and the criteria for simple vs exchange transfusions. Expert guidelines recommend that the severity of ACS should determine when to treat with simple vs exchange transfusions. ACS severity is inconsistently defined, whether by the number of opacified lobes on chest radiography, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia despite supplemental oxygen, or the presence of pleural effusions. We hypothesized that peripheral oxygen saturation would be a reliable and objective measure of respiratory impairment and thus could better predict ICU transfer as a surrogate marker of respiratory failure in patients with ACS. Peripheral oxygen saturation is routinely measured throughout hospitalizations for ACS, and hypoxemia itself worsens ACS pathophysiology, creating a vicious cycle.

### Erythrocytapheresis in children with sickle cell disease and acute chest syndrome [^116DcSRw]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Red cell exchange (RCE) is part of the management of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in patients with sickle cell disease. The study describes the indications and outcome of the procedure.

Procedure

We retrospectively reviewed 53 episodes of ACS in 44 patients who received RCE from January 2003 to October 2006. Patients were aged between 18 months and 19 years.

Results

Sixty-two percent of the patients had at least one previous episode of ACS. ACS was diagnosed at presentation in 66%, in the remainder ACS was diagnosed after a median of 2 days. Clinical Respiratory Score (CRS) was assigned retrospectively to assess respiratory distress (0 = no distress, > 6 = severe). Median admission CRS of 2, progressed to 4 before RCE and declined to 2 within 24 hr afterwards. Median day of RCE was day 2 (IQR 1–3) and the main indication was worsening respiratory distress. No patient developed venous thrombosis, alloantibodies or other complications from RCE. Median length of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR: 5–9 days). Patients with a platelet count significantly lower than their baseline on admission had an increased risk of mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

RCE appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with sickle cell disease and ACS. One-third of patients who received RCE for ACS had no respiratory symptoms on admission.

### Incentive spirometry to prevent acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease; a randomized controlled trial [^115CsfJw]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a major complication in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), attributing to up to 25% of mortality. 1 The pneumonia‐like complication frequently coincides with hospitalization for vaso‐occlusive crisis (VOC) and occurs in approximately 50% of SCD patients. Besides the acute morbidity and mortality, chronically impaired lung function in patients with recurrent ACS is described. 2 A frequently used definition for ACS is "presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate on a chest X‐ray in combination with fever or respiratory symptoms in SCD patients". 1 Multiple factors have been demonstrated to contribute to the development of ACS, including pulmonary fat embolisms, bacterial/viral infections, thromboembolic disease and hypoventilation due to thoracic bone infarction or the use of narcotics, but in more than half of the patients the cause remains unclear. 2 Incentive spirometry is a non‐invasive approach to prevent hypoventilation and pulmonary complications by encouraging regular deep inspiration. Two studies have reported this method to be effective as primary prevention of the development of ACS in SCD children hospitalized for VOC. 3, 4 In the landmark study of Bellet et al. 3 an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 36.8% in favor of spirometry was found. Ahmad et al. 4 observed an ARR of 14.1%(CI 1%‐28%) by the use of spirometry in a subgroup at high risk for ACS. However, these studies were performed in pediatric patients and no studies have been performed in adult SCD patients so far despite the pathophysiological difference of ACS between these populations. 2

Sickle cell disease — evidence summary for PFT screening reports that there were few direct head-to-head comparisons of benefits and harms in children and adults with SCD who underwent screening PFT vs those who did not, and studies were examined for the following patient-important outcomes: pain, acute chest syndrome, mortality, and decline in lung function. In 2 studies that examined pain and PFT in children and adults with SCD (total n = 1442), pain rates were not significantly different in individuals who underwent PFT vs those who did not; in 3 studies that examined acute chest syndrome and PFT (total n = 1564), there was no consistent relationship between acute chest syndrome and either completion of PFT screening or findings on PFT.

### Extracorporeal life support for severe acute chest syndrome in adult sickle cell disease: a preliminary report [^1176TNZh]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Extracorporeal life support could be helpful for severe acute chest syndrome in adults sickle cell disease, because of the frequent hemodynamic compromise in this setting, including acute pulmonary vascular dysfunction and right ventricular failure. The aim of this study was to report the extracorporeal life support experience for severe acute chest syndrome in four referral centers in France.

Design

The primary endpoint of this multicentric retrospective study was ICU survival of patients with severe acute chest syndrome managed with extracorporeal life support. Secondary endpoints included comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors.

Setting

We performed this study between January 2009 and July 2017 in four referral centers in France.

Patients

We included adult patients (age > 18 yr) with sickle cell disease, admitted for severe acute chest syndrome and who required extracorporeal life support during the ICU stay.

Interventions

The study was observational.

Measurements and Main Results

Over the 8-year period, 22 patients with sickle cell disease required extracorporeal life support for severe acute chest syndrome, including 10 (45%) veno-venous and 12 (55%) veno-arterial extracorporeal life support. In-ICU mortality was high (73%). Nonsurvivors had a higher severity at extracorporeal life support implantation, as assessed by their Vasoactive-Inotrope Score and number of organ failures.

Conclusions

Our study shows that outcome is impaired in sickle cell disease patients receiving extracorporeal life support while in severe multiple organ failure. Further studies are needed to evaluate selection criteria in this setting.

Overall conclusions for HSCT in sickle cell disease — The use of HSCT for SCD is evolving, the evidence for all recommendations is of low or very low certainty due to lack of RCTs, universal end points, and direct comparative therapies, and the conditional nature of the recommendations results from short accumulated follow-up and reliance on noncomparative data; for example, matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT should be considered for all individuals at risk of neurologic injury or with recurrent vasoocclusive pain crises or a history of recurrent acute chest syndrome (ACS).

### Management of severe acute chest syndrome in a patient with a history of severe delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction [^117V32vi]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A case of a patient in her 30s with sickle cell anaemia who developed multiorgan failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) from acute chest syndrome (ACS) despite a simple red blood cell transfusion is presented in this report. She was treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) due to a history of severe delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction and a lack of available compatible units of packed red blood cells. Following one session of PLEX with half plasma/half albumin, she had rapid clinical improvement from mechanical ventilation to room air in 5days. This finding is consistent with existing case reports of rapid improvement in pain, oxygenation and organ function following PLEX. Proposed mechanisms include the modulation of rheological properties of red blood cells by plasma, as well as the removal of the cytotoxic effects of haptoglobin and haemopexin. This case demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of an alternative upfront approach to managing complications related to ACS in those who are heavily alloimmunised.

Alongside prevention, affordable, comprehensive, and timely health care should be made more accessible. Pain management for patients with sickle cell disease must be prioritised, with improved education for physiciansand policy action to correct the documented disparities in treatment for Black people. Blood transfusion therapy, parenteral analgesics, and disease-modifying drugs are effective at managing pain, reducing the incidence of acute chest syndrome, infections, malaria, and ultimately decreasing mortality. Particular attention should be focused on scaling the use of hydroxyurea (also known as hydroxycarbamide), which in a 2020 review, was missing from the list of national drug formularies in India and many countries of southeast Asia. Pioneering efforts, such as the government of Ghana's 2019 commitment to ensure free access to hydroxyurea for all patients with sickle cell disease through the National Health Insurance Scheme, might serve as a model for other countries.

Sickle cell disease — Doppler echocardiography for tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) measurement should be performed when patients are clinically stable and used for periodic surveillance. The TRV should be measured by Doppler echocardiography and should be performed when the patient is in a stable clinical state, defined as more than 4 weeks after hospitalization for acute chest syndrome (ACS) and more than 2 weeks after hospitalization for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) or a blood transfusion that is part of a chronic transfusion program, because TRV may be acutely and transiently increased during acute illness. The optimal frequency is unknown; longitudinal adult data indicate that 13% with a normal echocardiogram developed an elevated TRV after approximately 3 years of follow-up, and echocardiography every 1 to 3 years seems reasonable.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^1134ucao]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society (ATS) sickle cell lung disease workshop — scope and priorities emphasize that sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy associated with early mortality, that pulmonary-related morbidity remains a high burden across the lifespan, and that cardiopulmonary complications are a major risk factor for death; expanding knowledge of lung disease is crucial to improving patient outcomes and this report serves to disseminate findings to the medical community. To address these challenges and frame a research agenda, an expert panel identified key unanswered research questions in acute chest syndrome (ACS), lower airways disease and pulmonary function, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and hypoxemia, and pulmonary vascular complications in SCD.

### Acute chest syndrome in adult patients with sickle cell disease: the relationship with the time to onset after hospital admission [^116keNvm]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Data on acute chest syndrome (ACS) in adult sickle cell disease patients are scarce. In this study, we describe 105 consecutive ACS episodes in 81 adult patients during a 32-month period and compare the characteristics as a function of the time to onset after hospital admission for a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that is early-onset episodes (time to onset ≤ 24h, 42%) versus secondary episodes (> 24h, 58%; median [interquartile range] time to onset: 2 [2–3] days). The median age was 27 [22–34] years, 89% of the patients had an S/S or S/β 0 -thalassaemia genotype; 81% of the patients had a history of ACS (median: 3 [2–5] per patient), only 61% were taking a disease-modifying treatment at the time of the ACS. Fever and chest pain were noted in respectively 54% and 73% of the episodes. Crackles (64%) and bronchial breathing (32%) were the main abnormal auscultatory findings. A positive microbiological test was found for 20% of episodes. Fifty percent of the episodes required a blood transfusion; ICU transfer and mortality rates were respectively 29% and 1%. Secondary and early-onset forms of ACS did not differ significantly. Disease-modifying treatments should be revaluated after each ACS episode because the recurrence rate is high.

ACS severity and subtypes — Research question: Which criteria should be used to classify ACS as mild, moderate, or severe? The umbrella term ACS describes distinct phenotypes, with rapidly progressive ACS associated with multiorgan failure and death appearing distinct from milder ACS that improves with antibiotics and supportive care. A retrospective study of 173 children and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) found that, in adults, thrombocytopenia was the only predictor of rapidly progressive ACS. Additional biomarkers should be evaluated for potential prediction of ACS development and progression, and ACS phenotype severity classifications should be explicitly defined and categorized by acuity and severity and identifiable pathophysiology allowing for targeted therapies.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: recognition of sickle cell crises in the paediatric emergency department [^114YAiAr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Children with sickle cell disease can develop life-threatening and painful crises that require prompt assessment and efficient management by healthcare professionals in the emergency or acute care setting. Due to migration patterns and improved survival rates in high-prevalence countries, there is an increased tendency to encounter these patients across the UK. These factors warrant regular revisions in sickle cell crisis management, along with education for medical personnel and patients to improve clinical care and patient management. The focus of this article is on the initial assessment and management of acute paediatric sickle cell complications in the emergency setting. Specific case studies, including acute pain crises, trauma, splenic sequestration, aplastic crises, acute chest syndrome, infection, avascular necrosis, osteomyelitis and stroke, are discussed. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have also reviewed specific concerns around this patient group.

### Inhaled bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease [^1172NCaQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchodilators are used to treat bronchial hyper-responsiveness in asthma. Bronchial hyper-responsiveness may be a component of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease. Therefore, bronchodilators may be useful in the treatment of acute chest syndrome.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks associated with the use of bronchodilators in people with acute chest syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional searches were carried out on MEDLINE (1966 to 2002) and Embase (1981 to 2002). Date of the most recent search of the Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 17 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. Trials using quasi-randomisation methods will be included in future updates of this review if there is sufficient evidence that the treatment and control groups are similar at baseline.

Data Collection and Analysis

We found no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Main Results

We found no trials investigating the use of bronchodilators for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

If bronchial hyper-responsiveness is an important component of some episodes of acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease, the use of inhaled bronchodilators may be indicated. There is need for a well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trial to assess the benefits and risks of the addition of inhaled bronchodilators to established therapies for acute chest syndrome in people with sickle cell disease.

### Successful treatment of acute chest syndrome with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in pediatric patients [^112DzfvC]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Severe acute chest syndrome afflicts patients with sickle cell disease and can cause hypoxemia refractory to conventional treatments. Obstructive mucus plugging and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome may underlie the pathophysiology of refractory hypoxemia in acute chest syndrome. Although high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) is well established in the treatment of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, there is no support in the literature for its role in managing hypoxemia in acute chest syndrome. In disease processes with high airways resistance and obstructive mucus plugging, HFOV may predispose to air-trapping and increased morbidity secondary to air leak syndromes. We report the first successful HFOV management of pediatric patients suffering from severe acute chest syndrome and hypoxic respiratory failure. These cases suggest that HFOV should be strongly considered for patients with severe acute chest syndrome that is refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation.

INTRODUCTION

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic, debilitating haematological disorder that arises from a point mutation in the β‐globin gene. This mutation produces an abnormal form of haemoglobin (i.e. haemoglobin S, HbS), which polymerizes under low oxygen conditions, resulting in 'sickled' red blood cells (RBCs). The pathophysiology of SCD is a complex interplay of chronic haemolysis, thrombosis, vascular occlusion and systemic inflammation. SCD is a systemic disorder whereby all organs may be affected. Notable acute and chronic sequelae include vaso‐occlusive crises, anaemia, acute chest syndrome (ACS), ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, renal injury, chronic pain, pulmonary hypertension and cardiac failure. Some of the therapies in use to manage SCD (e.g. blood transfusion) also pose risks (e.g. alloimmunization, hyperhaemolysis, haemosiderosis/iron overload, infections) to patients.

The highest burden of SCD is still encountered in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), most of which have limited resources to contend with the disease. In 2021 alone, an estimated 7.7 million people were living with SCD worldwide, and 515 000 babies were born with SCD, most (~80%) of whom were in sub‐Saharan Africa, particularly Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

There is a marked divide between care for individuals with SCD in high‐income countries (HICs) versus LMICs. The care of individuals with SCD has improved substantially in HICs, where over 90% of children with SCD now survive into adulthood. Interventions that have contributed favourably to improvements in outcomes include newborn haemoglobinopathy screening, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, penicillin prophylaxis, immunization programs, access to a safe and sufficient blood supply and hydroxyurea therapy. By contrast, LMICs lag far behind. Indeed, 50%–90% of children with SCD in LMICs die before their fifth birthday.

### The acute chest syndrome in Cameroonian children living with sickle cell disease [^117T4xJD]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Besides, we observed that radiological abnormalities of the lower lobes (90.5%) were the prevailing ones, mirroring previous findings. Contrariwise, other studies showed that the main radiological localizations of ACS were the upper lobes in children, and the lower ones in adults. While the upper lobes predominance has been associated with an infectious etiology especially in children, the lower or multi-lobes predominance has been linked to pulmonary thrombosis and fat embolism or rib infarction. Our results are therefore suggestive that the pathogenesis of ACS in our setting is also multifactorial. Further well-designed studies with large sample sizes are warranted to better elucidate the etiology of ACS in our setting.

In line with the literature, our management of ACS included broad-spectrum antibiotherapy, hydration, analgesics, supplemental oxygen and transfusion, but none of these supportive care impacted the duration of hospital stay. Actually, only patients presenting respiratory distress were placed on oxygen, mainly due to limitation of resources. Likewise, we transfused only SCD patients who had a hemoglobin level ≤ 7 g/dl given that blood safety remains an issue of major concern in the milieu. Although transfusion did not reduce the hospital stay, it significantly increased the hemoglobin level (p = 0.039), perhaps improving therefore the clinical state of our patients. Early transfusion of SCD patients presenting with ACS should be encouraged in SSA settings, especially transfusion of packed red blood cells instead of whole blood to reduce transfusion-related adverse reactions, despite recurrent blood shortages that occur in the region. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to underpin this suggestion with robust scientific evidence and indicate which threshold should be considered to transfuse SCD children suffering from ACS.

### Evidence-based obstetric management of women with sickle cell disease in low-income countries [^111P3DAV]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) is fraught with complications, some of which are life-threatening. Managing pregnancy in these women can be challenging, especially with poor resources, which is often the case in low-income countries. In Nigeria, for instance, up to 90% of patients pay out of pocket for medical care due to the poorly developed health insurance system, and this worsens the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. We describe a pragmatic approach to routinely managing pregnant women with SCD in the antenatal period, showing the feasibility of effective management of these high-risk pregnancies in limited-resource settings. We also present the case of a pregnant Nigerian woman with SCD who has intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and acute chest syndrome (ACS), conditions that are life-threatening for the fetus and the mother, respectively, and require prompt intervention. We highlight how we successfully managed this woman in a cost-effective manner by employing relatively inexpensive tests for diagnosis and treating her effectively with oxygen, appropriate antibiotics and manual exchange blood transfusion for the ACS, and finger pulse oximeters to monitor oxygen saturation. We explore pathophysiological concepts to IUGR in women with SCD and briefly discuss the appropriate mode of delivery, including the options for pain relief in labor.

### Red cell exchange in sickle cell disease [^112tWgY8]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Red cell exchange transfusions remain an effective but possibly underutilized therapy in the acute and chronic treatment of sickle cell disease. In sickle cell disease, increased blood viscosity can cause complications when the hemoglobin exceeds 10 g/dL even if this is due to simple transfusion. Red cell exchange can provide needed oxygen carrying capacity while reducing the overall viscosity of blood. Acute red cell exchange is useful in acute infarctive stroke, in acute chest and the multi-organ failure syndromes, the right upper quadrant syndrome, and possibly priapism. Neither simple or exchange transfusions are likely to hasten resolution of an acute pain episode.

### Identifying clinical and research priorities in sickle cell lung disease. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^113EdLXJ]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2019). High credibility.

Primary and secondary prevention of ACS — Research question: Which patients are at increased risk for ACS and may benefit from primary or secondary prevention? ACS often occurs 1 to 3 days after hospital admission for vaso-occlusive events (VOEs), though it can present independently of a painful episode. Hydroxyurea, l-glutamine, and chronic transfusions decrease ACS frequency but do not prevent all episodes. Some clinicians use early blood transfusion or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in patients at high risk for ACS, and the ideal timing and type of transfusion and the efficacy of NIV to decrease progression should be tested in intervention trials. Systemic steroids may reduce the severity and/or duration of an ACS episode, but some studies and anecdotal observations suggest an increased risk of rehospitalization for a VOE. Pharmacologic prevention strategies, including inhaled corticosteroids and novel medications such as crizanlizumab, should be evaluated in large randomized trials; agents targeting erythrocyte sickling, hemolysis, fat embolism, and thrombosis should be investigated. Preventive measures against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as low–tidal–volume ventilation, should be evaluated as preventive measures for ACS in patients with SCD.

### Rapidly progressive acute chest syndrome in individuals with sickle cell anemia: a distinct acute chest syndrome phenotype [^112FoKFP]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Current definitions of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in sickle cell anemia (SCA) do not account for rapid progression of respiratory compromise. In this two-center retrospective cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that in children and adults with ACS and respiratory failure (≤ 24 hours after onset of respiratory symptoms) have a distinct ACS phenotype associated with multiorgan failure when compared to those with ACS that have a more subacute and protracted course. We identified 173 individuals (97 children < 20 years and 76 adults ≥ 20 years) with SCA and at least one episode of ACS. Only one ACS episode was considered per individual. Rapidly progressive ACS occurred in 21% (n = 16) of adults, but only 2.1% (n = 2) of children. Compared to adults without rapidly progressive ACS, adults with rapidly progressive ACS more frequently developed acute kidney injury (68.8% vs. 3.3%, P < 0.001), hepatic dysfunction (75.0% vs. 15.0%, P < 0.001), altered mental status (43.8% vs. 11.7%, P < 0.001), multiorgan failure (93.8% vs. 10%, P < 0.001), and death (6.3% vs. 0%, P = 0.05). Clinical and laboratory covariates that were evaluable on the first day of respiratory symptoms were evaluated to identify predictors of rapidly progressive ACS. On multivariable analysis, decline in platelet count at presentation was the only predictor of rapidly progressive ACS [odds ratio 4.82 (95% CI 1.20–19.39), P = 0.027]. In conclusion, rapidly progressive ACS is a distinct phenotype that occurs more frequently in adults, is preceded by thrombocytopenia, and is associated with multiorgan failure. Am. J.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder with a complex pathophysiology largely driven by vaso‐occlusion and hemolytic anemia. Patients with SCD may experience a range of symptoms and complications, including acute chest syndrome, infections, pulmonary hypertension, stroke, and painful vaso‐occlusive crises (VOCs).VOCs are the hallmark of SCD and the leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalization, and are associated with a significantly elevated risk of life‐threatening organ damage and death.

Newborn screening programs for SCD are standard practice in many high‐income (HI) countries, including the United States, but are limited or non‐existent in many low‐ to middle‐income (LMI) countries. Therefore, the exact global prevalence of SCD is unknown. However, approximately, 300 000 infants are born each year with homozygous SCD (HbSS), with an estimated two‐thirds of these being in Africa. There is substantial disparity in life expectancy between HI (e.g. 54 years in the United States) and LMI countries (e.g. estimated at < 20 years across Africa). This is largely due to differential access to newborn screening programs and disparities in accessibility and availability of healthcare resources and treatments (particularly prophylactic antibiotics and hydroxyurea [HU]).

The international Sickle Cell World Assessment Survey (SWAY) was a cross‐sectional questionnaire that aimed to better inform the management and treatment of SCD, and support global healthcare policy and delivery, by collecting real‐world insights into the impact of SCD on patients' daily lives and the treatment they receive. The high impact of SCD on patients' lives previously reported by the SWAY investigatorsis consistent with multiple other studies, although these studies focus on restricted populations, including single countries, single regions/centers, and/or specific age groups. In contrast, SWAY included patients from different countries, socioeconomic backgrounds, ages, and genotypes.

The primary analysis of SWAY demonstrated that the unmet needs in SCD care and management differ substantially between HI and LMI countries. The aim of the current analysis was to compare data obtained from the United States with that from other HI and LMI countries, highlighting any differences in the reported disease burden, treatment utilization, and impact of SCD on education and employment.

### Sickle cell pain: a critical reappraisal [^113qP8ES]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Sickle cell pain includes 3 types: acute recurrent painful crises, chronic pain syndromes, and neuropathic pain. The acute painful crisis is the hallmark of the disease and the most common cause of hospitalization and treatment in the emergency department. It evolves through 4 phases: prodromal, initial, established, and resolving. Each acute painful episode is associated with inflammation that worsens with recurrent episodes, often culminating in serious complications and organ damage, such as acute chest syndrome, multiorgan failure, and sudden death. Three pathophysiologic events operate in unison during the prodromal phase of the crisis: vaso-occlusion, inflammation, and nociception. Aborting the acute painful episode at the prodromal phase could potentially prevent or minimize tissue damage. Our hypothesis is that managing these events with hydration, anti-inflammatory drugs, aggressive analgesia, and possibly vasodilators could abort the crisis and prevent or minimize further damage. Chronic pain syndromes are associated with or accompany avascular necrosis and leg ulcers. Neuropathic pain is not well studied in patients with sickle cell disease but has been modeled in the transgenic sickle mouse. Management of sickle cell pain should be based on its own pathophysiologic mechanisms rather than borrowing guidelines from other nonsickle pain syndromes.

### Association of guideline-adherent antibiotic treatment with readmission of children with sickle cell disease hospitalized with acute chest syndrome [^113y1ns3]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a common, serious complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) and a leading cause of hospitalization and death in both children and adults with SCD. Little is known about the effectiveness of guideline-recommended antibiotic regimens for the care of children hospitalized with ACS.

Objectives

To use a large, national database to describe patterns of antibiotic use for children with SCD hospitalized for ACS and to determine whether receipt of guideline-adherent antibiotics was associated with lower readmission rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cohort study including 14 480 hospitalizations in 7178 children (age 0–22 years) with a discharge diagnosis of SCD and either ACS or pneumonia. Information was obtained from 41 children's hospitals submitting data to the Pediatric Health Information System from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016.

Exposures

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute guideline-adherent (macrolidewithparenteral cephalosporin) vs non-guideline-adherent antibiotic regimens.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Acute chest syndrome-related and all-cause 7- and 30-day readmissions.

Results

Of the 14 480 hospitalizations, 6562 (45.3%) were in girls; median (interquartile range) age was 9 (4–14) years. Guideline-adherent antibiotics were provided in 10 654 of 14 480 hospitalizations for ACS (73.6%). Hospitalizations were most likely to include guideline-adherent antibiotics for children aged 5 to 9 years (3230 of 4047 [79.8%]) and declined to the lowest level for children 19 to 22 years (697 of 1088 [64.1%]). Between-hospital variation in antibiotic regimens was wide, with use of guideline-adherent antibiotics ranging from 24% to 90%. Children treated with guideline-adherent antibiotics had lower 30-day ACS-related (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.50–1.00) and all-cause (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39–0.64) readmission rates vs children who received other regimens (cephalosporin and macrolide vs neither drug class).

Conclusions and Relevance

Current approaches to antibiotic treatment in children with ACS vary widely, but guideline-adherent therapy appears to result in fewer readmissions compared with non-guideline-adherent therapy. Efforts to increase the dissemination and implementation of SCD treatment guidelines are warranted as is comparative effectiveness research to strengthen the underlying evidence base.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^114zQLW9]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Benefits of hydroxyurea

Another treatment paradigm for acute painful crisis has been the use of hydroxyurea. For several years now, it has been observed that the clinical trajectory of sickle cell patients can be ameliorated by this cytotoxic drug. The clinical improvement in some of the patients is thought to be related to its induction of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) production. However, its possible mechanisms of action have further been explored, and these include reduction of red blood cell adhesion receptor expression in young SCD subjects and in vitro induction of changes in endothelial cells, affecting the degree of adherence of different blood cells, as well as modulating the determinants of intercellular and endothelial adhesion such as soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and myeloperoxidase levels. Decreasing sVCAM-1 and myeloperoxidase levels suggests a reduction in the erythrocyte–endothelial interactions and in neutrophil activity, respectively; the latter outcome may help to reduce the propagation phase of a vaso-occlusive crisis. Other proven mechanisms of action of hydroxyurea include its reduction of hypercoagulability markers in SCD such as von Willebrand's factor and factor VIII, as well as nitric oxide (NO) depletion, which occurs in disease-associated hemolytic anemia. In SCD pathology, hemolytic anemia is associated with decreased bioavailability of NO, which results in the impairment of vasodilation among other effects. Although findings from the study of hydroxyurea in SCD indicate its beneficial effects in shortening the duration of crisis-related admissions and reducing the net dose of opioids, there have been concerns about its safety profile in pediatric sickle cell patients. Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence to support its use in patients as young as 9 months, given its reported ability to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome with little or no adverse reactions. In fact, results from a protocol suggest minimal genotoxicity or carcinogenicity with long-term hydroxyurea exposure. A recent review further lends credence to its safety and efficacy in both pediatric and adult patients as there was no reported increase in the incidence of leukemia and teratogenicity. In a longitudinal study of a cohort of sickle cell children in the United States, a group of researchers compared the number of vaso-occlusive pain episodes (including acute chest syndrome/pneumonia episodes) and treatment expenditure in those treated with hydroxyurea and those not treated with it, during a period of 2–3 years. Remarkably, treatment with hydroxyurea was associated with a significant reduction in vaso-occlusive pain episodes, hospital admissions, and cumulative expenditure for care. A multicenter study among adult patients also reported that hydroxyurea usage resulted in significant reduction in daily patient-rated pain intensity, analgesic use, and utilization, findings that are in tandem with previously documented reports about its ameliorating effects on vaso-occlusive crisis. Better still, the extent of pain relief in these patients was found to be directly correlated with the size of Hb F therapeutic response to hydroxyurea. More importantly, some authors have advocated that an increased utilization of hydroxyurea by pediatric and adult patients would most likely reduce their emergency-department visits for pain management.

### Evidence review of hydroxyurea for the prevention of sickle cell complications in low-income countries [^111AcZi1]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea is widely used in high-income countries for the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) in children. In Kenyan clinical guidelines, hydroxyurea is only recommended for adults with SCD. Yet many deaths from SCD occur in early childhood, deaths that might be prevented by an effective, disease modifying intervention. The aim of this review was to summarise the available evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of hydroxyurea in the management of SCD in children below 5 years of age to support guideline development in Kenya. We undertook a systematic review and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system to appraise the quality of identified evidence. Overall, available evidence from 1 systematic review (n = 26 studies), 2 randomised controlled trials (n = 354 children), 14 observational studies and 2 National Institute of Health reports suggest that hydroxyurea may be associated with improved fetal haemoglobin levels, reduced rates of hospitalisation, reduced episodes of acute chest syndrome and decreased frequency of pain events in children with SCD. However, it is associated with adverse events (eg, neutropenia) when high to maximum tolerated doses are used. Evidence is lacking on whether hydroxyurea improves survival if given to young children. Majority of the included studies were of low quality and mainly from high-income countries. Overall, available limited evidence suggests that hydroxyurea may improve morbidity and haematological outcomes in SCD in children aged below 5 years and appears safe in settings able to provide consistent haematological monitoring.

### A simplified hydroxyurea dosing approach for paediatric sickle cell anaemia in nigeria: addressing emergency care burden and adherence barriers in low-resource settings [^112Nqi8x]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a hereditary haematological disorder predominantly affecting individuals of African descent, with significant global health implications. It is characterized by the production of sickle-shaped erythrocytes, leading to recurrent vaso-occlusive crises and complications such as acute chest syndrome, stroke, and increased susceptibility to infections. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden of this disease, with Nigeria accounting for nearly 150,000 births annually. Despite advances in the understanding and management of SCA, children in resource-limited settings continue to experience high morbidity and mortality due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited access to effective therapies.

Hydroxyurea (also known as hydroxycarbamide) is an oral medication that has become a cornerstone of SCA management. Hydroxyurea increases foetal haemoglobin production, which in turn inhibits the polymerization of sickle haemoglobin and reduces red cell sickling. Numerous clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that hydroxyurea therapy significantly decreases the frequency of painful crises, hospitalizations, and the need for blood transfusions in SCA patients. Its efficacy in improving quality of life and overall survival has led to recommendations for its use as a standard of care for SCA, including endorsement by the World Health Organization (WHO).

However, the uptake of hydroxyurea in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been limited by multiple challenges. Key barriers include the high cost of the medication, the requirement for regular laboratory monitoring, and persistent misconceptions or lack of knowledge about the drug's safety among some healthcare providers and caregivers. In sub-Saharan Africa, these issues are compounded by constrained healthcare resources and socio-economic difficulties faced by families. Moreover, treatment adherence remains a significant concern in chronic diseases like SCA, particularly in resource-limited settings where factors such as medication cost, complex dosing regimens, and inadequate patient education can negatively impact compliance.

To address these challenges, our tertiary hospital in Southeast Nigeria implemented a simplified dosing regimen for hydroxyurea for paediatric patients with sickle cell anaemia. The goal of this simplified dosing strategy was to balance the proven clinical benefits of hydroxyurea with the practical constraints of a resource-limited setting. By administering a uniform regimen (20 mg/kg per day, capped at 500 mg for older children above a certain weight), we hypothesized that we could achieve meaningful reductions in SCA complications while minimizing the need for frequent laboratory tests. This simplification was expected to reduce the financial burden on families and improve treatment adherence through an easier, one-size-fits-all dosing approach.

### Acute pain episodes, acute chest syndrome, and pulmonary thromboembolism in pregnancy [^116YuMCm]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening condition. In both high- and low-income countries, there is an 11-fold increased risk of maternal death and a 4-fold increased risk of perinatal death. We highlight the epidemiology of SCD-specific and obstetric complications commonly seen during pregnancy in SCD and propose definitions for acute pain and acute chest syndrome (ACS) episodes during pregnancy. We conducted a systematic review of the recent obstetric and hematology literature using full research articles published within the last 5 years that reported outcomes in pregnant women with SCD. The prevalence of acute pain episodes during pregnancy ranged between 4% and 75%. The prevalence of ACS episodes during pregnancy ranged between 4% and 13%. The estimated prevalence of pulmonary thromboembolism in women with SCD during pregnancy is approximately 0.5 to 1%. ACS is the most common cause of death and is often preceded by acute pain episodes. The most crucial time to develop these complications in pregnancy is during the third trimester and postpartum period. In a pooled analysis from studies in low- and middle-income settings, maternal death in women with SCD is approximately 2393 and 4300 deaths per 100 000 live births with and without multidisciplinary care, respectively. In comparison, in the US and northern Europe, the general maternal mortality rate is approximately 23.8 and 8 deaths per 100 000 live births, respectively. A multidisciplinary SCD obstetrics care approach reduces maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries.

### SNAP: supportive noninvasive ventilation for acute chest syndrome prevention in children with sickle cell disease [^114f58s1]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children with sickle cell disease (SCD). Preventing hypoxemia by optimizing lung aeration during sleep remains a challenge.

Objectives

To explore safety, feasibility, and tolerability of noninvasive, bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) as preventative, supportive care for hospitalized, medically stable children with SCD on a general pediatric inpatient unit.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients ≤ 22 years of age with SCD admitted to the general pediatric inpatient unit from February 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 for whom BiPAP was recommended as supportive care. Hospitalizations were excluded if patients were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), required BiPAP for respiratory failure, or used BiPAP at home for obstructive sleep apnea.

Results

Twenty-three patients had 53 hospitalizations in which BiPAP was recommended. Fifty-two (98%) hospitalizations included acute SCD pain. Indications for BiPAP included prior ACS (94%), chest or back pain (79%), and/or oxygen desaturation (66%). On 17 occasions, patients already had mild to moderate ACS but were stable when BiPAP was recommended. BiPAP was used successfully during 75% of hospitalizations for a median of two nights. There were no adverse effects associated with BiPAP. PICU transfer for respiratory support occurred during three hospitalizations. In 26 hospitalizations of children at risk for ACS who tolerated BiPAP, 23 (88%) did not develop ACS.

Conclusions

BiPAP is safe, feasible, and well tolerated as supportive care for hospitalized children with SCD. Next steps include an intervention trial to further assess the efficacy of BiPAP on ACS prevention.

### Outcomes and survival prediction in adults with sickle cell disease treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^112NhfgP]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomally inherited hemoglobinopathy that results in polymerization of mutant hemoglobin when intravascular oxygen tension is low, leading to altered red cell rheology, hemolysis, and microcirculatory vaso-occlusion. For patients with SCD, cardiopulmonary complications such as pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and acute chest syndrome (ACS) occur at higher frequency and are major risk factors for death. With improvements in technology and the growth of capable centers, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is being progressively used in the management of cardiopulmonary failure when conventional treatment is insufficient. As use expands, there is a critical need to further understand the role of ECMO in unique populations such as those with SCD for whom support may increasingly be considered. Given the pathophysiology of SCD, hematologic aberrancies and disease-specific sequelae have the potential to add significant complexity to ECMO-related decision-making and management. Unfortunately, data on ECMO use for respiratory and cardiac insufficiency in adult patients with SCD undergoing either venovenous (VV) or venoarterial (VA) ECMO support are very limited, leaving little guidance on the optimal approach in these individuals. We hypothesized that adult patients with SCD may have high mortality on ECMO and those who do not survive VA or VV ECMO are more likely to experience bleeding and thrombotic events (BTEs) than those who survive. To better understand the use of ECMO in adult patients of any age with SCD, we queried the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) registry to characterize SCD cohorts that were treated with VV or VA ECMO, investigate ECMO-related outcomes, and identify clinical factors that may be predictive of survival in this population.

Acute Chest Syndrome Acute chest syndrome is a life-threatening complication in people living with SCD that can result in lung injury, breathing difficulty, and low oxygen to the rest of the body. ACS may occur when sickled cells block blood and oxygen from reaching the lungs or may be caused by a viral or bacterial infection. In children, ACS is usually caused by an infection. ACS is a medical emergency and should be treated in the hospital right away. Signs and symptoms are similar to pneumonia and can include:

- Chest pain
- Coughing
- Difficulty breathing
- Fever Other Resources. A PE can occur without any symptoms of a DVT.

Signs and symptoms of PE can include:

- Difficulty breathing
- Faster than normal or irregular heartbeat
- Chest pain or discomfort that worsens with a deep breath or cough
- Cough or coughing up blood
- Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting If you have any of these symptoms, seek medical help immediately. CDC Resources to Learn More Other Resources. Fever A fever may be the first sign of an infection or other SCD-related complication, such as acute chest syndrome, that can be life-threatening. For infants and children with SCD, a fever may be the only sign of an infection. It's important for people with SCD to go to the emergency department or hospital for a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38. 5 Celsius or greater. CDC Resources to Learn More Other Resources.

Pulmonary Hypertension People with SCD are at greater risk than the general population for high blood pressure in the lungs, which can be life-threatening. Some signs and symptoms of high blood pressure in the lungs can include:
