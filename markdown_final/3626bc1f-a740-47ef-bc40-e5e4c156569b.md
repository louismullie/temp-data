## Question

why does tips increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why TIPS increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy and how to explain the mechanism and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis. Then, I should verify exactly what TIPS does anatomically and hemodynamically. Next, I will examine how TIPS alters portal flow and detoxification, consider the role of ammonia versus other neurotoxins, and quantify the magnitude of risk. After that, I should review patient- and procedure-related risk modifiers, including shunt size and flow, and finally synthesize the mechanism and translate it into practical clinical implications for prevention and management.

> Let me first confirm the baseline pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhosis. HE arises when the failing liver cannot adequately clear gut-derived neurotoxins, especially ammonia, allowing them to enter the systemic circulation and provoke cerebral dysfunction; this is amplified by portosystemic collaterals that already bypass hepatocyte processing, so the brain is exposed to higher toxin loads even before any shunt is placed [^113vhuFC] [^113AvsL7].

> I need to check precisely what TIPS does. TIPS creates a non-physiologic, high-caliber intrahepatic channel from the portal vein to a hepatic vein, intentionally diverting a variable fraction of portal blood around the hepatic parenchyma to decompress portal hypertension; this is a controlled portosystemic shunt superimposed on the existing collaterals in cirrhosis [^113AvsL7] [^115PnEHK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the hemodynamic consequences. By design, TIPS lowers portal pressure but simultaneously reduces effective hepatic perfusion, decreasing hepatocyte exposure to portal blood and its toxins; the degree of shunting correlates with the fraction of portal flow that bypasses the liver, and higher shunt flow has been directly linked to more severe encephalopathy in observational studies, reinforcing the dose-response concept of overshunting [^113AvsL7] [^112hgRAv] [^117WdqFV].

> Next, I should review the toxin burden beyond ammonia. Wait, let me verify whether ammonia alone explains this. While hyperammonemia remains central, TIPS-related HE often occurs without a tight correlation to ammonia levels, suggesting other neurotoxins contribute; untargeted metabolomics shows that bile acids and other microbial metabolites fluctuate post-TIPS, and patients with larger shifts in hepatic vein metabolites — particularly bile acids — appear more prone to HE, implying that pre-existing intrahepatic shunting and the magnitude of post-TIPS metabolomic change modulate risk [^113AvsL7] [^115rEghq] [^117AvwJf].

> I should double-check the magnitude of risk. Contemporary series estimate overt HE after TIPS in roughly 30–50% of patients within the first year, with most episodes clustering early; importantly, while episodic post-TIPS HE may not independently increase mortality in some cohorts, severe or refractory HE carries substantial morbidity and quality-of-life impact, and a small subset requires shunt modification [^113AvsL7] [^111871mo] [^114LiSkQ].

> Let me consider patient-related risk modifiers. Older age, diabetes, prior HE, and more advanced liver dysfunction (higher MELD or Child-Pugh) consistently associate with higher HE risk; diabetes likely worsens ammonia handling and systemic inflammation, and covert HE detected by neurophysiologic testing predicts overt episodes after TIPS, supporting careful pre-procedural neurocognitive screening in elective cases [^112dkCQZ] [^112kqVRy] [^115Jtkdt].

> I will now examine procedure-related factors. Larger-diameter stents and higher calculated shunt flow increase HE risk; a randomized trial showed 8-mm stents had significantly more overt HE than 6-mm stents despite similar survival, and multiple series identify shunt size greater than 8 mm as a predictor of refractory HE; pre-existing spontaneous portosystemic shunts further amplify bypass flow, and concomitant embolization of large SPSS at the time of TIPS reduces post-TIPS HE in pooled analyses [^112aeNyL] [^111sbiQW] [^111zSypw].

> But wait, what if the stent position matters as well. Intraprocedural portography can reveal dominant splanchnic inflow patterns; puncturing toward the portal branch that minimizes diversion of highly proteinaceous, ammonia-rich inflow may theoretically reduce HE risk, though this remains an area of evolving evidence and institutional practice variation [^11773xJ6].

> Let me synthesize the mechanism to ensure internal consistency. TIPS increases HE risk by creating a calibrated portosystemic bypass that reduces hepatic clearance of gut-derived neurotoxins, with the severity of encephalopathy tracking with the fraction of portal flow diverted and the patient's baseline vulnerability to neurotoxin exposure; beyond ammonia, bile acids and other microbial metabolites likely contribute, and patients with minimal pre-TIPS intrahepatic shunting exhibit larger post-TIPS metabolomic shifts and higher HE risk, consistent with a threshold effect for neurotoxin exposure [^113AvsL7] [^115rEghq] [^111vKbmL].

> I should confirm the clinical implications for prevention and management. Prophylactic lactulose alone has not reliably prevented early post-TIPS HE in older trials, but a randomized study showed rifaximin reduced overt HE after TIPS, suggesting a role for targeted gut microbiome modulation; in refractory cases, endovascular flow reduction or partial occlusion can restore hepatic perfusion and improve HE, though survival remains limited without transplant candidacy, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and shunt sizing up front [^111sbiQW] [^112mxmsb] [^114LiSkQ] [^1155cNAH].

> In summary, I need to ensure the causal chain is explicit: TIPS lowers portal pressure by diverting portal blood around the liver, which proportionally decreases hepatic detoxification of neurotoxins; the resulting increase in systemic exposure to ammonia and other microbial metabolites precipitates or worsens encephalopathy, with risk modulated by shunt diameter and flow, baseline liver function, and patient factors such as age and diabetes; recognizing this, strategies that limit overshunting, optimize selection, and proactively manage neurotoxins can mitigate — but not eliminate — post-TIPS HE [^113AvsL7] [^112aeNyL] [^112mxmsb].

TIPS increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) by creating a **portosystemic shunt** that bypasses the liver, allowing gut-derived neurotoxins — especially ammonia — to reach the brain [^113AvsL7]. This bypass **reduces hepatic clearance** of toxins and worsens the existing portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis [^1153rpGj]. The risk is higher with larger shunt diameters, lower post-TIPS portosystemic gradients, and in patients with advanced liver disease, diabetes, or prior HE [^112aeNyL] [^1155cNAH] [^112dkCQZ]. Management includes medical therapy (lactulose, rifaximin), dietary protein moderation, and, for refractory cases, shunt narrowing or occlusion [^111sbiQW] [^114LiSkQ].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Portosystemic shunting and reduced hepatic clearance

Normally, the liver clears gut-derived toxins — especially ammonia — before they reach systemic circulation. TIPS creates a direct portal-to-systemic shunt that **bypasses hepatocyte clearance**, increasing systemic toxin exposure and precipitating HE [^113AvsL7].

---

### Ammonia and other neurotoxins

Ammonia is a key neurotoxin in HE; TIPS increases systemic ammonia by bypassing hepatic clearance, and additional neurotoxins (e.g. short-chain fatty acids, mercaptans) may also contribute [^113AvsL7].

---

### Cerebral effects of ammonia

Ammonia crosses the blood–brain barrier and disrupts astrocyte function, causing cerebral edema and neuroinflammation that manifest as cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and neuromuscular dysfunction [^114SR1cW].

---

## Clinical evidence of increased HE risk after TIPS

- **Incidence**: HE occurs in 10–50% of patients within 1 year after TIPS, with most episodes in the first 3 months [^113vhuFC] [^113AvsL7].
- **Severity**: TIPS-related HE ranges from mild cognitive impairment to severe encephalopathy requiring hospitalization [^113AvsL7] [^112FZQH8].
- **Persistence**: About 3–7% develop refractory HE despite medical therapy [^114LiSkQ].

---

## Factors influencing HE risk after TIPS

Several factors influence **post-TIPS HE risk**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on he risk** |
|-|-|
| Shunt diameter | Larger diameters (> 8 mm) increase HE risk by allowing greater portosystemic shunting [^112aeNyL] [^1155cNAH] |
| Post-TIPS portosystemic gradient | Lower gradients (< 12 mmHg) are associated with higher HE risk [^111sbiQW] |
| Patient-related factors | - Advanced liver disease (high MELD/Child-Pugh) <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Prior HE <br/> - Older age increase risk [^112dkCQZ] [^112kqVRy] |

---

## Management strategies for TIPS-related HE

### Medical management

Medical management centers on **lactulose** to reduce ammonia absorption and **rifaximin** to decrease ammonia-producing bacteria; together they reduce HE episodes and improve quality of life [^112mxmsb].

---

### Dietary modifications

Dietary modifications include **moderate protein restriction** to ~1.2 g/kg/day to limit ammonia production while preventing malnutrition.

---

### Interventional management

Interventional options include **shunt narrowing** with balloon-expandable stents or reduction stents to increase hepatic perfusion and reduce encephalopathy, and **shunt occlusion** for refractory cases when narrowing is insufficient [^114LiSkQ] [^1176QELs].

---

## Preventive measures and patient selection

Preventive strategies and careful selection can mitigate HE risk: use **smaller-diameter stents (6–8 mm)** to balance decompression and encephalopathy risk, and reserve TIPS for patients with preserved hepatic reserve and no prior HE. Pre-TIPS screening for minimal HE and optimization of liver function further reduce risk [^112aeNyL] [^116NrUmS] [^115Jtkdt].

---

TIPS increases HE risk by bypassing hepatic clearance of neurotoxins, especially ammonia. Risk is modulated by shunt size, gradient, and patient factors; management includes medical therapy, dietary changes, and, for refractory cases, shunt modification, with prevention through careful patient selection and stent sizing.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a challenging complication after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. Despite recent advances, much is still uncertain regarding risk factors, preventative measures, and the management of HE after TIPS placement. Appropriate patient selection and pre-procedural risk stratification remain areas of focus. In this manuscript, we discuss the current state of research related to HE after TIPS placement, including information regarding risk stratification, complication prevention, and treatment options.

### Surgical portosystemic shunts versus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhosis [^113a1vS8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Variceal haemorrhage that is refractory or recurs after pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy requires a portal decompression shunt (either surgical shunts or radiologic shunt, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)). TIPS has become the shunt of choice; however, is it the preferred option? This review assesses evidence for the comparisons of surgical portosystemic shunts versus TIPS for variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of surgical portosystemic shunts versus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for treatment of refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. We also searched on-line trial registries, reference lists of relevant articles, and proceedings of relevant associations for trials that met the inclusion criteria for this review (date of search 8 March 2018).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing surgical portosystemic shunts versus TIPS for the treatment of refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials and extracted data using methodological standards expected by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias according to domains and risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We found four randomised clinical trials including 496 adult participants diagnosed with variceal haemorrhage due to cirrhotic portal hypertension. The overall risk of bias in all the trials was judged at high risk. All the trials were conducted in the United States of America (USA). Two of the trials randomised participants to selective surgical shunts versus TIPS. The other two trials randomised participants to non-selective surgical shunts versus TIPS. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was by clinical and laboratory findings. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in all-cause mortality at 30 days between surgical portosystemic shunts compared with TIPS (risk ratio (RR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.99; participants = 496; studies = 4). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in encephalopathy between surgical shunts compared with TIPS (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.16; participants = 496; studies = 4). We found evidence suggesting an increase in the occurrence of the following harms in the TIPS group compared with surgical shunts: all-cause mortality at five years (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.90; participants = 496; studies = 4); variceal rebleeding (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; participants = 496; studies = 4); reinterventions (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28; participants = 496; studies = 4); and shunt occlusion (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.51; participants = 496; studies = 4). We could not perform an analysis of health-related quality of life but available evidence appear to suggest improved health-related quality of life in people who received surgical shunt compared with TIPS. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all-cause mortality at 30 days and five years, irreversible shunt occlusion, and encephalopathy to very low because of high risk of bias (due to lack of blinding); inconsistency (due to heterogeneity); imprecision (due to small sample sizes of the individual trials and few events); and publication bias (few trials reporting outcomes). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for variceal rebleeding and reintervention to very low because of high risk of bias (due to lack of blinding); imprecision (due to small sample sizes of the individual trials and few events); and publication bias (few trials reporting outcomes). The small sample sizes and few events did not allow us to produce meaningful trial sequential monitoring boundaries, suggesting plausible random errors in our estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

We found evidence suggesting that surgical portosystemic shunts may have benefit over TIPS for treatment of refractory or recurrent variceal haemorrhage in people with cirrhotic portal hypertension. Given the very low-certainty of the available evidence and risks of random errors in our analyses, we have very little confidence in our review findings.

### The role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in patients with cirrhosis and ascites: recent evolution and open questions [^113hsTPy]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In selected patients with cirrhosis and ascites, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement improves control of ascites and may reduce mortality. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge concerning the use of TIPS for the treatment of ascites in patients with cirrhosis, from pathophysiology of ascites formation to hemodynamic consequences, patient selection, and technical issues of TIPS insertion. The combination of these factors is important to guide clinical decision-making and identify the best strategy for each individual patient. There is still a need to identify the best timing for TIPS placement in the natural history of ascites (recurrent vs. refractory) as well as which type and level of renal dysfunction is acceptable when TIPS is proposed for the treatment of ascites in cirrhosis. Future studies are needed to define the optimal stent diameter according to patient characteristics and individual risk of shunt-related side effects, particularly hepatic encephalopathy and insufficient cardiac response to hemodynamic consequences of TIPS insertion.

Introduction

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of advanced liver disease, with up to 30–40% of patients developing this neurological condition as their disease progresses. The phenotype of HE can vary widely from mild cognitive impairment to more serious symptoms such as disorientation and coma. While the etiology of HE is complex, the most prevalent theory of its pathophysiology is the inability of dysfunctional hepatocytes to process enteric neurotoxins that accumulate within the splanchnic circulation, allowing them to enter the systemic circulation, and precipitate cerebral inflammation and cerebral edema.

Due to the elevated pressure within the portal venous system and resultant hepatofugal flow in the cirrhotic liver, extrahepatic collateral blood vessels known as varices form to allow for portal blood return to the vena cavae and the systemic circulation. Porto-hepatic venous collaterals, or intrahepatic shunts, can also form, although efforts to characterize this phenomenon have been sparse –. The presence of these extrahepatic and intrahepatic shunts alters toxin circulation, decreases toxin metabolism in the liver, and contributes to hepatic encephalopathy.

In severe liver disease with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is a therapeutic intervention that can reduce pathologies caused by portal hypertension. With TIPS, a synthetic shunt connects the portal venous system to the hepatic venous system, such that some blood can bypass the cirrhotic liver and reduce portal hypertension and its sequelae. Although TIPS can significantly improve the morbidity and mortality of patients with cirrhosis and increase transplant-free survival, TIPS placement is also a known risk factor for the development of HE and, thus, preexisting HE is a relative contraindication to TIPS placement. TIPS can increase the incidence of HE by 30–55% post-procedure, with 90% of affected patients developing it within the first three months –.

While the association between TIPS placement and HE exacerbation is well-documented, the mechanism is poorly understood. Ammonia level is usually associated with HE, but studies examining ammonia level and HE development are conflicting. The association is highly dependent on the chronicity of hyperammonemia and varies greatly in outcome and thus levels are not typically followed clinically –. Therefore, neurotoxic compounds beyond ammonia likely contribute to HE. Microbial products such as aromatic amino acids and bile acids (BAs) are candidate neurotoxins, but it is still unclear which microbial products or metabolites induce HE onset and how TIPS placement affects the concentration of these compounds within the systemic circulation.

### Episodic overt hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt does not increase mortality in patients with cirrhosis [^111871mo]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) is a major complication of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, given its high incidence and possibility of refractoriness to medical treatment. Nevertheless, the impact of post-TIPS OHE on mortality has not been investigated in a large population.

Methods

We designed a multicenter, non-inferiority, observational study to evaluate the mortality rate at 30 months in patients with and without OHE after TIPS. We analyzed a database of 614 patients who underwent TIPS in three Italian centers and estimated the cumulative incidence of OHE and mortality with competitive risk analyses, setting the non-inferiority limit at 0.12.

Results

During a median follow-up of 30 months (IQR 12–30), 293 patients developed at least one episode of OHE. Twenty-seven (9.2%) of them experienced recurrent/persistent OHE. Patients with OHE were older (64 [57–71] vs. 59 [50–67] years, p < 0.001), had lower albumin (3.1 [2.8–3.5] vs. 3.25 [2.9–3.6] g/dl, p = 0.023), and had a higher prevalence of pre-TIPS OHE (15.4% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.023). Child-Pugh and MELD scores were similar. The 30-month difference in mortality between patients with and without post-TIPS OHE was 0.03 (95% CI -0.042 to 0.102). Multivariable analysis showed that age (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.05, p < 0.001) and MELD score (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.13, p < 0.001), but not post-TIPS OHE, were associated with a higher mortality rate. Similar results were obtained when patients undergoing TIPS for variceal re-bleeding prophylaxis (n = 356) or refractory ascites (n = 258) were analyzed separately. The proportion of patients with persistent OHE after TIPS was significantly higher in the group of patients who died. The robustness of these results was increased following propensity score matching.

Conclusion

Episodic OHE after TIPS is not associated with mortality in patients undergoing TIPS, regardless of the indication.

Impact and Implications

Overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) is a common complication in patients with advanced liver disease and it is particularly frequent following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. In patients with cirrhosis outside the setting of TIPS, the development of OHE negatively impacts survival, regardless of the severity of cirrhosis or the presence of acute-on-chronic liver failure. In this multicenter, non-inferiority, observational study we demonstrated that post-TIPS OHE does not increase the risk of mortality in patients undergoing TIPS, irrespective of the indication. This finding alleviates concerns regarding the weight of this complication after TIPS. Intensive research to improve patient selection and risk stratification remains crucial to enhance the quality of life of patients and caregivers and to avoid undermining the positive effects of TIPS on survival.

### Complications of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the era of the stent graft-what the interventionists need to know? [^115PnEHK]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is created between a hepatic vein (HV) and the portal vein (PV) to alleviate the symptoms of portal hypertension. Despite high procedural success rates, a myriad of complications may occur at every step of TIPS creation. These complications may be attributable to the procedure itself or the shunt. Portal vein puncture is the most challenging and rate-limiting step, with extrahepatic portal vein puncture being the most devastating tabletop complication. Hepatic encephalopathy is the most common shunt-related complication after TIPS. Unlike bare metallic stents, covered stents have a longer patency rate and lower incidence of TIPS dysfunction. Most of the TIPS dysfunction that occurs with stent-grafts is due to technical errors and mechanical factors. TIPS revision often requires a combination of angioplasty, mechanical thrombectomy, and thrombolytics with a need for additional stenting in some cases. This review article focuses on procedure and shunt-related complications, as well as preventive and management strategies.

### Post-TIPS encephalopathy: clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management [^112mBoQq]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of portal hypertension commonly involves the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Despite significant advancement in procedural techniques, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) continues to be one of the most consequential complications following TIPS creation. In this manuscript, we describe in detail several factors associated with the clinical condition of patients and TIPS creation that increase the likelihood of post TIPS development of hepatic encephalopathy. We also discuss the management of the post-TIPS encephalopathic patient.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for acute variceal bleeding: a meta-analysis [^117VDnFh]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute variceal bleeding is the most common lethal complication of liver cirrhosis. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the outcomes of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to those of medical/endoscopic therapy for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for all relevant comparative studies. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)were pooled for dichotomous and time-dependent variables, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of study design (randomized or nonrandomized studies), source of bleeding (esophageal or gastric varices), type of stent (covered or bare stent), and patient selection (high risk or unselected patients).

Results

Six papers were eligible. TIPS was superior to medical/endoscopic therapy in decreasing the incidence of treatment failure (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.11–0.44), improving overall survival (HR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38–0.812), and decreasing the incidence of bleeding-related death (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.59). Although TIPS did not significantly decrease the incidence of rebleeding (OR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.06–1.29), it became significantly greater in the subgroup meta-analyses of randomized studies (OR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03–0.32) than in those of nonrandomized studies (OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.40–1.45; subgroup difference, P = 0.003), and in the subgroup meta-analyses of studies including high-risk patients (OR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01–0.23) than in those including low-risk patients (OR = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.44–1.56; subgroup difference, P = 0.0007). In addition, TIPS did not significantly increase the incidence of posttreatment hepatic encephalopathy (OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.63–2.99).

Conclusions

With the exception of the benefit of prevention from treatment failure, TIPS with covered stents might improve the overall survival of high-risk patients with acute variceal bleeding.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on TIPS [^115Evv47]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is a well-established procedure for managing complications of portal hypertension. In recent years, the field of TIPS has seen rapid advances, particularly in technical approaches, prognostic modelling, and an expanding range of indications. The aim of these EASL guidelines is to comprehensively address all aspects of TIPS in patients with cirrhosis. Other related topics, such as the use of TIPS in surgical settings and in vascular liver disorders, are covered in separate dedicated clinical practice guidelines.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) stent choice and encephalopathy prophylaxis — Use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stents is now preferred because of lower shunt dysfunction and possibly improved outcomes compared with bare stents, and creation of a TIPS increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy while prophylactic nonabsorbable disaccharides or antibiotics do not reduce this risk and are not recommended.

### North American practice-based recommendations for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts in portal hypertension [^1132i5y6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Complications of portal hypertension, including ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatic encephalopathy, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite few high-quality randomized controlled trials to guide therapeutic decisions, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation has emerged as a crucial therapeutic option to treat complications of portal hypertension. In North America, the decision to perform TIPS involves gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and interventional radiologists, but TIPS creation is performed by interventional radiologists. This is in contrast to other parts of the world where TIPS creation is performed primarily by hepatologists. Thus, the successful use of TIPS in North America is dependent on a multidisciplinary approach and technical expertise, so as to optimize outcomes. Recently, new procedural techniques, TIPS stent technology, and indications for TIPS have emerged. As a result, practices and outcomes vary greatly across institutions and significant knowledge gaps exist. In this consensus statement, the Advancing Liver Therapeutic Approaches group critically reviews the application of TIPS in the management of portal hypertension. Advancing Liver Therapeutic Approaches convened a multidisciplinary group of North American experts from hepatology, interventional radiology, transplant surgery, nephrology, cardiology, pulmonology, and hematology to critically review existing literature and develop practice-based recommendations for the use of TIPS in patients with any cause of portal hypertension in terms of candidate selection, procedural best practices and, post-TIPS management; and to develop areas of consensus for TIPS indications and the prevention of complications. Finally, future research directions are identified related to TIPS for the management of portal hypertension.

### Refractory hepatic encephalopathy after elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: risk factors and outcomes with revision [^1155cNAH]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement and is often successfully medically managed. Risk factors for refractory hepatic encephalopathy (RHE) necessitating revision of TIPS are not well defined. We evaluated the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of post-TIPS RHE necessitating TIPS revision.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort study of 174 consecutive patients undergoing elective TIPS placement (2010–2015), we evaluated the incidence of post-TIPS RHE. Clinical demographics and procedural variables were collected. 1-year outcomes after revision were collected.

Results

Ten of 174 patients (5.7%) developed post-TIPS RHE requiring revision. Significant differences between RHE and non-refractory groups were shunt size > 8 versus ≤ 8 mm (18.5 vs. 3.4%, p = 0.001), history of HE (14 vs. 2%, p = 0.007), and serum albumin levels ≤ 2.5 versus > 2.5 g/dL (13.1 vs. 3.1%, p = 0.020). On multivariate analysis, shunt size > 8 mm (p = 0.001), history of HE prior to TIPS (p = 0.006), and low serum albumin (≤ 2.5 g/dL) (p = 0.022) remained independent predictors of RHE, controlling for age and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. RHE improved in 8 of 10 patients but survival at 1 year without liver transplantation (LT) was only 10%.

Conclusion

While TIPS revision successfully improves RHE in most cases, 1-year mortality rates are high, limiting the value of revision in non-LT candidates. Patients with previous history of HE and low serum albumin levels prior to TIPS may benefit most from the use of shunt sizes < 8 mm to mitigate the risk of RHE.

### Analysis of independent risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in patients with cirrhosis combined with diabetes [^115NhdQm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Portal hypertension often causes serious complications, including variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, portal vein thrombosis, etc. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an effective tool for the treatment of portal hypertension; however, after TIPS, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) occurs in about 30–60% of the patients, which causes an unfavorable prognosis, and greatly affects the application of the procedure. HE is a syndrome of central nervous system dysfunction based on metabolic disorders. The occurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) often leads to poor prognosis.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of HE are complex and currently unknown. It is important to identify risk predictors of OHE after TIPS to improve the prognosis. Many factors have been reported to be related to the development of HE after TIPS such as older age, a higher Child-Pugh class/score or model for end-stage liver disease, previous history of HE, and the etiology of cirrhosis. Moreover, our previous study found that diabetes significantly increased the incidence of OHE. Previous studies have only demonstrated that diabetes is an independent risk factor for the development of HE after TIPS; however, fewer studies focused on the risk factors in patients with cirrhosis complicated with diabetes. This study aims to investigate the independent risk factors for the development of OHE in patients with cirrhosis combined with diabetes.

### Small diameter shunts should lead to safe expansion of the use of TIPS [^115woURw]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is increasingly used worldwide to treat the complications of portal hypertension in patients with advanced cirrhosis. However, its use is hampered by the risk of causing hepatic encephalopathy and of worsening liver function. The reported haemodynamic targets used to guide TIPS are too narrow to be achieved in most cases and are perhaps not entirely adequate nowadays as they were obtained in the pre-covered stent era. We propose that small diameter TIPS - alone or combined to pharmacological therapy or ancillary interventional radiology procedures - may overcome these limitations while maintaining the beneficial effects of the procedure.

### Uncovered transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for refractory ascites: a meta-analysis [^115cDDUU]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Several trials showed that uncovered transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is superior to paracentesis for the control of refractory ascites. However, the results for encephalopathy and mortality were not consistent across trials. We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of TIPS for refractory ascites to assess the overall treatment effects and to explore potential reasons of heterogeneity.

Methods

Pertinent studies were retrieved trough MEDLINE (1968–2004), EMBASE (1986–2004), the Cochrane Library (2004;4), and reference lists of key articles. Outcome measures were recurrence of ascites, encephalopathy, and mortality. Metaregression analysis was used to explore heterogeneity.

Results

Five trials were identified including 330 patients. Successful TIPS placement ranged from 77% to 100% and portosystemic pressure gradient reduction ranged from 6.0 to 14.0 mm Hg. Metaregression analysis showed that bilirubin levels and successful TIPS placement rates were associated significantly with log-odds ratio for death after TIPS, explained heterogeneity of trials for mortality, and suggested an outlier trial. After exclusion of the outlier trial, pooled odds ratios for recurrence of ascites with TIPS was .14 (confidence interval, .07-.27), for encephalopathy was 2.26 (confidence interval, 1.35–3.76), and for mortality was .74 (confidence interval, .40–1.37), without any significant heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Uncovered TIPS is significantly better than paracentesis for control of refractory ascites. Although it increases encephalopathy, it also is associated with a trend toward improvement of survival. Future TIPS trials should select patients on the basis of bilirubin levels and predictors of the risk for post-TIPS encephalopathy, and assess costs and quality of life.

Hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) — prevention and management: Initially, it was routine to use standard HE treatment to prevent post-TIPS HE, but one study illustrated that neither rifaximin nor lactulose prevented post-TIPS HE any better than placebo; if it occurs, shunt diameter reduction can reverse HE; and there is a lack of consensus on whether to aim to reduce PP by 50% or below 12 mmHg, with the latter associated with more bouts of encephalopathy.

### Endovascular management of refractory hepatic encephalopathy complication of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): comprehensive review and clinical practice algorithm [^114LiSkQ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has evolved as an effective intervention for treatment of complications of portal hypertension. The use of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents have improved the patency of the shunts and diminished the incidence of TIPS dysfunction. However, TIPS-related refractory hepatic encephalopathy (rHE) poses a significant challenge. Approximately 3–7% of patients with TIPS develop rHE. Refractory hepatic encephalopathy is defined as a recurrent or persistent encephalopathy despite appropriate medical treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy can be an extremely debilitating complication that profoundly affects quality of life. The approach to management of patients with rHE is complex and typically requires collaboration between different specialties. Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment for rHE; however, the ongoing shortage of organ donation markedly limits this treatment option. Alternative therapies such as shunt occlusion or reduction can control symptoms and serve as a 'bridge' therapy to liver transplantation. Therefore, interventional radiologists play a key role in the management of these patients by offering a variety of endovascular techniques. The purpose of this review is to highlight some of these endovascular techniques and to develop a therapeutic algorithm that can be applied in clinical practice for the management of rHE.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): current status and future possibilities [^112bSpJx]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Since the insertion of the first TIPS in 1989 much has been learned about this therapeutic procedure. It has an established role for the treatment of some complications of portal hypertension: prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding and rescue of patients with acute uncontrollable variceal bleeding. In addition TIPS is useful for Budd-Chiari syndrome, refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome, although its specific role in these indications remains to be definitively established. However, the decrease in sinusoidal blood flow induced by TIPS can lead to the patient developing hepatic encephalopathy and liver failure in some cases. Therefore, TIPS should be used with caution in patients with very poor liver function. From a technical point of view, successful placement of TIPS is achieved in more than 98% of cases by experienced groups. At present, evaluation of TIPS dysfunction based on morphology probably leads to an overdiagnosis of this complication since most of these cases are not associated with clinical manifestations (recurrent bleeding or refractory ascites). The major disadvantage of TIPS remains its poor long-term patency requiring a mandatory surveillance program. The indicator for shunt function/malfunction should be the portosystemic pressure gradient, which is best assessed by intravascular measurements. Shunt obstructions may be prevented or reduced by the use of stent-grafts in the future.

### Efficacy of 6-mm and 8-mm transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for variceal bleeding: a randomized controlled trial [^112aeNyL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is associated with an increased incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of 6-mm and 8-mm TIPS for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis who were at risk for HE.

Methods

This was an investigator-initiated, open-label, single-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding were randomly assigned to the 6-mm or the 8-mm covered TIPS groups. The primary endpoint was all-cause rebleeding after 2 years.

Results

Between September 20, 2017 and September 17, 2021, 144 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the 6-mm (n = 72) or 8-mm (n = 72) TIPS group. Overall, 24 (33.3%) and 16 (22.2%) patients in the 6-mm and 8-mm groups, respectively, experienced rebleeding. In the 6-mm and 8-mm groups, the cumulative rates of rebleeding were 35.2% and 24.1%, respectively (p = 0.187). The 2-year cumulative incidence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) was significantly higher in the 8-mm group than in the 6-mm group (42.0% vs. 20.3%, p = 0.009). The 2-year actuarial survival rates were 84.6% in the 6-mm group and 83.0% in the 8-mm group.

Conclusion

Among this cohort of patients with cirrhosis who are receiving TIPS for the secondary prevention of variceal bleeding, the use of 6-mm stents results in a higher rate of rebleeding but has similar survival and a significantly lower risk of OHE compared to 8-mm stents.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt versus endoscopic therapy in the secondary prophylaxis of variceal rebleeding in cirrhotic patients: meta-analysis update [^111aZGjk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study was to determine through meta-analysis the effects of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) for the reduction of variceal rebleeding (VRB).

Background

Variceal bleeding is one of the most frequent and severe complications of chronic liver disease. Although prophylactic use of TIPS for the reduction of VRB has been evaluated, the discrepancy about TIPS's beneficial effect on cirrhotic patients still exists.

Study

We employed the method recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TIPS versus endoscopic therapy in the prevention of VRB including 12 RCTs conducted in 7 different countries.

Results

Most RCTs reviewed were of high quality. The updated meta-analysis showed that the decreased incidence of VRB [odds ratio (OR) = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.24–0.43), P < 0.00001], deaths due to rebleeding [OR = 0.35, 95% CI (0.18–0.67), P = 0.002], the increased rate of posttreatment encephalopathy [OR = 2.21, 95% CI (1.61–3.03), P < 0.00001] were correlated with TIPS, whereas the hospitalization days [weighted mean difference = -0.21, 95% CI (-3.50 to 3.08), P = 0.90] and deaths due to all causes [OR = 1.17, 95% CI (0.85–1.61), P = 0.33] returned negative results in 2 groups.

Conclusions

TIPS is currently the first choice to prevent rebleeding except that TIPS is worse than endoscopic therapy for encephalopathy. An exploration of new approaches out of above complications will be of considerable clinical significance and be a challenge to clinicians.

### The evolution of the TIPS placement technique and its applications over four decades [^117AuUjw]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), a highly effective procedure reducing portal hypertension, has been in use for over seven decades and is now a cornerstone in managing portal hypertension-related complications such as variceal bleeding and ascites. Historically, TIPS has dealt with two main challenges: ensuring stent patency and preventing post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy. The introduction of PTFE-coated stents markedly reduced the risk of TIPS dysfunction and stent patency is no longer a major concern. However, despite improved patient selection criteria, hepatic encephalopathy continues to be a significant and persistent issue. In addition, the broader application of TIPS in recent decades has brought to light additional, albeit less common, complications, such as post-TIPS heart failure. This review offers a comprehensive overview of TIPS historical evolution, advancements in technique, and its application in the treatment of portal hypertension.

### The role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of portal hypertension [^111vj8Pk]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an interventional radiology technique that has shown a 90% success rate to decompress the portal circulation. As a non-surgical intervention, without requirement for anesthesia and very low procedure-related mortality, TIPS is applicable to severe cirrhotic patients, who are otherwise untreatable, for example, nonsurgical candidates. TIPS constitutes the most frequently employed tool to achieve portosystemic shunting. TIPS acts by lowering portal pressure, which is the main underlying pathophysiologic determinant of the major complications of cirrhosis. Regarding esophagogastric variceal bleeding, TIPS has excellent hemostatic effect (95%) with low rebleeding rate (< 20%). TIPS is an accepted rescue therapy for first line treatment failures in 2 settings (1) acute variceal bleeding and (2) secondary prophylaxis. In addition, TIPS offers 70% to 90% hemostasis to patients presenting with recurrent active variceal bleeding. TIPS is more effective than standard therapy for patients with hepatic venous pressure gradient > 20mm Hg. TIPS is particularly useful to treat bleeding from varices inaccessible to endoscopy. TIPS should not be applied for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Portosystemic encephalopathy and stent dysfunction are TIPS major drawbacks. The weakness of the TIPS procedure is the frequent need for endovascular reintervention to ensure stent patency. The circulatory effects of TIPS are an attractive approach for the treatment of refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome, yet TIPS is not considered first line therapy for refractory ascites owing to unacceptable incidence of portosystemic encephalopathy. Pre-TIPS evaluation taking into account predictors of outcome is mandatory. The improved results achieved with covered-stents might expand the currently accepted recommendations for TIPS use.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt: technical factors and new developments [^111FBXNm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The introduction of expandable metal stents in the mid 1980s led to the development of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt (TIPSS) as we know it today. Short-lived detrimental effects on the hyperdynamic circulation in cirrhosis accompany the acute reduction in portal pressure following TIPSS creation. Caution is needed in patients with cardiac dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension. With increasing expertise and careful patient selection, fatal procedural complications are rare and TIPSS can even be safely used as a bridge to liver transplantation. Shunt insufficiency and hepatic encephalopathy are more common following TIPSS. Currently, however, novel approaches to tackling both these limitations exist. These include the combination of uncovered TIPSS with variceal band ligation, and the introduction of polytetrafluoroethylene covered stents. Despite the lack of controlled studies, covered stents are now widely used and have the potential to drastically reduce shunt insufficiency, the need for long-term shunt surveillance and even hepatic encephalopathy.

### AASLD practice guidance on the use of TIPS, variceal embolization, and retrograde transvenous obliteration in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^115ct93L]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

TIPS versus RTO — "both TIPS and RTO showed similar hemostasis rates and postoperative procedure-related complications", but "Rates of hepatic encephalopathy were higher in patients treated with TIPS". "Generally, the choice of RTO versus TIPS is determined by clinical and pathophysiological considerations and local expertise", with mechanism-based tradeoffs: "RTO closes a preexisting portosystemic shunt, whereas TIPS creates a new one; therefore, the main advantage of RTO over TIPS is the reduction in hepatic encephalopathy and potentially the prevention of liver function deterioration related to portal systemic shunting, whereas the downside of RTO is the increased risk of new/worsened esophageal varices and new/worsened ascites and/or hydrothorax". Additional selection notes include that "patients with cardiac contraindications for TIPS are commonly eligible for RTO", "in patients with contraindications for TIPS, RTO should be the first choice, provided vascular anatomy and local expertise allow for its performance", "In patients who are candidates for both TIPS and RTO, the choice might be based on local expertise and the presence of other complications of portal hypertension", and while "a combination of TIPS + RTO could be more efficacious", "data are scarce to support this recommendation beyond individual cases".

### The use of rifaximin in the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: a randomized controlled trial [^112mxmsb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of rifaximin in the secondary prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is well documented, but its effectiveness in preventing a first episode in patients after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has not been established.

Objective

To determine whether rifaximin prevents overt HE after TIPS compared with placebo.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02016196).

Participants

197 patients with cirrhosis undergoing TIPS for intractable ascites or prevention of variceal rebleeding.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive rifaximin (600 mg twice daily) or placebo, beginning 14 days before TIPS and continuing for 168 days after the procedure.

Measurements

The primary efficacy end point was incidence of overt HE within 168 days after the TIPS procedure.

Results

An episode of overt HE occurred in 34% (95% CI, 25% to 44%) of patients in the rifaximin group (n = 93) and 53% (CI, 43% to 63%) in the placebo group (n = 93) during the postprocedure period (odds ratio, 0.48 [CI, 0.27 to 0.87]). Neither the incidence of adverse events nor transplant-free survival was significantly different between the 2 groups.

Limitations

The study's conclusion applies mainly to patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, who made up the study population. The potential benefit of rifaximin 6 months after TIPS and beyond remains to be investigated.

Conclusion

In patients with cirrhosis treated with TIPS, rifaximin was well tolerated and reduced the risk for overt HE. Rifaximin should therefore be considered for prophylaxis of post-TIPS HE.

### Quality improvement guidelines for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) [^111yzHoX]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical success is defined as cessation of variceal bleeding, decrease of ascites, and conversion into diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as improvement of liver function in patients referred for massive thrombosis of hepatic veins.

Hepatic encephalopathy is defined as the complex of all cerebral dysfunctions that can occur during the course of serious liver disease. Clinical symptomatology, which as a rule is potentially reversible, ranges from disorientation, somnolence, and lethargy to sopor and coma. Hepatic encephalopathy has three forms: type A, associated with acute liver failure; type B, associated with portosystemic bypass without liver disease; and type C, or chronic, associated with liver cirrhosis.

### Predicting morbidity and mortality after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement: a review of existing models and future directions [^114Xogti]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a key therapeutic intervention in the management of portal hypertension and its complications, such as variceal bleeding, hepatic hydrothorax, and refractory ascites. TIPS has historically been used as a lifesaving measure or as a bridge to liver transplantation (LT). Despite its efficacy, creation of a TIPS can be associated with significant morbidity, particularly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Complications include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), progressive liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular compromise. As such, accurate patient selection and risk stratification are essential to optimize clinical outcomes. This review synthesizes current evidence on predictive models for post-TIPS mortality. Traditional scoring systems such as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) remain widely used, with newer iterations such as the MELD-Na and MELD 3.0 demonstrating improved prognostic accuracy. Notably, MELD 3.0 offers enhanced prediction of long-term mortality. In contrast, the Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) has become a valuable tool for short-term mortality prediction. Additional models, including the Bilirubin-Platelet (Bili-PLT) score, offer further refinement. At the same time, the role of sarcopenia has gained attention as an independent and synergistic predictor of poor outcomes, especially when combined with MELD-based scores. Beyond mortality, this review explores the multifactorial pathophysiology of post-TIPS complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, liver failure, and right heart dysfunction that can cause significant morbidity. These outcomes are influenced by a spectrum of patient-related and procedural factors. Novel predictive approaches-encompassing clinical, radiological, and machine learning-based models-are being developed to better anticipate these risks.

Patient selection

Summary of recommendations for patient selection prior to TIPSS.

Hepatic encephalopathy

Pre-TIPSS assessment of encephalopathy

As with all portosystemic shunts, the major complication post-TIPSS is HE. This is particularly heartbreaking for the relatives/carers, who will be the first to notice changes in cognition. Phrases such as "I no longer recognise my husband/wife" reflect a poor outcome, especially when the TIPSS has been a palliative procedure in someone with recurrent ascites. The incidence of encephalopathy has been quoted as high as 55% and is dependent on patient and attainment factors: assiduous searching for encephalopathy will identify a higher incidence.

Every effort needs to be made to identify those at risk of post-TIPSS HE, especially in the elective setting. This is harder to do when the TIPSS is being considered in an emergency, and under these circumstances, a history may be all that is available, for example, a history of debilitating encephalopathy in someone with an acute variceal bleed is a contraindication to a TIPSS unless there is a major competing portosystemic shunt that can be embolised.

Patient-related factors perhaps predictably include: age, severity of liver disease, history of preceding encephalopathyand size of shunt. A Child-Pugh score equal or greater than 10 was a proposed cut-off point. The recently recognised additional risk factor of diabetes may well reflect altered renal handling of ammonia. This latter consideration is increasingly important, as many of the referrals for TIPSS for diuretic resistant ascites are in patients who have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and who are diabetic.

While these simple clinical markers are easy to obtain, most elective patients will have well-preserved liver function. The major advance has been the recognition of the clinical disorder "covert" or subclinical encephalopathy. This is a disorder in which patients with chronic liver disease exhibit specific, reversible, quantifiable, neuropsychological or electroencephalographic abnormalities in the absence of clinically obvious mental or neurologic defects. The critical next step is the identification that covert hepatic encephalopathy predicts the development of overt hepatic encephalopathty. This has driven the search for accurate techniques that identify covert encephalopathy, and parameters which predict the development of overt encephalopathy post-TIPSS.

### Coveredbare stents for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114aVjU9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 2010, we published for the first time a meta-analysis of one RCT and five observational studies to compare the patency and clinical outcomes of TIPS with covered versus bare stents. The statistical analyses demonstrated that shunt patency, hepatic encephalopathy, and survival were significantly improved by the use of covered stents. However, given the quality of included studies, the conclusions might be unreliable. Therefore, the conclusions were that covered stents improved shunt patency without any increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy and with a trend towards better survival.

In 2015, we published another meta-analysis of two RCTs from Western countries to further explore the survival benefit of covered stents for TIPS. The statistical analysis showed only a borderline survival benefit.

The present meta-analysis had three major strengths. First, four RCTs were included. No observational studies were considered. Second, the relevant studies were systematically searched. Third, only a random-effect model was employed. The statistical results were more conservative. By comparison, our previous meta-analysis employed a fixed-effect model, in which the results were more aggressive. Fourth, the risk of bias was relatively low. According to the common practice for Cochrane reviews of endoscopic or surgical RCTs while physicians could not be blinded, the question 'blinding of participants and personnel' was judged as 'high risk of bias' in three studies. However, considering that the outcomes (i.e. overall survival, shunt patency, and hepatic encephalopathy) are objective, we believed that the outcome measurement might not be largely influenced by the absence of blinding of types of stents.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: current status [^113Vg381]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was developed in the 1980s for treatment of complications of portal hypertension. Once it was shown that the shunt could be placed with relative ease, TIPS was rapidly applied to the treatment of many of the complications of portal hypertension. These complications include actively bleeding gastroesophageal varices, prevention of rebleeding from varices, control of refractory cirrhotic ascites and hepatic hydrothorax, and treatment of hepatorenal failure and hepatopulmonary syndrome. TIPS has also been used as therapy for Budd-Chiari syndrome and veno-occlusive disease. Despite these broad applications, TIPS has been compared with other forms of therapy in only 2 situations: prevention of rebleeding from varices and control of refractory cirrhotic ascites. In the trials, TIPS was shown to provide better control of these 2 complications of portal hypertension than standard forms of therapy. However, there was no improvement in survival and the incidence of encephalopathy was greater for patients receiving a TIPS. Thus, the use of TIPS for the control of ascites and prevention of rebleeding from varices should be limited to a select group of patients. There have been no controlled trials for the other indications listed. Despite the apparent efficacy of TIPS in many of these situations, its use should be limited to salvage therapy pending the publication of controlled trials showing it is a better treatment than other forms of therapy.

### TIPS-related hepatic encephalopathy: management options with novel endovascular techniques [^111JVbrB]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a common complication that develops after creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Although most patients respond well to conservative medical therapy (ie, protein-restricted diet, nonabsorbable disaccharides, nonabsorbable antibiotics), a small percentage of patients (3%-7%) do not benefit from these methods and require more invasive therapeutic approaches. One option is emergent liver transplantation, but the majority of patients are not suitable candidates. Recently, various percutaneous techniques have been described that alter the hemodynamics through the shunt by occluding it with coils or balloons or by reducing its diameter by inserting constrained stents or stent-grafts. Other techniques have been used for patients with TIPS-related hepatic encephalopathy in whom spontaneous splenorenal shunts are present. In many patients with refractory hepatic encephalopathy, these percutaneous techniques have produced symptomatic improvement, with either a complete resolution or a substantial reduction in hepatic encephalopathy symptoms that can be controlled with medical therapy. Unfortunately, despite all attempts, some patients remain incapacitated and ultimately die. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of TIPS-related hepatic encephalopathy so that newer, less invasive and safer procedures can be developed to treat this difficult clinical problem.

### The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for the management of cirrhotic refractory ascites [^1141wPA4]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Cirrhotic ascites results from sinusoidal hypertension and sodium retention, which is secondary to a decreased effective arterial blood volume. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is currently indicated in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites who require large-volume paracentesis (LVP) more than two or three times per month. TIPS placement is associated with normalization of sinusoidal pressure and a significant improvement in urinary sodium excretion that correlates with suppression of plasma renin activity, which is, itself, indicative of an improvement in effective arterial blood volume. Compared with serial LVP, placement of an uncovered TIPS stent is more effective at preventing ascites from recurring; however, increased incidence of hepatic encephalopathy and shunt dysfunction rates after TIPS placement are important issues that increase its cost. Although evidence suggests that TIPS placement might result in better patient survival, this needs to be confirmed, particularly in light of the development of polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stents. Favorable results apply to centers experienced in placing the TIPS, with the aim being to decrease the portosystemic gradient to < 12 mmHg but > 5 mmHg. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis for the use of a TIPS in patients with refractory ascites, the results of controlled trials comparing TIPS placement (using uncovered stents) versus LVP, and a systematic review of predictors of death after TIPS placement for refractory ascites.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: an update [^113GPxZU]. Liver Transplantation (2003). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) have been used in the treatment of complications of portal hypertension. TIPS is used for the control of acute variceal bleeding and for the prevention of vericeal rebleeding when pharmacologic therapy and endoscopic therapy have failed. Patients with refractory ascites with adequate hepatic reserve and renal function who fail to respond to large volume paracentesis may be reasonable candidates for TIPS. Promising indications for TIPS are Budd-Chiari syndrome uncontrolled by medical therapy, severe portal hypertensive gastropathy, refractory hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS cannot be recommended for preoperative portal decompression solely to facilitate liver transplantation. Special care should be taken to insure proper placement of the stent to avoid increasing the technical difficulty of the transplantation procedure. The major limiting factors for TIPS success are shunt dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy. Because shunt stenosis is the most important cause of recurrent complications of portal hypertension, a surveillance program to monitor shunt patency is mandatory. The MELD score may be useful in predicting post-TIPS survival, and also in counseling patients and their families.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent-shunt in the management of portal hypertension [^113dbXiG]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Three recent guidelines recommend TIPSS in the management of refractory or recurrent ascites. The EASL guidelines also suggested useful parameters to identify higher-risk patients with more advanced liver disease who would not benefit from TIPSS. These include bilirubin > 50µmol and platelets < 75×10⁹, current encephalopathy, active infection, progressive renal failure, severe systolic or diastolic dysfunction, or pulmonary hypertension. Many guidelines and studies have recommended that once a patient is being considered for TIPSS in the context of ascites, liver transplantation should also be considered at that stage for appropriate patients.

Figure 2 is a summary of the recommendations.

Figure 2
Summary of recommendations for TIPSS in recurrent or refractory ascites.

Recommendations: TIPSS for ascites

In patients who are eligible for liver transplantation, TIPSS for ascites should only be undertaken after discussion with the regional transplant centre (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
In selected patients with refractory or recurrent ascites, we recommend insertion of TIPSS provided there are no contraindications to the procedure (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
In addition to the standard TIPSS contraindications, patients who may not benefit from TIPSS for ascites include those with bilirubin > 50 µm/L and platelets < 75×10⁹, pre-existing encephalopathy, active infection, severe cardiac failure or severe pulmonary hypertension (strong recommendation, moderate- quality evidence).

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^116sXDBv]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement can worsen cognitive dysfunction in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) patients due to toxins, including possible microbial metabolites, entering the systemic circulation. We conducted untargeted metabolomics on a prospective cohort of 22 patients with cirrhosis undergoing elective TIPS placement and followed them up to one year post TIPS for HE development. Here we suggest that pre-existing intrahepatic shunting predicts HE severity post-TIPS. Bile acid levels decrease in the peripheral vein post-TIPS, and the abundances of three specific conjugated di- and tri-hydroxylated bile acids are inversely correlated with HE grade. Bilirubins and glycerophosphocholines undergo chemical modifications pre- to post-TIPS and based on HE grade. Our results suggest that TIPS-induced metabolome changes can impact HE development, and that pre-existing intrahepatic shunting could be used to predict HE severity post-TIPS.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts for adults with hepatorenal syndrome [^112euiSs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome is a condition that occurs in people with chronic liver disease (such as alcoholic hepatitis, advanced cirrhosis, or fulminant liver failure) and portal hypertension. The prognosis is dismal, often with a survival of weeks to months. Hepatorenal syndrome is characterised by the development of intense splanchnic vasodilation favouring ascites and hypotension leading to renal vasoconstriction and acute renal failure. Therefore, treatment attempts focus on improving arterial pressure through the use of vasopressors, paracentesis, and increasing renal perfusion pressure. Several authors have reported that the placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may be a therapeutic option because it decreases portal pressure and improves arterial and renal pressures. However, the evidence is not clearly documented and TIPS may cause adverse events. Accordingly, it is necessary to evaluate the evidence of the benefits and harms of TIPS to assess its value in people with hepatorenal syndrome.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) in adults with hepatorenal syndrome compared with sham, no intervention, conventional treatment, or other treatments.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 2 June 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials with a parallel-group design, which compared the TIPS placement with sham, no intervention, conventional therapy, or other therapies, in adults aged 18 years or older, regardless of sex or ethnicity, diagnosed with chronic liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded trials of adults with kidney failure due to causes not related to hepatorenal syndrome, and we also excluded data from quasi-randomised, cross-over, and observational study designs as we did not design a separate search for such studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. all-cause mortality, 2. morbidity due to any cause, and 3. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 1. health-related quality of life, 2. non-serious adverse events, 3. participants who did not receive a liver transplant, 4. participants without improvement in kidney function, and 5. length of hospitalisation. We performed fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses using risk ratio (RR) or Peto odds ratio (Peto OR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for the continuous outcomes. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included two randomised clinical trials comparing TIPS placement (64 participants) versus conventional treatment (paracentesis plus albumin 8 g/L of removed ascites) (66 participants). The co-interventions used in the trials were dietary treatment (sodium less than 60 mmoL/day), spironolactone (300 mg/day to 400 mg/day), and furosemide (120 mg/day). Follow-up was up to 24 months. Both were multicentre trials from Spain and the United States, and Germany, conducted between 1993 and 2002. Most participants were men (aged 18 to 75 years). We are uncertain about the effect of TIPS placement compared with conventional treatment, during the first 24 months of follow-up, on all-cause mortality (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.38; 2 trials, 130 participants; I² = 58%; very low-certainty evidence) and on the development of any serious adverse event (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.10 to 24.59; 2 trials, 130 participants; I² = 78%; very low-certainty evidence). The use of TIPS may or may not result in a decrease in overall morbidity such as bacterial peritonitis, encephalopathy, or refractory ascites, during the first 24 months of follow-up, compared with the conventional treatment (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.18; 2 trials, 130 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of TIPS placement versus conventional treatment on the number of people who did not receive a liver transplant (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 2 trials, 130 participants; I² = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) or on the length of hospitalisation (MD -20.0 days, 95% CI -39.92 to -0.08; 1 trial, 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Kidney function may improve in participants with TIPS placement (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.02; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No trials reported health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, or number of participants with improvement in liver function associated with the TIPS placement. Funding No trials reported sources of commercial funding or conflicts of interest between researchers. Ongoing studies We found one ongoing trial comparing TIPS with conventional therapy (terlipressin plus albumin) and listed one study as awaiting classification as no full-text article could be found.

Authors' Conclusions

TIPS placement was compared with conventional treatment, with a follow-up of 24 months, in adults with hepatorenal syndrome type 2. Based on two trials with insufficient sample size and trial limitations, we assessed the overall certainty of evidence as low or very low. We are unsure if TIPS may decrease all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, the number of people who did not receive a liver transplant, and the days of hospitalisation because of the very low-certainty evidence. We are unsure if TIPS, compared with conventional treatment, has better effects on overall morbidity (bacterial peritonitis, encephalopathy, or refractory ascites). TIPS may improve kidney function, but the certainty of evidence is low. The trials included no data on health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, and liver function associated with the TIPS placement. We identified one ongoing trial and one study awaiting classification which may contribute to the review when information becomes available.

Considerations before TIPS

Patient selection for TIPS is a multidisciplinary decision that entails demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters, and preoperative considerations as well as standard scoring systems such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease, Child-Pugh Score and the Freiburg Index of Post-TIPS Survival. Consideration of factors such as encephalopathy, cardiopulmonary function, frailty, and age is necessary to ensure best patient outcomes.

Pre-TIPS assessment of encephalopathy

HE is a frequent complication of all portosystemic shunts including TIPS. An episode of overt HE can occur in up to 50% of patients after TIPS. Nearly half of respondents (47.8%) recommend that at least two screening tests for HE should be performed before TIPS placement (figure 2). Almost a quarter of respondents (26.1%) said that they will perform only one test to screen for HE before TIPS, while 56.5% of respondents would recommend two or more tests. Notably, 17.4% reported that they will not screen for HE before TIPS.

Figure 2

Age

The largest proportion of respondents (9, 39.1%) considered TIPS in patients above 70 a risky procedure. On the other hand, only 2 (8.7%) (> 65 years), 3 (13%) (> 75 years), 2 (8.7%) (> 80 years), and 3 (13%) (> 85 years) of respondents, respectively, considered these age cut-offs when TIPS becomes a risky procedure. Meanwhile, three (13%) of respondents said that there is no age cut-off when TIPS was perceived as risky procedure and one respondent could not specify an age cut-off for TIPS.

### Pharmacological prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: a randomized controlled study [^115Dwg4o]. Journal of Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Hepatic encephalopathy is a frequent event after transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunt (TIPS), especially during the first months. Aim of this study was to compare two different treatments (lactitol 60 g/day, rifaximin 1200 mg/day) with no-treatment in the prevention of post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy.

Methods

Seventy-five consecutive cirrhotics submitted to TIPS were randomized to receive either one of the above treatments or no-treatment. The main end-point was the occurrence of an episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy during the first month post-TIPS. Before the procedure and weekly thereafter the patients were evaluated by examining their mental status, asterixis, ammonia and trail-making-test Part-A (TMT-A).

Results

The three groups were comparable for age, sex, etiology, Child-Pugh-score, post-TIPS porto-systemic gradient, previous hepatic encephalopathy, basal values of ammonia and psychometric performance. Twenty-five patients developed hepatic encephalopathy (33%, CI 95% = 22–45%). One-month incidence was similar in the three groups (P = 0.97). Previous hepatic encephalopathy (Relative Hazard = 3.79;1.27–11.31) and basal-TMT-A Z-score > 1.5 (RH = 3.55;1.24–10.2) were predictors of post-TIPS encephalopathy at multivariate analysis. A < 5 mmHg porto-systemic gradient was also significantly related to the occurrence of encephalopathy.

Conclusions

Our data show that treatment with lactitol or rifaximin is not effective in the prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy during the first month after a TIPS.

Discussion

As far as we are aware, the association between SSF and OHE has not been investigated previously in patients with cirrhosis following TIPS. The findings of the current suggest that as SSF increases, the risk of OHE following a TIPS also increases. This indicated that SSF has potential as a clinical predictor of OHE after a TIPS.

Similar to our study, a previous study demonstrated that the SSF in patients with HE was significantly higher than those without HE (2098.56 vs. 1674.61 ml/min). This study indicated high SSF may be associated closely with an increased risk of HE in patients with cirrhosis following TIPS, which is in line with our results.

We used AG models to identify the risk factors for OHE after TIPS and showed that a high SSF and older age were independent predictors of OHE following TIPS. Therefore, we performed a sensitivity analysis for age, with the findings indicating that a high SSF had a greater impact on the progression of OHE in patients either younger or older than 52 years. The data showed that a high SSF was associated with an increased risk of OHE.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt flow reduction with adjustable polytetrafluoroethylene-covered balloon-expandable stents [^113GSJvi]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can effectively treat complications of portal hypertension, but excessive shunting can cause life-threatening hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic insufficiency. The present report describes a novel technique that allows for controlled and adjustable flow reduction through the TIPS via partial closure of the shunt with a balloon-mounted covered stent. The method results in clinical improvement of hepatic encephalopathy and hepatic insufficiency and immediate increase in the portosystemic pressure gradient. However, among the four patients described herein, survival beyond 1 year was seen in only one, who underwent liver transplantation after TIPS reduction.

Objective

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy due to overshunting. Techniques exist to secondarily reduce the shunt for refractory encephalopathy. The purpose of this article is to describe a technique for primary TIPS restriction using a balloon-expandable stent within the transvenous hepatic track followed by deployment of a self-expanding polytetrafluoroethylene-lined stent-graft within the balloon-expandable stent to create the TIPS.

Conclusion

This technique enables control over the degree of portosystemic shunting in elective TIPS creation.

BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Post-TIPS HE

HE is a common and often severe complication after TIPS placement. Incidence of new onset OHE or worsening of MHE after TIPS is approximately 20%–54%. Risk factors for post-TIPS HE are mainly described for uncovered stents in retrospective studies. Extensive prospective evidence is lacking and little evidence is available for covered stents. Prior HE episodes, increased CP score and increased age are possible risk factors, but there is no consensus about the exact limits. In patients with variceal bleeding, a TIPS diameter of 8 mm can decrease the incidence of post-TIPS HE compared with 10 mm.

The International Club of Ascites published their sixth position paper on PH in 2015. Both this group of international experts in PH as well as the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines have prioritised studies on treatment and prevention of (post-TIPS) HE on the research agenda because of the lack of strong evidence regarding primary prevention. Besides a missing strategy to prevent HE after TIPS placement, it is currently not possible to predict whether patients will suffer from post-TIPS HE. Moreover, possible biomarkers currently are lacking.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) — epidemiology and natural history in cirrhosis: The incidence and prevalence of HE are related to the severity of the underlying liver insufficiency and PSS, and in patients with cirrhosis, fully symptomatic overt HE (OHE) defines the decompensated phase of the disease. The prevalence of OHE at the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis is 10%-14% in general, 16%-21% in those with decompensated cirrhosis, and 10%-50% in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), while minimal HE (MHE) or covert HE (CHE) occurs in 20%-80% of patients with cirrhosis. The prevalence of HE in prehepatic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) is not well defined. The risk for the first bout of OHE is 5%-25% within 5 years after cirrhosis diagnosis; a previous bout confers a 40% cumulative risk of recurrence at 1 year, and recurrent OHE carries a 40% cumulative risk of another recurrence within 6 months despite lactulose; even mild cognitive dysfunction or mild electroencephalography (EEG) slowing is associated with approximately one bout of OHE per 3 years of survival. After TIPS, the median cumulative 1-year incidence of OHE is 10%-50%, and patients with HE accounted for approximately 110,000 hospitalizations.

### High stent shunt flow increases the incidence of overt-hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^112FZQH8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 1-year incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been reported to range from 10 to 50% in patients with cirrhosis after they have undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Severe HE, also referred to as overt-hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), is associated closely with a diminished quality-of-life, frequent hospital admissions, and increased mortality rates. Therefore, determining risk factors for OHE after a TIPS is of significant clinical importance.

In recent years, several studies have indicated that factors associated with a risk of HE post-TIPS include minimal hepatic encephalopathy, pre-TIPS portal venous pressure, older age, plasma international normalized ratio, serum creatinine levels, presence of diabetes, etiology of portal hypertension, as well as higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh scores. It is noteworthy that some studies also demonstrated that a smaller spontaneous portosystemic shunt (SPSS) area and SPSS embolism both reduced the occurrence of HE. These findings indicate a close association between high shunt flow and the development of HE. The inability of hepatocytes to process enteric neurotoxins plays a significant role in the association between SPSS and HE. It should also be noted that stent shunt is similar to SPSS and is a major contributor to HE after a TIPS. The above literature suggests that stent shunt flow (SSF) is associated with the occurrence of HE post-TIPS. Currently, the main method for assessing stent flow velocity (SFV) is ultrasound, with SSF obtained using formula [, where D is the diameter of the stent and V is the SFV]. However, there is limited research on the connection between SSF and OHE, although Li et al. reported that a high SSF led to a high incidence of HE. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the correlation between SSF and the risk of OHE in patients with cirrhosis who were treated with the TIPS procedure, as well as to evaluate the predictive value of SSF in identifying OHE.

### Complications during transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation [^111eHdB8]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation is a widely adopted treatment for complications of portal hypertension, including variceal hemorrhage and refractory ascites. The creation of a TIPS requires establishing a pathway from the portal vein to a hepatic vein or inferior vena cava through hepatic parenchyma, using a stent or stent graft to sustain patency of this pathway. Because it is a technically challenging procedure and patients may be critically ill with severe comorbidities, the risk of procedural complications and mortality is substantial. This article discusses known complications of the TIPS procedure and ways to minimize their occurrence.

### Pre-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) prediction of post-TIPS overt hepatic encephalopathy: the critical flicker frequency is more accurate than psychometric tests [^115Jtkdt]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) is a second-line treatment because of an increased incidence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). A better selection of patients to decrease this risk is needed and one promising approach could be the detection of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). The aim of the present prospective study was to determine whether pre-TIPS minimal hepatic encephalopathy was predictive of post-TIPS OHE and to compare Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Sum Score(PHES) and the Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) in this setting. From May 2008 to January 2011, 54 consecutive patients treated with TIPS were included. PHES and CFF were performed 1 to 7 days before and after TIPS at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 or until liver transplantation or death. Before TIPS, MHE was detected by PHES and CFF in 33% and 39% of patients, respectively. After the TIPS procedure, 19 patients (35%) experienced a total of 64 episodes of OHE. OHE developed significantly more often inpatients for whom an indication for TIPS had been refractory ascites, with a history of OHE or of renal failure, lower hemoglobin level, or MHE as diagnosed by CFF. Post-TIPS OHE was more accurately predicted by CFF than by PHES. Absence of MHE at CFF had a good negative predictive value (91%) for the risk of post-TIPS recurrent OHE, defined as the occurrence of three or more episodes of OHE or of one episode which lasted more than 15 days. The absence of pre-TIPS history of OHE and a CFF value equal to or greater than 39 Hz had a 100% negative predictive value for post-TIPS recurrent OHE.

Conclusion

Aiming to decrease the rate of post-TIPS HE, the use of CFF could help selecting patients for TIPS.

### Portal flow diversion based on portography is superior than puncture site in the prediction of overt hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS creation [^11773xJ6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is recommended as a standard procedure for treating portal hypertension-related complications in patients with cirrhosis. However, the high prevalence of postprocedural overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) limits the effectiveness and broad use of this procedure, with a reported incidence ranging from 10 to 50% within 1 year.

Diversion of undetoxified portal blood into the systemic circulation is one of the major mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of post-TIPS overt HE, which degree is related to the diameter and position of the stent. The association between stent diameter and overt HE has been well established, while the effect of stent position on the outcome has not been fully elucidated. An early randomized-controlled trial (RCT) and few observational studies suggested that puncture of the left branch of portal vein (PV) might decrease the risk of post-TIPS overt HE compared to the right branch, and the potential mechanism might be related to the unbalanced distribution of blood flow from splenic vein (SV) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in the intrahepatic portal system. However, this theory lacks of hemodynamic evidence and may not be applicable to all cirrhotic patients due to anatomic variation.

During TIPS procedure, portography is performed to evaluate the portal system after access from the hepatic vein to the PV, which clearly demonstrates distribution of blood flow from the SMV and SV to the PV and its tributaries, and from a hemodynamic point of view, this approach is more accurate than assuming all patients have the same pattern of intrahepatic blood distribution. Thus, the first aim was to describe the distribution of intrahepatic portal blood from SMV and SV under intraprocedural portography, and the second aim was to combine portal blood distribution with puncture site to determine the type of portal flow diversion and evaluate its prognostic value in the prediction of post-TIPS overt HE in cirrhotic patients undergoing TIPS placement.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for refractory ascites: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^1143QN3V]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Several randomized controlled trials have compared a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) with large-volume paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Although all agree that TIPS reduces the recurrence rate of ascites, survival is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of TIPS and large-volume paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites by means of meta-analysis of individual patient data from 4 randomized controlled trials.

Methods

The study population consisted of 305 patients: 149 allocated to TIPS and 156 to paracentesis. Cumulative probabilities of transplant-free survival and of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences assessed by log-rank test. The total number of HE episodes per patient was also compared between TIPS and paracentesis.

Results

Tense ascites recurred in 42% of patients allocated to TIPS and 89% allocated to paracentesis (P < .0001). Sixty-five patients in the TIPS group and 78 in the paracentesis group died. The actuarial probability of transplant-free survival was significantly better in the TIPS group (P = 0.035). Cox regression analysis performed in a subgroup of 235 patients (114 allocated to TIPS and 121 to paracentesis) showed that age, serum bilirubin level, plasma sodium level, and treatment allocation were independently associated with transplant-free survival. The average number of HE episodes was significantly higher in the TIPS group (1.13 ± 1.93 vs 0.63 ± 1.18; p = 0.006), although the cumulative probability of developing the first episode of HE was similar between the groups (P = 0.19).

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis of individual patient data provides further evidence to the previous meta-analyses of literature data showing that TIPS significantly improves transplant-free survival of cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.

### Risks and benefits of TIPS in HCC and other liver malignancies: a literature review [^1117zBFu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a well-validated treatment option for clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in the context of liver cirrhosis. Its high efficacy and safety in the management of treatment-refractory ascites and variceal bleeding have been extensively proven. Contraindications for TIPS include severe right heart failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and sepsis. However, the role of liver malignancy in TIPS is debatable. Mostly, primary liver malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) emerge from advanced liver diseases. Coexisting portal hypertension in HCC often results in limited treatment options and a poor prognosis.

Summary

Previous studies have shown that TIPS implantation in patients with HCC is technically feasible and is usually not associated with major adverse events. Furthermore, TIPS may help in bridging the time to liver transplantation in early HCC and allow for locoregional treatment in advanced HCC. However, several studies suggest that seeding tumour cells to the lungs by TIPS placement might worsen the prognosis.

Conclusions

TIPS placement in patients with coexisting liver malignancy remains a case-by-case decision, and there is no profound evidence allowing general recommendations. This review aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the potential risks and benefits of TIPS placement in patients with liver malignancies.

### Early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^113jQq7C]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is conflicting evidence on the benefit of early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) on the survival of patients with acute variceal bleeding (AVB).

Aim

To assess the effect of early TIPSS on patient prognosis.

Materials and Methods

We carried out a meta-analysis of trials evaluating early TIPSS in cirrhotic patients with AVB.

Results

Four studies were included. Early TIPSS was associated with fewer deaths [odds ratio (OR) = 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.17–0.83, P = 0.02], with moderate heterogeneity between studies (P = 0.15, I = 44%). Early TIPSS was not significantly associated with fewer deaths among Child-Pugh B patients (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.10–1.17, P = 0.087) nor among Child-Pugh C patients (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.10–1.11, P = 0.074). There was no heterogeneity between studies in the Child-Pugh B analysis (P = 0.6, I = 0%), but there was a high heterogeneity in the Child-Pugh C analysis (P = 0.06, I = 60%). Early TIPSS was associated with lower rates of bleeding within 1 year (OR = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.04–0.17, P < 0.001) both among Child-Pugh B patients, (OR = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.05–0.47, P = 0.001) and among Child-Pugh C patients (OR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.02–0.15, P < 0.001), with no heterogeneity between studies. Early TIPSS was not associated with higher rates of encephalopathy (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.50–1.42, P = 0.5).

Conclusion

Cirrhotic patients with AVB treated with early TIPSS had lower death rates and lower rates of clinically significant bleeding within 1 year compared with patients treated without early TIPSS. Additional studies are required to identify the potential risk factors leading to a poor prognosis after early TIPSS in patients with AVB and to determine the impact of the degree of liver failure on the patient's prognosis.

### First reports of clinical effects of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in four patients with cirrhotic ascites refractory to tolvaptan [^112GCrw2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment for RA includes TIPS, serial LVP plus albumin infusion, PV shunts, low-flow ascites pumps and liver transplantation. TIPS is an endovascular operation which is performed to create an intrahepatic tract between the hepatic and portal veins and can reduce the portal pressure. Compared with serial LVP, TIPS reduced the relapse of symptoms due to ascites and improves transplant-free survival. Selection of eligible patients is important for the success of TIPS creation. Child-Pugh class C, MELD score greater than 18, advanced age, cardiopulmonary insufficiency or sarcopeniahave a high risk for complications of TIPS creation. In addition, Bureau et al reported serum bilirubin value below 50 µmol/L and a platelet count above 75×10⁹/L is predictive of survival in patients with RA treated with TIPS. In this study, all patients were Child-Pugh grade B, MELD score was less than 18, and serum bilirubin and platelet count were within above criteria, indicating appropriate patient selection. We do not derive the exact mechanisms why these four patients responded to TIPS well. However, TIPS might be as effective in the tolvaptan-refractory patients as in the patients with RA as long as they fit the eligibility criteria of TIPS described above.

The larger diameter-stent can more reliably achieve the target hepatic venous pressure gradient. Whereas excessive shunting may induce hepatic dysfunction due to reduced effective hepatic blood flow and the development of encephalopathy. Therefore, it is important to select the appropriate diameter of the stent to balance the efficacy and complications of TIPS. A comparative study of 8 mm and 10 mm diameter stents showed no difference in the development of hepatic encephalopathy, but control of complications due to portal hypertension was superior with the 10 mm diameter stent. In this study, the stents used for two patients in TIPS placement were 10 mm and 12 mm each, which were effective in improving ascites and did not cause any hepatic encephalopathy or dysfunctions. This discrepancy is attributed to bare stents used in our country as different from a more popular stent-graft in Western countries. Because of more frequent restenosis of bare stents in TIPS, bigger stent diameters tends to be selected in our hospital.

### Prevention of hepatic encephalopathy by administration of rifaximin and lactulose in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): a multicentre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial (PEARL trial) [^1115rcjW]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Portal hypertension and TIPS

Liver cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension (PH). Complications of PH include (refractory) ascites and oesophageal or gastric variceal bleedings. These complications are severe and result in hospital admissions and decreased survival. Moreover, cirrhotic patients undergo physical deterioration due to undernutrition and muscle wasting and are physically frail.

A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) reduces PH, by decompression of the portal system through an artificial shunt from a intrahepatic portal vein to a hepatic vein. TIPS can be considered as therapy for refractory ascites and variceal bleeding. TIPS treatment for refractory ascites has a response rate, defined as improvement of ascites, of up to 85%. A meta-analysis showed improved survival of cirrhotic patients receiving a (uncovered) TIPS, with a decreased risk of refractory ascites and hepatorenal syndrome. However, these patients have an increased risk of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Improvement of survival was confirmed in a recent randomised controlled trial (RCT): 1-year transplant-free survival was significantly higher in patients who received TIPS (93%) compared with patients who were treated with large volume paracentesis (LVP) and albumin infusion (52%) and suggested that TIPS should be the first line of treatment of refractory ascites.

Another consequence of PH is the development of gastric or oesophageal varices. One-third of the patients who are diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and are compensated have oesophageal varices, and in patients presenting with ascites, this is the case in up to 60%. Seventy per cent of all upper gastrointestinal bleeding episodes in patients with cirrhosis are caused by variceal bleeding. In patients with multiple bleeds, high risk of treatment failure (recurrence of variceal bleed), or increased mortality risk (Child Pugh C (< 11 points) liver cirrhosis), a TIPS is a highly effective intervention (94%) to control bleeding. Hence, TIPS is a very effective intervention to treat complications of PH. However, also these patients are at risk for post-TIPS HE.

### The transhepatic endotoxin gradient is present despite liver cirrhosis and is attenuated after transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS) [^116ECrTN]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic translocation of gut-derived bacteria and their products is a risk factor for recurrent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and/or encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis. For decades, there has been great interest in unraveling the pathophysiology of bacterial translocation in cirrhosis. Experimental data derived from animal studies demonstrated portal and systemic bacteremia, predominantly Gram-negative organisms, in cirrhotic animals with portal hypertension. Research conducted 20–30 years ago suggested an important role for endotoxemia in liver cirrhosis, but the assays available at that time were less sensitive and human portal blood sampling is challenging. Recent detection of bacterial translocation during HIV infection, thought to result from increased gut permeability, provided a plausible cause of systemic immune activation; however, parallel studies in, HBV, HCV and HIV-HCV co-infection demonstrated that bacterial translocation is strongly associated with cirrhosis, raising questions of cause and effect. In this context, we and others have improved the sensitivity of standard LPS assays.

The implantation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has become a standard procedure for the treatment of complications of portal hypertension. Although of proven benefit in decompensated liver cirrhosis, TIPS is associated with significant mortality and morbidity from worsened hepatic encephalopathy and hematogenous infections. It is thought that these complications of TIPS are, in part, due to the diminished hepatic clearance of bacterial products, although the change in clearance has not been measured. The implantation of TIPS offers an opportunity to directly quantify LPS in various compartments of the human circulation including the portal vein.

Here, we assess concentrations of LPS and the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), L-arginine, in a cohort of patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing TIPS implantation to determine the transhepatic LPS gradient in vivo before and after TIPS.

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt with ePTFE-covered stentgrafts: incidence and predictors of shunt dysfunction [^117F4ifE]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the past 20 years, the introduction of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stents has significantly contributed to the widespread adoption of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), primarily due to a reduced incidence of stent dysfunction. However, there remains a risk of potential complications related to shunt function during follow-up, including both overfunction and underfunction of TIPS. Previous studies have reported stenosis or occlusion of TIPS in over 10% of cases. Additionally, the rate of revisions due to refractory hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been reported to range between 5 and 13% of patients. In such cases, TIPS revision is typically necessary, and several procedural options have been established. Few studies have focused specifically on reinterventions and their associated risk factors. As their focus was mainly on the first revision after TIPS, successive revisions during the long-term course are not reported in detail. The aim of this study was to investigate reintervention rates after TIPS using ePTFE-covered stent grafts during long-term follow-up. Beyond that, we aimed to identify risk factors related to mandatory TIPS revision and report on the respective interventional techniques.

### High stent shunt flow increases the incidence of overt-hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^111rWTkS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the study was a retrospective design based on previously collected data. Second, the admission of patients at different times resulted in variability in data collection. Third, the exclusion criteria of patients with a MELD score > 18 and no prior HE, and the high rates of viral hepatitis may make this cohort not generalizable to other populations. Finally, the grouping of patients was based on a cutoff value derived from our own patient cohort and was not validated in an external cohort. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate the relationship between SSF and OHE.

In summary, our study aimed to verify the potential association between SSF and OHE in patients with cirrhosis undergoing the TIPS procedure. We found that higher SSF levels were associated with an increased risk of OHE after TIPS. Furthermore, our findings indicated that SSF demonstrated greater predictive power for OHE compared with other indicators, including age, ammonia levels, Child-Pugh score, and MELD score. Therefore, we recommend that attention be given to the changes in SSF following TIPS, as effectively reducing SSF may play a crucial role in minimizing the occurrence of OHE in these patients.

A novel endovascular technique to reduce flow through a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is described in a patient with severe hepatic encephalopathy. This technique allows controlled and potentially adjustable partial closure of the TIPS without thromboembolic risk. The patient experienced a dramatic clinical improvement after the procedure.

Stent shunt flow and severity of overt-hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt

As stated above, a high SSF was associated with an increased risk of OHE. We, therefore, analyzed the relationship between SSF and different grades of HE and showed that the median SSF in patients with HE 4 was significantly higher than those with HE 2 or No OHE (P both < 0.05). In addition, the median SSF in patients with HE 3 was significantly higher than those with HE 2 or No OHE (P both < 0.05) (Fig. 4).

Risk factors of overt-hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt

AG model analysis was used to identify the risk factors for OHE after a TIPS and included SSF, age, diabetes, Child-Pugh score, MELD score, blood ammonia, and etiology of liver cirrhosis. The results of the multivariate analysis (likelihood ratio test = 15.16, P = 0.03; Wald test = 24.74, P = 8e−4; Score (log-rank) test = 14.96, P = 0.04; Robust = 15.25, P = 0.03) demonstrated that SSF [hazard ratio (HR), 1.002; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001–1.004; P < 0.05) and age (HR, 1.042; 95% CI, 1.012–1.072; P < 0.01) were independent predictors of OHE following a TIPS (Supplementary Table S1, Supplemental digital content 1).

### Hepatic encephalopathy as a predictor of survival in patients with end-stage liver disease [^1179nboB]. Liver Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an important component of hepatic decompensation, which reduces survival in patients with cirrhosis. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has been used to predict survival of patients with cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to determine whether HE is a predictor of survival of patients with cirrhosis and to examine the degree to which HE may add to the survival prediction of MELD. Patients with end-stage liver disease whose data were included in 2 databases were included in the analysis: 223 patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion, and 271 patients hospitalized with hepatic decompensation. In univariate analysis, HE grade 3 or higher was associated with a 3.7-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.9–7.3, P < 0.01) increase in the risk of death in the TIPS patients and HE grade 2 or higher was associated 3.9-fold increase (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.6–5.7, P < 0.01) in hospitalized patients. As expected, MELD and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores (with and without HE included) were also markedly associated with survival. When HE (grade 2 or higher) and MELD were considered together, HE remained strongly statistically significant in the hospitalized patients (hazard ratio = 2.6, 95% CI, 1.7–3.8, P < 0.01). The effect became smaller in the TIPS patients (hazard ratio = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7–1.6, P = 0.76). In conclusion, this retrospective study demonstrates that HE is an important event in the natural history of cirrhosis that affects subsequent survival of patients. HE may provide additional prognostic information independent of MELD, which warrants prospective validation.

BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension can suffer from variceal bleeding or refractory ascites and can benefit from a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common (20%–54%) and often severe complication. A prophylactic strategy is lacking.

Methods and analysis

The Prevention of hepatic Encephalopathy by Administration of Rifaximin and Lactulose in patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing placement of a TIPS (PEARL) trial, is a multicentre randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. Patients undergoing covered TIPS placement are prescribed either rifaximin 550 mg two times per day and lactulose 25 mL two times per day (starting dose) or placebo 550 mg two times per day and lactulose 25 mL two times per day from 72 hours before and until 3 months after TIPS placement. Primary endpoint is the development of overt HE (OHE) within 3 months (according to West Haven criteria). Secondary endpoints include 90-day mortality; development of a second episode of OHE; time to development of episode(s) of OHE; development of minimal HE; molecular changes in peripheral and portal blood samples; quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The total sample size is 238 patients and recruitment period is 3 years in six hospitals in the Netherlands and one in Belgium.

Ethics and dissemination

This study protocol was approved in the Netherlands by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam (2018–332), in Belgium by the Ethics Committee Research UZ/KU Leuven (S62577) and competent authorities.

Introduction

Cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension can suffer from variceal bleeding or refractory ascites and can benefit from a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).

### Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy after a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in cirrhotic patients [^112dkCQZ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the rate of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis after the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).

Patients and Methods

This study retrospectively reviewed 436 consecutive patients with cirrhosis receiving TIPS in our department from 2008 to 2016. By comparing two groups of patients, with or without DM, the incidence of developing overt HE after TIPS, as well as the correlation between diabetes and HE, was analyzed. Data were analyzed using the χ² tests, unpaired t-tests, logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier curves. After the initial data processing, we used a regression model to analyze whether or not DM is associated with the development of HE after TIPS.

Results

Of the 436 patients who underwent TIPS, 85 (19.5%) had diabetes at admission and 126 (28.9%) had HE after TIPS. Patients with DM more frequently had HE compared with those without DM (44.7 vs. 25.1%; P = 0.000). The logistic regression analysis showed that DM (P = 0.015) and age (P = 0.002) were independent risk factors for HE after TIPS. Finally, using the Kaplan-Meier curves, we found that diabetes significantly increases the incidence of overt HE (log-rank P = 0.026).

Conclusion

Similar to old age, DM may increase the risk of HE in cirrhotic patients after the creation of TIPS.

### Preoperative elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt for cirrhotic patients undergoing abdominal surgery [^116iDqm3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

By virtue of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis, in addition to the contribution from its etiologic agent (hepatitis B/C, alcohol, autoimmune), the cirrhotic patient is at risk for encephalopathy, ascites (infections and poor wound healing), increased pressures in portal circulation (bleeding), renal dysfunction (hepatorenal syndrome), cardiac dysfunction (high cardiac output leading to cirrhotic cardiomyopathy), electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia), respiratory issues (portopulmonary hypertension, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatopulmonary syndrome), malnutrition (poor wound healing), and poor tolerance to stress (surgery). One or more of these factors are together responsible for poor surgical outcomes in this population. Abdominal surgery in patients with cirrhosis is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite improvements in the surgical techniques, anesthesia and intensive care, major abdominal surgery in patients with cirrhosis remains a challenge. The mortality can be as high as 50% in emergent cases. The mortality and morbidity risk correlates with the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class of cirrhosis. Consequently, abdominal surgery may be contraindicated in some patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension who would otherwise have been candidates for potentially curative surgical procedures.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been used to manage complications of portal hypertension, including bleeding esophageal varix, refractory ascites and hepatic hydrothorax. Preoperative TIPS can theoretically improve outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension undergoing abdominal surgery by decompressing the varices and resolution of ascites, thus decreasing bleeding (perioperative), improving wound healing, and minimizing the infection risk.

In this review article, we have summarized the single-center reports describing the prophylactic use of TIPS in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

### Traumatic portacaval shunt: a rare complication to be considered in patients with encephalopathy [^112W8dJu]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In cases of liver trauma, confusion should prompt an investigation for hepatic encephalopathy related to a portosystemic shunt. Its closure may be necessary if conservative measures are insufficient. Conversely, if confusion or delirium is present or when the confusion is unrelated to a portosystemic shunt, as suggested by a normal blood ammonia level or low portacaval flow, conservative management may be appropriate.

In the literature, most post-traumatic shunts are small intrahepatic arterioportal shunts, that typically resolve over time. This case highlights a rare complication of high-grade liver injury: the portosystemic shunt. Such shunts increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy by diverting portal blood flow away from the liver, a mechanism well-documented in complications of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The precise pathophysiology of TIPS-related encephalopathy remains unclear, and symptom severity is unpredictable.

To date, only two cases of traumatic portacaval shunt have been reported. The first involved a young patient with blunt trauma to the right flank, who developed agitation, massive cerebral edema and brain death due to cerebral herniation. The second case described a patient with grade V liver laceration whose shunt, as in our case, was managed conservatively and resolved over 10 months.

Conservative management seems preferable when hemorrhage is not a concern. In the absence of portal hypertension, spontaneous regression of portacaval shunt is expected. However, in cases of severe neurological disturbances, such as confusion with cerebral edema on CT, without direct cranial trauma or without liver failure with fall of PT ratio level or liver bleeding, surgical closure of the shunt may be required. The patient's favorable baseline health likely facilitated recovery without major hepatic or renal intervention. However, outcomes may differ in older individuals or those with underlying comorbidities.

Early recognition of this rare but significant complication may help clinicians better understand unexplained neurological symptoms and guide appropriate management strategies, including surgical intervention.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^111vKbmL]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We then hypothesized that participants who develop more severe HE have less intrahepatic shunting at the time of their TIPS. To test this hypothesis, we compared the shift in metabolome within each participant before and after the TIPS procedure. In this analysis, those who already have significant intrahepatic shunting should have a low dissimilarity between their pre- and post-TIPS hepatic vein plasma metabolome, while those who have less shunting should have a higher dissimilarity. Within-participant dissimilarities between pre- and post-peripheral vein metabolome did not show any difference based on HE grade (Fig. 2c). Serendipitously, within-participant dissimilarities between pre- and post-hepatic vein metabolome are significantly different between participants with an HE grade of 0 versus participants with a grade of 1 or 2+ (Wilcoxon P = 0.027 and P = 0.036, respectively, Fig. 2d), despite no overall difference in hepatic vein blood metabolome before and after TIPS (Fig. 1b). This difference is also consistent when we remove HE grade 1 (Supplementary Fig. 4b, c). This change in the hepatic vein metabolome based on HE grade suggests that individuals with more dissimilarity in their metabolome after shunt placement, likely from a lack of pre-TIPS intrahepatic shunting, are at a higher risk of developing HE after the procedure (Fig. 2e).

### Outcome of children with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: a meta-analysis of individual patient data [^1165YWXk]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Over 25% of children displayed some degree of liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is expected to increase also in the pediatric population due to multiple reasons such as increase in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and increasing survival rates of congenital liver diseases.

The major limitation of this meta-analysis is the limited number of patients included with, moreover, a very heterogeneous spectrum of diseases included as well as varying therapeutic approaches including liver transplantation. This heterogeneity had substantial impact on the analysis, with a potential confounding of data. As stated, the reported cohorts from Europe, the US and Asia differed in terms of subsequent liver transplantation; thus, TFS data have to be interpreted carefully. Missing values from the retrospective cohorts, with, e.g. cirrhosis grading not being reported in each cohort, moreover, led to impaired statistical analyses. A higher number of censored observations compared to the moderate number of events (deaths/transplantation) made reasonable sub-analyses such as time-to-event impossible.

The applied methodology, by including original data provided by the authors, has a lot of advantages; however, as certain data were not available from the original data, some initially planned analysis such as impact on different levels on cirrhosis on outcome after TIPS could not be performed. Complications of TIPS creation such has right heart overload as well as hepatic encephalopathy were not routinely reported and certainly require further investigation. Another major drawback when interpreting the outcome after TIPS creation in children is the lack of an equivalent control group, with similar underlying disease, but either not undergoing portosystemic shunt treatment or children treated with surgical shunt procedures.

Given the rarity of the underlying disease, prospective controlled trials investigating TIPS in children are unlikely to take place in the foreseeable future; however, prospective registries investigating the course and clinical outcome in rare liver diseases are being established any may provide additional evidence.

### Predictors of occurrence and risk of hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS creation: a 15-year experience [^112kqVRy]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To identify clinical variables, including use of newer Viatorr TIPS endoprosthesis with controlled expansion (VCX) that may affect the occurrence and risk of hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation.

Methods

A total of 376 patients who underwent TIPS creation at our institution between 2003 and 2018 were retrospectively identified. Of these patients, 71 received a Viatorr controlled expansion endoprosthesis and 305 received a Viatorr TIPS endoprosthesis (older version without controlled expansion). Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify factors predicting the occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS creation; a Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess risk of HE through time to HE onset RESULTS: A total of 194 patients (52%) developed hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS creation, including 28 of 71 patients (39%) who received a VCX endoprosthesis. Older patient age and the use of Viatorr endoprosthesis without controlled expansion were significantly associated with the development of hepatic encephalopathy overall. Pre-TIPS pressure variables, patient age, plasma international normalized ratio, and model for end-stage liver disease score were risk factors for time to hepatic encephalopathy.

Conclusion

Several variables are mild predictors of early hepatic encephalopathy development after TIPS creation, and the use of VCX endoprosthesis in TIPS creation is associated with a modest lower risk of hepatic encephalopathy. These preliminary findings should be considered in regard to patient selection, endoprosthesis selection, and post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation monitoring for the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Evaluation and management of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts [^112xJ6Xe]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the evaluation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) and the management of dysfunctional shunts.

Conclusion

TIPS can become dysfunctional if stenosis develops in the shunt or the hepatic vein above the shunt. Screening allows detection of stenoses before portal hypertensive-related complications recur. Revision of stenotic shunts can be easily accomplished in most cases. Techniques for screening and revision will be discussed.

### Cerebral edema and hyperammonemia after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement in a cirrhotic patient [^114SR1cW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement has been widely performed for nearly two decades and has been shown to alleviate refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS is rarely severe; however, a risk of cerebral edema resulting from hyperammonemia after TIPS does exist. Here we describe a case demonstrating the development of severe hepatic encephalopathy with cerebral edema caused by hyperammonemia as a complication of TIPS in a patient with chronic liver disease with relatively preserved liver function.

### Intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS): evolving indications [^11592D6e]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a minimally invasive procedure used to manage complications of portal hypertension, including most frequently refractory ascites and variceal bleeding. While TIPS has established indications, contraindications, and procedural guidelines, its scope is expanding with advancements in technology and improved evidence-based patient selection criteria. This article reviews the current indications and contraindications for TIPS, examines potential expanding applications, and discusses consensus guidelines from organizations such as the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE), and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD).

Best practice advice on preoperative transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) — TIPS is not routinely recommended before surgical procedures in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension with abdominal conditions; small uncontrolled case series have demonstrated the ability to decompress collateral vessels with TIPS preoperatively in patients requiring deep pelvic or abdominal surgery; however, the absolute benefit of TIPS over conservative management is not well established.

### Endovascular shunt reduction in the management of transjugular portosystemic shunt-induced hepatic encephalopathy: preliminary experience with reduction stents and stent-grafts [^1176QELs]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety, feasibility, and midterm clinical outcome of the use of three types of reduction stents inserted to manage transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)-induced hepatic encephalopathy refractory to medical treatment.

Conclusion

The use of a covered reduction stent-graft results in a greater increase in portosystemic gradient immediately after reduction than does use of a bare reduction stent. Relief of TIPS-induced hepatic encephalopathy tends to be greater in patients with reduction stent-grafts than in those with bare reduction stents.

### High stent shunt flow increases the incidence of overt-hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^112hgRAv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was higher within 1 year after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in cirrhosis. While some findings showed that the shunt flow correlates with HE, it remains unknown whether the stent shunt flow (SSF) is associated with overt-hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). This study, therefore, investigated the association between SSF and OHE after a TIPS.

Methods

A digital color ultrasonic diagnostic device was used to measure stent flow velocity (SFV). The association between SSF and OHE was then examined using logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models. The predictive value of SSF for OHE was also assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

Of the 91 patients, 24 (26.4%) developed OHE after TIPS within 1 year. Patients with OHE post-TIPS had higher SSF than those without [2459 (2203–2490) ml/min vs. 2190 (1968–2363) ml/min; P = 0.001]. Multiple logistic regression showed interquartile range of SSF was associated positively with the risk of OHE after TIPS [odds ratio, 2.483; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.407–4.383; P = 0.002]. The Andersen-Gill model indicated SSF [hazard ratio (HR), 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001–1.004; P < 0.05] and age (HR, 1.042; 95% CI, 1.012–1.072; P < 0.01) were independent predictors of OHE after TIPS. SSF had higher predictive power for OHE than age, ammonia levels, Child-Pugh score, and model for end-stage liver disease score.

Conclusion

This study suggests high SSF may be associated closely with an increased risk of OHE in patients with cirrhosis following TIPS.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^117AvwJf]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

HE is a serious complication of liver disease, and TIPS placement can increase its risk. The etiology and treatment of HE have historically focused on ammonia homeostasis; however, ammonia levels are not universally predictive of the degree of HE and are not reliable in guiding treatment. In light of this incongruence, additional neurotoxins have been implicated, but no clinically applicable biomarker for HE severity has been validated. In this study, we used the latest methods in untargeted metabolomics with an expanded set of annotations to characterize metabolites implicated in changes post-TIPS that could lead to the development of HE. With further study, these compounds may be used as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for HE. Notably, the methods described herein are not limited to HE; they can be applied in virtually any disease process to identify involved metabolites, which can be investigated as biomarkers or targets for drug discovery.

Untargeted metabolomics allows us to compare metabolites within the peripheral and hepatic circulations before and after TIPS placement. Both peripheral and hepatic veins are important to our analysis. Whereas samples from the hepatic vein, which is much harder to access in patients, inform us of intrahepatic shunting and biochemical transformations that occur in the liver (through our ChemProp analysis), the peripheral vein samples, which are much easier to obtain, can help us determine whether specific metabolomic findings can be used as a potential biomarker of disease activity. In our study, we observed that the metabolome pre- to post-TIPS changes to a greater extent in the peripheral vein compared to the hepatic vein (Fig. 1b, c), and the metabolites contributing the most to these changes are bile acids (Fig. 1d–g and Supplementary Fig. 3). The surprisingly small differences in hepatic vein blood metabolome before and after TIPS suggests that the overall blood metabolome does not drastically change as a result of TIPS. However, participants with the greatest degree of dissimilarity in the pre- to post-TIPS hepatic vein metabolome went on to develop HE (Fig. 2d). The higher degree of metabolome dissimilarity in HE grades 1 and 2+ implicates a functional and perhaps structural difference in participants who developed HE, namely, intrahepatic shunting.

BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Analysis of outcome measures

A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be provided separately. Data will be analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Descriptive methods will be used to assess quality of data, homogeneity of treatment groups and endpoints. A p value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. A brief outline is given in the next paragraph.

Primary outcome measurement

The primary outcome, development of OHE within 3 months after TIPS placement determined by the West Haven criteria, will be compared between the intervention and placebo group. Percentage differences with corresponding 95% CI will be reported as absolute improvement in percentages.

Secondary outcomes

Secondary outcomes will be analysed using either a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data or a χ² test for categorical data, as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to determine transplant-free survival. Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to determine the length of time for the subjects to reach the primary or secondary endpoint with regards to OHE. Censoring will be applied in analysis for liver transplantation or death by any cause. When censoring is applied, Cox proportional hazards model will be used. Comparison of peripheral and portal blood samples at TIPS placement will be analysed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Repeatedly measured endpoints will be analysed with mixed models, for the time point(s) they are measured (see table 1).

### High stent shunt flow increases the incidence of overt-hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [^117GnsaQ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidence of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was higher within 1 year after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in cirrhosis. While some findings showed that the shunt flow correlates with HE, it remains unknown whether the stent shunt flow (SSF) is associated with overt-hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). This study, therefore, investigated the association between SSF and OHE after a TIPS.

Methods

A digital color ultrasonic diagnostic device was used to measure stent flow velocity (SFV). The association between SSF and OHE was then examined using logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models. The predictive value of SSF for OHE was also assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

Of the 91 patients, 24 (26.4%) developed OHE after TIPS within 1 year. Patients with OHE post-TIPS had higher SSF than those without [2459 (2203–2490) ml/min vs. 2190 (1968–2363) ml/min; P = 0.001]. Multiple logistic regression showed interquartile range of SSF was associated positively with the risk of OHE after TIPS [odds ratio, 2.483; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.407–4.383; P = 0.002]. The Andersen-Gill model indicated SSF [hazard ratio (HR), 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001–1.004; P < 0.05] and age (HR, 1.042; 95% CI, 1.012–1.072; P < 0.01) were independent predictors of OHE after TIPS. SSF had higher predictive power for OHE than age, ammonia levels, Child-Pugh score, and model for end-stage liver disease score.

Conclusion

This study suggests high SSF may be associated closely with an increased risk of OHE in patients with cirrhosis following TIPS.

### Racial disparities in transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure outcomes [^111g7cLo]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion plays an important role in the management of chronic liver disease and, specifically, complications of portal hypertension. The procedure achieves portal decompression through creation of a conduit between the hepatic and portal veins. Common indications for TIPS include bleeding oesophageal varices (EVB) and ascites refractory to conservative management.TIPS carries risk of significant morbidity including hepatic encephalopathy and early liver failure with resulting risk of mortality. Clinician judgement is therefore required to identify patients who can benefit from TIPS placement.

Recent studies have reported black race is an independent predictor of mortality following the TIPS procedure. Race was not the focus of these studies. Healthcare disparities have previously been reported in liver transplantation access, hepatocellular carcinoma management and management of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from the TIPS procedure with a focus on race and ethnicity.

### Coveredbare stents for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1141oy3V]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In the present meta-analysis, we found that covered stents not only significantly improved the shunt patency, but also significantly decreased the risk of death. Additionally, the risk of hepatic encephalopathy was not increased by the use of covered stents. Notably, the heterogeneity among studies was not statistically significant, suggesting that the statistical results should be stable. Although the findings were heterogeneous in some subgroup analyses, we should fully acknowledge that the results of subgroup meta-analyses were unpowered due to a small number of relevant studies.

Our findings were of importance in clinical practice and future trial design, because most indications for TIPS were established in the era of bare stents. For example, early evidence suggested that TIPS with bare stents should be superior to endoscopic and pharmacological treatment for decreasing the risk of variceal rebleeding, but inferior in relation to hepatic encephalopathy and not advantageous in terms of overall survival. Considering the benefits of covered stents, we had some confidence about the theoretical possibility that TIPS with covered stents would result in better survival. However, the evidence from at least three recent clinical trials with covered stents did not remarkably upgrade the role of TIPS for the prevention of variceal rebleeding. Sauerbruch and colleagues reported the results of a German multicenter prospective randomized trial regarding the prevention of variceal rebleeding in liver cirrhosis. The experimental group was TIPS with covered stents. The control group was hepatic-venous-pressure-gradient-guided medical-therapy prophylaxis (propranolol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate followed by variceal-band ligation and TIPS). They suggested that TIPS was more straightforward and prevented variceal rebleeding more effectively, but did not improve the survival. Luo and colleagues reported the results of a Chinese single-center randomized trial regarding the prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis with portal vein thrombosis. The experimental group was TIPS with covered stents. The control group was endoscopic-band ligation plus propranolol. They suggested that TIPS had a significantly lower risk of variceal bleeding, but a similar risk of hepatic encephalopathy and death. Holster and colleagues also reported the results of a Dutch multicenter prospective randomized trial regarding the prevention of variceal rebleeding in liver cirrhosis. The experimental group was TIPS with covered stents. The control group was endoscopic variceal ligation, or glue injection plus beta-blocker treatment. Similarly, they also suggested that TIPS had a significantly lower risk of variceal bleeding, but the risk of hepatic encephalopathy and death was not significantly different. Taken together, the results of each clinical trial did not favor the covered TIPS over the traditional first-line treatment option. Certainly, more accumulative data and subsequent meta-analyses should reiterate this.

### Coveredbare stents for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt: an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1127B6jw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the practice guideline suggested that TIPS with bare stents should be superior to large-volume paracentesis for controlling ascites, but inferior in treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and not advantageous in terms of overall survival. More recently, Bureau and colleagues have shown the preliminary results of an RCT examining TIPS with covered stents versus large-volume paracentesis plus albumin infusion in cirrhotic patients with recurrent ascites. They found a statistically significant difference in the transplant-free survival and a similar rate of hepatic encephalopathy between them. Specifically, TIPS with covered stents had a nearly twofold survival rate compared with large-volume paracentesis plus albumin infusion (93% versus 52%). Collectively, the use of covered stents might upgrade the role of TIPS in patients with refractory ascites.

Our meta-analysis suggested that the covered-stents group might have a lower risk of hepatic encephalopathy than the bare-stents group. This phenomenon might be explained by the consideration that the covered-stents group had a significantly lower risk of shunt dysfunction and recurrence of portal hypertension-related complications that were often the main precipitating factors for hepatic encephalopathy. However, we should be very cautious about whether the diameters of stents were comparable between the two groups. First, as thoroughly analyzed by Rossle and Mullen, a significant difference in the diameters of shunt observed in the RCT by Bureau and colleagues (10.5 ± 0.9 in the covered-stents group versus 11.7 ± 0.8 mm in the bare-stents group) might result in the difference in the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Second, in the RCT by Huang and colleagues, the diameter of stents was heterogeneous (10 mm in the bare-stents group and 8 mm in the covered-stents group). Third, in the RCTs by Perarnau and collegues and Wang and colleagues, the information regarding the diameter of stents was not available. Collectively, if the diameters of stents were similar between the two groups, we would be still unsure about the benefits of covered stents in the development of hepatic encephalopathy.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^115rEghq]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

With the knowledge that intrahepatic shunting likely plays a role in post-TIPS HE and that the most significant metabolomic changes occur among bile acids pre- to post-TIPS, we explored the relationship between bile acids and HE. The change in bile acid abundances in the peripheral and hepatic vein is greater in those who developed HE (Fig. 3c). This finding was confirmed upon examining bile acid changes as they relate to HE grade in the peripheral vein, which showed three conjugated hydroxylated bile acids were inversely correlated with the later development of HE (Fig. 4a). Patients who were hospitalized and treated for HE exacerbation had fluctuations in these specific bile acids that were consistent with their disease course (Fig. 4b, c). Combined, our results suggest that the increased risk of developing HE post-TIPS is related to the extent to which the bile acid abundance pool changes immediately post-TIPS. Closer inspection of these bile acids leads us to suspect that they are secondary conjugated glycine and taurine bile acids, with mtb 181 possibly corresponding to deoxycholic acid (DCA) or one of its isomers. These results suggest that bile acids play a protective role against the development of HE. Participants who did not develop post-TIPS HE did not demonstrate the decline in bile acids (Figs. 3c and 4), as they likely had intrahepatic shunting at the time of TIPS and had already acclimated to the portal toxins within systemic circulation. Those without intrahepatic shunting pre-TIPS are then exposed to the alterations in metabolites post-TIPS and are unable to further compensate for the portosystemic shunting. Of note, the methodology used here provides a snapshot of metabolites possibly implicated in HE. It is possible that toxins other than those captured by our method contribute to cognitive dysfunction in HE.

### Attitudes towards transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in Australia: a national survey of TIPS centres [^112qbk3t]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Questionnaire development

A survey questionnaire was developed to assess and benchmark the current landscape of TIPS services in Australia against agreed international guidelines and protocols. The online survey included 42 questions across four key domains: (1) service provision, (2) patient selection and indications, (3) best procedure practice, and (4) postoperative care (see online supplemental appendix 1).

Respondents provided consent by completing the initial screening and consent question. The questionnaire was completed anonymously, with the respondents not asked for any identifying details regarding themselves or their institution. If participants opted to provide identifiable information, this information was deleted prior to analysis.

Section 1 included questions concerning the participant's medical specialty and experience, as well as information about the institution in which they work, and the number of TIPS carried out from 2017 to 2019 (pre-COVID pandemic). Questions regarding the existence of available guidelines or standard of care protocols for TIPS and other questions related to service development were included. This was followed by clinical scenarios to explore institution-specific practices with respect to TIPS indications. Respondents were asked to answer based on the current practice at their institution. Scenarios were designed to include clinical indications for portal hypertensive bleeding, ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Furthermore, experts were asked about the utility of TIPS for rarer indications. Participants were given choices regarding what they thought would be usual practice at their workplace.

In the third section, participants were asked about their approach to patient selection, pre-TIPS workup and procedural aspects of TIPS, with a focus on preoperative assessment of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and preoperative cardiopulmonary and nutritional considerations. Participants were queried for their own individual expert opinion on mandatory investigations before TIPS, contraindications, and best procedural practices. The fourth section addressed postoperative care, regular observations and follow-up of patients after TIPS implantation.

### Spontaneous portosystemic shunts in liver cirrhosis: new approaches to an old problem [^1153rpGj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSSs) are communications among the venous portal system and the venous systemic circulation that bypass the liver. Their presence has been related to portal hypertension (PH). However, many questions regarding their prevalence, pathophysiology and repercussion in liver disease have not been completely elucidated.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been strongly linked with SPSS. – This severe complication implies hospitalizations, high morbidity and mortality and detriment in quality of life among patients and their relatives. The generation of nitrogenous-containing products in the gut, rich in ammonia, and the decrease in the cleaning function in liver cirrhosis are involved in its pathophysiology. With the presence of SPSSs, a direct bypass effect is added, amplifying the pass of toxins and the accumulation of ammonia.

The close relation between SPSSs and HE is also reflected in the definition of HE: "Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunt". Either persistent or recurrent HE has been linked to the presence of shunts in many studies. Moreover, the acquired experience with surgical shunts during the last century and lately with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) has allowed achieving important knowledge in HE pathophysiology that is also applicable to SPSSs.

In recent years, patients with cirrhosis have an easier and widespread access to noninvasive imaging techniques, not only ultrasound, but also abdominal contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which have facilitated the diagnosis of SPSSs. At the same time, SPSSs have been considered as a therapeutic target to reverse difficult cases of HE. More recently, special situations, as liver transplant (LT) or a broader TIPS indication, have posed new challenges, in which the role of SPSSs will have to be defined.

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive revision of the role of SPSSs in cirrhotic patients, focused on clinical aspects and current therapeutic management.

### Concurrent spontaneous portosystemic shunt embolization for the prevention of overt hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111zSypw]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Overt hepatic encephalopathy remains a serious complication after TIPS. Concomitant SPSS is associated with an increased risk of HE in patients treated with TIPS.

Purpose

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness and safety of the prophylactic embolization of SPSS at the time of TIPS creation.

Materials and Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched up to April 2023 to identify studies on the association between antegrade embolized SPSS before TIPS placement and the incidence of post-TIPS HE. Odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% CIs were used to identify significant differences in the outcomes.

Results

Four studies enrolling 1243 patients with cirrhosis who received TIPS for variceal bleeding were included. A meta-analysis revealed that TIPS without simultaneous SPSS embolization was associated with an increased risk of overt HE (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.32–4.38; p = 0.004). The risks of mortality (0.79, 95% CI 0.58–1.07; p = 0.13), variceal rebleeding (0.94, 95% CI 0.66–1.34; p = 0.74) and shunt dysfunction (1.40, 95% CI 0.51–3.83; p = 0.51) did not significantly differ among the groups.

Conclusion

SPSS prevalence was associated with an increased risk of overt HE after TIPS. Concurrent antegrade SPSS embolization during TIPS creation reduced the risk for overt HE without increasing other complications.

### Efficacy and safety of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation for Budd-Chiari syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zTXcE]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the critical role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the management of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS), as the data with respect to the safety and outcome of TIPS in patients with BCS are scarce because of the rarity of the disease.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive search of literature of various databases from 2000 to October 2021 was conducted for studies evaluating the outcome of TIPS in patients with BCS. The primary outcomes of the analysis were technical and clinical success, adverse events and mortality associated with TIPS, dysfunction of TIPS, need for TIPS revision, need for liver transplantation (LT), and 1-year survival.

Results

A total of 33 studies (1,395 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled rates and 95% confidence intervals of various outcomes were 98.6% (97.6–99.7) for technical success, 90.3% (86.0–94.6) for clinical success, 10.0% (6.5–13.6) for major adverse events, 0.5% (0.2–1.0) for TIPS-related mortality, 11.6% (7.8–15.4) for post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy (HE), 40.1% (32.5–47.7) for TIPS dysfunction, 8.6% (4.9–12.4) for the need for TIPS revision, 4.5% (2.8–6.2) for the need for LT, and 94.6% (93.1–96.1) for 1-year survival. Publication bias was seen with all outcomes except for post-TIPS HE, TIPS dysfunction, and the need for LT.

Conclusions

The existing literature supports the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of TIPS in the treatment of BCS. Deciding the optimal timing of TIPS in BCS needs further studies.

### Attitudes towards transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in Australia: a national survey of TIPS centres [^115dhAcw]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

More than four decades after its inception, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has become widely accepted as a minimally invasive therapeutic option for specific complications of portal hypertension. Despite a low level of invasiveness when compared with surgical portosystemic shunts, high efficacy, and a favourable safety profile even in vulnerable patients, TIPS uptake appears to be low in Australia. This has likely been fuelled by anecdotal reports of shortcomings combined with local availability of technical TIPS expertise in Australia. Consequently, little is known about TIPS services in Australia and its outcomes.

Over recent years, clinical practice guidelines have increasingly recognised advances related to procedural techniques, TIPS stent technology, and the expanding list of indications. However, there remains an absence of up-to-date Australian guidance on TIPS referral pathways and practice guidelines. As a result, it is unclear whether current practices across institutions are in line with international standards.

To address the paucity of real-life data regarding TIPS indications, performance, patient selection, and management, we surveyed TIPS centres in Australia. Survey results were used to assess existing practices and to benchmark the current landscape of TIPS services against international guidelines and standards.

### Portosystemic shunt placement reveals blood signatures for the development of hepatic encephalopathy through mass spectrometry [^1143hULt]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Post-TIPS HE severity is higher in participants with potentially less intrahepatic shunting

The surprisingly small difference observed between the pre- and post-hepatic vein metabolome strongly indicates considerable intrahepatic shunting is already occurring in most participants prior to undergoing TIPS. The shunting is necessarily intrahepatic, because the blood being sampled comes directly from the hepatic vein and thus would not include other portosystemic shunts such as esophageal varices or splenorenal shunts.

To explore how this could affect the future development of HE, we analyzed metabolome changes based on the worst HE grade within a year after the TIPS procedure. Metabolome dissimilarities across participants post-TIPS for peripheral vein and hepatic vein show no significant differences for any of the pairwise HE grade comparisons (PERMANOVA all pairwise P > 0.05), although the spread of points increases with increasing severity for just the hepatic vein samples (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4a). To ensure that this relationship between HE grade and variability was not due to reduction in portal hypertension after TIPS, we compared HE grade and changes in direct portal vein pressure and did not see a significant association (Fig. 2b).

### Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in the management of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome [^117Bes2z]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Ascites is the most common complication of liver cirrhosis and when it develops mortality is 50% at 5 years, apart from liver transplantation. Large volume paracentesis has been the only option for ascites refractory to medical treatment. The role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in the management of diuretic-resistant ascites has been evaluated in many cohort studies and five randomized trials up to now, clearly showing improvement in natriuresis and clinical efficacy. It, however, remains unclear how transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt affects survival and quality of life, because hospital admissions owing to worsening encephalopathy may counterbalance the reduced need of paracentesis. What is clear is that the patient selection is critical. About 30% of patients with ascites develop hepatorenal syndrome at 5 years, leading to high mortality in its severe and progressive form. As its main pathogenetic factor is derangement of circulatory function owing to portal hypertension, these patients may benefit from transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, but this has been shown only in small series, in which mortality remains very high, owing to the underlying poor liver function.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications… [^113qMfar]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatic Encephalopathy Hepatic encephalopathy represents a potentially reversible decrease in neuropsychiatric function caused by acute and chronic liver disease, occurring predominantly in patients with portal hypertension. The onset often is insidious and is characterized by subtle and sometimes intermittent changes in memory, personality, concentration, and reaction times. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, all other etiologies of altered mental status must be effectively ruled out. 7 Therapy should be directed toward improving mental status via bowel cleansing with lactulose orally or with enemas. One randomized trial demonstrated that diets with normal protein content can be followed safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis, and that protein restriction has no beneficial effect during such episodes. 11In patients who are refractory to lactulose alone, neomycin can be added.

Increases in the ratio of plasma aromatic amino acids to branched-chain amino acids as a consequence of hepatic insufficiency also may contribute to encephalopathy. One meta-analysis suggested that mental recovery was consistently more rapid in patients whose treatment included a branched-chain amino acid infusion; three studies found lower mortality rates in patients who received this treatment, and two others suggested that the treatment increased mortality. 18 Risk factors for early rebleeding include age older than 60 years, renal failure, large varices, and severe initial bleeding.

18 A retrospective study showed that in-hospital mortality of patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding decreased from 43 percent in 1980 to 15 percent in 2000, in concurrence with an early and combined use of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies and short-term antibiotic prophylaxis.
19. 21The pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome is not completely understood, but it is likely the result of an extreme underfilling of the arterial circulation secondary to arterial vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation. 22Although hepatorenal syndrome can occur with most forms of severe hepatic disease, patients with primary biliary cirrhosis appear to be relatively protected. 23.
