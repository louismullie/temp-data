## Question

Three days after hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis, an 87-year-old woman refuses insulin injections. She says that her medical condition has declined so much that she no longer wishes to go on living; she is nearly blind and will likely require bilateral leg amputations. She reports that she has always been an active person and does not see how her life will be of value anymore. She has no family and most of her friends are sick or deceased. On mental status examination, she is alert and cooperative. She accurately describes her medical history and understands the consequences of refusing insulin. There is no evidence of depression. She dismisses any attempts by the physician to change her mind, saying that the physician is too young to understand her situation. She says, "I know I will die, and this is what I want". Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer Choices:
A. Discharge the patient after she has signed an "against medical advice" form
B. Seek a court order to appoint a legal guardian
C. Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it
D. Admit to the psychiatric unit

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an 87-year-old woman with diabetes who, three days after DKA, is refusing insulin and stating she wants to die, and to choose the best next step among four options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether she has decision-making capacity. Then, I should verify the ethical and legal implications of respecting a refusal of life-sustaining treatment. Next, I will consider whether her request aligns with a desire to hasten death and how that should be handled. After that, I need to check whether any of the proposed options violate ethics or law. Finally, I will integrate guideline-based care for older adults with diabetes facing end-of-life decisions and outline the correct next step with documentation and supports in place.

> Let me first confirm capacity, because everything hinges on it. She is alert, cooperative, accurately recounts her history, understands the consequences of refusing insulin, and can communicate a choice; there is no evidence of depression or cognitive impairment, which supports intact decision-making capacity by the standard four abilities: understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expression of choice, so she has the right to refuse treatment even if it will lead to death [^137b8c70] [^2be196bc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "wanting to die" equaling suicidality or lack of capacity. I should verify the nuance here. A reasoned, value-based refusal of life-sustaining treatment is not the same as suicidal ideation; when patients express a wish to hasten death, the appropriate response is enhanced palliative care, expert symptom control, and counseling, not psychiatric hospitalization or coercion, and clinicians are not compelled to provide treatments that conflict with patient values or their own moral convictions [^45e1be81] [^cf2088ad].

> Next, I should review the legal and ethical framework. Competent adults have a constitutional and common-law right to refuse medical treatment, including life-sustaining therapy, and this right is robustly protected in end-of-life ethics and law; forcing treatment without consent violates autonomy and could constitute battery, so options that override her refusal are inappropriate absent a finding of incapacity or an emergency exception, which does not apply here [^5deb3395] [^cf2088ad].

> I will now examine each option against this framework. Discharging her AMA is premature because we have not yet offered a medically acceptable alternative that respects her wishes; seeking a court order for guardianship is unjustified without evidence of incapacity; admitting her to psychiatry would be inappropriate because there is no mental illness impairing capacity; offering insulin and allowing refusal is the only option that honors informed consent, preserves autonomy, and remains within professional ethics and the law [^137b8c70] [^cf2088ad].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical context and guideline alignment. In older adults with diabetes, especially near the end of life, standards emphasize comfort, avoidance of burdensome monitoring, and deintensification of therapy; for someone with severe complications and a reasoned preference to forgo insulin, the focus should shift to palliative goals, symptom prevention, and dignity rather than aggressive glycemic control, which reinforces that accepting her refusal is consistent with best practice [^eeb8fa98] [^f37c1345] [^d8942abd].

> I should double-check the practical steps to ensure we do this safely and ethically. The correct next step is to offer insulin while accepting her refusal, document the informed refusal conversation including her understanding of consequences, involve ethics or palliative care for support, and arrange comfort-focused care with appropriate discharge planning; if she lacks reliable outpatient support, hospice or skilled nursing placement may be appropriate, but that follows after respecting her decision rather than forcing treatment or discharge AMA [^cf2088ad] [^748c2526].

> But wait, what if the team fears liability for allowing a preventable death? I need to ensure the documentation is airtight: record capacity assessment, the informed refusal discussion, the patient's values and goals, and consultation notes; this demonstrates that we respected autonomy, provided appropriate counseling, and followed ethical and legal standards, which protects both the patient and the clinicians in this scenario [^137b8c70] [^cf2088ad].

> Final answer: C. Offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it, because she has capacity, her refusal is ethically and legally valid, and the appropriate response is to honor her autonomy while providing palliative, comfort-focused care and thorough documentation [^137b8c70] [^cf2088ad] [^eeb8fa98].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it** [^notfound], because she has decision-making capacity and the right to decline life-sustaining treatment [^5deb3395]. The team should document her understanding of the consequences, engage in shared decision-making [^1642ee51], and involve palliative care to prioritize comfort and dignity [^b177f18c]. Discharging AMA or seeking guardianship is inappropriate without evidence of incapacity, and psychiatric admission is not indicated without signs of depression or suicidality [^137b8c70].

---

## Ethical and legal considerations

- **Decision-making capacity**: The patient demonstrates understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and communication, indicating intact capacity [^137b8c70].

- **Autonomy and informed consent**: Competent patients have the right to refuse treatment, even life-sustaining therapy [^5deb3395].

- **Legal implications**: Forcing treatment without consent constitutes battery; discharge AMA is inappropriate without offering acceptable alternatives [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Shared decision-making**: Engage the patient in discussions about goals, values, and preferences [^1642ee51].

- **Palliative care involvement**: Prioritize comfort, symptom control, and dignity in line with end-of-life care principles [^b177f18c].

- **Documentation**: Record the patient's understanding of consequences and the rationale for refusing treatment [^notfound].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Discharge AMA | Inappropriate without offering acceptable alternatives; violates autonomy | Inappropriate |
| B. Court order for guardian | No evidence of incapacity; unnecessary legal intervention | Inappropriate |
| C. Offer insulin, allow refusal | Respects autonomy, aligns with ethics and law | Appropriate |
| D. Psychiatric admission | No evidence of depression or suicidality | Inappropriate |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it**, documenting her informed decision and involving palliative care to ensure comfort and dignity [^b177f18c]. This approach respects autonomy, adheres to ethical and legal standards, and aligns with clinical guidelines.

### Trends in diabetic ketoacidosis hospitalizations and in-hospital… [^74873ad7]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary What is already known about this topic. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of diabetes, a disease that affects approximately 30 million persons in the United States. DKA is more common among persons with type 1 diabetes. What is added by this report. What are the implications for public health practice. DKA is a life-threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes. Prevention measures, such as diabetes self-management education, might help reverse the increasing trend in DKA, especially in persons aged < 45 years who have the highest DKA rates. Altmetric: Citations: 1). Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening but preventable complication of diabetes characterized by uncontrolled hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and increased ketone concentration that occurs most frequently in persons with type 1 diabetes.

CDC's United States Diabetes Surveillance System indicated an increase in hospitalization rates for DKA during 2009–2014, most notably in persons aged < 45 years. This increase in DKA hospitalization rates is concerning because DKA is a life-threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes. Despite the increase in DKA hospitalization rates, however, in-hospital mortality among persons with DKA consistently decreased over the study period. Identification of factors contributing to the increase in hospitalizations for DKA might help target prevention efforts. In the early 2000s, an increase in DKA cases among persons with obesity and type 2 diabetes was reported. These patients had impaired insulin levels but lacked typical autoimmune markers of type 1 disease, and their beta-cell function recovered quickly after treatment. This disease type, named ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, has features of both type 1 and type 2 disease.

Other variants of diabetes have been described, but no evidence that rates of these disease variants are increasing and thus contributing to the increased DKA hospitalization rates could be found. DKA hospitalizations in the United States have increased among all age groups, with the highest rates among persons aged < 45 years. Although the continued decline in in-hospital DKA mortality is encouraging, further work might help identify populations at risk. Evidence-based, targeted prevention measures, such as diabetes self-management education and support might help reverse the trend in this potentially life-threatening but avoidable complication of diabetes.

### Brittle diabetes revisited: a description of erratic and difficult-to-control diabetes in an elderly woman with type 1 diabetes [^da8f2c3e]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

'Brittle diabetes' is frequently attributed to psychological stressors causing insulin omission in young women with Type 1 diabetes. It has received little attention in the recent medical literature.

Case Report

We report the case of an 87-year-old woman who had recurrent episodes of unexplained diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite frequent inpatient monitoring of capillary glucose, her blood glucose levels remained erratic. She experienced a total of 12 episodes of ketoacidosis (some occurring during hospitalization), with 11 episodes occurring over a 3-month period. Several episodes of ketoacidosis required care in a high-dependency unit and up to 32 h of intravenous insulin and fluids. Extensive investigations failed to identify any underlying cause of the recurrent ketoacidosis. Ultimately, the introduction of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump resulted in improved glycaemic control and avoided the need for further hospitalizations.

Conclusion

Individuals of advanced age can benefit from insulin pump therapy. The original definition of 'brittle diabetes' referred to patients whose lives were 'constantly disrupted by episodes of hypo- or hyperglycaemia'. Our case reminds us that this clinical entity can result from altered biology and is not always related to psychological stressors.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy [^078098a1]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The development of diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy is a medical emergency, requiring treatment in an intensive care setting. Both the mother and the fetus are at risk for significant morbidity and mortality. Physiologic changes unique to pregnancy provide a background for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis. An understanding of these physiologic changes assists in the management of the two patients being treated. Treatment of the patient with diabetic ketoacidosis includes insulin therapy and careful fluid management; recommendations for management are presented.

Patients

Pregnant women, either with preexisting diabetes or with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Prompt recognition of the clinical manifestations of diabetic ketoacidosis, followed by appropriate, timely treatment will optimize outcome for the pregnant woman and her fetus.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^1c4044c1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^68da76b3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that presents commonly to the emergency department. Severe DKA has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is incumbent on the emergency clinician to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of the adult patient with severe DKA.

Discussion

DKA is a condition found most commonly in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis present rather than absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent the complications that can occur.

Conclusions

DKA is a medical condition that has the potential for significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### Diabetes care in the hospital: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^c54599f2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state — clinical management details: Presentations vary and include euglycemic DKA defined as plasma glucose levels < 200 mg/dL (< 11.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ketosis and metabolic acidosis, necessitating individualized treatment based on careful clinical and laboratory assessment. In critically ill and hemodynamically unstable individuals with DKA or HHS, continuous intravenous insulin is the standard of care, and successful transition to subcutaneous insulin requires administering basal insulin 2–4 h before stopping the intravenous insulin to prevent recurrence and rebound hyperglycemia. For mild or moderate DKA, there is no significant difference in outcomes for intravenous human regular insulin versus subcutaneous rapid-acting analogs when combined with aggressive fluid management, and selected individuals with uncomplicated DKA may sometimes be treated with subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin analogs in the emergency department or step-down unit. The use of bicarbonate in DKA made no difference in the resolution of acidosis or time to discharge, and its use is generally not recommended.

### Normoglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy [^7ee69d62]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis in pregnancy is usually the same as in nonpregnant women, although the blood glucose may not be as high as in the nongravid state. We report a case of a pregnant woman who developed diabetic ketoacidosis with a normal blood glucose and review the pertinent medical literature. A 29-year-old woman with type I diabetes developed diabetic ketoacidosis during induction of labor. She had a glucose level of 87 mg per 100 mL with ketonuria, a metabolic acidosis, and an anion gap of 20 mmol l(-1). Normoglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis during pregnancy is truly unusual but can occur with relatively low, or even normal, blood sugars and necessitates prompt recognition and treatment. In this case, the combination of an initial episode of hypoglycemia and subsequent blood glucose levels below 95 mg per 100 mL led to a prolonged delay in the initiation of a planned insulin infusion for insulin coverage during the induction of labor. A significant ketoacidosis consequently developed, despite the absence of even a single elevated blood glucose measurement. This case illustrated the importance of not withholding insulin in a patient with type I diabetes for more than a few hours even if the blood glucose is normal.

### Strawberry pink blood: hypertriglyceridaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus [^34e1aa0f]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 54-year-old woman with insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus presented with acute shortness of breath and drowsiness on a background of polydipsia, weakness and significant weight loss. One year ago, she had decided to stop her insulin and other medications and adopt lifestyle modifications instead. Initial emergency department (ED) blood samples were highly lipaemic and appeared strawberry pink. She was eventually diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with severe hypertriglyceridaemia, intubated for airway protection, and managed with fluid resuscitation and intravenous insulin to good effect. We share an uncommon DKA presentation at the ED. History was limited as the patient was drowsy and minimally communicative. Physical examination was unremarkable. Blood investigations were also delayed in view of the need for additional centrifugation. These contributed to a paucity of information in the acute setting and resulted in a diagnostic challenge.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^5ca0d804]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Key action statement 1 — Clinicians must ensure that insulin therapy is initiated for children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are ketotic or in diabetic ketoacidosis and in whom the distinction between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM is unclear; and, in usual cases, should initiate insulin therapy for patients who have random venous or plasma blood glucose (BG) concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dL or whose HbA1c is > 9%. This is a Strong Recommendation with preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents [^98766ad9]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis management and short-term insulin use — Of adolescents in whom T2DM is subsequently diagnosed, 5% to 25% present with ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis must be treated with insulin and fluid and electrolyte replacement, and patients in whom ketoacidosis is diagnosed require immediate treatment with insulin and fluid replacement in an inpatient setting under the supervision of a physician who is experienced in treating this complication. Youth and adolescents with T2DM and poor glycemic control (BG concentrations ≥ 250 mg/dl or HbA1c > 9%) but lacking evidence of ketosis or ketoacidosis may also benefit from initial treatment with insulin, at least on a short-term basis, and many patients with T2DM can be weaned gradually from insulin therapy and subsequently managed with metformin and lifestyle modification. When diabetes type is uncertain, these patients are best managed initially with insulin therapy while appropriate tests are performed to differentiate between T1DM and T2DM, and the care of such patients should be supervised by a physician experienced in treating diabetic patients with insulin.

Special considerations/patients

In the setting of severely uncontrolled diabetes with catabolism, defined as fasting plasma glucose levels > 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/dl), random glucose levels consistently above 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), A1C above 10%, or the presence of ketonuria, or as symptomatic diabetes with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, insulin therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention is the treatment of choice. Some patients with these characteristics will have unrecognized type 1 diabetes; others will have type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency. Insulin can be titrated rapidly and is associated with the greatest likelihood of returning glucose levels rapidly to target levels. After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels decreased, oral agents can often be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) — strength of recommendation classifications and interpretations specify that "1 — Strong recommendation for or against" applies when "Desirable consequences CLEARLY OUTWEIGH the undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with patient interpretation that "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", clinician guidance that "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", and policy-maker interpretation that "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". It also defines "2 — Conditional recommendation for or against" when "Desirable consequences PROBABLY OUTWEIGH undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with patient interpretation that "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not", clinician guidance that "Clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual and that clinicians must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences", and policy-maker interpretation that "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision-making is appropriate".

### Insulin initiation: bringing objectivity to choice [^9207db17]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

The choice of initial insulin is often dictated by subjective criteria: the "severity" of diabetes, the ability of the person with diabetes to self inject, at specific times of the day, and the physician's personal experience. No objective criteria have been evolved by any expert body so far to help guide clinicians make an appropriate, and accurate, choice of initiating insulin. Neither have large studies been able to shed light on the preferred type of insulin regime for a particular individual. This communication suggests various objective parameters which may be used to inform this decision.

### Does a ketogenic diet have a place within diabetes clinical practice? Review of current evidence and controversies [^fe9e23ba]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Carbohydrate restriction has gained increasing popularity as an adjunctive nutritional therapy for diabetes management. However, controversy remains regarding the long-term suitability, safety, efficacy and potential superiority of a very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet compared to current recommended nutritional approaches for diabetes management. Recommendations with respect to a ketogenic diet in clinical practice are often hindered by the lack of established definition, which prevents its capacity to be most appropriately prescribed as a therapeutic option for diabetes. Furthermore, with conflicted evidence, this has led to uncertainty amongst clinicians on how best to support and advise their patients. This review will explore whether a ketogenic diet has a place within clinical practice by reviewing current evidence and controversies.

### Triaging and initial treatment in the patient with suspected type 2 diabetes [^23f6b893]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Insulin titration protocol: weaning — manage insulin reduction with the following steps and thresholds. If still on MDI, stop short acting insulin and contact approximately every 3 days to review glucoses. Wait until fasting numbers are < 100 mg/dl for at least 2–3 days in a 5–7 day period. If so, cut back long-acting insulin dose by 20%/10 units, but may consider 30%/15–20 units if glucoses are 80 mg/dl or less, and consider reliability of patient contact when making the decision to more aggressively wean insulin. Once the dose is down to 0.1–0.2 units/kg/day, consider stopping, and consider using a small decrease in insulin as a motivational factor to continue to maintain contact. If patient was lost to follow-up between onset visit and follow-up visit, but has an HbA1c < 6% 3 months+ after diagnosis and is on full-dose metformin (or pioglitazone), stop long-acting insulin with careful monitoring after. If HbA1c is 6.5–7% at the next visit, add a second agent.

### The role of patients: shared decision-making [^77debde9]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Shared decision-making affords patients and their families the autonomy to make difficult decisions after receiving comprehensive information about medical facts and treatment options. It is essential that patients' values are respected. The essential steps include first informing patients of the need for a decision, then explaining the various facts involved; after which, it is important to elicit patients' preferences and goals. Once the treatment options and outcomes important to patients are identified, an actual decision can be made. This activity is complex and requires a commitment of time and is enhanced through employment of a multidisciplinary team approach.

Post-episode care after diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) includes social and access screening and referral, and consideration of technology access: Individuals who have experienced DKA or HHS should be screened for social determinants of health that can contribute to or trigger these complications, including inadequate access to insulin, other glucose-lowering medications, and diabetes-durable medical equipment, and referred to appropriate health care and/or community services. Access to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may also decrease risk of DKA recurrence.

### Can the patient decide? Evaluating patient capacity in practice [^2be196bc]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Physicians assess the decision-making capacity of their patients at every clinical encounter. Patients with an abrupt change in mental status, who refuse recommended treatment, who consent too hastily to treatment or who have a known risk factor for impaired decision-making should be evaluated more carefully. In addition to performing a mental status examination (along with a physical examination and laboratory evaluation, if needed), four specific abilities should be assessed: the ability to understand information about treatment; the ability to appreciate how that information applies to their situation; the ability to reason with that information; and the ability to make a choice and express it. By using a directed clinical interview or a formal capacity assessment tool, primary care physicians are able to perform these evaluations in most cases.

WHY SHARE DECISIONS: BEYOND THE ETHICAL IMPERATIVE

SDM is supported by evidence from 86 randomized trials showing knowledge gain by patients, more confidence in decisions, more active patient involvement, and, in many situations, informed patients elect for more conservative treatment options. We illustrate the arguments in favor of SDM by providing two hypothetical cases where more than one reasonable treatment option exist — see cases 1 and 2. They illustrate that informed preferences are an optimal goal because the decisions made will be better understood, based on more accurate expectations about the negative and positive consequencesand more consistent with personal preferences.

### Current and new treatment options for adults recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes [^cdca37fd]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

Grade strength of recommendation classifications — "1 — Strong recommendation for or against" and "2 — Conditional recommendation for or against" — include criteria and stakeholder interpretations. For "1 — Strong recommendation for or against", the criteria are "Desirable consequences clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with interpretations: patients — "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not"; healthcare providers — "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; policymakers — "The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guidelines could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For "2 — Conditional recommendation for or against", the criteria are "Desirable consequences probably outweigh undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with interpretations: patients — "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not"; healthcare providers — "Clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual patient and that clinicians must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences". and "Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; policymakers — "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate".

Older adults with diabetes — palliative and end-of-life care — for people with diabetes receiving palliative care and end-of-life care, the focus should be to avoid hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia while reducing the burdens of glycemic management; thus, as organ failure develops, the treatment plan will have to be deintensified and one or more agents will need to be discontinued; at the end of life, most agents for type 2 diabetes may be discontinued, and there is, however, no consensus for the management of type 1 diabetes in this scenario.

Literature reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, letters to the editor and commentaries, and animal studies were excluded. However, prior systematic reviews and literature reviews were assessed for potential studies that were eligible for inclusion. Finally, we excluded conference abstracts as they did not contain sufficient information to properly assess the study quality. After removing duplicates, two independent reviewers (AA and TM) screened the titles and abstracts of identified publications, and any publication deemed potentially relevant by either reviewer was carried forward to a full-text review. Discrepancies during full-text review between reviewers were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer (OY).

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed for all included studies by two independent reviewers (AA and TM), and disagreements were resolved through further discussion or by a third reviewer (OY). First, we extracted information regarding the study design, population characteristics (population size, location of the study, study period, body mass index [BMI]), precipitants of DKA, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and outcomes of interest (length of hospital stay, time to resolution of DKA, cost of hospitalization, complications). The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.0 was used to evaluate the RCTs and the Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS)-I tool was used to evaluate observational studies.

Risk of Bias Assessment in Included Studies

We assessed the risk of bias for RCTs using the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB2), the tool recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. We judged the "Risk of Bias" criteria as "low risk", "some concerns" or "high risk" and evaluated different bias items as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 6). We assessed the following domains: the risk of bias arising from the randomization process, the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions (effect of assignment to intervention and adhering to intervention), missing outcome data, the risk of bias in measurement of the outcome, and the risk of bias in selection of the reported result. We synthesized an overall risk of bias judgement based on the outcomes within each domain.

### Knowledge of insulin use and its determinants among Nigerian insulin requiring diabetes patients [^f059cbeb]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Optimal control of DM by insulin dependent diabetes patients requires effective and meticulous self-management in terms of diet, exercise, medication adherence, but the complexities associated with these present challenges to self-managing the disease well. While medical and health professionals will not always be around to guide and influence patients decisions regarding when and how to administer insulin at home, life-long education on administration, complications and benefits of adherence to therapy provides knowledge, skills and confidence for the patient.

There is alarming and widespread poor knowledge of insulin use among Nigerian insulin requiring diabetes patients. For example majority did not know signs of ketoacidosis, cause of an insulin reaction, time it takes to have an insulin reaction after taking intermediate acting insulin and what to do if they develop an insulin reaction. The participants in this study may not be conversant with these terms (ketoacidosis and insulin reaction) possibly because in an attempt to simplify these medical terms to the understanding of the illiterate and semi-illiterate members, educators sometimes miss out on these main terms altogether. This finding is in line with an earlier study which reported poor knowledge of signs of ketoacidosis and cause of an insulin reaction among majority of veterans in the US.

Hypoglycemia is the leading limiting factor in the glycemic management of type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and may be an obstacle to the use of insulin. In Nigeria, hypoglycemia was the most frequently documented problems encountered by persons on insulin. However, a slight majority of the participants in this study did not know the cause of low blood sugar. Even though teaching people with diabetes to balance insulin use with carbohydrate intake and exercise is necessary may not always be an adequate approach due to natural defects such as hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure, educating them on ways of identifying the signs and preventing hypoglycemia is an essential component of diabetes management for insulin requiring patients with diabetes. It is however heartwarming that a simple majority (66.7%, n = 36) knew that too little insulin could lead to hyperglycemia. Furthermore, that an overwhelming majority (90.7%, n = 49) of them knew the benefits of exercise, but many were not exercising regularly (33.3%, n = 18) would probably mean that knowledge may not necessarily lead to good practice or performance.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis without diabetes [^f212dd5e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Type B insulin resistance syndrome is a rare disease that occurs due to the development of autoantibodies to the insulin receptor and can result in either severe insulin resistance and hyperglycemia or, conversely, hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is often severe, usually transient, and poorly responsive to exogenous insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an unusual consequence of this most severe form of transient diabetes mellitus.

Case Description

A 39-year-old Nigerian woman presented with significant weight loss, severe diabetic ketoacidosis, and severe insulin resistance requiring massive doses of exogenous insulin. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and type B insulin resistance syndrome. She was treated by immunomodulation with rituximab and pulse dose dexamethasone, and she entered euglycemic remission after 4 months of treatment. She remains independent of exogenous insulin 1 year later on maintenance azathioprine therapy.

Conclusion

We report a case of severe type B insulin resistance syndrome complicated by severe diabetic ketoacidosis soon after the initial diagnosis of diabetes, despite large doses of exogenous insulin therapy. Our patient achieved euglycemic remission after combination immunomodulation. This case illustrates the severe catabolic state that may occur with high anti-insulin receptor antibody titers and that combination therapy with rituximab and dexamethasone, followed by maintenance azathioprine therapy for 1 year, is an effective treatment approach for the management of type B insulin resistance syndrome.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d7c3882f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with diabetes — advanced disease categories for end-of-life management — are delineated into three groups. Different categories have been proposed for diabetes management in those with advanced disease, including a stable individual, an individual with organ failure, and a dying individual. For a stable individual, continue the person's previous medication plan with a focus on the prevention of hypoglycemia and the management of hyperglycemia using blood glucose monitoring, and there is no role for A1C monitoring. For an individual with organ failure, preventing hypoglycemia is of greatest significance, dehydration must be prevented and treated, insulin administration in people with type 1 diabetes may be reduced as oral intake decreases but should not be stopped, and for those with type 2 diabetes agents that may cause hypoglycemia should be reduced in dose, with the main goal to avoid hypoglycemia allowing for glucose values in the upper level of the desired goal range. For a dying individual, for people with type 2 diabetes the discontinuation of all medications may be a reasonable approach because oral intake is unlikely, and in people with type 1 diabetes there is no consensus but a small amount of basal insulin may maintain glucose levels and prevent acute hyperglycemic complications.

### Current therapies for the medical management of diabetes [^9f98b75e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects a large and diverse number of individuals who share in common its risks for complications but who differ greatly from one another in age, health, and a number of circumstances influential to successful treatment. Because type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of diabetes cases, a number of agents have been developed for its treatment. Their unique properties offer opportunities to overcome some of the treatment limitations of older medicines and enable a more individualized and flexible approach to glucose-lowering. At the same time, new medications are accompanied by greater costs and uncertainties about their long-term benefits or safety, and thus the present state of care for type 2 diabetes places focus on a process of shared decision-making between the clinician and patient as to which treatments can optimize health while minimizing harms. We review the major classes of diabetes agents and provide some guidance for how one might approach decision-making in choosing among them.

### Practical approaches to diagnosing, treating and preventing hypoglycemia in diabetes [^750414d1]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypoglycemia causes harm to people with diabetes, creating cardiovascular impairment and an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. Further, hypoglycemia significantly impacts the quality of life of patients with diabetes and can limit optimal glucose control. A patient-centered approach is imperative to achieve optimal glucose control while avoiding hypoglycemia and its harmful effects. A patient-centered approach is one that is based on shared medical decision-making among the patient, family and healthcare provider and uses individualized approaches to problem solving and diabetes management planning. Education aimed at recognizing the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia is imperative for both patients and families. Appropriate teaching includes individual risk factors, prevention, and treatment of hypoglycemia. In addition, healthcare providers must work diligently with patients and families to identify and eradicate hypoglycemia by using appropriate glucose targets and medications and modifying lifestyle.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^f37c1345]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with diabetes — palliative care glycemic management principles — prioritize reducing burdensome monitoring, preventing dysglycemia, and simplifying therapy while centering quality of life. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could be considered when frequent blood glucose testing is burdensome so monitoring for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is needed, glycemia goals should aim to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, treatment interventions need to be mindful of quality of life, and careful monitoring of oral intake is warranted. Health care professionals may consider withdrawing treatment and limiting diagnostic testing; treatment may include oral agents as first line followed by a simplified insulin plan, basal insulin can be implemented accompanied by oral agents and without rapid-acting insulin, and as symptoms progress some agents may be slowly tapered and discontinued.

Closed‐loop systems may provide a safer and less burdensome approach to glucose management towards the end of life.
Studies are needed to determine safety, efficacy and acceptability in this population.

### Celebration of a century of insulin therapy in children with type 1 diabetes [^fef71c7c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

The limitations of subcutaneous insulin therapy

Although initially heralded as a medical miracle, insulin brought new challenges and questions, such as whether the patient's urine should be kept glucose-free or whether some glycosuria was preferable, if this meant avoiding hypoglycaemia. It was also not known how the effects of insulin should be spread over 24 hours, or whether high blood glucose was of concern if urine was glucose-free. Children diagnosed with diabetes now lived longer and could abandon their starvation diets, and, with restored carbohydrate metabolism, they gained weight and vigour. However, insulin is not a cure for T1D, and prolonged life and daily insulin therapy transformed T1D from a disease of short duration, decline and premature death to a chronic condition with substantial daily burdens and concerns over later complications.

These complications were chronicled in the records of Boston diabetologist Elliott Joslin, who began his practice in 1898 and continued treating patients with diabetes until his death in 1962. Joslin lived to see the emergence of diabetology as a specialty for thousands of healthcare professionals, catering to a rapidly growing patient population. Joslin kept thousands of meticulous medical records and letters of communication with patients, and so the Joslin Diabetes Center became a repository of information about how everyday life for children with T1D was changing over the years, and how diabetes affected them as they grew into adulthood.

Despite many physicians' early concerns that patients might make lethal mistakes, most learnt to self-administer their injections, and self-management was championed by Joslin. Longer survival, however, led to the emergence of complications associated with poor glycaemic control: retinal damage and blindness in some patients were recognised by the mid-1930s, and deaths due to renal failure by the mid-1950s. Vascular complications (eg, ulceration, gangrene necessitating amputation, major cardiovascular events, and various microvascular and neural complications) also became apparent. By contrast, improved care with insulin resulted in a marked decline in mortality from diabetic ketoacidosis and coma.

5.3	Lower Limb Amputation

In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg treatment arms, respectively.

Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent (81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations). Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs.

Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. Patients with amputations were more likely to be male, have higher A1C (%) at baseline, have a history of peripheral arterial disease, amputation or peripheral revascularization procedure, diabetic foot, and to have been taking diuretics or insulin.

Across seven ertugliflozin clinical trials, non-traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group.

### Approach to the hypoglycemic patient [^c83a4518]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypoglycemia is commonly encountered in the emergency department. Patients can present with a myriad of symptoms and its presentation can mimic other more serious diagnoses. Despite the relative ease of its management, clinicians often miss the diagnosis or mismanage it even when discovered. Glucose is an important energy source for the brain and failing to recognize hypoglycemia or mismanaging it can lead to permanent neurologic disability or death. Although it is important to replenish glucose in a rapid fashion, it is equally important to discover and manage the underlying etiology to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.

5.2 Lower Limb Amputation

An increased incidence of lower limb amputations occurred in BRENZAVVY-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (8.3 versus 5.1 events per 1,000 patient-years) in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD (Trial 6). Additional amputation data from Trial 6 are shown in Table 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Of the 23 BRENZAVVY-treated patients who had amputations, 15 were amputations of the toe and midfoot and 8 were amputations above and below the knee. Some patients had multiple amputations.

Lower limb infections, gangrene, ischemia, and osteomyelitis were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. The risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy.

Before initiating BRENZAVVY, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to the need for amputations, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving BRENZAVVY for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue BRENZAVVY if these complications occur.

### Empowered citizen' health hackers' who are not waiting [^5ad20702]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Type 1 diabetes is a condition requiring around the clock management. Despite the multiple daily injections and invasive blood testing, type 1 diabetes patients find that the main challenge to managing their condition is the mental pressure to keep track of their blood sugar levels, treatments and medication calculations, leading them to exhaustion. After more than 22 years as a type 1 diabetic, I agree with them.

Existing care is unrealistic

The NHS Type 1 Diabetes Care Pathway is focused on a yearly follow-up between patients and a diabetes clinic of trained experts. Patient performance over the previous year is reviewed and treatment adjustments suggested, but this is often of limited value for the patient, whose state on a given day may often not match that on the next, and a yearly discussion cannot summarise the patient's personal challenges. Therefore, the outcome is often a 'bending of the truth' to meet the clinician's expectations.

The most modern accessible technology for type 1 diabetes management is an insulin pump, which provides a constant supply of insulin, as well as a self-funded continuous glucose monitor, which provides real-time feedback of the patient's blood sugar levels. These devices provide many functions and high volumes of data, all of which are very welcome and useful, but such systems always fail with regards to patient expectations to understand and process all of this information. As a result, patients become overwhelmed by a feeling of judgement by healthcare professionals, the vast amounts of ensuing information, and alert and alarm 'shouts' from their devices when they have failed at being a 'good diabetic', as well as with their own disappointment of their body letting them down.

Are things going to get better?

Diabetics are getting better at understanding their condition and its cause and reactions, as well as more technically able to finely tune treatments and understand real-time information, yet patients are still not able to processes and act upon such data; this is due to incorrect use of the data. Data is commonly locked into the devices, with no or limited ability to share across devices, and the analytics required to process such data are extremely complicated. Nevertheless, patients should not be made to feel that managing their diabetes is their full-time job!

### Insulin initiation: bringing objectivity to choice [^f8b38a4d]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Subjectivity vs. objectivity

The choice of initial insulin is often dictated by subjective criteria: the "severity" of diabetes, the ability of the person with diabetes to self inject, at specific times of the day, and the physician's personal experience. No objective criteria have been evolved by any expert body so far to help guide clinicians make an appropriate, and accurate, choice of initiating insulin. Neither have large studies been able to shed light on the preferred type of insulin regime for a particular individual.

This communication suggests various objective parameters which may be used to inform this decision. Shared decision-making, involving patient and physician, is always welcome. These objective criteria, based upon simple physiologic principles, will help characterize the "hyperglycemia personality", for both. This is important for health care professionals, who confront a wide spectrum of diabetes in clinical practice including predominant fasting hyperglycemia, predominant postprandial hyperglycemia, and overall hyperglycemia. It is also relevant for patients, who would like to understand the rationale behind particular regime.

It must be noted that many of the suggestions listed below are empirical or experience-based, and still need to be supported by evidence. However, they all conform to the school of science known as 'logical empiricism'. They are built upon sound logic, and supported by extensive observation. All these suggestions are easy to follow at primary care level, and may help improve the quality of care of people with diabetes. Choice of insulin therapy is dictated by three parameters: efficacy, safety, and tolerability. This review aims to help the physician choose an appropriate insulin regimen, which maintains safety and tolerability, without compromising efficacy.

### Evaluating medical decision-making capacity in practice [^137b8c70]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Medical decision-making capacity is the ability of a patient to understand the benefits and risks of, and the alternatives to, a proposed treatment or intervention (including no treatment). Capacity is the basis of informed consent. Patients have medical decision-making capacity if they can demonstrate understanding of the situation, appreciation of the consequences of their decision, and reasoning in their thought process, and if they can communicate their wishes. Capacity is assessed intuitively at every medical encounter and is usually readily apparent. However, a more formal capacity evaluation should be considered if there is reason to question a patient's decision-making abilities. Such reasons include an acute change in mental status, refusal of a clearly beneficial recommended treatment, risk factors for impaired decision making, or readily agreeing to an invasive or risky procedure without adequately considering the risks and benefits. Any physician can evaluate capacity, and a structured approach is best. Several formal assessment tools are available to help with the capacity evaluation. Consultation with a psychiatrist may be helpful in some cases, but the final determination on capacity is made by the treating physician. If a patient is found not to have capacity, a surrogate decision maker should be identified and consulted. If the patient is unable to give consent and identifying a surrogate decision maker will result in a delay that might increase the risk of death or serious harm, physicians can provide emergency care without formal consent.

Case presentation

A 54-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was brought in with an acute onset of shortness of breath and drowsiness. One year before presentation, she had stopped her metformin and subcutaneous insulin against medical advice and started adopting lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a modified diet comprising mostly of fruits and salads with intermittent fasting from 09:00 to 21:00 daily. She had also started taking traditional Chinese medications, specifically fish oil, black garlic and lingzhi. Six months in, she started experiencing polydipsia, back and thigh aches, and significant intentional weight loss of 27% (from 52 kg to 38 kg). Her husband also started to notice atrophy of her leg muscles associated with a slow gait and difficulty climbing stairs. She was otherwise well and did not have any other known medical conditions. She did not have a family history of hyperlipidaemia. There was no history of drug overdose, self-harm or exposure to smoke or fumes.

On presentation, she was noted to be dehydrated and drowsy with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 (E1V1M4). The patient was also noted to be in sinus tachycardia and tachypnoea with a heart rate of 125, a respiratory rate of 28 and a blood pressure of 157/113. She was otherwise afebrile and saturating well on room air. The patient appeared cachexic and malnourished. Physical examination was otherwise unremarkable with equal and reactive pupils, no pink skin or bright red lips, and no signs of pancreatitis.

### Committee opinion no. 617: end-of-life decision making [^cf2088ad]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

End-of-life care ethics — In instances of disagreement, respect for a woman's autonomy guides care and the woman's wishes and values should be respected as relayed by her surrogate decision maker when she lacks capacity. If decisions made by or for the patient cause significant moral distress or ethical conflict, the physician has the right to transfer care to a physician who has more expertise and is more comfortable with these choices. Optimal end-of-life care allows the physician to refrain from using life-extending technologies that are no longer beneficial or may impose harm and should include consideration of palliative care efforts. On rare occasions, physicians may be asked for assistance in hastening death; such requests may be seen as an opportunity to open a conversation, and enhanced palliative care, expert pain management, and counseling are appropriate to address suffering, and the physician is encouraged to use these resources. The principles articulated should be honored regardless of whether or not a woman is pregnant.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^3898d8e1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with type 1 diabetes — insulin and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in long-term care: the population of people with type 1 diabetes over 65 years of age is growing. Insulin is an essential life-preserving therapy, and to avoid diabetic ketoacidosis older adults with type 1 diabetes need some form of basal insulin even when they are unable to ingest meals, delivered via an insulin pump or injections. CGM is approved for use by Medicare and can play a critical role in improving A1C, reducing glycemic variability, and reducing risk of hypoglycemia. Many older people with type 1 diabetes require placement in assisted living, and in long-term care a feasibility study showed CGM use can be useful although it requires substantial staff training; an observational study revealed a high prevalence of hypoglycemia including in those using sulfonylureas; and a randomized controlled trial showed that real-time CGM use for up to 60 days was safe and effective in guiding insulin doses compared with BGM by point of care with no differences in TIR, time below range, or mean glucose levels.

Glycemic management of diabetes in older individuals — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend metformin as the initial oral medication chosen for glycemic management in addition to lifestyle management, and this recommendation should not be implemented in patients who have significantly impaired kidney function [estimated GFR (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2] or have a gastrointestinal intolerance; metformin is highly effective, may reduce cardiovascular events and mortality, and does not cause hypoglycemia or weight gain, and because clinical events that may precipitate acute kidney injury can cause metformin accumulation with a potential risk for lactic acidosis, metformin use is often stopped when patients are hospitalized, with vitamin B12 levels monitored yearly; in patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes who have not achieved glycemic targets with metformin and lifestyle, we recommend that other oral or injectable agents and/or insulin should be added to metformin.

### Withdrawing life-sustaining treatment: ethical considerations [^60d69324]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Withdrawing life-supporting technology from patients who are irremediably ill is morally troubling for caregivers, patients, and families. Interventions that enable clinicians to delay death create situations in which the dignity and comfort of dying patients may be sacrificed to spare professionals and families from their elemental fear of death. Understanding of the limits of treatment, expertise in palliation of symptoms, skillful communication, and careful orchestration of controllable events can help to manage the withdrawal of life support appropriately.

### Evaluating a patient's request for life-prolonging treatment: an ethical framework [^a9cbc273]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2012). Low credibility.

Five guiding questions to approach conflicts about limiting treatment

Decisions about medical treatments require both medical expertise and value judgements. Therefore, a dissent between patient and physician about what is the best course of action can result either from medical (factual) or normative (evaluative) aspects of the decision. One main goal of this article is to distinguish these two dimensions and to propose practical criteria that can guide decisions about patients' requests for life-prolonging treatments. These criteria are: the expected effectiveness of the intervention in question, the benefit-harm ratio of the intervention, and the patient's understanding of his or her medical situation. Under conditions of scarcity, resources required for the treatment may also play a role in the decision, especially if the treatment has a low likelihood of success or an unfavourable benefit-risk ratio. These criteria need careful evaluation and are therefore built into an ethical decision model with five guiding questions. The starting point is a situation in which a competent patient requests a treatment that might be perceived as inappropriate by the healthcare team (figure 1). We do not include proxy requests for incompetent patients because surrogate decision making requires other ethical considerations and decision processes. However, the family is often involved in the patient's decision-making process and is, therefore, considered throughout the decision pathway.

Figure 1
Systematic ethical decision model with five guiding questions for situations in which patients request a treatment that might be perceived as inappropriate by the healthcare team (see explanation of the guiding questions in the text). *Implementing this last step of considerations requires a broader societal consensus about the physician's role in making resource-sensitive decisions at the bedside.

### Bexagliflozin [^8f57bb21]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue bexagliflozin tablets, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting bexagliflozin tablets.

Withhold bexagliflozin tablets, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume bexagliflozin tablets when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue bexagliflozin tablets and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

5.2 Lower Limb Amputation

An increased incidence of lower limb amputations occurred in bexagliflozin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients (8.3 versus 5.1 events per 1,000 patient-years) in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating patients with type 2 diabetes who had either established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or were at risk for CVD (Trial 6). Additional amputation data from Trial 6 are shown in Table 2 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Of the 23 bexagliflozin-treated patients who had amputations, 15 were amputations of the toe and midfoot and 8 were amputations above and below the knee. Some patients had multiple amputations.

Lower limb infections, gangrene, ischemia, and osteomyelitis were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. The risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy.

Before initiating bexagliflozin tablets, consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to the need for amputations, such as a history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving bexagliflozin tablets for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue bexagliflozin tablets if these complications occur.

### Responding to surrogate requests that seem inconsistent with a patient's living will [^fa1b5970]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2011). Low credibility.

Clinicians may feel conflicted when a patient's legal decision maker is making decisions that seem inconsistent with a patient's living will. We provide evidence-based information to help clinicians consider whether a surrogate's inconsistent decisions are ethically appropriate. Surrogates are not flawless translators of their loved one's preferences; they are influenced by their own hopes and the current clinical context. Patients may be aware of this, are often concerned about burdening their loved ones, and often grant their surrogates leeway in interpreting their wishes. When appropriate, clinicians should respect surrogates' interpretations of patient values and take steps to decrease surrogate stress during the decision-making process. Finally, if clinicians are cognizant of their own values and preferences, they may recognize how these may affect their responses to certain clinical cases.

### The urgent need for breakthrough therapies and a world without type 1 diabetes [^751d0647]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 Diabetes: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow

Breakthrough innovations have dramatically transformed type 1 diabetes (T1D). Over a century of advances in research, therapy, and medical technology have turned T1D from a fatal childhood diagnosis to a challenging chronic condition. Before these advances, children frequently died within days to weeks after diagnosis, and those that did not were subject to severe dietary restrictions, extended bed rest, and often hospitalized for weeks or months at a time. Starvation treatments were commonly employed, combining low-calorie, highly restricted diets with periods of fasting. On average, a 10-year-old diagnosed with "acute-onset diabetes" could expect to live for only 2–3 more years, typically dying from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Today, more than 100 years after insulin's discovery, steady improvements have been made in available insulins, insulin delivery systems, glycemic monitoring, and overall care. That same 10-year-old child, now diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D), will, on average, live for 61 more years (in a high-income country). Although it was once thought to primarily afflict children, we now know T1D is not just a childhood-onset disease, with approximately half of US diagnoses occurring after age 30. The advent of insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and automated insulin delivery systems has vastly improved glycemic control and reduced short- and long-term complications. People with T1D are living longer, healthier lives with improved quality of life.

However, the story does not end there. People diagnosed with T1D have an 11-year shorter life expectancy than those without the diagnosis. In upper-middle, lower-middle, or low-income countries, this gap expands to 25, 26, or 46 fewer years of life, respectively, with an overall global average of 24 years of life lost. Mortality rates are 3–18 times higher among individuals with T1D than the general population, attributable largely to diabetes-related cardiovascular and renal disease. Encouraging data show age-standardized mortality rates in T1D have decreased globally by about 21% from 1990–2019. However, the rate of decline was lowest in populations with a lower sociodemographic index, meaning the improvements seen over the last few decades are not equally realized across all T1D populations. Despite these improvements, people with T1D still have shorter life expectancies. This is something that needs to be urgently addressed and in an equitable and global manner.

### Preventing life-sustaining treatment by default [^102b8a11]. Annals of Family Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Many physicians will at some point care for patients who will receive life-sustaining treatment by default, because there are no instructions available from the patient as to what kind of care is preferred, and because surrogates are likely to ask for everything to be done when they do not know a patient's preferences. We use the methods of ethics informed by qualitative focus group research to identify 5 pathways to life-sustaining treatment by default originating with the patient's preferred decision-making style: deciding for oneself or letting others decide. We emphasize preventing the ethically unwelcome outcome of life-sustaining treatment by default by increasing the frequency with which patients make clear decisions or clearly express their values and goals that they then communicate to physicians or surrogates.
