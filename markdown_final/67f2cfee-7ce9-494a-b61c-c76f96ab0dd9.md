## Question

how long does a patient need to be hospitalized for a stemi

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a patient should be hospitalized after experiencing a STEMI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether the patient is low risk versus complicated. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about monitoring requirements and earliest discharge windows. Next, I will review real-world length-of-stay data and risk-stratification tools that support early discharge. After that, I need to check special populations like in-hospital STEMI and cardiogenic shock. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant answer and outline the discharge readiness criteria and follow-up plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: most patients with STEMI undergo primary PCI, and the question about length of stay hinges on whether the course is uncomplicated versus complicated by heart failure, arrhythmias, renal injury, or procedural issues. I should also distinguish outpatient-onset STEMI from in-hospital STEMI, which behaves differently and often requires longer stays and more intensive monitoring [^117Wjk3A] [^1136N8j2].

> I need to verify the guideline backbone before jumping to numbers. The 2023 ESC ACS guidance recommends that all STEMI patients with successful reperfusion and an uncomplicated course be monitored in a coronary care unit or intensive cardiac care unit for at least 24 hours, and then considered for transfer to a step-down monitored bed for an additional 24–48 hours; importantly, it also allows consideration of discharge in selected stable patients within 48–72 hours if early rehabilitation and follow-up are arranged, which anchors the shortest acceptable stay in low-risk cases [^1156oFZm] [^1157cAS1].

> Next, I should review real-world length-of-stay patterns to calibrate expectations. In the United States, contemporary observational data show a median STEMI length of stay around 3 days, with national registries demonstrating a decline from roughly 3.3 days in 2005 to about 2.7 days in 2014. Internationally, mean LOS varies from about 5 days in the Netherlands and the US to 8.5 days in Taiwan, underscoring system-level differences even as the trend is toward shorter stays [^111kkMNv] [^116kS23c] [^111vqZ2d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about very early discharge. I should confirm which patients are actually safe for 48–72 hour discharge. Risk-stratification tools support identifying low-risk patients for early discharge: the Zwolle risk index with a score ≤ 3 and the CADILLAC risk model identify patients with very low event rates beyond day 3, and pooled analyses suggest no excess 30-day mortality with early discharge in appropriately selected cohorts; the 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP guideline explicitly endorses using the Zwolle score to identify low-risk patients who can be discharged in 48–72 hours when criteria are met [^117GNKxW] [^114fKqDg] [^115Rryry] [^113bYSBc].

> Wait, let me verify the monitoring requirements before discussing discharge timing. ESC guidance specifies continuous ECG monitoring for at least 24 hours for all STEMI patients, which practically means most patients will spend at least 2–3 days total when you include CCU time plus step-down observation, unless a same-day transfer or exceptional pathway is arranged; same-day transfer after successful, uneventful PCI is permissible in selected stable patients, but that is the exception rather than the rule [^113s2JSh] [^1156oFZm] [^112k9jec].

> I will now examine special populations that deviate from the typical 2–4 day trajectory. In-hospital STEMI patients have markedly longer lengths of stay and worse outcomes, with mean LOS around 13 days and substantially higher mortality; they often require prolonged monitoring and management of the precipitating illness, so I should not apply outpatient STEMI timelines here [^1136N8j2]. For cardiogenic shock, average LOS approaches 9 days and is driven by mechanical support, repeated procedures, and critical care needs; similarly, patients with heart failure, renal injury, arrhythmias, or large infarcts generally require extended observation and titration of therapy before discharge [^113ie24Y] [^113DDDFx].

> Let me consider the lower bound of stay to avoid overstating early discharge. Very short LOS of 1–2 days has been associated with higher adjusted 30-day mortality in some analyses, particularly in anterior-wall STEMI, suggesting a U-shaped risk distribution; this reinforces that 48–72 hours is the appropriate minimum for truly low-risk patients rather than pushing for same-day or next-day discharge in most cases [^1164wuA5] [^115Qj3Na].

> I should double-check the discharge readiness criteria to ensure we are not missing safety steps. Before discharge, patients should be clinically stable without ongoing ischemia, heart failure, LV dysfunction, arrhythmias, or procedural complications; they need confirmed access to dual antiplatelet therapy and other guideline-directed medications, a responsible adult at home, and a structured follow-up plan including a phone check-in within 24–72 hours and a clinic visit within 2–4 weeks; these elements are emphasized in contemporary PCI discharge guidance and ACS pathway documents [^115Rryry] [^112SqbtU].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the practical answer. For an uncomplicated STEMI with successful primary PCI and a low-risk profile, the typical hospitalization is about 2–4 days, anchored by at least 24 hours in the CCU and an additional 24–48 hours on a monitored step-down unit, with discharge as early as 48–72 hours in carefully selected low-risk patients who meet stability and follow-up criteria. For complicated STEMI or in-hospital STEMI, stays commonly extend to 5–7 days or longer depending on comorbidities and complications, and cardiogenic shock often requires a week or more [^1156oFZm] [^115Rryry] [^1136N8j2] [^113ie24Y].

---

The typical length of stay for STEMI is **3–5 days** following successful primary PCI, with discharge once the patient is stable, complications are excluded, and appropriate medical therapy and follow-up are arranged [^1156oFZm] [^111vqZ2d]. Many patients can be safely discharged within **48–72 hours** if they are low risk, have no complications, and have reliable support and follow-up [^113bYSBc] [^117GNKxW]. Prolonged stays (> 5 days) are usually due to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or renal dysfunction [^111vqZ2d]. In-hospital STEMI and cardiogenic shock extend stays to a median of 5–8 days and often require ICU care [^115X2v6y] [^113ie24Y] [^1156oFZm].

---

## Typical length of stay

- **Median LOS**: 3–5 days after successful primary PCI without complications [^111kkMNv] [^113DDDFx].
- **Early discharge**: 48–72 hours is safe for carefully selected low-risk patients with reliable support and follow-up [^113bYSBc] [^117GNKxW].
- **Prolonged LOS**: > 5 days is common with complications (heart failure, arrhythmias, renal dysfunction) [^111kkMNv] [^111vqZ2d].

---

## Factors influencing length of stay

Several factors influence **LOS** in STEMI patients:

| **Factor** | **Impact on los** |
|-|-|
| Clinical stability | Stable patients have shorter LOS; unstable patients require longer monitoring and treatment [^111vqZ2d] |
| Complications (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmias, renal dysfunction) | Significantly prolong LOS [^116kS23c] |
| Age and comorbidities | Older patients and those with comorbidities often have longer LOS [^116kS23c] |
| Type of reperfusion therapy | Primary PCI allows shorter LOS than fibrinolysis [^notfound] |
| Hospital protocols and regional practices | LOS varies by institution and region [^113DDDFx] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized LOS** based on stability, complications, and support:

- **ESC 2023**: Monitor in CCU/ICCU for ≥ 24 hours after successful reperfusion, then step-down for 24–48 hours; consider discharge at 48–72 hours for selected stable patients with early rehab and follow-up [^1156oFZm] [^1157cAS1].
- **ACC/AHA 2025**: Early discharge (< 3 days) is safe for low-risk patients after PCI with adequate follow-up; use risk scores (e.g. Zwolle ≤ 3) to identify candidates [^113bYSBc] [^115Rryry].

---

## Outcomes associated with different lengths of stay

Shorter LOS (2–3 days) is generally safe for low-risk patients, with **no significant increase in 30-day mortality or MACE** [^117PHpUL]. Longer LOS (> 5 days) is associated with higher in-hospital mortality and complications, often reflecting severity rather than causation [^114wW2n5] [^116kS23c].

---

## Special considerations

- **In-hospital STEMI**: Higher risk, longer LOS (median 5–8 days), and higher mortality; often requires ICU care [^1136N8j2] [^115X2v6y].
- **Cardiogenic shock**: Requires prolonged ICU stay and advanced therapies (e.g. mechanical circulatory support) [^notfound].
- **Resource-limited settings**: Longer LOS due to limited access to PCI and specialized care [^116SQF4X].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Typical LOS**: 3–5 days after successful primary PCI without complications.
- **Early discharge**: 48–72 hours for low-risk patients with reliable support and follow-up [^113bYSBc].
- **Prolonged LOS**: > 5 days for complications or unstable patients [^notfound].
- **Individualized care**: Base LOS on stability, complications, and support [^111vqZ2d].

---

The typical STEMI hospital stay is **3–5 days**, with early discharge at 48–72 hours for selected low-risk patients and longer stays for complications or unstable courses.

### Temporal trends and factors associated with prolonged length of stay in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^116kS23c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Improved procedural techniques and process of care initiatives have decreased length of stay (LOS) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, there remains a subset of patients who continue to require longer LOS. We used the 2005 to 2014 National Inpatient Sample databases to identify all hospitalizations for PPCI for STEMI in patients ≥ 18 years of age. Hospitalizations in which patients were discharged home alive were included. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to examine temporal trends in LOS and to identify independent predictors of longer LOS (LOS > 3 days). In 678,545 hospitalizations for PPCI for STEMI, mean ± standard error of mean LOS decreased significantly from 3.3 (± 0.04) days to 2.7 (± 0.02) days (p trend < 0.001). There was a marked decrease in the proportion of STEMI hospitalizations with LOS > 3 days from 31.9% in 2005 to 16.9% in 2014 (p < 0.001). Patient demographics, co-morbidities, hospital region, use of mechanical circulatory support, and periprocedural complications were independently associated with longer LOS. In conclusion, LOS for hospitalizations for PPCI for STEMI has decreased significantly over time. Targeting strategies to reduce procedure-related risk may translate into shorter LOS.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The 30‐day revascularization rates were 2.5% in the short LOS cohort, 3.0% in the medium LOS cohort, and 2.6% in the long LOS cohort among the AW STEMI group (P = 0.021), and 2.7% in the short LOS cohort, 3.3% in the medium LOS cohort, and 2.7% in the long LOS cohort among the NAW STEMI group (P < 0.001). The 30‐day repeat revascularization rates from more detailed stratification of LOS are shown in Figure 2 G and 2 H. There was no significant difference in the risk for adjusted 30‐day repeat revascularization among different LOS cohorts versus the 3‐day LOS cohort in both the AW STEMI and the NAW STEMI groups.

The 30‐day MACE rates were 5.8% in the short LOS cohort, 9.5% in the medium LOS cohort, and 11.9% in the long LOS cohort among the AW STEMI group (P < 0.001), and 5.0% in the short LOS cohort, 7.8% in the medium LOS cohort, and 9.9% in the long LOS cohort among the NAW STEMI group (P < 0.001). The 30‐day MACE rates for both the AW and the NAW STEMI groups stratified by the detailed LOS cohorts are shown in Figure 2 I and 2 J. The risk of adjusted 30‐day MACE increased progressively with increasing LOS in both the AW and the NAW STEMI groups (Figure 3).

### Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients hospitalized for noncardiac conditions [^113kKp7L]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rapid reperfusion with early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard of care for patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who present to a hospital with interventional cardiology capabilities. Recognition of the importance of rapid reperfusion has led to significant improvement in door‐to‐balloon times in the last 5 years (from a median of 96 minutes in 2005 to 64 minutes in 2010), which correlates with an improvement in overall outcomes of STEMI patients. Research and nationwide initiatives on STEMI care have targeted patients who have onset of STEMI while outside the hospital. Much less is known about clinical presentation, sources of delay in diagnosis and treatment, and outcomes in patients who develop STEMIs while hospitalized for a noncardiac condition. Patients in the hospital for treatment of active medical or surgical conditions are susceptible to developing STEMIs, but we know surprisingly little about optimal care in this setting.

### National trends in emergency department care processes for acute myocardial infarction in the United States, 2005 to 2015 [^113DV8og]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Despite investments to improve quality of emergency care for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), few studies have described national, real-world trends in AMI care in the emergency department (ED). We aimed to describe trends in the epidemiology and quality of AMI care in US EDs over a recent 11-year period, from 2005 to 2015. Methods and Results We conducted an observational study of ED visits for AMI using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative probability sample of US EDs. AMI visits were classified as ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI. Outcomes included annual incidence of AMI, median ED length of stay, ED disposition type, and ED administration of evidence-based medications. Annual ED visits for AMI decreased from 1 493 145 in 2005 to 581 924 in 2015. Estimated yearly incidence of ED visits for STEMI decreased from 1 402 768 to 315 813. The proportion of STEMI sent for immediate, same-hospital catheterization increased from 12% to 37%. Among patients with STEMI sent directly for catheterization, median ED length of stay decreased from 62 to 37 minutes. ED administration of antithrombotic and nonaspirin antiplatelet agents rose for STEMI (23%-31% and 10%-27%, respectively). Conclusions National, real-world trends in the epidemiology of AMI in the ED parallel those of clinical registries, with decreases in AMI incidence and STEMI proportion. ED care processes for STEMI mirror evolving guidelines that favor high-intensity antiplatelet therapy, early invasive strategies, and regionalization of care.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedural urgency — National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) definitions describe Elective cases as procedures that "can be performed on an outpatient basis or during a subsequent hospitalization without significant risk of infarction or death", and for stable inpatients are performed for convenience and "NOT because the patient's clinical situation demands the procedure prior to discharge". Urgent cases are those where the procedure "is being performed on an inpatient basis and prior to discharge because of significant concerns that there is risk of ischemia, infarction and/or death". Emergency cases are those where the procedure "is being performed as soon as possible because of substantial concerns that ongoing ischemia and/or infarction could lead to death". Salvage cases are those where "The procedure is a last resort" and "The patient is in cardiogenic shock at the start of the procedure".

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, with fibrinolysis, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to continue parenteral anticoagulation in patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy for the duration of the hospital stay, up to a maximum of 8 days, or until revascularization is performed to reduce ischemic events.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^111vqZ2d]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) discharge and length of stay — If PCI is performed, discharge can proceed once a patient meets the milestones outlined previously, whether that occurs the day of or following the PCI procedure, while patients who present with or develop complications including (but not limited to) recurrent ischemia, heart failure, AKI, or ventricular dysrhythmias may require additional evaluation and longer length of stay (LOS). Patients undergoing primary PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represent a higher risk group depending on presenting clinical characteristics, and randomized and observational studies generally support a 48- to 72-hour hospitalization in patients who undergo successful primary PCI and are clinically stable after the procedure. The milestones of recovery, education, and follow-up should be met before the patient is ready for discharge, and ultimately, the duration of observation following PCI for an individual patient must be a professional medical decision based on individual procedural and patient factors.

### National trends in emergency department care processes for acute myocardial infarction in the United States, 2005 to 2015 [^115vJbq6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Particularly in the case of STEMI, our results mirror the results of these trials and guidelines, as demonstrated by steady increases in the administration of nonaspirin antiplatelet agents and antithrombotic agents. These trends suggest the ongoing adoption by ED providers of clinical practice guidelines emphasizing dual antiplatelet therapy and antithrombotic therapy as cornerstones of STEMI management. Rates of administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors for STEMI remained low and decreased for most of the study period. This trend may also reflect an evolution in evidence. Trial results initially favored early upstream administration of these agents, but their routine use has been declining in favor of newer antiplatelet agents, which demonstrate similar ischemic end points and lower bleeding rates. 48

Consistently low rates of fibrinolytic use may also be explained by several trends. First, given the established superiority of timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over fibrinolysis, increases in the proportion of patients with STEMI transferred or directly admitted from the ED for PCI may reflect reduced motivation on the part of emergency physicians to administer on‐site fibrinolysis. Second, as other authors have noted, both fibrinolysis and PCI remain underused nationwide, 49 with use of fibrinolysis for STEMI decreasing and concurrent worsening of door‐to‐needle times. 50 Only one‐third of acute care hospitals in the United States have full‐time PCI capability, 51 and long transfer times often result in patients with STEMI failing to achieve timely PCI. 52 Though we observe reductions in ED length of stay in the subset of patients with STEMI who underwent transfer (among both EMS‐ and non–EMS‐arrival patients), overall, lengths of stay in this group far exceeded the recommended 30‐minute door‐in–door‐out time frame specified in current guidelines. 26 Our findings thus echo renewed calls to examine the role that early on‐site fibrinolysis may play in the treatment of STEMI among patients unable to undergo timely primary PCI. 53

### Comparison of in-hospital mortality and length of stay in acute ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction among urban teaching hospitals in China and the United States [^1173qgwM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although there are barriers in public health service arising from a large population base and unbalanced development, the Chinese healthcare system has made impressive progressive improvements in recent years, including reducing out‐of‐pocket payments, expanding insurance coverage, increasing reimbursement ratio, and narrowing gap of accessing to health services between rural and urban areas, which is probably promoted by the effective reform of the healthcare system. 24, 32, 33 In addition, quality of medical care and outcomes have also been improved, especially for life‐threatening conditions like acute STEMI. 34 According to a quality‐control report of the first half of 2018 released by the headquarters of the China Chest Pain Centers, around 460 CPCs have been certificated across the whole country. Average door‐to‐balloon time is 74 minutes, and other indicators, including symptom onset to first medical contact, first medical contact to ECG, and in‐hospital mortality, have also improved. 35 The Hospital Quality Monitoring System is encouraged to improve performance of all tertiary hospitals through ongoing quality assessments. 36 On the basis of guideline‐recommended treatments from Western countries, many clinical researches funded by the government have been launched to generate clinical evidence in coronary artery disease based on characteristics of Chinese populations. 37, 38 Abundant patient resources and well‐designed researches in China will provide clinical evidence with high quality that may improve treatments and outcomes for acute STEMI patients. Regardless of the difficulties to overcome, medical care in patients with acute STEMI might be better with sustained financial inputs and the national initiative to healthcare reform.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^1165CY82]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Same-day discharge (SDD) after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — older adult outcomes and evidence — shows comparable short-term safety: The largest observational CathPCI analysis involved 107,018 patients aged 65 years or older undergoing elective PCI, and the primary outcome of 30-day death or rehospitalization was similar between patients discharged the same day and those observed overnight; three systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials (with or without observational studies) found no difference in acute or medium-term mortality, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or rehospitalization between SDD and overnight observation.

### Decade-long trends in the magnitude, treatment, and outcomes of patients aged 30 to 54 years hospitalized with ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^117HVHb6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs primarily in the elderly, this disease also affects young adults. Few studies have, however, presented data on relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI. The objectives of this population-based study were to examine recent trends in the magnitude, clinical characteristics, management, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes associated with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients aged 30 to 54 years. We reviewed the medical records of 955 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area aged 30 to 54 years who were hospitalized for an initial STEMI or NSTEMI in 6 biennial periods from 1999 to 2009 at 11 greater Worcester medical centers. From 1999 to 2009, the proportion of young adults hospitalized with an STEMI decreased from approximately 2/3 to 2/5 of all patients with an initial AMI. Patients with STEMI were less likely to have a history of heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease than those with NSTEMI. Both groups received similar effective medical therapies during their acute hospitalization. In-hospital clinical complications and mortality were low and no significant differences in these end points were observed between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI or with regard to 1-year postdischarge death rates (1.9% vs 2.8%). The present results demonstrate recent decreases in the proportion of relatively young patients diagnosed with an initial STEMI. Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI had similar in-hospital outcomes and long-term survival. Trends in these and other important outcomes warrant continued monitoring.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^112kqmuy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Since the publication of the 2009 SCAI Expert Consensus Document on Length of Stay Following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), advances in vascular access techniques, stent technology, and antiplatelet pharmacology have facilitated changes in discharge patterns following PCI. Additional clinical studies have demonstrated the safety of early and same day discharge in selected patients with uncomplicated PCI, while reimbursement policies have discouraged unnecessary hospitalization. This consensus update: (1) clarifies clinical and reimbursement definitions of discharge strategies, (2) reviews the technological advances and literature supporting reduced hospitalization duration and risk assessment, and (3) describes changes to the consensus recommendations on length of stay following PCI (Supporting Information Table S1). These recommendations are intended to support reasonable clinical decision making regarding postprocedure length of stay for a broad spectrum of patients undergoing PCI, rather than prescribing a specific period of observation for individual patients.

Our findings show significant variation in length of hospital stay among patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention; length of stay can be predicted from baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics. Our investigation suggests the need for a multi-tier diagnostic-related group system for patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.

PPCI in STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals — classed recommendations and timing: In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presenting ≤ 12 hours after symptom onset, PPCI should be performed with a goal of first medical contact (FMC) to device activation of ≤ 90 minutes, or ≤ 120 minutes in patients requiring hospital transfer, to improve survival. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel by PCI or CABG is indicated to improve survival, irrespective of time from symptom onset. In patients with STEMI presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. In patients with STEMI presenting > 24 hours after symptom onset with the presence of ongoing ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. In patients who are stable with STEMI who have a totally occluded infarct-related artery > 24 hours after symptom onset and are without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe HF, or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI should not be performed due to lack of benefit.

### Institutional variability in processes of care and outcomes among patients with STEMI in the US [^117R2a4s]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the criterion standard for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Achieving target first medical contact (FMC)-to-device time is a quality metric in STEMI care.

Objectives

To describe site-level variability in achieving target FMC-to-device time (≤ 90 minutes for primary presentations to PCI-capable hospitals and ≤ 120 minutes for transfers), compare treatment times according to hospital performance, location, and primary PCI volume, and assess whether these aspects are associated with clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a retrospective cross-sectional study from the American Heart Association Get With the Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease registry from 2020 to 2022. Patients were recruited from a multicenter quality-improvement registry across 503 US hospitals. Patients with STEMI or STEMI equivalent who underwent primary PCI were included in this analysis.

Exposures

FMC-to-device time.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hospital performance was determined by the proportion of patients meeting target FMC-to-device time at each site. Treatment times and outcomes were compared by hospital performance, location, and primary PCI volume.

Results

A total of 73 826 patients were analyzed (median [IQR] age, 62 [54–71] years; 53 474 male [72.4%]). Of 60 109 patients who presented directly to PCI-capable hospitals (primary presentations), 35 783 (59.5%) achieved an FMC-to-device time of 90 minutes or less, whereas 6900 (50.3%) of 13 717 transfers had an FMC-to-device time of 120 minutes or less. There was substantial institutional variability in achieving target FMC-to-device time for both primary presentations (median [IQR], 60.8% [51.2%-68.8%]) and transfers (median [IQR], 50.0% [32.5%-66.9%]). High-performing centers met all target treatment times more frequently. Low-performing sites experienced prolonged emergency department stays, catheterization laboratory arrival-to-PCI times, and transfer delays, varying by mode of presentation. Compared with urban centers, presentation to rural hospitals did not affect the odds of meeting target FMC-to-device time for primary presentations (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.20; 95% CI, 0.96–1.50) or transfers (aOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.50–1.47). Failure to achieve target FMC-to-device time was associated with increased in-hospital mortality risk for primary presentations (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 2.02–2.42) and transfers (aOR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.90–3.12). Low hospital performance was associated with increased mortality risk compared with high performance in primary presentations (aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00–1.34). Outcomes were similar between rural vs urban and low vs high primary PCI volume centers.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this large cross-sectional study of patients with STEMI, there was substantial hospital-level variability in achieving target treatment times. Patients in whom target FMC-to-device time was not met and those presenting to low-performing hospitals had worse outcomes.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^111UxZbK]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — the abstract reports that advances in vascular access techniques, stent technology, and antiplatelet pharmacology have facilitated changes in discharge patterns after PCI, and additional studies have shown the safety of early and same day discharge for selected uncomplicated PCI, while reimbursement policies have discouraged unnecessary hospitalization. The consensus update clarifies clinical and reimbursement definitions of discharge strategies, reviews technological advances and literature supporting reduced hospitalization duration and risk assessment, and describes changes to consensus recommendations on PCI length of stay. The recommendations are intended to support reasonable clinical decision making on postprocedure length of stay for a broad spectrum of PCI patients rather than prescribing a specific observation period for individual patients.

Early discharge after myocardial infarction — among low-risk ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality; the Zwolle score has been recommended as a clinical tool to help identify low-risk patients (score ≤ 3) who can potentially be discharged earlier (48 to 72 hours). Small retrospective studies suggest safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative, and patients considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support; hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Age differences in the chief complaint associated with a first acute myocardial infarction and patient's care-seeking behavior [^117C91nK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study set out to describe age differences in patient's chief complaint related to a first myocardial infarction and how the "typicality" of patient's acute symptoms relates to extent of prehospital delay.

Methods

The medical records of 2586 residents of central Massachusetts hospitalized at 11 greater Worcester medical centers with a first myocardial infarction on a biennial basis between 2001 and 2011 were reviewed.

Results

The average age of the study population was 66.4 years, 39.6% were women, 40.2% were diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and 72.0% presented with typical symptoms of myocardial infarction, namely acute chest pain or pressure. Patients were categorized into 5 age strata: > 55 years (23%), 55–64 years (20%), 65–74 years (19%), 75–84 years (22%), and ≥ 85 years (16%). The lowest proportion (11%) of atypical symptoms of myocardial infarction was observed in patients < 55 years, increasing to 17%, 28%, 40%, and 51% across the respective age groups. The most prevalent chief complaint reported at the time of hospitalization was chest pain, but the proportion of patients reporting this symptom decreased from the youngest (83%) to the oldest patient groups (45%). There was a slightly increased risk of prehospital delay across the different age groups (higher in the oldest old) in those who presented with atypical, rather than typical, symptoms of myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

The present results provide insights to the presenting chief complaint of patients hospitalized with a first myocardial infarction according to age and the relation of symptom presentation to patient's care-seeking behavior.

### Predictors, treatment, and outcomes of STEMI occurring in hospitalized patients [^1148dT7A]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is most commonly caused by an acute thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. For patients in whom the onset of STEMI occurs outside of hospital (outpatient STEMI), early reperfusion therapy with either fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention reduces complications and improves survival, compared with delayed reperfusion. STEMI systems of care are defined as integrated groups of separate entities focused on reperfusion therapy for STEMI, generally including emergency medical services, emergency medicine, cardiology, nursing, and hospital administration. These systems of care have been successful at reducing total ischaemia time and outpatient STEMI mortality. By contrast, much less is known about STEMI that occurs in hospitalized patients (inpatient STEMI), which has unique clinical features and much worse outcomes than outpatient STEMI. Inpatient STEMI is associated with older age, a higher female:male ratio, and more comorbidities than outpatient STEMI. Delays in diagnosis and infrequent use of reperfusion therapy probably also contribute to unfavourable outcomes for inpatient STEMI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — early discharge and risk stratification after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are characterized as follows: available data suggest that an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality for low-risk patients after STEMI who have undergone PCI; the Zwolle score has been recommended to identify low-risk patients after primary PCI (PPCI) in STEMI, with low-risk patients, score ≤ 3, who can potentially be discharged earlier from the hospital (48 to 72 hours); small retrospective studies have suggested safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative; patients being considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support, and hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Comparison of in-hospital mortality and length of stay in acute ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction among urban teaching hospitals in China and the United States [^116SQF4X]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study containing 108 345 acute STEMI patients discharged from urban teaching hospitals in China and the United States demonstrates that overall in‐hospital mortality in both China and the United States tends to decrease during 2007–2010. Patients in China have less coexisting comorbidities. There are no statistically significant differences in overall in‐hospital mortality between China and the United States. Patients in Chinese hospitals had lower 3‐day mortality. Rates of PCI and PPCI during hospitalization in China are lower than those in the United States. In acute STEMI patients receiving PPCI, the Chinese hospitals have significantly higher overall and 3‐day mortality. Total, preoperative, and postoperative LOSs are longer in China.

The most important findings are higher overall and 3‐day in‐hospital mortality rates in patients receiving PPCI in China across all age subgroups (18–65 and ≥ 65 years). PPCI is suggested as the first‐line therapy according to the recommended guidelines in China and the United States. Early reperfusion through PPCI in acute STEMI patients could reduce the extent of ischemic injury, protect cardiac function, and thus lower in‐hospital mortality. 5 CPC and regional acute STEMI networks, which aimed to shorten total ischemic time and more quickly offer reperfusion strategies, have been well established in the United States. 19 These organizations could better coordinate acute STEMI management and improve clinical outcomes through both prehospital and in‐hospital measures. However, the first CPC based on regional cooperative treatment in China was set up in 2011. Therefore, during the study period 2007–2010, more delays to offer PPCI might account for higher mortality in patients with acute STEMI in China. First, median door‐to‐balloon time in China was supposed to be longer than that in the United States because of the lack of acute STEMI systems of care. In fact, researchers have reported an average door‐to‐balloon time of > 130 minutes in China. 10, 11 Second, prehospital system delays, including traffic‐ or weather‐related delays, lack of transportation availability, and absence of effective collaboration, between PCI‐capable and non‐PCI‐capable hospitals might be more common in China, especially for rural patients. 5, 20, 21, 22 Third, because of cultural perception or affordability, some acute STEMI patients, especially the elderly, in China chose to endure the pain with poor knowledge of the importance of rapid action and finally missed the best treatment time. For the same reason, certain dying or terminal patients in China might withdraw from hospitalized treatment, which could underestimate the in‐hospital mortality. Gasevic et al reported ethnic differences with higher short‐term mortality in Chinese patients following PCI after acute myocardial infarction (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.12–5.00; P = 0.02). 23 They discussed that genetic differences in antiplatelet drug responsiveness, being less likely to fill prescriptions and adhere to secondary prevention medications in Chinese patients, might be involved.

### Variation in ACS patient hospital resource utilization: is it time for advanced NSTEMI risk stratification in the ED? [^111QA13e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

A majority of patients who experience acute coronary syndrome (ACS) initially receive care in the emergency department (ED). Guidelines for care of patients experiencing ACS, specifically ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are well defined. We examine the utilization of hospital resources between patients with NSTEMI as compared to STEMI and unstable angina (UA). We then make the case that as NSTEMI patients are the majority of ACS cases, there is a great opportunity to risk stratify these patients in the emergency department.

Materials and Methods

We examined hospital resource utilization measure between those with STEMI, NSTEMI, and UA. These included hospital length of stay (LOS), any intensive care unit (ICU) care time, and in-hospital mortality.

Results and Conclusions

The sample included 284,945 adult ED patients, of whom 1195 experienced ACS. Among the latter, 978 (70%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI, 225 (16%) with STEMI, and 194 with UA (14%). We observed 79.1% of STEMI patients receiving ICU care. 14.4% among NSTEMI patients, and 9.3% among UA patients. NSTEMI patients' mean hospital LOS was 3.7 days. This was shorter than that of non-ACS patients 4.75 days and UA patients 2.99. In-hospital mortality for NSTEMI was 1.6%, compared to, 4.4% for those with STEMI patients and 0% for UA. There are recommendations for risk stratification among NSTEMI patients to evaluate risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) that can be used in the ED to guide admission decisions and use of ICU care, thus optimizing care for a majority of ACS patients.

### Changes in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction hospitalisations in China from 2011 to 2015 [^113n2Eyq]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Participants

Only patients with a definite discharge diagnosis of STEMI were included in the study sample. The diagnosis of STEMI was determined by the combination of clinical discharge diagnosis terms and ECG results and validated by review of ECGs from randomly selected records by a cardiologist not involved in data abstraction. We treated left bundle branch block as a STEMI equivalent.

We excluded all patients whose STEMI occurred during the course of the hospitalisation because STEMI during hospitalisation could be considered one severe and rare complication of other clinical conditions (ie, coronary artery bypass graft and trauma), so the treatment could be very different, making it difficult to measure quality of care. For the analysis of treatments, procedures and tests, we excluded patients who had transferred in from other hospitals or who had a length of stay of 24 hours or shorter. For the analysis of in-hospital outcomes, we excluded patients who were transferred in from another hospital because we sought to characterise patients admitted directly to the hospital. We also excluded patients who were transferred out because their admissions were truncated. We further excluded patients who were discharged alive within 24 hours because they may have left against medical advice and there was very little time for treatment.

Patient-level characteristics

Variables included patient-level characteristics (age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, medical history and clinical characteristics at admission), defined as documentation on the admission notes, discharge diagnosis or positive laboratory test results (total cholesterol > 5.18 mmol/L or low-density lipoprotein ≥ 3.37 mmol/L, or high-density lipoprotein < 1.04 mmol/L in men or < 1.30 mmol/L in women).

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to transfer, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to arrange immediate emergency medical services transport for patients with suspected STEMI to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI, aiming for a first medical contact to first-device time of ≤ 90 minutes.

Figure 1 — Reperfusion timeline in primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) specifies time-to-treatment goals by presentation route: With emergency medical services (EMS) contact, EMS performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 10 minutes of arrival and PCI is performed within 90 minutes of EMS contact. For patients arriving directly to a PCI-capable hospital, ECG is performed within 10 minutes of patient arrival and PCI is performed within 90 minutes of arrival to the PCI hospital. For patients first presenting to a non-PCI hospital, ECG is performed within 10 minutes of arrival, the patient departs the non-PCI hospital within 45 minutes of arrival for transport to a PCI hospital, and PCI is performed within 120 minutes of arrival to the non-PCI hospital.

Limitations should be acknowledged in the present study. First, databases from different countries might vary in data collection and medical coding. Such differences posed a challenge to the design and analysis in the context of clinically abstracted information in a real‐world setting. Nevertheless, we examined acute STEMI‐related clinical outcomes between 2 countries in several situations or subgroups, and propensity‐score matching analyses verified the main findings in the study. Second, unmeasured confounders, such as lifestyles, environments, and medications, that were related to the clinical outcomes and disproportionately distributed between the 2 countries cannot be excluded in observational studies. To take account of bias introduced by potential unmeasured confounders, we performed sensitivity analyses which assumed the presence of unmeasured confounders. The results showed that differences in mortality in patients undergoing PPCI between 2 groups remained statistically significant even under strong biases. Third, individual data from China could be linked together to count multiple admissions for acute STEMI more than once. However, the NIS could not trace an individual's records. Considering the statistically large sample size, its influence was expected to be minor. Four, the NIS did not have present‐on‐admission flags because of the nature of discharge database. However, a literature review of previous publications using the NIS shared similar methods to capture the coexisting conditions for adjustments. 39, 40 Five, this study excluded the patients who transferred from other hospitals. Six, differential LOS between 2 countries is an important limitation of this study. Furthermore, analytical results regarding overall in‐hospital mortality should be regarded as exploratory and hypothesis‐generating. Additionally, when LOS was restricted to 3 days, the results were generally stable. Seven, this analysis was based on data from 2007 to 2010. Considering progress in care and outcomes of acute STEMI patients in China during recent years, whether an improved in‐hospital prognosis relative to the United States is established may be worthy of expectation. More evidence is needed to verify this hypothesis.

In conclusion, overall in‐hospital mortality of acute STEMI patients is comparable between China and the United States among urban teaching hospitals during 2007–2010. In addition, 3‐day mortality was lower in China. Early revascularization and longer LOS need to be given more attention in China. Well‐established regional systems of acute STEMI care and educational interventions for patients with acute STEMI or at high risk for acute STEMI are needed to improve acute management and quality of care in hospitalized patients with acute STEMI.

Risk stratification tools for patients with STEMI and NSTE-ACS emphasize validated use and limitations. "Substantial variability in short-term mortality and MACE risk exists among patients with ACS", and "Individual risk assessment can inform discussions with patients and decisions regarding therapeutic interventions". The GRACE and TIMI Risk Scores "are well validated and may be useful for helping to guide some therapeutic decisions", but "These scores are not to be used as diagnostic tools". The GRACE Risk Score "has been found to be superior to subjective clinical assessment for the prediction of death or MI", yet "there is insufficient evidence that routine use of risk scores in patients hospitalized for STEMI/NSTE-ACS translates into reduced risk of cardiovascular events". Table 5 target outcomes are specified as GRACE: "In-hospital, 6-mo, 1-y, 3-y, death/MI"; TIMI Unstable Angina/NSTEMI: "14-d all-cause death, MI, or urgent revascularization"; TIMI STEMI: "30-d all-cause death". Variables include, for Unstable Angina/NSTEMI, "Age ≥ 65 y… ST-segment deviation ≥ 0.5 mm… ≥ 2 anginal events in prior 24 h… Aspirin use in prior 7 d", and for STEMI, "Systolic blood pressure (< 100 mm Hg, 3 points)… Heart rate > 100 bpm (2 points)… Anterior ST-segment elevation or LBBB (1 point)… Diabetes/hypertension/angina (1 point)… Weight < 67 kg (1 point)… Time to treatment > 4 h (1 point)".

### Timely and optimal treatment of patients with STEMI [^115VanXf]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Fibrinolysis is recommended in European and US guidelines for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) when a strategy of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is associated with ≥ 120 min delay from first medical contact (FMC), defined as call to the emergency medical services or self-presentation at hospital. Current evidence indicates that reperfusion therapy should be initiated as soon as possible after FMC. However, fibrinolysis cannot be initiated instantaneously at FMC, and PPCI is superior to fibrinolysis in reducing mortality if the extra time needed to perform PPCI instead of fibrinolysis (so-called PCI-related delay) is < 120 min. During the past 10 years, the terms 'FMC-to-PPCI delay' and 'PCI-related delay' have been used in guidelines synonymously; however, a distinction should be made between the recommended FMC-to-PPCI delay and the acceptable PCI-related delay. In the future, an ideal recommendation would be to initiate reperfusion as soon as possible, preferably within 120 min of FMC in the case of PPCI. When the expected PCI-related delay is < 120 min, PPCI should be the preferred reperfusion strategy, even if the FMC-to-PPCI delay is > 120 min. Setting up a health-care system enabling prehospital diagnosis of STEMI with field triage of patients directly to catheterization laboratories at large-volume PCI centres (bypassing local hospitals, coronary care units, emergency departments, and intensive care units) will help to increase the proportion of patients with STEMI who will benefit from PPCI.

We also note an increase in ED length of stay for patients with NSTEMI. Whereas improvements in the timeliness of STEMI care may reflect the implementation of STEMI protocols and enhanced systemwide performance, increases in ED length of stay for patients with NSTEMI may relate to the growing and linked problems of hospital bed shortages and ED boarding and crowding. 41 Moreover, owing to their lack of uniform ECG findings and heterogeneity in clinical presentation, patients with NSTEMI may be triaged to lower‐acuity ED beds, facing longer ED lengths of stay. This carries important clinical ramifications, as patients with NSTEMI experiencing longer ED lengths of stay are less likely to receive guideline‐concordant care, 42 and ED crowding has been linked to adverse outcomes among patients with AMI. 43

We identified trends in ED administration of pharmacotherapies for AMI consistent with evolving clinical practice guidelines. During the study period, several landmark clinical trials of traditional and novel pharmacotherapies were published, including TRITON‐TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 38), ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy), HORIZONS‐AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction), and EARLY‐ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Non–ST‐Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome), 44, 45, 46, 47 as well as major clinical practice guidelines and performance measures for the treatment of STEMI and NSTEMI.

Trends in Length of Stay and Total Hospital Cost

The average length of stay and total hospital cost for the overall cohort of patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock was 8.9 ± 11.8 days and $41 774 ± 45 252, respectively. The average length of stay was shorter in patients aged ≥ 75 years and in women, most likely as a consequence of higher inhospital mortality in these groups (Table 7). Trend analysis revealed no significant change in the average length of stay over the 8 years, even across age, sex, and each racial/ethnic group (P trend > 0.001; Figure 7 A through 7 D). On the other hand, the average total hospital cost increased from $35 892 in 2003 to $46 454 in 2009 (P trend < 0.001), followed by a small decline to $45 625 in 2010 (Figure 8 A). A similar trend was observed in patients < 75 and ≥ 75 years of age, men and women, and across each racial/ethnic group (Figure 8 B through 8 D). Asian/Pacific Islanders accrued the highest total hospital cost (Table 7).

### National trends in emergency department care processes for acute myocardial infarction in the United States, 2005 to 2015 [^111auvpg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite investments to improve quality of emergency care for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), few studies have described national, real‐world trends in AMI care in the emergency department (ED). We aimed to describe trends in the epidemiology and quality of AMI care in US EDs over a recent 11‐year period, from 2005 to 2015.

Methods and Results

We conducted an observational study of ED visits for AMI using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a nationally representative probability sample of US EDs. AMI visits were classified as ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non‐STEMI. Outcomes included annual incidence of AMI, median ED length of stay, ED disposition type, and ED administration of evidence‐based medications. Annual ED visits for AMI decreased from 1 493 145 in 2005 to 581 924 in 2015. Estimated yearly incidence of ED visits for STEMI decreased from 1 402 768 to 315 813. The proportion of STEMI sent for immediate, same‐hospital catheterization increased from 12% to 37%. Among patients with STEMI sent directly for catheterization, median ED length of stay decreased from 62 to 37 minutes. ED administration of antithrombotic and nonaspirin antiplatelet agents rose for STEMI (23%–31% and 10%–27%, respectively).

Conclusions

National, real‐world trends in the epidemiology of AMI in the ED parallel those of clinical registries, with decreases in AMI incidence and STEMI proportion. ED care processes for STEMI mirror evolving guidelines that favor high‐intensity antiplatelet therapy, early invasive strategies, and regionalization of care.

### ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: recommendations on triage of patients to heart attack centers: is it time for a national policy for the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction? [^112Lqzss]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite substantial progress in the diagnosis and treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), implementation of this knowledge into routine clinical practice has been variable. It has become increasing clear that primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method of reperfusion if it can be performed in a timely manner. Recent European data suggest that transfer for direct PCI may also be preferable to fibrinolytic therapy. We believe it is time to establish a national policy for treatment of patients with STEMI to develop a coordinated system of care similar to that of the level 1 trauma system.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction — an electrocardiogram (ECG) "should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact", and "prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis)". For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, "recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable". Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: "ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease", while a comparison tracing helps but "should not delay the decision for treatment". Early ischemic changes include "increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads", and infarction evolution is reflected as "the development of new Q waves" indicating necrosis that "starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult", with "transient Q waves" sometimes seen during acute ischemia or "(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion".

The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association last published evidence-based guidelines for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 1999. In mid-2004, in recognition of the evolution and improvement of many of the most basic tenets of clinical management of STEMI since that time, an updated edition of the STEMI guidelines has been published. These guidelines offer many evidence-based recommendations that are pertinent to the out-of-hospital and emergency department care of STEMI patients, including initial evaluation, risk stratification, stabilizing management, and the choice between pharmacologic and mechanical revascularization. These are presented and discussed here.

### Treatment patterns and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction for low-and high-income patients… [^114oXZZs]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this study of 289 376 patients aged 66 years or older hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 843 046 hospitalized with non-STEMI across 6 health systems, adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were higher for low-income patients, whereas rates of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary interventions were lower. High-income patients also had shorter length of stay and lower rates of readmissions. We studied 289 376 patients hospitalized with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 843 046 hospitalized with non-STEMI. Adjusted 30-day mortality generally was 1 to 3 percentage points lower for high-income patients. For instance, 30-day mortality among patients admitted with STEMI in the Netherlands was 10. 2% for those with high income vs
13. 1% for those with low income.

Rates of coronary artery bypass graft surgery for patients with STEMI in low- vs high-income strata were similar but for NSTEMI were generally 1 to 2 percentage points higher among high-income patients. Thirty-day readmission rates generally also were 1 to 3 percentage points lower and hospital length of stay generally was 0. 2 to
0. 5 days shorter for high-income patients. These outcomes were selected because there is a strong body of evidence for the benefits of early PCI in patients with STEMI, but there is also concern about potential overuse of PCI in the NSTEMI population. 29–31 We also examined hospital length of stay and readmission within 30 days of discharge. Rates of cardiac catheterization and PCI within 90 days of admission for STEMI were higher for high-income patients than for low-income patients in all countries.

For instance, rates of catheterization among high- vs low-income patients with STEMI in England were 85. 3% vs
79. 4%. Age- and sex-standardized readmission rates are shown in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1.

In the appropriate clinical context, these assays allow clinicians to rapidly rule out a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and decrease 30-day major adverse cardiac events. This can have significant downstream impacts on the percentage of patients discharged from the emergency department (ED), ED lengths of stay, cardiac testing, and hospitalizations. There are many proposed diagnostic protocols and experts recommend institutions implement a single validated protocol.

### Comparison of in-hospital mortality and length of stay in acute ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction among urban teaching hospitals in China and the United States [^117Wjk3A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute ST‐segment‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an acute and life‐threatening condition that serves as the leading contributor of death globally, resulting in substantial medical as well as economic burdens. 1, 2 Although clinical outcomes, including adjusted 30‐day mortality and readmission rates, have improved during the past years in the United States, the overall 30‐day mortality rate remains high. 3, 4 For acute STEMI patients, urgent revascularization is required for better survival and improved healthcare resource utilization, given that timely access to revascularization could reduce the extent of ischemic injury and protect cardiac function. The primary reperfusion treatments for acute STEMI are thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), among which PCI is suggested as the preferred treatment according to the recommended guidelines in China and the United States. 5, 6 CABG serves as a remedial measure for high‐risk conditions, including cardiogenic shock, severe multivessel coronary artery disease, or PCI failure. It was previously reported that only ≤ 5% of patients admitted for acute STEMI received CABG. 7, 8

In the United States, most acute STEMI patients could receive primary PCI (PPCI) as the initial reperfusion therapy and median door‐to‐balloon time has declined from 96 minutes in 2005 to 64 minutes in 2010 nationally, conforming to the recommended time of ≤ 90 minutes. 9 However, the situation of early reperfusion among acute STEMI patients in China is not so good. Researchers have reported an average door‐to‐balloon time of > 130 minutes in China. 10, 11 According to the nationally representative China PEACE‐Retrospective Acute Myocardial Infarction Study, rates of PPCI in acute STEMI were 10.2% in 2001, 17.0% in 2006, and 27.6% in 2011. 2 Although quality of care has improved with implementation of evidence‐based treatments, the rate of early reperfusion in China is lower than that in the United States.

### Long-term time-varying risk of readmission after acute myocardial infarction [^113irPFy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Most patients are never readmitted after an index MI, even when the readmission window is lengthened to 1 year. Of patients who are readmitted, < 25% accounted for nearly half (43%) of all the readmissions, reflecting that the risk of readmission is not the same from patient to patient. This varying risk is even more striking when viewed in the context of the entire cohort because the patients readmitted more than once only represent 4.8% of the total population of patients discharged alive after MI; yet, they account for nearly half of all readmissions within 12 months. This varying individual patient‐to‐patient risk may enable us to concentrate our readmission prevention strategies on certain high‐risk patients because nearly 80% of patients are never readmitted, ≈15% are readmitted once, and 5% are readmitted multiple times. Identifying the specific patients who have a dramatically higher risk for readmission after MI could help direct efforts to prevent future readmissions. However, the development of accurate readmission risk prediction models has remained elusive. 16

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^114qtrc1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) legal considerations — the primary concern is complications after discharge; most readmissions after PCI are not due to procedural complications, yet adverse events can raise questions about longer stays. Data supporting the safety of early appropriate discharge are robust and should overcome medicolegal concerns. Interventionalists should communicate to patients, families, and referring physicians that early discharge is safe and generally preferred by patients, and each facility should have a policy describing criteria for selecting patients and procedures suitable for SDD or early discharge.

### ACC / AHA release guidelines on management of patients… [^115tg8Zj]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Hospital Management EARLY, GENERAL MEASURES Level of Activity Class IIa 1. After 12 to 24 hours, it is reasonable to allow patients with hemodynamic instability or continued ischemia to have bedside commode privileges. Class III 1. Patients with STEMI who are free of recurrent ischemic discomfort, symptoms of heart failure, or serious disturbances of heart rhythm should not be on bed rest for more than 12 to 24 hours. MEDICATION ASSESSMENT BETA BLOCKERS There is overwhelming evidence for the benefits of early use of beta blockers in patients with STEMI and no contraindications to their use. Studies have demonstrated benefits of their use in patients with and without concomitant fibrinolytic therapy, both early and late after STEMI. Class I Patient receiving beta blockers within the first 24 hours of STEMI without adverse effects should continue to receive them during the early convalescent phase of STEMI. Antithrombotics Class I Intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin should be used in patients after STEMI who are at high risk for systemic emboli. Class IIa It is reasonable that patients with STEMI who are not undergoing reperfusion therapy and do not have a contraindication to anticoagulation be treated with intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin or with subcutaneous LMWH for at least 48 hours. In patients whose clinical condition necessitates prolonged bed rest and/or minimized activities, it is reasonable that treatment be continued until the patient is ambulatory.

Oxygen Class I Supplemental oxygen therapy should be continued beyond the first six hours in STEMI patients with arterial oxygen desaturation or overt pulmonary congestion.

### Is coding for myocardial infarction more accurate now that coding descriptions have been clarified to distinguish ST-elevation myocardial infarction from non-ST elevation myocardial infarction? [^116zD6BA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Outcomes are typically graded on the basis of diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). To facilitate performance measurement, the ICD-9 codes for acute myocardial infarction changed in October 2005 to completely separate non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI; code 410.71) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; all other codes 410.x), yet it is unclear whether these changes have been implemented by coders. Patients in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), version 5, were categorized in 2 ways: by electrocardiographic (ECG) findings and ICD-9 codes. Agreement between ECG findings and ICD-9 codes for type of myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) was assessed before and after ICD-9 revision. Mortality rates were measured in a subgroup of patients discharged without transfer after the coding change. There were 102,679 hospitalizations before October 2005 and 63,012 hospitalizations after the coding change, among which the mean age was 66.7 years. Previously, 81% of NSTEMIs (by ECG diagnosis) were coded ICD-9 410.71; after the reclassification of code 410.71 to reflect NSTEMI, 82% of NSTEMIs were coded 410.71 (p < 0.001). Overall, the correlation of ECG diagnosis with ICD-9 code improved only slightly after the coding change. In conclusion, despite more distinctly separated definitions of STEMI and NSTEMI in the new ICD-9 coding system as of October 2005, there appears to be little change in coding, which may reflect a lack of awareness of this substantial change in classification.

Study Participants

All hospitalizations between 2001 and 2011 for patients aged 30 years or older with principal diagnosis of AMI were included in this study. We excluded patients with the hospital length of stay of zero (LOS) because they may have resulted from coding errors, our interest was in ordinary AMI patients who stayed longer than 1 day and the characteristics of the AMI patients with zero LOS (eg, those who were transferred to other institutions or who died within 24 hours of admission) are likely to be different from them, and technically we could not calculate the geometric mean of LOS when the data include zeros. We identified an AMI hospitalization using the International Classification of Diseases — Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) primary discharge diagnosis code for AMI (ICD‐9‐CM codes 410.x0 and 410.x1). We excluded ICD‐9‐CM codes 410.x2 which represents an AMI episode of care following the initial episode (eg, hospital transfers). The primary unit of analysis was a patient hospitalization, counted at discharge. We further classified the hospitalizations into 2 groups by the type of AMI: STEMI and NSTEMI. STEMI was identified by using codes for AMIs of the anterolateral wall (ICD‐9‐CM codes of 410.00 and 410.01), other anterior wall (410.10 and 410.11), inferolateral wall (410.20 and 410.21), inferoposterior wall (410.30 and 410.31), other inferior wall (410.40 and 410.41), other lateral wall (410.50 and 410.51), true posterior wall (410.60 and 410.61), or other specified sites (410.80 and 410.81). NSTEMI was identified using codes for subendocardial infarction (410.70 and 410.71) or AMI of unspecified site (410.90 and 410.91). Because each discharge has a unique primary discharge diagnosis code, all included in our sample were classified as either STEMI or NSTEMI. We also collected information about the intervention received (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) using the ICD‐9‐CM procedure code. We considered discharges as having undergone PCI during hospitalization when they had procedure codes of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary atherectomy (00.66, 36.01, 36.02, 36.05), insertion of non‐drug‐eluting coronary artery stent(s) (36.06), or insertion of drug‐eluting coronary artery stent(s) (36.07). We considered discharges as having undergone CABG during hospitalization when they had procedure codes of bypass anastomosis for heart revascularization (36.1x). Patients "without intervention" were defined as those having neither of PCI nor CABG during hospitalizations.

### The impact of short hospital stay on prognosis after acute myocardial infarction: an analysis from the ACSIS database [^116kADLj]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Until the 1950s, patients with myocardial infarction (MI) were treated by immobilization and prolonged hospital stay (4–6 weeks). 1, 2, 3 This policy gradually changed in the following decades with a median hospitalization of 21 days in 1970, 14 days in 1980, and less thereafter. 4 Improvement in the management of acute MI over the past several decades, in conjunction with a policy of early mobilization, has led to a dramatic decline in overall mortality with a steady decrease in the length of hospital stay (LOS). 5, 6, 7 Though decreased LOS provides a significant cost savings for health care systems, there is concern that this policy might put patients at risk due to premature discharge.

The available evidence regarding the optimal LOS after a MI is scarce. The guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology 8 currently recommend that the optimal LOS should be determined on an individual basis, according to the patient's cardiac risk, comorbidities, functional status, and social support.

Several studies have shown that patients with STEMI who underwent successful primary PCI and complete revascularization can be safely discharged from hospital within 48–72 h. 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 These low‐risk patients can be recognized using various risk score systems 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 such as the Second Primary Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (PAMI‐II) criteria 9 or the Zwolle primary PCI Index. 10, 11, 12, 13

Only a few studies which investigated the safety of early discharge 9, 11, 12, 15, 16 post MI were randomized and most of them were relatively small and underpowered. Moreover, there are no actual guidelines recommendations concerning the optimal LOS following NSTEMI. 17, 18, 19

In the present study, we used the large ACSIS (Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey) database, in order to assess whether an early discharge strategy is safe, and to define the characteristics of patients who could benefit the most from this strategy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Non–PCI-capable hospital STEMI management — Transfer for PPCI is recommended if device activation can be reasonably predicted to occur in < 2 hours from FMC; if this cannot be achieved and symptoms have been present < 12 hours, fibrinolytic therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent MACE. Patients with STEMI who present ≥ 12 hours after symptom onset should be transferred to a PCI-capable facility when possible; if hemodynamic instability or a large infarct territory is at risk and timely PPCI is not possible, the benefits of fibrinolytic administration likely outweigh the benefit of prolonged transfer, and fibrinolysis in this setting should be followed by transfer to a PCI-capable center as soon as feasible. PPCI is recommended to reduce the risk of MACE when FMC to PPCI can be achieved within 120 minutes, and when timely PPCI is unavailable, meta-analyses show statistically similar morbidity and mortality with a pharmaco-invasive approach (eg, fibrinolysis followed by PCI within 2 to 24 hours). The STREAM trial randomized 1892 early presenters with symptoms < 3 hours who were unable to receive PCI within 1 hour of FMC and found similar 30-day composite and 1-year mortality rates for prehospital fibrinolysis versus transfer for PPCI; small studies also suggest PPCI continues to offer clinical benefit 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, making transfer reasonable.

### Defining and managing patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: sorting through type 1 vs other types [^115Bo1RP]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes a spectrum spanning unstable angina, non ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 1, 2, 3

Typically, ACS results from an abrupt total (STEMI and some NSTEMI) or subtotal (NSTEMI only) interruption of coronary artery blood flow, and therefore oxygen supply, to cardiac tissues. 1, 4 This occurs as a result of coronary artery occlusion following atherosclerotic plaque disruption, where the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque leads to the formation of an intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries. 1, 3 Myocardial infarction (MI) can also result from distal thrombotic embolization. 1, 5 Evaluation of the clinical presentation and determining the underlying pathophysiology of an MI are crucial for the development of an appropriate management plan. 1, 5

STEMI is usually characterized by severe and/or total coronary flow obstruction with transmural ischemia, which predisposes to myocardial necrosis and pump dysfunction. 6 The pathogenesis of NSTEMI differs from that of STEMI in that it usually results from a flow‐limiting coronary stenosis with resultant downstream myocardial ischemia. 1, 3, 4 Total coronary artery occlusion is present in approximately one‐quarter of patients with NSTEMI. 4 STEMI and NSTEMI require different approaches to their acute and long‐term management. 1, 2, 3 In this article, we focus on the epidemiology, prognosis, and management of NSTEMI according to its underlying pathophysiology.

### Rehospitalizations following primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: results from a multi-center randomized trial [^113Np6ve]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rehospitalizations (RHs) after myocardial infarction (MI) are the aftermath of in‐hospital quality of care, postdischarge management, and an individual's vulnerability. 1, 2 Up to one fifth of patients who survive to hospital discharge will be readmitted within 1 month, 3, 4 with the consequent economic burden as well as impact on quality of life and long‐term prognosis. Identifying the characteristics associated with RHs could aid in stratifying patients according to their risk of RHs and assist physicians in optimizing management following discharge. 5

Although extensive data have been published regarding RHs after acute MI, 5 RHs after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients presenting with ST‐segment elevation MI (STEMI) have not been systematically studied, and available data are limited to 30 days of follow‐up. 2, 4 Moreover, predictors of RHs have not been consistent throughout studies, which is partially explained by the diverse types of RHs reported (eg, all cause, cardiac related), as well as the quality and granularity of data expected based on the study design. 5 In addition, regional differences in the frequency emerged in multinational studies, underscoring the impact of health systems and local practices on RHs. 2

Planned RHs post‐PCI for STEMI may reflect good clinical practice, given that they relate to clinical decisions to better diagnose or treat patients. Such decisions could occur before (eg, hip replacement), during (eg, staged PCI), or after (eg, implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator) the index hospitalization. Consequently, examining unplanned RHs may better characterize patients at increased risk. Our aim was to investigate the frequency, reasons, and predictors of unplanned cardiac and noncardiac RHs following primary PCI in STEMI patients.

### ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction care in America: celebration and anxiety [^115Qj3Na]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

There is some solace to be found in this distressing observation. Although the 30‐day mortality rate of AW‐STEMI patients was twice that of those staying in hospital 1 more day, the difference was small in absolute terms: a mortality risk of 0.2% compared with 0.1%. With 64 097 patients discharged after 1 to 2 days and 53 235 discharged at 3 days, this is a difference of 75 lives of 117 332, ≈15 excess deaths for each year of study. Not to diminish the concern, but at least the death rate in this cohort was not far out of range. And when bundled with those who stayed for a third day, an overall strategy of early discharge was not linked to unfavorable outcomes and was cost saving. I suppose planning for a 3‐day stay is prudent for AW‐STEMI, but until we have a better understanding about this group, we cannot use that extra time wisely. Knowing other uncomplicated STEMI patients can be safely discharged in < 3 days, and that the extra day for AW‐STEMI patients increases costs only modestly, is reassuring.

Although it is a distracting observation, concerns over this special patient subgroup should not cloud the important broader findings in the article by Jang et al. 4 This complex and well‐executed analysis of a large data set representing approximately half of all hospitalizations in America over a 5‐year period demonstrates that hospitals have been working hard to deliver high‐quality, efficient care for STEMI patients. That work is paying off, literally, by lowering short‐term and 30‐day cumulative care costs while producing excellent outcomes for patients. As is always the case, a bit more information is needed to complete the picture. The early discharge AW‐STEMI group is ripe for further study.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to transfer, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to transfer patients with STEMI and an estimated time from first medical contact to device activation of ≤ 120 minutes, or those with a contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy, to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Identifying patients for safe early hospital discharge following ST elevation myocardial infarction [^111Rn4QM]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the CADILLAC risk score is an effective method of patient stratification for early discharge following ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Background

Patients with STEMI are typically hospitalized to monitor for serious complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and reinfarction. Optimal length of stay is unclear. Whether low risk patients can be safely discharged before 72 hr of hospitalization is unclear.

Methods

Patients with STEMI who underwent successful PCI were retrospectively stratified using CADILLAC risk score to low risk (n = 123) and intermediate to high risk (n = 105). The primary outcome was adverse clinical events at day 3 or later. Secondary outcomes were adverse clinical events on day 1 and mortality rates at 30 days and 31 to 365 days.

Results

Low risk patients had lower major adverse clinical events at day 3 or later (0 vs. 11.4%, P = 0.0002) and lower total mortality at 1 year (0 vs. 4.8%, P = 0.02) than patients with intermediate to high risk. Low risk patients were also less likely to have a cardiovascular event during the first 24 hr when compared to those with an intermediate to high risk score (3.3% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.006).

Conclusion

Low risk patients identified using CADILLAC risk score with STEMI treated successfully with primary PCI have a low adverse event rate on the third day or later of hospitalization suggesting that an earlier discharge is safe in properly selected patients. Monitoring in a noncritical care setting following primary PCI for STEMI may be feasible for selected patients. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Admission status for PCI per Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) criteria — Inpatient is "A patient who has been admitted to a hospital for bed occupancy for purposes of receiving inpatient hospital services" and is "Formally admitted as inpatient" with care expected to span "at least two midnights". Outpatient status is for most outpatient procedures and includes that "CMS does not define how long observation should be as long as it is less than 24 hr" and "There is no additional reimbursement for overnight stay and/or nursing care". Observation "cannot be defined preprocedure; i.e., a patient cannot come as outpatient for a procedure and expect to be placed in observation", and "A patient can remain in observation status for up to 48 hr", with hospitals able to "bill for additional nursing care and procedures to treat the patient".

### Hospital length of stay in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111g1bd5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Substantial heterogeneity in hospital length of stay exists among patients admitted with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Furthermore, little is known about the factors that impact length of stay.

Methods

We examined 39,107 non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients admitted to 351 Acute Coronary Treatment Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines hospitals from January 1, 2007-March 31, 2009 who underwent cardiac catheterization and survived to discharge. Length of stay was categorized into 4 groups (≤ 2, 3–4, 5–7, and ≥ 8 days), where prolonged length of stay was defined as > 4 days.

Results

The overall median (25(th), 75(th)) length of stay was 3 (2, 5) days. Patients with a length of stay of > 2 days were older with more comorbidities, but were less likely to receive evidence-based therapies or percutaneous coronary intervention. Among the factors associated with prolonged length of stay > 4 days were delay to cardiac catheterization > 48 hours, heart failure or shock on admission, female sex, insurance type, and admission to the hospital on a Friday afternoon or evening. Hospital characteristics such as academic versus nonacademic or urban versus rural setting, were not associated with prolonged length of stay.

Conclusion

Patients with longer length of stay have more comorbidities and in-hospital complications, yet paradoxically, are less often treated with evidence-based medications and are less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention. Hospital admission on a Friday afternoon or evening and delays to catheterization appear to significantly impact length of stay. A better understanding of factors associated with length of stay in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is needed to promote safe and early discharge in an era of increasingly restrictive health care resources.

### The impact of short hospital stay on prognosis after acute myocardial infarction: an analysis from the ACSIS database [^114gy62P]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Setting

An observational study using the Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey (ACSIS) database. The ACSIS is a biannual nationwide survey performed since the year 2000 that includes all ACS patients admitted during a 2‐month period to the intensive cardiac care units and cardiology wards of 26 public Israeli hospitals. This survey was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each site and all patients signed a written informed consent. The survey prospectively collects pre‐specified data on patients admitted with the diagnosis of ACS including unstable angina, non‐ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Experienced nurses and study coordinators collect follow‐up information at 30 days. Mortality at 1 year is obtained from the Israeli National Population registry. The present analysis included all patients with acute MI (STEMI or NSTEMI) who participated in the survey throughout 2000–2016. Patients who died during hospitalization and those who underwent CABG were excluded. The ACSIS survey was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of each site.

2.2 Design

All patients were segregated according to their LOS (LOS): up to 3, 3–6, and over 6 days. The short LOS was chosen based on previous studies and guidelines of early discharge after STEMI. 8, 9, 11, 12 The intermediate LOS was chosen arbitrary representing the next 72 h (3–6 days). The long LOS was all other patients. We compared the groups for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, management strategies during the index event, and outcome at 30 days and mortality at 1 year. Outcomes included all‐cause mortality, MI, recurrent angina or revascularization (defined as new unplanned need for percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery), arrhythmias and re‐hospitalization from any cause. Major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was defined as the composite of death, unstable angina, MI/ischemia, cerebrovascular event, stent thrombosis and an unplanned need for revascularization procedure.

Additional comparisons were made between STEMI and NSTEMI patients and according to the GRACE‐score (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events Risk Score) tertiles.

### Delay in coronary artery bypass grafting for STEMI patients improves hospital morbidity and mortality [^112gb1x6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European revascularization guidelines for STEMI recommend culprit vessel revascularization during primary PCI as the primary intervention strategy in patients with multivessel disease. Despite these recommendations cardiothoracic surgeons are asked on many occasions to perform CABG on STEMI patients because of technical issues in the catherization laboratory. The findings from our study have been seen previously in a few studies but the debate on the timing of surgical revascularization is still present. Further support for our results has been stated beforehand and documented in the 2004 ACC/AHA guidelines. In the guidelines the management of patients with STEMI gives the following class IIa recommendation: "In patients who have had a STEMI, CABG mortality is elevated for the first 3 to 7 days after infarction, and the benefit of revascularization must be balanced against the increased risk. Patients who have been stabilized after STEMI and who have incurred a significant fall in LV function should have their surgery delayed to allow myocardial recovery to occur". The data from our study supports these statements and further helps to identify the optimal timing when patients should undergo CABG. Frequently, cardiothoracic surgeons do not have the luxury of waiting for 7 days to intervene and as a result reporting the impact of surgery earlier is important to know.

In this study, patients with STEMI who underwent CABG during the first 24 h after the event were found to have higher cardiac, respiratory and renal complications. They were also more likely to have increased in-hospital mortality and a longer length of hospital stay.

### Dynamic TIMI risk score for STEMI [^113nA3qW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Risk stratification of STEMI patients is a continuous process. Over time, a patient's condition can change, altering estimated mortality. The dynamic TIMI risk score for STEMI is a prospectively derived, validated means of updating the estimate of 1‐year mortality at the time of hospital discharge. Unlike baseline risk assessments, this score incorporates information from events during the index hospital course that are known to affect mortality risk from STEMI after hospital discharge.

### The impact of short hospital stay on prognosis after acute myocardial infarction: an analysis from the ACSIS database [^112CxPZo]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study supports current guidelines advocating discharge 48–72 h after admission for an uncomplicated STEMI. 8 However, there is inconsistency in the literature about the optimal score for assessing the risk after MI in order to determine the desired length of stay. Most studies defined the threshold for early discharge as an extremely low risk in STEMI patients. 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 23 Our study incorporated a much wider spectrum of patients by the GRACE risk score, and demonstrated the same outcomes for both STEMI and NSTEMI patients at low to intermediate risk. When using a multivariate analysis, the LOS did not predict neither mortality nor MACE at 30 days (Table 3). Furthermore, there are no guideline recommendations for optimal LOS following NSTEMI 17, 18, 19 and our study supports an approach of early discharge after an uncomplicated course.

4.1 Limitations

The major limitation of our observational study is that we cannot demonstrate causality but only an association between variables and outcome, along with the risk of overlooked confounders. In addition, the data was collected over a 16‐year period during in which various changes in therapies and intervention policies occurred that may have influenced the changes in LOS and prognosis.

The data were collected by many investigators, which may lead to different interpretations of the study questionnaire. In addition, re‐admissions were not divided into emergent and elective, and therefore may include some elective admissions such as planned PCI to a non‐culprit vessel. Finally, we could not account for patients admitted for very short time because of leaving against medical advice, a factor that may also portend worse outcomes secondary to noncompliance.

### Length of stay following percutaneous coronary intervention: an expert consensus document update from the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions [^117GNKxW]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) early discharge risk stratification is supported by studies identifying low-risk criteria and thresholds for safe early discharge. In one study of 228 patients, a low CADILLAC score was associated with fewer major adverse cardiac events beyond 3 days after PPCI versus intermediate/high scores (0% vs 11.4%, P = 0.0002). Incorporating N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the Zwolle risk score (ZRS) improved prognostication; based on a ZRS (< 2) or NT-proBNP at 18–24 h (< 2500 pg/mL), 75% of patients could be targeted for early discharge at 48 h. Randomized trials using ZRS-selected low-risk PPCI patients included n = 215 randomized to early (< 3 days) or routine discharge and another trial of 54 patients randomized to routine care or discharge within 72 hr with Advanced practice nurse follow-up; in both studies there were no deaths and no difference in rehospitalization, suggesting that low-risk ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients can be safely discharged within 72 hr.

### Predicting length of stay and the need for postacute care after acute myocardial infarction to improve healthcare efficiency [^116ycvSQ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2018). Low credibility.

Background To improve value in the care of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), payment models increasingly hold providers accountable for costs. As such, providers need tools to predict length of stay (LOS) during hospitalization and the likelihood of needing postacute care facilities after discharge for acute MI patients. We developed models to estimate risk for prolonged LOS and postacute care for acute MI patients at time of hospital admission to facilitate coordinated care planning. Methods and Results We identified patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ACTION registry (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) who were discharged alive after hospitalization for acute MI between July 1, 2008 and March 31, 2017. Within a 70% random sample (Training cohort) we developed hierarchical, proportional odds models to predict LOS and hierarchical logistic regression models to predict discharge to postacute care. Models were validated in the remaining 30%. Of 633 737 patients in the Training cohort, 16.8% had a prolonged LOS (≥ 7 days) and 7.8% were discharged to a postacute facility (extended care, a transitional care unit, or rehabilitation). Model discrimination was moderate in the validation dataset for predicting LOS (C statistic = 0.640) and strong for predicting discharge to postacute care (C statistic = 0.827). For both models, discrimination was similar in ST-segment-elevation MI and non-ST-segment-elevation MI subgroups and calibration was excellent. Conclusions These models developed in a national registry can be used at the time of initial hospitalization to predict LOS and discharge to postacute facilities. Prospective testing of these models is needed to establish how they can improve care coordination and lower costs.

### Mortality differences among patients with in-hospital ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^112EN3uB]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In‐hospital STEMI, while far less common than out‐of‐hospital STEMI, is associated with delayed reperfusion and poorer outcomes. 1 Admitted patients are frequently not on cardiology services, less likely to have typical symptoms suggestive of acute MI, and more likely to have comorbid conditions which may serve as contraindications to invasive diagnostic testing, including coronary angiography. These factors contribute to delayed recognition, triage, and treatment of in‐hospital STEMI. 1 The cohort of patients who develop in‐hospital STEMI consists of a heterogeneous population with various admission diagnoses and varying complexity of illness. This study highlights the differences in outcomes among three distinct subsets of patients who develop STEMI while admitted to the hospital: cardiac, periprocedure, and noncardiac/nonpostprocedure. To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study to stratify cases of in‐hospital STEMI into more discrete, homogeneous groups.

Although an overall in‐hospital mortality of 36% presented in this case series was comparable to published mortality rates, we found that this was driven primarily by higher mortality among the noncardiac patients (33%‐46%). 1 Mortality for cardiac patients in this study more closely resembled reported rates of out‐of‐hospital STEMI cases. 8 Furthermore, the noncardiac patients in our study had longer ECG‐to‐CCL times than cardiac patients, although a significant limitation is the extent of missing data and the small sample size, particularly for our cohort of cardiac patients. Nonetheless, our findings were consistent with those reported in single center studies by Garberich et al and Dai et al, which also found that patients admitted with noncardiac reasons had longer reperfusion times and higher mortality than those admitted for cardiac reasons. 3, 9

### The impact of short hospital stay on prognosis after acute myocardial infarction: an analysis from the ACSIS database [^117PHpUL]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current evidence regarding the optimal length of hospital stay (LOS) following myocardial infarction (MI) is limited. This study aimed to examine LOS policy for MI patients and to assess the safety of early discharge.

Methods

A prospective observational study that included patients with STEMI and NSTEMI enrolled in the Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey (ACSIS) during the years 2000–2016. Patients were divided into three subgroups according to their LOS: < 3days (short-LOS), 3–6days (intermediate-LOS) and > 6days (long-LOS). We compared baseline characteristics, management strategies and clinical outcomes at 30days and 1 year in these groups.

Results

Ten thousand four hundred and fifty eight patients were enrolled in the study. The LOS of MI patients gradually decreased over time. Short-LOS and intermediate-LOS patients had similar clinical characteristics while patients in the long-LOS group were older with more co-morbidity. There was no difference in the clinical outcomes, including re-MI, arrhythmias, 30days MACE, and 30days mortality between the short-LOS and intermediate-LOS groups. However, the rate of re-hospitalizations was higher in the short-LOS group (20.9% vs. 17.8%, p = .004) without evidence of increased cardiovascular events. In multivariate analysis, the LOS did not predict either 30days mortality (HR: 1.3; CI:0.45–5.48), nor MACE at 30days (HR: 1.1; CI:0.79–1.56).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that an early discharge strategy of up to 3days from admission is safe for low and intermediate-risk patients after both STEMI and NSTEMI. Nevertheless, this strategy is associated with an increased risk of potential avoidable readmission and there might be psychological and social factors that may warrant a longer stay.

### Dynamic TIMI risk score for STEMI [^115BPqJ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients suffering from ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have preexisting characteristics that vary across a range of severity. This unique milieu produces post‐STEMI complications at a variable yet quantifiable rate. The process of estimating the long‐term risk of morbidity and mortality after STEMI is based on 2 levels of assessment. At hospital admission, patients can be stratified by demographics, physical examination, and presenting signs, as well as initial laboratory and angiographic data. – The second level of assessment involves the identification of long‐term risk based on the development of postevent complications. It is well established that patients who have peri‐infarction morbidity are at increased risk for downstream events.

Over the last 10 years, multiple methods of risk stratification for STEMI have been developed. The TIMI risk score, TIMI risk index, GRACE risk index, Zwolle primary PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) risk index, and CADILLAC risk scoreare all prospectively validated predictors of both short‐ and long‐term mortality. Although each relies on a wide range of admission and peri‐PCI characteristics, these methods do not reclassify patients based on in‐hospital events. –, Patients are tied to the score they were assigned on admission without regard to their initial recovery from the index event. Although some validated risk scores include in‐hospital events, there is a need for a risk stratification method that can be easily calculable at bedside, added as an arithmetic sum, and used as an additional component of an existing scoring system. –

The wide spectrum of STEMI patients includes both those who are initially deemed high risk but have an uneventful hospital recovery as well as low‐risk patients who suffer major morbidity prior to discharge. Methods of prognostication that merge these populations do not take advantage of important information gathered in the first few days following the event.

Our primary goal is to present a new method of STEMI risk stratification that incorporates both initial assessment of risk as well as a discharge estimation of 1‐year mortality. This clinical risk score, derived from a multivariable analysis, can be calculated at the bedside and is a dynamic updating of the TIMI risk score for STEMI at the time of discharge, conditional on having survived the index hospitalization.

### Mortality differences among patients with in-hospital ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^1172YJfn]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In‐hospital ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a unique clinical entity encompassing a more heterogeneous patient population and associated with a higher mortality rate than out‐of‐hospital STEMI. 1 The true incidence of in‐hospital STEMI is unclear due in the past to the lack of a standardized definition and the exclusion of these patients from clinical trials, however it is estimated at 18 to 34 per 100 000 adult hospitalizations based on the available literature. 1 Prior retrospective studies show that patients who develop in‐hospital STEMI are older, more frequently female, have higher in‐hospital mortality, and less frequently undergo cardiac catheterization than patients who present with out‐of‐hospital STEMI. Mortality of in‐hospital STEMI is 3 to 10‐fold greater than out‐of‐hospital STEMI. 2, 3, 4 An integrated system of care, along with national quality initiatives such as the American college of cardiology door to balloon alliance and the American heart association's mission: Lifeline, have resulted in expedient reperfusion times and decreased mortality for patients who develop out‐of‐hospital STEMI. 5, 6, 7 Conversely, for patients who develop STEMI while admitted to the hospital, there are often barriers to diagnosis and management. Equivalent quality measures and universal protocols for treatment of in‐hospital STEMI do not exist, likely contributing to delays in recognition and treatment.

Recently, a national cohort of clinicians and researchers have formed the In‐Hospital STEMI Quality Improvement Project, a group dedicated to increasing awareness of and improving outcomes for patients with in‐hospital STEMI. In a recent Special Communication published in JAMA Cardiology, this group proposed a standardized definition of in‐hospital STEMI and identified three clinically distinct groups within this cohort. 1 However, the value of this classification has not yet been determined. The aim of the study presented here is to evaluate the usefulness of this standardized classification and to analyze outcomes with respect to these groups.

### Variation in revascularisation use and outcomes of patients in hospital with acute myocardial infarction across six high income countries: cross sectional cohort study [^113DDDFx]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hospital efficiency

Marked variation was found among the countries for mean length of stay and 30 day readmission rate for STEMI and NSTEMI (fig 3, supplementary appendices 6 and 7). For example, in 2017, mean length of stay for STEMI ranged from 5.0 days (Netherlands) and 5.1 days (US) to 8.5 days (Taiwan), while median length of stay ranged from 3 to 6 days across countries (supplementary appendix 6). The 2017 30 day readmission rate for STEMI ranged from 11.7% (Taiwan) and 12.2% (US) to 23.1% in England. The US was unique among countries in having short hospital length of stay and low 30 day readmission rates for STEMI and NSTEMI. Between 2011 and 2017, hospital length of stay decreased for STEMI and NSTEMI by approximately one day in all countries; 30 day readmission rates decreased substantially for STEMI and NSTEMI in the US, the Netherlands, and Taiwan but less in the other countries.

### Highlights from the 2013 ACCF / AHA guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and beyond [^116h6b5j]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is considered a cardiology emergency requiring immediate recognition and treatment aimed at successful and early reperfusion to ensure optimal outcomes. The American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have issued guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction since 1990. These guidelines are based on clinical research exploring reperfusion modalities and adjunctive therapies. They are further supported by expert opinion where randomized trial evidence is lacking. In January 2013, the ACCF/AHA released the most recent guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI. This review focuses on the newest and most important recommendations taken from the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of STEMI and highlight important new studies that have emerged over the past year.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Thirty‐Day Readmission by LOS

Overall incidence of 30‐day readmission was higher in patients with AW STEMI than those with NAW STEMI (12.3% versus 9.9%, P < 0.001). The rates of 30‐day readmission in patients with AW STEMI were 8.7% in the short LOS cohort, 14.9% in the medium LOS cohort, and 21.1% in the long LOS cohort (P < 0.001). The rate of 30‐day readmission in patients with NAW STEMI were 7.7% in the short LOS cohort, 13.4% in the medium LOS cohort, and 19.5% in the long LOS cohort (P < 0.001). In the AW STEMI group, the 30‐day readmission rates were 7.8% in the very short LOS (1–2 days) cohort, 9.8% in the 3‐day LOS cohort, 13.8% in the 4‐day LOS cohort, 16.9% in the 5‐day LOS cohort, and 21.1% in the > 5‐day LOS cohort (P < 0.001) (Figure 2 A). In the NAW STEMI group, the 30‐day readmission rates were 7.1% in the very short LOS cohort, 8.8% in the 3‐day LOS cohort, 12.0% in the 4‐day LOS cohort, 16.3% in the 5‐day LOS cohort, and 19.5% in the > 5‐day LOS cohort (P < 0.001) (Figure 2 B). Very short LOS was associated with reduced risk of adjusted 30‐day readmission in both the AW STEMI group (adjusted HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.91) and the NAW STEMI group (adjusted HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92) compared with 3‐day LOS. Patients with LOS of 4 days, 5 days, and > 5 days showed incrementally higher risk of adjusted 30‐day readmission in both the AW STEMI group (adjusted HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.17–1.36]; 1.42 [95% CI, 1.30–1.55]; and 1.50 [95% CI, 1.39–1.63], respectively) and the NAW STEMI group (adjusted HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.11–1.27]; 1.47 [95% CI, 1.34–1.60]; and 1.46 [95% CI, 1.37–1.57], respectively) (Figure 3, Tables S3 through S8).

### Improving the non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) pathway using quality improvement methodology [^116ze1Ya]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Problem

The term 'acute coronary syndromes' (ACS) encompasses a range of conditions including unstable angina, and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, collectively termed non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There are distinct pathways for patients with NSTEACS and STEMI.

The STEMI pathway differs from the NSTEACS pathway as ST elevation on an ECG usually indicates a complete occlusion of a coronary artery, which is an emergency. Typically, these patients call 999, paramedics attend and perform an ECG, and if STEMI is diagnosed, transport urgently to the nearest centre that provides 24/7 primary angioplasty.

This paper focuses on the NSTEACS pathway, a group of patients without ST elevation on ECG usually admitted to their local hospital. People with ACS have a poor prognosis without prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on the management of ACS contains a quality standard that states "adults with NSTEACS with an intermediate or higher risk of future adverse cardiovascular events who are having coronary angiography (with follow-on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if indicated), undergo this within 72 hours of first admission to hospital".

In Wales, there is poor compliance with this quality standard, with unwarranted variation across the country. In this report, the NSTEACS pathway for the hospitals studied had a compliance of 18% with this standard — well below the compliance published in the annual Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Program (MINAP) and reflects incomplete data collection for MINAP.

A recent meta-analysis of 17 randomised controlled trials with > 10 000 patients has reported that for patients with NSTEACS, an early invasive coronary angiogram strategy significantly reduced the risk of recurrent ischaemia and length of stay, it did not have a significant impact on all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, admission with heart failure or repeat revascularisation.

Long inpatient delays before angiography in patients with NSTEACS reduce opportunities for other patients to be admitted to acute medical beds and create a higher cost per case for NSTEACS treatment.

### Pre-hospital versus in-hospital thrombolysis for ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^115m4JYj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Early thrombolysis for individuals experiencing a myocardial infarction is associated with better mortality and morbidity outcomes. While traditionally thrombolysis is given in hospital, pre-hospital thrombolysis is proposed as an effective intervention to save time and reduce mortality and morbidity in individuals with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Despite some evidence that pre-hospital thrombolysis may be delivered safely, there is a paucity of controlled trial data to indicate whether the timing of delivery can be effective in reducing key clinical outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the morbidity and mortality of pre-hospital versus in-hospital thrombolysis for STEMI.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), two citation indexes on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for randomised controlled trials and grey literature published up to June 2014. We also searched the reference lists of articles identified, clinical trial registries and unpublished thesis sources. We did not contact pharmaceutical companies for any relevant published or unpublished articles. We applied no language, date or publication restrictions. The Cochrane Heart Group conducted the primary electronic search.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of pre-hospital versus in-hospital thrombolysis in adults with ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosed by a healthcare provider.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened eligible studies for inclusion and carried out data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments, resolving any disagreement by consulting a third author. We contacted authors of potentially suitable studies if we required missing or additional information. We collected efficacy and adverse effect data from the trials.

Main Results

We included three trials involving 538 participants. We found low quality of evidence indicating uncertainty whether pre-hopsital thrombolysis reduces all-cause mortality in individuals with STEMI compared to in-hospital thrombolysis (risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 1.41). We found high-quality evidence (two trials, 438 participants) that pre-hospital thrombolysis reduced the time to receipt of thrombolytic treatment compared with in-hospital thrombolysis. For adverse events, we found moderate-quality evidence that the occurrence of bleeding events was similar between participants receiving in-hospital or pre-hospital thrombolysis (two trials, 438 participants), and low-quality evidence that the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation (two trials, 178 participants), stroke (one trial, 78 participants) and allergic reactions (one trial, 100 participants) was also similar between participants receiving in-hospital or pre-hospital thrombolysis. We considered the included studies to have an overall unclear/high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Pre-hospital thrombolysis reduces time to treatment, based on studies conducted in higher income countries. In settings where it can be safely and correctly administered by trained staff, pre-hospital thrombolysis may be an appropriate intervention. Pre-hospital thrombolysis has the potential to reduce the burden of STEMI in lower- and middle-income countries, especially in individuals who have limited access to in-hospital thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary interventions. We found no randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of pre-hospital thrombolysis for STEMI in lower- and middle-income countries. Large high-quality multicentre randomised controlled trials implemented in resource-constrained countries will provide additional evidence for the efficacy and safety of this intervention. Local policy makers should consider their local health infrastructure and population distribution needs. These considerations should be taken into account when developing clinical guidelines for pre-hospital thrombolysis.

### Contemporary challenges in the management of acute myocardial infarction: ST-elevation myocardial infarction guidelines and the real world [^114H3PWe]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Timely reperfusion is the primary treatment goal for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines utilize time since symptom onset, anticipated time to treatment, patient risk factors, and center volume and experience to determine the optimal reperfusion strategy. There continues to be a considerable number of patients who do not receive reperfusion therapy and treatment delays are still too long. Institution-specific protocols which reflect current guidelines may increase the number of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients who receive timely reperfusion.

### Association of inpatient vs outpatient onset of ST-elevation myocardial infarction with treatment and clinical outcomes [^1136N8j2]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Reperfusion times for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) occurring in outpatients have improved significantly, but quality improvement efforts have largely ignored STEMI occurring in hospitalized patients (inpatient-onset STEMI).

Objective

To define the incidence and variables associated with treatment and outcomes of patients who develop STEMI during hospitalization for conditions other than acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational analysis of STEMIs occurring between 2008 and 2011 as identified in the California State Inpatient Database.

Exposures

STEMIs were classified as inpatient onset or outpatient onset based on present-on-admission codes. Patients who had a STEMI after being hospitalized for ACS were excluded from the analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Regression models were used to evaluate associations among location of onset of STEMI, resource utilization, and outcomes. Adjustments were made for patient age, sex, comorbidities, and hospital characteristics. The analysis allowed for the location of inpatient STEMI to have a multiplicative rather than an additive effect for resource utilization since these measures were highly skewed.

Results

A total of 62,021 STEMIs were identified in 303 hospitals, of which 3068 (4.9%) occurred in patients hospitalized for non-ACS indications. Patients with inpatient-onset STEMI were older (mean, 71.5 [SD, 13.5] years vs 64.9 [SD, 14.1] years; P < .001) and more frequently female (47.4% vs 32%; P < .001) than those with outpatient-onset STEMI. Patients with inpatient-onset STEMI had higher in-hospital mortality (33.6% vs 9.2%; adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.05; 95% CI, 2.76–3.38; P < .001), were less likely to be discharged home (33.7% vs 69.4%; AOR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.34–0.42; P < .001), and were less likely to undergo cardiac catheterization (33.8% vs 77.8%; AOR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.16–0.21; P < .001) or percutaneous coronary intervention (21.6% vs 65%; AOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.21–0.26; P < .001). Length of stay and inpatient charges were higher for inpatient-onset STEMI (mean length of stay, 13.4 days [95% CI, 12.8–14.0 days] vs 4.7 days [95% CI, 4.6–4.8 days]; adjusted multiplicative effect, 2.51; 95% CI, 2.35–2.69; P < .001; mean inpatient charges, $245,000 [95% CI, $235,300-$254,800] vs $129,000 [95% CI, $127,900-$130,100]; adjusted multiplicative effect, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.93–2.28; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients who had a STEMI while hospitalized for a non-ACS condition, compared with those with onset of STEMI as an outpatient, were less likely to undergo invasive testing or intervention and had a higher in-hospital mortality rate.

### Sex differences in treatment and outcomes of patients with in-hospital ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^1114aX6d]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite advancements in medical therapy and device technology, patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) continue to suffer from high mortality. Rapid reperfusion is key in the treatment of STEMI with time from symptom onset to revascularization closely linked to outcomes. Two groups of patients with STEMI who demonstrate a particularly poor prognosis are females, and patients with so‐called "in‐hospital STEMI", that is, STEMI that happens while the patient is already admitted to the hospital. With regard to females, factors associated with poorer outcomes include significantly longer ischemic times in females compared with males, as well as more bleedingand less guideline‐directed medical therapy. Similarly, patients with in‐hospital STEMI have been found to have longer ischemic times compared with patients presenting with out‐of‐hospital STEMI. Further, both female patients, and those with in‐hospital STEMI, are older and have more comorbidities. They are both less likely to undergo invasive diagnostic management as well as to be treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).,

Despite these concerning data, patients with in‐hospital STEMI have been under‐researched, with less than a handful of studies conducted. The topic is of critical importance during the current coronavirus‐19 pandemic: Acute cardiac injury is present in 17% of patients with COVID‐19and is predictive of in‐hospital mortality in this patient group. Importantly, STEMIs do occur both as the first sign of COVID‐19 or in‐hospital patients admitted for COVID‐19.

In particular, no research has been undertaken with regard to female patients with in‐hospital STEMI and possible sex disparities in this patient group and as compared with overall STEMI cohorts. The aim of this study was to evaluate sex differences in ischemic times and outcomes of patients with in‐hospital STEMI in a large, multicenter, prospective registry.

### Associations between hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission, and costs in ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction after primary percutaneous coronary intervention: a nationwide readmissions database analysis [^1164wuA5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Thirty‐Day Readmission Mortality, Reinfarction, and Repeat Revascularization by LOS

The 30‐day mortality rates during readmission were 0.2% in the short LOS cohort, 0.4% in the medium LOS cohort, and 1.3% in the long LOS cohort among the AW STEMI group (P < 0.001), and 0.1% in the short LOS cohort, 0.4% in the medium LOS cohort, and 0.9% in the long LOS cohort among the NAW STEMI group (P < 0.001). The 30‐day mortality rates for both the AW STEMI group and the NAW STEMI group stratified by more detailed LOS cohorts are shown in Figure 2 C and 2 D. In the AW STEMI group, the rate of 30‐day mortality was the lowest in the 3‐day LOS cohort, showing a U‐shaped risk distribution (Figure 3 and 4). Very short LOS after AW STEMI was associated with significantly higher risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality compared with 3‐day LOS (adjusted HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.16–3.16). However, the risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality increased progressively with increasing LOS (adjusted HR: 4‐day LOS [versus 3‐day LOS], 1.80 [95% CI, 1.06–3.04]; 5‐day LOS, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.44–3.73]; and > 5‐day LOS, 3.45 [95% CI, 2.22–5.36]) in the AW STEMI group. In the NAW STEMI group, the risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality was not significantly different in the very short LOS cohort (adjusted HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.48–1.06) versus the 3‐day LOS cohort, but the risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality sequentially increased with longer LOS (adjusted HR: 4‐day LOS [versus 3 day LOS], 1.52 [95% CI, 1.00–2.30]; 5‐day LOS, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.06–2.93]; and > 5‐day LOS, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.45–3.65]).

### ST-elevation myocardial infarction diagnosed after hospital admission [^115X2v6y]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment times for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients presenting to percutaneous coronary intervention hospitals have improved dramatically over the past 10 years, particularly for patients using emergency medical services. Limited data exist regarding treatment times and outcomes for patients who develop STEMI after hospital admission.

Methods and Results

With the use of a comprehensive prospective regional STEMI program database, we evaluated the characteristics and outcomes for patients who develop STEMI after hospital admission. Of the 3795 consecutive STEMI patients treated by the use of the Minneapolis Heart Institute regional STEMI program from March 2003 to January 2013, 990 (26.1%) presented initially to the percutaneous coronary intervention facility, including 640 arriving via emergency medical services, 267 self/family driven, and 83 already admitted to the hospital. Patients with in-hospital presentation were older with higher body mass indexes, were more likely to have hypertension, and to present with pre-percutaneous coronary intervention cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock. Door-to-balloon times (diagnostic ECG-to-balloon for in-hospital patients) were longer than for patients using emergency medical services (76 versus 51 minutes; P < 0.001), but similar to self/family-driven patients (76 versus 66 minutes; P = 0.13). In-hospital patients had longer lengths of stay (5 versus 3 versus 3 days; P < 0.001) and higher 1-year mortality (16.9% versus 10.3% versus 7.1%; P = 0.032). These patients frequently had high-risk and complex reasons for admission, including 30.1% with acute coronary syndrome, 22.9% postsurgery, 13.3% respiratory failure, and 8.4% ventricular fibrillation.

Conclusions

Patients who develop STEMI while in-hospital represent a unique, high-risk subset of patients. They have increased treatment time and lengths of stay and higher mortality rates than the patients presenting via emergency medical services or who are self/family driven.

### Management of acute coronary syndromes in patients in rural Australia: the MORACS randomized clinical trial [^113dMXUB]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of missed STEMI. STEMI was defined using ECG and clinical presentation criteria from the Fourth Universal Definition for Myocardial Infarctionand in accordance with the Australian Guidelines for the Management of ACS. Missed STEMI was defined by failure to recognize STEMI on the ECG and initiate treatment for STEMI according to Australian guidelines. Recommended time to reperfusion with thrombolysis (unless contraindicated) from presentation to hospital is 30 minutes. If STEMI was not considered within a 4-hour period from presentation, the diagnosis was classified as missed. Missed STEMI events not already identified in the hospital admission documentation by a cardiologist were identified by ECG criteria of STEMI, which were then adjudicated by 2 cardiologists who were blinded to randomization.

Patients deemed eligible for immediate STEMI treatment (reperfusion) were those who presented to the hospital within 12 hours of symptom onset as per national and international guidelines. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital, 30-day, and 12-month mortality; time to reperfusion (for STEMI); 30-day readmission; and length of hospital stay. Data were analyzed in August 2021.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Population and Variables

All hospitalizations for STEMI with subsequent underwent PCI during index hospitalization were selected by finding ICD‐9‐CM codes for initial STEMI (410.x1) and PCI (00.66, 36.01, 36.02, 36.05, 36.06, and 36.07) (total unweighted N = 228 953; weighted N = 539 517). Subendocardial infarction (410.7x) was excluded from the analysis. In addition, patients who died during the index hospitalization were excluded in this cohort. To evaluate the effect of LOS and eliminate outliers, we included patients with a LOS from 1 day up to 14 days. LOS was calculated by subtracting the admission date from the discharge date. The LOS was categorized as follows: short LOS (LOS 1–3 days), medium LOS (LOS 4–5 days), and long LOS (LOS > 5 days). We also examined the very short LOS (LOS 1–2 days) cohort versus those with a longer LOS after subdividing patients into 5 LOS cohorts (LOS 1–2, 3, 4, 5, and > 5).

Patients with a concomitant diagnosis of cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest were identified using ICM‐9‐CM codes 785.51 and 427.5, respectively. Concurrent use of intra‐aortic balloon pump and percutaneous left ventricular assist devices were identified with ICD‐9‐CM procedure codes 37.61 and 37.68, respectively. Since NRD prohibits linking patients across years, patients discharged from January through November were included in the study to allow for completeness of data on 30 days of follow‐up after discharge. Furthermore, patients with missing data on LOS were excluded to properly capture interval until readmission. Patient‐ and hospital‐level variables were included as baseline characteristics. NRD variables were used to identify age, sex, median household income quartiles, primary payer, hospital teaching status, location, and bed size. ICD‐9‐CM codes for selected concurrent clinical diagnoses and procedures are listed in Table S1.

### Treatment time and in-hospital mortality among patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 2018–2021 [^115MS9MZ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Recognizing the association between timely treatment and less myocardial injury for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), US national guidelines recommend specific treatment-time goals.

Objective

To describe these process measures and outcomes for a recent cohort of patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional study of a diagnosis-based registry between the second quarter of 2018 and the third quarter of 2021 for 114 871 patients with STEMI treated at 648 hospitals in the Get With The Guidelines-Coronary Artery Disease registry.

Exposures

STEMI or STEMI equivalent.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment times, in-hospital mortality, and adherence to system goals (75% treated ≤ 90 minutes of first medical contact if the first hospital is percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]-capable and ≤ 120 minutes if patients require transfer to a PCI-capable hospital).

Results

In the study population, median age was 63 (IQR, 54–72) years, 71% were men, and 29% were women. Median time from symptom onset to PCI was 148 minutes (IQR, 111–226) for patients presenting to PCI-capable hospitals by emergency medical service, 195 minutes (IQR, 127–349) for patients walking in, and 240 minutes (IQR, 166–402) for patients transferred from another hospital. Adjusted in-hospital mortality was lower for those treated within target times vs beyond time goals for patients transported via emergency medical services (first medical contact to laboratory activation ≤ 20 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 3.6 vs 9.2] adjusted OR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.48–0.60], and first medical contact to device ≤ 90 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 3.3 vs 12.1] adjusted OR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.36–0.44]), walk-in patients (hospital arrival to device ≤ 90 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 1.8 vs 4.7] adjusted OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.40–0.55]), and transferred patients (door-in to door-out time < 30 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 2.9 vs 6.4] adjusted OR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32–0.78], and first hospital arrival to device ≤ 120 minutes [in-hospital mortality, 4.3 vs 14.2] adjusted OR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.26–0.71]). Regardless of mode of presentation, system goals were not met in most quarters, with the most delayed system performance among patients requiring interhospital transfer (17% treated ≤ 120 minutes).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study of patients with STEMI included in a US national registry provides information on changes in process and outcomes between 2018 and 2021.

### ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without standard modifiable cardiovascular risk factors-how common are they, and what are their outcomes? [^115feTdo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In these multicenter registry studies spanning nearly 20 years, 19% of STEMI patients without a prior history of CVD also had no prior history of SMuRFs. The proportion of STEMI patients with no SMuRFs increased from 14% to 23% during the study period. SMuRF‐less STEMI patients had higher in‐hospital mortality rates when compared with patients with 1 or more SMuRFs. Our study highlights the need for ongoing investigation and for discovery of novel risk factors, biomarkers, biological processes, and treatment targets in order to better address the changing nature of coronary artery disease in the 21st century.

### Discharge timing and outcomes after uncomplicated non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction [^112CKZ7v]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Length of stay after non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) continues to decrease, but information to guide duration of hospitalization is limited.

Methods

We used landmark analyses, in which the landmark defined potential days of discharge, to estimate complication rates on the first day the patient would have been out of the hospital, and estimated associations between timing of discharge and 30-day and 1-year event-free survival after discharge among NSTEMI patients.

Results

Among 20,410 NSTEMI patients, median length of stay was 7 (4, 12) days; 3,209 (15.7%) experienced a cardiac complication on days 0 to 2 and 1,322 (6.5%) were discharged without complications during hospital days 0 to 2. At the start of day 3, 15,879 patients (77.8%) were still hospitalized without complications. Of these, 1,689 (10.6%) were discharged event-free on day 3. Adjusted event-free survival rates of death or myocardial infarction from day 4 to 30 days after among the 1,689 patients was 99.1% compared with 93.1% for the 14,190 who remained hospitalized at the end of day 3. For 1-year mortality, these rates were 98.1% and 96.4%, respectively. Among 13,334 patients hospitalized without complications at the start of day 4, 1,706 were discharged event-free that day. Adjusted survival rates among these patients, compared with those still hospitalized at the end of day 4, were 98.0% versus 93.7% for 30-day death or myocardial infarction and 97.8% versus 96.1% for 1-year mortality.

Conclusions

Patients with NSTEMI who had no serious complications during the first 2 hospital days were at low risk of subsequent short- and intermediate-term death or ischemic events.
