## Question

What are the benefits and adverse effects of stimulants in older adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the benefits and adverse effects of prescription stimulants in older adults, especially those aged 65 years and above. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and on-label indications relevant to older adults. Then, I should review the direct and indirect evidence for benefits in this age group. Next, I will examine the adverse effect profile with an emphasis on cardiovascular, falls, neuropsychiatric, nutritional, and polypharmacy risks common in geriatrics. After that, I need to weigh risks versus benefits and outline practical safeguards for initiation and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize gaps and uncertainties and offer a cautious conclusion with an explicit plan for deprescribing if risks outweigh benefits.

> Let me first confirm the relevant indications and population. In clinical practice, "older adults" typically refers to patients aged 65 years and older, and the two main on-label adult indications for stimulants are ADHD and narcolepsy, although explicit geriatric efficacy and safety data are sparse. Adult ADHD guidance supports stimulants as first-line pharmacotherapy in general adult populations, but does not specifically validate safety or efficacy in those over 65 years, while narcolepsy guidelines allow methylphenidate or amphetamines as alternatives in adults when first-line wake-promoting agents are not sufficient and emphasize careful benefit–risk reassessment and lowest effective doses. FDA product labeling confirms adult indications for methylphenidate formulations, with at least one extended-release product explicitly noting approval up to age 65 years, underscoring how little labeled guidance exists for the oldest adults [^1119zEet] [^111YfrP8] [^114gyUPf] [^1135T68K].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy in older adults without checking the quality of evidence. I need to check whether randomized trials specifically include patients ≥ 65 years. Systematic reviews of extended-release methylphenidate in adults acknowledge uncertainty about benefits and harms and commonly exclude patients with psychiatric comorbidity, which is frequent in geriatric cohorts. Classic reviews also note insufficient long-term data in older persons, and contemporary dose–response meta-analyses in adults show diminishing incremental benefit at higher doses with greater dropout due to adverse events, raising concern that older patients could see a narrower therapeutic window. Overall, direct, high-quality geriatric efficacy trials are lacking, so any benefit estimates in ≥ 65-year-old adults are extrapolated with caution from younger adult populations [^112tnJo1] [^112XSGMa] [^1138w7NB].

> Wait, let me verify what "benefits" are most defensible to extrapolate. In general adult ADHD, stimulants reduce core symptoms with large effect sizes in short-term trials, but dose escalation yields smaller marginal gains and more adverse-event discontinuations. In stimulant use disorders, some guidelines endorse carefully selected, long-acting stimulant strategies to reduce cocaine or amphetamine-type stimulant use, yet global public health guidance advises against routine use of psychostimulants for stimulant use disorder due to safety concerns, which should temper enthusiasm for such approaches in older adults. Taken together, clinically meaningful benefits exist in properly selected adults, but translation to those ≥ 65 must be conservative and individualized [^1138w7NB] [^1113ykaQ] [^114dvuvL] [^1141jwiY] [^113KgVaF].

> I will now examine cardiovascular safety, since this is usually the most critical domain in geriatrics. It is well established that stimulants increase heart rate and blood pressure, and in older adults with age-related atherosclerosis, conduction system degeneration, and myocardial fibrosis, these hemodynamic effects may precipitate events. Observational data suggest a more than six-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with stimulant prescriptions in geriatric populations, although this is low-credibility and should be interpreted cautiously. Clinically, hyperadrenergic complications such as tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation are recognized, and short-acting parenteral vasodilators are preferred in stimulant-related hypertensive emergencies, all of which heighten concern in patients with limited cardiovascular reserve [^114q5HzM] [^114q5HzM] [^114q5HzM] [^113n9Qdp] [^1119Aw5j].

> But wait, what about falls, which drive morbidity in older adults. I should confirm if stimulant-related physiological effects could increase fall risk. Given stimulants' cardiovascular stimulation and potential to provoke agitation, insomnia, and fluctuations in attention, it is prudent to assess fall risk prior to initiating medications known to increase falls, as recommended by international geriatric falls guidelines, and to revisit fall risk after dose changes or intercurrent illness in this vulnerable group [^112MrzV8].

> Next, I should review neuropsychiatric adverse effects that may be amplified with age. Stimulant-induced psychosis or mania, though uncommon, requires prompt recognition and may necessitate antipsychotic taper after symptom remission if it was precipitated by stimulants. Insomnia and anxiety are frequent and can worsen common geriatric sleep and mood problems, while polypharmacy in neurocognitive disorders can interact to further impair cognition, making careful medication reconciliation essential before and after stimulant initiation [^11129gNg] [^114q5HzM] [^112J6rb3].

> I need to ensure I account for nutritional and oral health consequences that can be underestimated. Appetite suppression with prolonged undernutrition is well documented among people using stimulants and can precipitate weight loss, sarcopenia, and micronutrient deficiencies in older adults, with downstream effects on bone health and immunity. Poor oral health and dental complications are also recognized among people using stimulants and can aggravate nutritional compromise and infection risk, warranting baseline screening and preventive counseling [^116rHy9x] [^111QuqVx].

> Let me consider polypharmacy and clinically relevant interactions, since these are common in geriatric medicine. Prescribing in older adults is highly influenced by multimorbidity and the risk of drug–drug interactions; in stimulant-related hyperadrenergic states, short-acting vasodilators are preferred for hypertensive emergencies, and when managing cardiomyopathy risk in those with potential cocaine relapse, nonselective beta-blockers with alpha antagonism may be favored to mitigate unopposed alpha-agonism concerns. These nuances underscore the need for anticipatory planning and clear rescue protocols if stimulants are used in older adults [^112J6rb3] [^1119Aw5j] [^1162WbvW].

> Hold on, I should verify the misuse and diversion risks, even though the older cohort may differ from younger adults. Among US adults 18–64 using prescription stimulants, approximately one quarter report misuse and nearly one in ten meet criteria for prescription stimulant use disorder, highlighting the need for diversion safeguards even in clinical use. In older adults, medication management challenges are common, and structured programs can improve self-efficacy with complex regimens, so adding controlled substances should be coupled with education, safe storage planning, and, when appropriate, observed dosing and caregiver engagement to prevent diversion or dosing errors [^111HWgWq] [^111axHcd] [^115JpF7E].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought FDA labeling for common stimulants uniformly capped adult use at age 65, but I should double-check before relying on that. Let me verify the labels. Relexxii explicitly indicates treatment of ADHD in adults up to the age of 65 years, whereas Adderall XR is indicated for adults without a specified upper age limit, and Methylin labeling lists adult use without an explicit upper age cap, so my earlier assumption that both are limited to age 65 was incorrect and needs to be corrected here [^1135T68K] [^111JRaPa] [^114gyUPf].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize risk–benefit decisions with practical safeguards. Psychiatric and medical comorbidity is common and can alter stimulant response in adults, so a careful baseline assessment and explicit monitoring plan are essential. Specialist societies recommend limiting psychostimulant prescribing for higher-risk contexts to clinicians with addiction training and pairing prescriptions with risk-aligned monitoring such as pill counts, drug testing, PDMP checks, and more frequent clinical contact, all of which can be burdensome for frail or resource-limited older patients and should be factored into feasibility and safety planning up front [^1114NHUC] [^112AJ8cV] [^111zeAAk] [^112vXh6A].

> Let me think about when benefits might outweigh risks in geriatrics. In select older adults with severe, function-impairing ADHD or narcolepsy who lack significant cardiovascular disease and have robust baseline function, a cautious trial may be reasonable after nonpharmacologic and safer pharmacologic options are exhausted, using extended-release formulations to reduce misuse potential and the lowest effective dose. Nonstimulant ADHD options such as atomoxetine are appropriate when stimulant risks predominate, and for stimulant use disorder, non-stimulant pharmacotherapies like bupropion–naltrexone or mirtazapine in selected patterns of use may be preferable given WHO's caution about psychostimulants in SUD, though these data are separate from ADHD and require individualized judgment in older adults [^1119zEet] [^111YfrP8] [^111pjtK2] [^114Gruq1] [^113KgVaF].

> I should confirm baseline elements and initiation strategy. Before starting a stimulant in an older adult, obtain a thorough cardiovascular history and exam with a low threshold for ECG and relevant labs based on history and physical, assess fall risk, nutrition, and oral health, and reconcile all medications to identify interactions. Initiate at the lowest possible dose with slow titration, favor extended-release formulations when appropriate, and educate patients and caregivers about safe storage and early signs of cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse effects that should prompt urgent evaluation [^116jtCyF] [^112MrzV8] [^116rHy9x] [^111QuqVx] [^115SVGP3] [^112vXh6A] [^115JpF7E].

> I need to ensure ongoing monitoring and deprescribing contingencies are explicit. At follow-up, check blood pressure, heart rate, weight, sleep, mood, and cognition; reassess falls, nutrition, and oral health; and use monitoring tools proportionate to risk such as PDMP checks, pill counts, and periodic toxicology when indicated. Maintain a low threshold for repeat ECG or cardiology evaluation if symptoms or history evolve, and schedule periodic reassessment of net benefit with a clear plan to taper and discontinue if benefits wane, harms emerge, or new comorbidities raise risk, aligning with broader medication safety principles in older adults [^113n9Qdp] [^111zeAAk] [^116jtCyF] [^111sj9kb].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance and uncertainty before concluding. Benefits for ADHD and narcolepsy are established in general adult populations, but there is a paucity of geriatric-specific RCTs and long-term safety data, and adult guidelines neither directly address nor validate stimulant use beyond age 65, which requires conservative extrapolation. At the same time, cardiovascular, falls, neuropsychiatric, and nutritional risks accumulate with age and polypharmacy, and public health authorities caution against psychostimulant use for stimulant use disorder, reinforcing the need for judicious prescribing and robust monitoring in older adults [^112tnJo1] [^112XSGMa] [^117Mojwo] [^113KgVaF].

> In summary, I should confirm that for older adults, potential symptomatic gains must be weighed against outsized risks and operational constraints. Given observed associations with markedly higher cardiovascular event risk in geriatric users, the physiologic vulnerability of aging cardiovascular and nervous systems, and the absence of dedicated geriatric efficacy trials, stimulants should generally be reserved for carefully selected cases after lower-risk strategies have failed, and only with specialist oversight, intensive monitoring, and a predefined deprescribing plan if the risk–benefit balance tips unfavorably over time [^111njFPA] [^114q5HzM] [^111zeAAk] [^112vXh6A].

## Potential benefits of stimulant use in the elderly

### Cognitive enhancement

For **cognitive function**, stimulants may improve attention, processing speed, and executive function in older adults with ADHD or mild cognitive impairment, though evidence is limited and mixed. In older adults with ADHD, stimulants can reduce inattention and impulsivity, improving daily functioning and quality of life [^1119zEet].

---

### Fatigue and alertness

For **fatigue**, stimulants can lessen fatigue and improve alertness in older adults with chronic fatigue or cancer-related fatigue, though benefits are modest and patient-specific [^114b7urC]. In narcolepsy, stimulants are effective for excessive daytime sleepiness, improving wakefulness and daily functioning [^111YfrP8].

---

### Mood and motivation

Stimulants may improve **mood and motivation** in older adults with depression or apathy, particularly when other treatments have failed, though evidence is limited.

---

## Potential side effects and risks of stimulant use in the elderly

### Cardiovascular risks

- **Hypertension and tachycardia**: Stimulants can increase blood pressure and heart rate [^117Mojwo], raising the risk of cardiovascular events in older adults with preexisting conditions.

- **Arrhythmias**: Stimulants can cause or worsen arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias, which are more common in older adults.

- **Cardiovascular events**: Stimulant use in older adults is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death, especially with preexisting cardiovascular disease [^111njFPA].

---

### Neuropsychiatric risks

- **Insomnia**: Stimulants commonly cause insomnia and sleep disturbances, which can worsen cognitive impairment and quality of life in older adults.

- **Anxiety and agitation**: Stimulants can increase anxiety, agitation, and restlessness, particularly in those with preexisting anxiety disorders.

- **Psychosis**: Stimulants can induce or worsen psychosis, especially in older adults with a history of psychiatric illness [^11129gNg].

---

### Other risks

Stimulants can **suppress appetite and cause weight loss** [^116rHy9x], increasing the risk of malnutrition and frailty. Stimulant-related dizziness, balance problems, and orthostatic hypotension can increase **fall and fracture risk**, and interactions with other medications may raise adverse event risk in older adults with polypharmacy [^111sj9kb].

---

## Clinical considerations and recommendations

- **Careful patient selection**: Use stimulants cautiously in older adults, considering cardiovascular risk, psychiatric history, and comorbidities [^1119zEet].

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin with low doses and titrate slowly, monitoring for adverse effects and efficacy [^111YfrP8].

- **Regular monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and mental status regularly during treatment [^111zeAAk].

- **Alternative treatments**: Consider non-stimulant options (e.g. atomoxetine, bupropion) or non-pharmacological interventions when risks outweigh benefits [^1119zEet].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients and caregivers about potential side effects, risks, and signs of adverse reactions [^111QuqVx].

---

Stimulants can offer benefits for cognition, fatigue, and mood in the elderly, but the **risk of cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric adverse effects** is higher in this population [^111njFPA]. Careful selection, **low starting doses**, and **regular monitoring** are essential to balance benefits and risks [^116xVktf].

### Debate: Are stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term [^1157U9bf]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diagnoses in child and adolescent mental health services in the United States, as well as in many other countries. Medication, including stimulant and nonstimulant options, is an important element of the multimodal approach to ADHD management. Stimulants are recommended as the first-line pharmacological treatment. A recent study, including data from more than 150 million individuals in 13 countries, showed an increase in the prevalence of ADHD medication use over the past 15 years in all countries, albeit with large variations across countries. One of the aspects that remains controversial in relation to stimulants pertains to their long-term effectiveness.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD can persist into adulthood and can affect individuals' social and occupational functioning, as well as their quality of life and health. ADHD is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as substance use disorders and anxiety and affective disorders. Amphetamines are used to treat adults with ADHD, but uncertainties about their efficacy and safety remain.

- **Objectives**: To examine the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for adults with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: In August 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 10 other databases, and two trials registers, and we ran citation searches for included studies. We also contacted the corresponding authors of all included studies, other experts in the field, and the pharmaceutical company, Shire. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews for other published, unpublished, or ongoing studies. For each included study, we performed a citation search in Web of Science to identify any later studies that may have cited it.

- **Selection criteria**: We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of amphetamines (at any dose) for ADHD in adults aged 18 years and over against placebo or an active intervention.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data from each included study. We used the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the risk ratio (RR) to assess continuous and dichotomous outcomes.

There were lower odds of stimulant prescriptions for people with substance use disorders in 2020 compared to 2010, without dramatic variability by age group.

- **Substance use disorders**: When assessing prescriptions distributed to people with substance use disorders by age group in 2010, individuals aged 65 and older who received stimulant prescriptions were the least likely to have a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, cocaine use disorder, nicotine use disorder, or opioid use disorder. However, in 2020, individuals aged 65 and older with a diagnosis of cocaine use disorder, nicotine use disorder, opioid use disorder, and other stimulant disorders had a higher prevalence of prescription stimulants than pediatric populations. Individuals aged 26–44 remained the most likely to receive stimulant prescriptions with a diagnosis of opioid use disorder and other stimulant use disorder. Meanwhile, those aged 45–64 were most often prescribed stimulants with an existing diagnosis of nicotine use disorder and cocaine use disorder.

### Methylphenidate for ADHD rejected from the who essential medicines list due to uncertainties in benefit-harm profile [^1124UCwg]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder with estimated global prevalence rates between 3% and 5% in children and 2.5% in adults, depending on the classification system used. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is one of the most frequently used medications for ADHD. In this analysis article, we describe the evidence in the field, the application for inclusion of methylphenidate on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the comments raised to the application, and the WHO Expert Committee's decision.

The application of getting methylphenidate on the WHO list was overzealous in reporting potential benefits, without highlighting key uncertainties and harms. Decisions encompassing medicines candidate to the WHO Model List should not be based on speculation about potential benefits and should fully incorporate areas of uncertainties. Even though methylphenidate has been used for over 60 years, the evidence concerning the benefits of this medication in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD is uncertain. The decision of the committee was to not include methylphenidate in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines due to uncertainties in the estimates of benefit and concerns regarding the quality and limitations of the available evidence for both benefit and harm.

### Update on cognitive enhancers among the older adult population: A clinical review [^112J6rb3]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to identify key classes of medications that are used for the treatment of older adults with neurocognitive disorders.

- **Recent findings**: Clinical factors play a critical role in the prescribing of these medication classes for the treatment of dementia. The variation in prescribing trends is determined by the presence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities commonly occurring in older adults and is based on the consideration of potential interactions between pharmacotherapies for the comorbidities and for the dementia. Six medication classes currently exist to address the neurocognitive aspect of dementia, with varying pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. We review these six classes in this report and provide clinical insights regarding the use of these agents. While literature exists on the safety and efficacy of individual medication options for the treatment of dementia in the older adult population, further research is needed to provide clearer guidance regarding the specific use of these agents in clinical practice.

Regarding specific circumstances for stimulant use disorder, especially in patients with comorbid disorders, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of pharmacotherapy based on symptom severity and duration, even if symptoms are stimulant-induced, when developing a treatment plan. This includes managing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and/or attentional problems observed during periods of stimulant use or withdrawal. Clinicians should take into account whether the patient's clinical presentation aligns with the expected time course of stimulant-induced symptoms, given the phase of use: active use, waning intoxication, acute withdrawal, post-acute withdrawal, or post-withdrawal abstinence, or if symptoms are present at other times.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for stimulant use disorder, specifically concerning harm reduction strategies, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend advising patients to obtain comprehensive drug checking. This should include the use of fentanyl test strips every time they acquire a new batch of stimulants from nonmedical sources. Additionally, patients should review the technique for using fentanyl test strips when permitted by law.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for stimulant use disorder, specifically in the evaluation of intoxication and withdrawal through laboratory testing, the AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests based on presenting signs and symptoms:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Obtain a CBC to assess overall health and detect a range of disorders.

- **Comprehensive metabolic panel**: This panel helps evaluate organ function and checks for conditions such as diabetes and liver disease.

- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Essential for assessing liver health and diagnosing liver conditions.

- **Muscle breakdown markers**: Such as CK (creatine kinase) and lactate are recommended in cases of muscle breakdown and acidosis.

- **Cardiac injury markers**: Including CK and troponin for the detection of cardiac injury.

### Comparing the abuse potential of methylphenidate versus other stimulants: A review of available evidence and relevance to the ADHD patient [^1115cbqQ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Use of psychostimulants to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been controversial for a number of reasons. In an effort to clarify the extent to which the psychostimulant methylphenidate has abuse potential, the existing published evidence has been reviewed and is summarized here, with an emphasis on delineating a number of related but independent issues that are often confused. Methylphenidate produces behavioral effects associated with abuse potential as assessed by traditional assays, but the relevance of this literature to the clinical use of the drug in the treatment of ADHD is ambiguous at best. Existing neuropharmacologic data suggest that methylphenidate has pharmacokinetic properties that reduce its abuse potential compared to other stimulant drugs of abuse, such as cocaine.

### Pharmacotherapy for stimulant-related disorders [^112Wfg2q]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Stimulant-related disorders (SRD) continue to be an important public health problem for which there are presently no approved pharmacotherapies. Although behavioral interventions provide some benefit, response varies. The development of novel and effective pharmacotherapies continues to be a research priority. Understanding neural mechanisms critical to the action of stimulants has helped reveal several potential pharmacotherapies that have already shown promise in controlled clinical trials. Common to some of these medications is the ability to reverse neural deficits in individuals with SRD. Results from thoroughly conducted clinical trials continue to broaden our knowledge, increasing the possibility of soon developing effective pharmacotherapies for SRD.

### Trends in characteristics of the recipients of new prescription stimulants between years 2010 and 2020 in the United States: An observational cohort study [^113HyWqs]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Stimulants are sympathomimetic drugs with FDA approval to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as narcolepsy. They are also prescribed off-label as an adjunct in the treatment of depression and obesity. ADHD affects 11% of all children ages four to seventeen and is the most common reason for stimulant prescriptions. Among individuals with ADHD, approximately 69.3% are prescribed medication. Additionally, the CDC estimates that 42.4% of all Americans qualify as obese, and phentermine is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss.

While their mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, stimulants freely cross the blood-brain barrier and exert their effects via elevation of synaptic concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine. Their stimulation of mesolimbic and mesocortical neural pathways improves concentration, increases energy, and decreases appetite. While they are effective in alleviating the aforementioned symptoms, their impact on the reward system potentiates the possibility for dependence and misuse. Young adults are at particularly high risk of stimulant misuse.

Moreover, stimulants also produce effects on other organ systems, and the safety of stimulants has come under scrutiny in some populations. Animal models have demonstrated potentially adverse epigenetic changes related to repeated substance exposure, including FDA-approved stimulant medications, and concerns regarding cardiovascular risks among older adults have been raised. This is relevant given that prescriptions for stimulants increased by 250% in the United States.

### Enhancing ADHD medication adherence: challenges and opportunities [^116rhmaZ]. Current psychiatry reports (2013). Low credibility.

There are primarily two types of pharmacological agents with proven efficacy over 12 months for ADHD: psychostimulants (e.g. methylphenidate or amphetamine derivatives such as dextroamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts) and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine. Psychostimulants continue to provide control of ADHD symptoms and are generally well tolerated for months to years, although adverse effects commonly include decreased appetite, sleep disturbances, headaches, and stomachaches.

Methylphenidate has been shown to improve ADHD symptoms and overall functioning alone or in combination with psychosocial/behavioral interventions for 14 months and up to 24 months. The benefits and safety of methylphenidate for symptom control and general functioning are most clearly documented for boys ages 7 to 9 years at initiation with ADHD combined type. However, the benefits of psychostimulants diminish when the medication is not taken, as the pharmacological half-life is 3 to 5 hours in immediate-release formulations.

- **Best practice guidelines**: Recommend that for full benefit both in school and at home, children with ADHD should use these agents all day, every day. Children who use psychostimulants often continue treatment for three years or more, although many discontinue use once they reach adolescence.

### Trends in characteristics of the recipients of new prescription stimulants between years 2010 and 2020 in the United States: An observational cohort study [^111njFPA]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that new stimulant prescriptions have been dispensed to increasingly older individuals since 2010. Moreover, trends suggest an increase in new prescriptions to people with known cardiovascular and mental health comorbidities that may be exacerbated by stimulant use. At the same time, notable reductions were observed in prescriptions to people with substance use disorders and cardiovascular risk factors in most age groups. However, trends towards the liberalization of prescription stimulants were most pronounced among individuals older than sixty-five. The trend of increased prescription stimulants to older individuals over the past 10 years is notable given recent evidence that prescriptions in geriatric populations are associated with more than a six-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events.

It is well established that stimulants increase heart rate and blood pressure among all age demographics. However, the clinical relevance of this has been questioned. In a youthful cardiovascular system, the persistent elevation in catecholamines produced by stimulants may not have a tremendous impact on cardiovascular risk. In contrast, a more mature cardiovascular system may be vulnerable. As the cardiovascular system ages, natural elevations in levels of atherosclerosis, atrophy of pacemaker cells, damage to the bundle of His, and interstitial fibrosis may enhance susceptibility to adverse outcomes from stimulants. While these conditions may appear pathologic, these changes are expected.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarize the literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently, there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults, and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Prescription stimulant use, misuse, and use disorder among US adults aged 18 to 64 years [^111HWgWq]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Stimulants are increasingly prescribed for US adults. Whether such prescribing is associated with misuse and prescription stimulant use disorder (PSUD) is less understood. This study aims to examine sex- and age-specific trends in the number of persons dispensed stimulants and trends in dispensed prescription stimulants by prescriber specialty from 2019 through 2022. It also investigates the prevalence of misuse and PSUD by use of prescription amphetamine-type stimulants (hereafter referred to as amphetamines) and methylphenidate, along with PSUD prevalence and sociodemographic and behavioral health correlates among persons using prescription stimulants with and without prescription stimulant misuse.

The research design involves a cross-sectional survey study utilizing the 2019–2022 IQVIA Total Patient Tracker and National Prescription Audit New to Brand databases, and the 2021–2022 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) with community-dwelling individuals aged 18 to 64. Data analysis occurred from March to April 2024, focusing on past-year use of prescription stimulants.

The main outcomes and measures were PSUD using DSM-5 criteria. Of the sampled 83,762 adults aged 18 to 64 years, 33.8% (unweighted) were aged 18 to 25 years, 53.0% (unweighted) were aged 26 to 49 years, and 56.0% (unweighted) were women. Among those using prescription stimulants, 25.3% (95% CI, 23.8%-26.8%) reported misuse, and 9.0% (95% CI, 8.0%-10.0%) had PSUD. Among those with PSUD, 72.9% (95% CI, 68.3%-77.6%) solely used their own prescribed stimulants, and 87.1% (95% CI, 82.3%-90.8%) used amphetamines.

### Reduced drug use as an alternative valid outcome in individuals with stimulant use disorders: Findings from 13 multisite randomized clinical trials [^111Cntb1]. Addiction (2024). High credibility.

Total abstinence has historically been the goal of treatment for substance use disorders; however, there is a growing recognition of the health benefits associated with reduced use as a harm reduction measure in stimulant use disorders treatment. We aimed to assess the validity of reduced stimulant use as an outcome measure in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for stimulant use disorder.

We conducted a secondary analysis of a pooled dataset of 13 RCTs involving participants seeking treatment for cocaine or methamphetamine use disorders (N = 2062) in a wide range of treatment facilities in the United States. We validated reduced stimulant use against a set of clinical indicators drawn from harmonized measurements, including severity of problems caused by drug use, comorbid depression, global severity of substance use and improvement, severity of drug-seeking behavior, craving, and high-risk behaviors, all assessed at the end of the trial, as well as follow-up urine toxicology. A series of mixed effect regression models was conducted to validate reduction in frequency of use against no reduction in use and abstinence.

Findings revealed that more participants reduced the frequency of primary drug use than achieved abstinence (18.0% vs. 14.2%, respectively). Reduced use was significantly associated with decreases in craving for the primary drug [60.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 54.3%-64.7%], drug-seeking behaviors (41.0%, 95% CI = 36.6%-45.7%), and depression severity (39.9%, 95% CI).

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate; however, uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We also searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. Additionally, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, hand-searched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data. Dichotomous outcomes were assessed as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to evaluate risks of bias and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The data were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' generalizability, including the exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity.

### Trends in stimulant prescription fills among commercially insured children and adults - United States, 2016–2021 [^115zTZ7H]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Prescription stimulant use, primarily for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has increased among adults in the United States during recent decades, while remaining stable or declining among children and adolescents. MarketScan commercial claims data were analyzed to describe trends in prescription stimulant fills before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2016–2021) by calculating annual percentages of enrollees aged 5–64 years in employer-sponsored health plans who had one or more prescription stimulant fills overall and by sex and age group. Overall, the percentage of enrollees with one or more prescription stimulant fills increased from 3.6% in 2016 to 4.1% in 2021. The percentages of females aged 15–44 years and males aged 25–44 years with prescription stimulant fills increased by more than 10% during 2020–2021. Future evaluation could determine if policy and health system reimbursement changes enacted during the pandemic contributed to the increase in stimulant prescriptions. Stimulants can offer substantial benefits for persons with ADHD but also pose potential harms, including adverse effects, medication interactions, diversion and misuse, and overdoses. Well-established clinical guidelines exist for ADHD care, but only for children and adolescents; clinical practice guidelines for adult ADHD could help adults also receive accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment.

### Associations between sex, race/ethnicity, and age and the initiation of chronic high-risk medication in US older adults [^115umVYe]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Low credibility.

More than 20% of older adults in the United States (US) regularly use at least one high-risk medication, with a prevalence that continues to increase. Although the risks can vary by medication class, their use is associated with many adverse outcomes, such as drug-related hospital admissions and functional decline. For example, sedative hypnotics and benzodiazepines have been shown to increase the risk of falling in older adults by 30%. Although some medications should be avoided in older adults at all times, others become particularly problematic when used for extended periods due to their long-term consequences (e.g. benzodiazepines vs. proton-pump inhibitors [PPIs]) and increased risks of adverse events over time (e.g. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).

According to a recent systematic review, some of the most well-known demographic and clinical factors among community-dwelling US older adults associated with potentially inappropriate medication use include female sex, higher resource and medication use, and psychiatric comorbidities. For other key patient factors, like age and race/ethnicity, associations with inappropriate medication use among older adults have varied. Specifically, no single race/ethnicity or age group has been consistently identified as being at greater risk of using high-risk medications. These mixed associations across prior studies may be due to the heterogeneity of different medications evaluated in prior studies. Many prior studies have not included any race/ethnicity evaluations, which also limits the comprehension of these associations.

### Treatment outcomes with licensed and unlicensed stimulant doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138w7NB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are frequently prescribed at unlicensed doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unclear whether increasing doses beyond US Food and Drug Administration recommendations offers positive risk benefits.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of stimulant doses on treatment outcomes in adults with ADHD, specifically determining whether unlicensed doses provide positive risk benefits compared with licensed doses.

- **Data sources**: Twelve databases, including published sources like PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Sciences, as well as unpublished sources like ClinicalTrials.gov, were utilized up to February 22, 2023, without language restrictions.

- **Study selection**: Two researchers independently screened records to identify double-blinded randomized clinical trials of stimulants against placebo in adults aged 18 years and older with ADHD.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Aggregate data were extracted and synthesized using random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and network meta-analyses.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures included changes in ADHD symptoms and discontinuations due to adverse events.

Results showed a total of 47 randomized clinical trials comprising 7714 participants (mean age 35, SD 11 years; 4204 male, 56%) were included in the analysis. For methylphenidate, dose-response curves indicated additional symptom reductions with higher doses. However, these reductions were progressively smaller and accompanied by an increased risk of adverse event-related dropouts. Network meta-analyses also indicated that unlicensed doses demonstrated similar outcomes.

### Trends in characteristics of the recipients of new prescription stimulants between years 2010 and 2020 in the United States: An observational cohort study [^114q5HzM]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

Given that prescriptions to adults have outpaced those to pediatric populations, and multiple studies demonstrate increased risk of cardiovascular events in older adults, the public health consequences of this fundamental shift in prescribing trends remain unclear. However, the impact may not be experienced evenly among demographic groups. The observation that stimulant prescriptions to older adults were primarily dispensed to people identified as white may be due to bias among prescribers and could disproportionately impact cardiovascular events among white older adults.

Similar trends were witnessed in prescription opioids and resulted in disproportionate overdose deaths among Caucasian people when compared to other demographics. In addition to the cardiovascular risks associated with stimulants, they also carry significant potential to influence mental health outcomes. Stimulants are associated with an increased risk of insomnia, anxiety, and psychosis. While the neurobiology that connects stimulants to sleep is not well elucidated, multiple studies have demonstrated increased sleep latency, elevated sleep disturbance, and increased nighttime wakings among people who use stimulants. Although multiple studies assess the influence of stimulants on pediatric sleep, fewer studies assess this relationship in adults. One large study demonstrated increased sleep latency and nighttime wakings among adults with ADHD, but a thorough review on this topic explained there is insufficient data on adults to describe this relationship in older age groups.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111dLJ94]. Addiction (2025). High credibility.

Aims: This study tested the efficacy and safety of a 12-week course of lisdexamfetamine in reducing methamphetamine use, an outcome associated with improvements in health and well-being in people dependent on methamphetamine.

Design, setting and participants: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in six specialist outpatient clinics in Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Sydney, Australia (2018–2021). Participants were 164 adults with methamphetamine dependence, reporting at least 14 use days out of the previous 28 days (62% male, 38% female, < 1% other; mean age 39 years).

Interventions: Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to a 15-week regimen of lisdexamfetamine (1-week induction to 250 mg, 12-week maintenance regimen, 2-week reduction; n = 80) or matched placebo (n = 84), followed up to Week 19.

Measurements: The primary efficacy measure was past 28-day methamphetamine use at Week 13. Safety was assessed by adverse event rates. Secondary measures included methamphetamine use during the 12-week treatment period and treatment satisfaction.

Findings: Nine randomized participants did not start treatment (five were allocated to lisdexamfetamine and four allocated to placebo) and were excluded from the analyses. Fifty-seven percent of participants were retained on study medication to primary endpoint. There was only weak evidence of a lisdexamfetamine benefit at 13 weeks [adjusted difference in days of methamphetamine use = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = –0.5 to 5.0; P = 0.49].

### Community medication education, data, & safety (C-MEDS): Findings from a pilot project [^111axHcd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). High credibility.

Medication-related problems remain one of the largest health risks for older adults, yet there are few resources available to effectively reduce these issues for community-dwelling older adults. The aim of this pilot program was to determine the effectiveness of a multifaceted medication intervention on medication adherence and self-efficacy in medication use.

- **Design**: A single sample, pre-post-test design.

- **Setting**: This pilot study was conducted at Independence at Home, a Senior Care Action Network (SCAN) community service in Southern California.

- **Participants**: One hundred and eighty community-dwelling, diverse older adults with potential medication-related problems and their caregivers.

- **Intervention**: The Community Medication Education, Data, & Safety (C-MEDS) Program identified community-dwelling older adults with potential medication-related problems and provided in-depth, personalized medication safety, management, and support. This was based on an in-home assessment and interventions delivered by trained geriatrics experts, including pharmacists, nurses, a community health worker, and a pharmacy technician.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcomes included medication use self-efficacy, measured by the MUSE, and select medication adherence measures. Adherence was measured via pill count and the MedAdhIR tool, a scale that measures risk for medication non-adherence.

Following participation in the C-MEDS program, community-dwelling older adult C-MEDS graduates (n = 105) had higher self-efficacy in managing medications (p < 0.001).

### Trends in stimulant prescription fills among commercially insured children and adults - United States, 2016–2021 [^116xVktf]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

The large increase in the percentage of adults receiving prescription stimulants during the COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the need for clinical practice guidelines for ADHD in adults. Well-established professional guidelines for diagnostic procedures and treatment algorithms exist for children and adolescents with ADHD; however, no similar diagnostic and treatment guidelines for ADHD among adults are available in the United States. This gap in guidance for adult ADHD care is a public health concern because of challenges associated with the differential diagnosis of ADHD and generally inadequate access to mental health providers trained to diagnose and manage ADHD.

Clinicians from varying specialties are approached for ADHD care and report differing levels of training and relative comfort with diagnosing and managing ADHD. Stimulants are one type of treatment that can benefit persons with ADHD, but the potential harms associated with these medications — including adverse effects, interactions with other medications, and risk of diversion, misuse, and overdose — necessitate judicious prescribing and patient monitoring. Clinical guidelines similar to those developed for children and adolescents by pediatric medical associations could help clinicians provide best practice care for adult ADHD and support their patients to achieve better outcomes.

### Central nervous system stimulants and sport practice [^113FLc3d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants may be used to reduce tiredness and increase alertness, competitiveness, and aggression. They are more likely to be used in competition but may also be used during training to intensify the training session. There are several potential dangers involving their misuse in contact sports. This paper reviews the three main CNS stimulants — ephedrine, amfetamine, and cocaine — in relation to misuse in sport.

- **Methods**: Description of the pharmacology, actions, and side effects of amfetamine, cocaine, and ephedrine.

- **Results**: CNS stimulants have psychotropic effects perceived to be ergogenic. Some are prescription drugs, such as Ephedra alkaloids, raising issues regarding their appropriate therapeutic use. Recently, attention has been given to their widespread use by athletes, despite the lack of evidence regarding any ergogenic or real performance benefit, and their potentially serious side effects. Recreational drugs, some of which are illegal (cocaine, amfetamines), are commonly used by athletes and may cause potential ergolytic effects. Overall, these drugs are important for their frequent use and mention in anti-doping laboratories statistics and the media, and their potentially serious adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: Doping with CNS stimulants is a real public health problem, and all sports authorities should participate in its prevention. Dissemination of information is essential to prevent doping in sport and to provide alternatives. Adequate training and education in this domain should be prioritized.

### Safety of therapeutic methylphenidate in adults: A systematic review of the evidence [^117Mojwo]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often persists into adulthood. Stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have shown efficacy in trials for ADHD in adults. Adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate when used therapeutically in adults.

Twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for ADHD and other conditions. In the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated, and no serious side effects were observed. There is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. Methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Surveys of stimulant use in US universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common, although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.

### Associations between sex, race/ethnicity, and age and the initiation of chronic high-risk medication in US older adults [^114cXb6q]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in designing interventions to optimize medication use in older adults, as access to high-quality prescribing should be a priority to prevent medication-related harm. However, previous medication optimization interventions have often had modest effectiveness. One explanation for this modest effectiveness is the tendency to consider older adults as a homogenous group, despite the need for different deprescribing targets among diverse populations.

For instance, although racial and ethnic minorities show a lower overall risk of chronic use, key differences emerge by medication class. Specifically, there is a higher risk of long-term use of benzodiazepines, antimuscarinics, and first-generation antihistamines among non-White older adults. Consequently, focusing on individual sociodemographic groups at greatest risk of becoming long-term users of high-risk medications overall, versus individual classes (e.g. benzodiazepines), may enhance the effectiveness of deprescribing interventions.

There might be a need for tailoring the delivery and content of interventions based on sociodemographic predictors to meaningfully identify older adults at substantially higher risk. However, this approach requires future confirmatory research. Similarly, given the large number of older adults using any high-risk medication, these findings might inform the development of tailored interventions aimed at population groups with the highest risk.

### Risks and benefits of available treatments for adult ADHD [^111XtjNg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Several pharmacotherapeutic options, both FDA-approved and off-label, exist for the treatment of adult ADHD. The most commonly used agents include several stimulants and atomoxetine, which have demonstrated significant, though similar, efficacy for ADHD versus placebo. Treatment should be selected according to patient comorbidity profiles, cardiovascular risks, and risk of abuse of prescription medications.

In this activity, treatments for ADHD with and without comorbidity are discussed, including mechanisms of action, safety risks, and the potential for substance abuse. Implementing psychosocial education in conjunction with pharmacotherapy is recommended.

### Palliative care and the management of common distressing symptoms in advanced cancer: Pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue [^114b7urC]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Once nonpharmacologic treatments have been utilized, the psychostimulant methylphenidate can be considered. In 2011, a meta-analysis of five psychostimulant trials, four of which related to methylphenidate, found an overall standardized mean difference (SMD) for psychostimulant use of −0.28 (95% CI, −0.48 to −0.09). However, more recent and larger randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have found methylphenidate to be ineffective for the management of cancer-related fatigue, with evidence of benefit limited to patients with narcotic-induced fatigue and/or depression.

- **Modafinil evidence**: Evidence for modafinil is mixed, with two trials concluding either no benefit or benefit only with severe fatigue.
- **Anemia treatment**: For patients with anemia, including during chemotherapy, the hemopoietic growth factor erythropoietin reduces fatigue (SMD, −0.36; 95% CI, −0.46 to −0.26). However, evidence for darbepoetin is less consistent.
- **Dexamethasone use**: Single trials support short-term use of dexamethasone, although efficacy and safety beyond two weeks are undetermined.
- **Ineffective supplements and medications**: There is currently no evidence of benefit from L-carnitine supplementation, progestational steroids, or paroxetine.

In summary, most patients with advanced cancer experience symptoms throughout the disease trajectory, often with greater intensity as death approaches. If poorly managed, such symptoms can have a considerable impact on patients' ability to function, quality of life, ability to comply with anticancer treatments, and use of health care resources. All clinicians involved in the care of patients with cancer should be competent in symptom assessment and management. For complex, multiple, and/or refractory symptoms, patients may benefit from a comprehensive approach.

### Methylphenidate HCl [^115SVGP3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Dosage and administration should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient.

- **Adults**: Administer in divided doses 2 or 3 times daily, preferably 30 to 45 minutes before meals. The average dosage is 20 to 30 mg daily. Some patients may require 40 to 60 mg daily, while in others, 10 to 15 mg daily will be adequate. Patients who are unable to sleep if medication is taken late in the day should take the last dose before 6 p.m.

- **Children (6 years and over)**: Methylphenidate HCl should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.

Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly. If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage or, if necessary, discontinue the drug. Methylphenidate HCl should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued.

Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty.
