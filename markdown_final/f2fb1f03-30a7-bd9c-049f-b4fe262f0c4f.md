## Question

What is brugada syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Brugada syndrome is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and epidemiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and ECG phenotypes. Next, I will examine the genetic basis and pathophysiology. After that, I need to review clinical presentation and triggers. Then, I should appraise risk stratification and management, including ICD indications and alternatives. Finally, I will consider special populations and controversies, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and epidemiology. Brugada syndrome is an inherited cardiac channelopathy characterized by a distinct ECG pattern and an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in the absence of structural heart disease, with a prevalence around 3–5 per 10,000 and a marked male predominance of roughly 8–10:1, and it accounts for a notable fraction of sudden deaths in patients with structurally normal hearts [^116Mbc3p] [^116kY73f] [^114mMpD7].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria and ECG phenotypes. The diagnosis hinges on a spontaneous or provoked type 1 Brugada ECG pattern: coved ST-segment elevation of at least 2 mm in the right precordial leads V1–V2 with negative T waves, which may be intermittent and unmasked by sodium channel blockers or fever; types 2 and 3 are saddleback patterns and are not diagnostic unless they convert to type 1 with provocative testing, and guidelines advise against repeating sodium channel blocker testing once a type 1 pattern has already been documented [^114e5k3q] [^114e5k3q] [^112FirHk].

> I need to check the genetic basis and pathophysiology carefully. Historically, SCN5A was considered the primary gene, but I should confirm the current consensus: SCN5A accounts for about 20–30% of cases, while most patients do not have a monogenic explanation, and large-scale genomic studies now support a polygenic architecture with contributions from common variants, suggesting a threshold model of cumulative genetic and environmental risk; mechanistically, reduced sodium current and right ventricular outflow tract epicardial substrate drive repolarization heterogeneity and phase 2 reentry, with emerging evidence for subtle structural abnormalities in some patients [^notfound] [^112cJCpQ] [^114mMpD7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical presentation. I should confirm the typical course: many patients are asymptomatic, but the first manifestation can be sudden cardiac death, often at rest or during sleep when vagal tone is high; fever, sodium channel blockers, and alcohol can unmask or trigger malignant arrhythmias, and syncope or nocturnal agonal respirations may herald events; importantly, seizures or convulsive syncope can mimic primary neurologic disease, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion when the ECG is suggestive [^116kY73f] [^116Mbc3p] [^114oEtvS].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and management, and I need to ensure alignment with guidelines. High-risk features mandate ICD therapy: prior aborted cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular arrhythmias, or spontaneous type 1 ECG with syncope presumed arrhythmic; for asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type 1 ECG, programmed electrical stimulation with up to two extra stimuli can be considered to identify inducibility, and ICD may be reasonable in selected inducible cases; quinidine can be used for recurrent arrhythmias or as bridge therapy, and fever management with antipyretics is essential; sodium channel blocker testing should not be repeated once type 1 is established, and patients should avoid cocaine, cannabis, and excessive alcohol [^116qup6d] [^1175He79] [^114mMpD7] [^112cYBuD] [^112FirHk].

> But wait, what about special populations and controversies. In children, fever-triggered events are common and spontaneous type 1 ECG plus symptoms predict life-threatening arrhythmias; in women, prevalence and event rates are lower, though pregnancy is generally well tolerated; in athletes, eligibility decisions should be individualized, with restriction for high-risk features and careful consideration of low-risk phenotypes; the role of electrophysiology study remains debated, with variable predictive value across studies, and the "type 1 paradox" notes that drug-induced type 1 patterns carry lower risk than spontaneous type 1, complicating risk inference from provocative testing [^114M6T89] [^116ARNTj] [^1152RDcP] [^113LvCyV] [^113gk8Vj].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Brugada syndrome is a channelopathy defined by a type 1 right precordial ECG pattern in the absence of structural heart disease, with a complex genetic architecture in which SCN5A explains a minority of cases; clinical expression is dynamic and modulated by autonomic tone and systemic factors; risk is heterogeneous, with highest events in those with prior arrest, sustained VT, or spontaneous type 1 ECG with syncope; ICD remains the cornerstone for high-risk patients, while asymptomatic individuals require judicious risk stratification and lifestyle modification, reflecting evolving but still imperfect tools for prediction [^116Mbc3p] [^114mMpD7] [^116qup6d].

---

Brugada syndrome is an **inherited cardiac channelopathy** characterized by a **distinct ECG pattern** (coved ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads) and a **risk of sudden cardiac death** from ventricular fibrillation in the absence of structural heart disease [^116Mbc3p]. It is most often due to SCN5A variants that reduce sodium current, and is diagnosed by spontaneous or provoked type 1 ECG with exclusion of other causes [^112b2Xnc] [^111xWi5y]. Management is **risk-stratified**: ICD for high-risk patients (prior cardiac arrest, sustained VT, or syncope with spontaneous type 1 ECG), and conservative care with fever control and drug avoidance for low-risk patients [^116qup6d] [^112cYBuD]. Asymptomatic patients with drug-induced type 1 ECG have a low event risk, but ongoing surveillance is essential [^113gk8Vj].

---

## Clinical features and epidemiology

- **Prevalence**: Approximately 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000 globally, with higher prevalence in Southeast Asia and Japan [^116Mbc3p] [^114mMpD7].
- **Demographics**: Predominantly affects males (male-to-female ratio ~8:1), with symptoms typically manifesting in adulthood (third to fifth decades) [^116ARNTj] [^116kY73f].
- **Clinical presentation**: Many patients are asymptomatic; symptomatic patients may present with syncope, nocturnal agonal respirations, or sudden cardiac arrest, often during rest or sleep [^116kY73f] [^114mMpD7].

---

## Electrocardiographic findings

The **diagnostic hallmark** is a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern: coved ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm in the right precordial leads (V1–V3) followed by negative T waves [^111xWi5y]. This pattern may be spontaneous or unmasked by sodium channel blockers (e.g. ajmaline, flecainide) or fever [^114e5k3q] [^112VQyZG]. Types 2 and 3 (saddleback ST elevation) are nondiagnostic unless they convert to type 1 with provocative testing [^111G5dbc].

---

## Genetic basis

- **SCN5A**: The most commonly implicated gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5; variants reduce sodium current and alter repolarization [^111JYiZS].
- **Other genes**: Over 20 genes have been reported, but most have limited or disputed evidence for causality beyond SCN5A [^1157a4oT].
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant with variable penetrance; genetic testing is recommended for probands and cascade screening of relatives [^112FB11h] [^115GChei].

---

## Pathophysiology

Mechanistically, reduced sodium current increases **transmural repolarization heterogeneity**, creating a substrate for phase 2 reentry and ventricular fibrillation [^111mzNKq]. An **epicardial arrhythmogenic substrate** in the right ventricular outflow tract has been identified and linked to arrhythmogenesis [^114mMpD7].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis requires a **type 1 ECG pattern** (spontaneous or provoked) with exclusion of other causes (e.g. ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, structural heart disease) [^111xWi5y]. Sodium channel blocker challenge is used when the ECG is nondiagnostic, but is contraindicated in patients with prior type 1 pattern or high-risk features [^112FirHk] [^111zpaV6].

---

## Risk stratification

Risk is stratified by **clinical history, ECG pattern, and electrophysiology study (EPS)** [^113LvCyV]:

| **Risk category** | **Features** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| High risk | - Prior cardiac arrest <br/> - Sustained VT <br/> - Syncope with spontaneous type 1 ECG | ICD implantation [^116qup6d] |
| Intermediate risk | - Asymptomatic with spontaneous type 1 ECG <br/> - Inducible VF on EPS | Consider ICD or close surveillance [^1175He79] |
| Low risk | - Drug-induced type 1 ECG <br/> - No symptoms <br/> - Negative EPS | Conservative management [^114mMpD7] |

---

## Management strategies

- **ICD therapy**: Only proven intervention to prevent sudden cardiac death in high-risk patients [^116qup6d].
- **Pharmacological therapy**: Quinidine may be used for recurrent arrhythmias or as adjunctive therapy, particularly in children or when ICD is contraindicated [^114mMpD7].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Fever management, avoidance of sodium channel blockers, alcohol, and illicit drugs [^112cYBuD] [^114p9S8X].
- **Catheter ablation**: Epicardial ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate is an emerging option for recurrent VF or frequent ICD shocks [^114mMpD7].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with risk profile: high-risk patients have a **significant risk of arrhythmic events**, whereas low-risk patients generally have a favorable outlook [^113gk8Vj]. Appropriate risk stratification and targeted therapy are essential to optimize outcomes [^113pfcbR].

---

Brugada syndrome is a **genetic arrhythmia syndrome** with a characteristic ECG pattern and a risk of sudden death; management is risk-stratified, balancing ICD therapy for high-risk patients with conservative care for low-risk individuals.

### Brugada syndrome: update and future perspectives [^113pfcbR]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac disorder, characterised by a typical ECG pattern and an increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). BrS is a challenging entity, in regard to diagnosis as well as arrhythmia risk prediction and management. Nowadays, asymptomatic patients represent the majority of newly diagnosed patients with BrS, and its incidence is expected to rise due to (genetic) family screening. Progress in our understanding of the genetic and molecular pathophysiology is limited by the absence of a true gold standard, with consensus on its clinical definition changing over time. Nevertheless, novel insights continue to arise from detailed and in-depth studies, including the complex genetic and molecular basis. This includes the increasingly recognised relevance of an underlying structural substrate. Risk stratification in patients with BrS remains challenging, particularly in those who are asymptomatic, but recent studies have demonstrated the potential usefulness of risk scores to identify patients at high risk of arrhythmia and SCD. Development and validation of a model that incorporates clinical and genetic factors, comorbidities, age and gender, and environmental aspects may facilitate improved prediction of disease expressivity and arrhythmia/SCD risk, and potentially guide patient management and therapy. This review provides an update of the diagnosis, pathophysiology and management of BrS, and discusses its future perspectives.

### Prediction and prevention of sudden death in the Brugada syndrome [^115FZTke]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) secondary to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming over a quarter million lives annually, and is directly responsible for 50% of all cardiovascular mortality. Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is an arrhythmogenic cardiovascular channelopathy that predisposes asymptomatic patients who have no identified disease to a high-risk of SCD/SCA as their first cardiac event/disease manifestation. Limited progress has been made in risk prediction of SCA and SCD, with the greatest challenge being the ability to identify the small high-risk subgroups concealed within the larger general population. In conclusion, accurate identification of high-risk asymptomatic BrS patients (through multiparametric risk scores composed of reliable and validated unambiguous clinical variables and biomarkers) may hold utility in improving current SCD prediction algorithms, and the appropriate primary prevention therapy may prove valuable in reducing risk of sudden death for this patient population. This systematic review aims to comprehensively summarize qualitative evidence that explore proposed clinical, electrocardiographic, electrophysiological, and genetic markers for risk stratification of patients with BrS phenotype, and to discuss the best available contemporary evidence regarding therapeutic approach.

### Pathogenesis and management of Brugada syndrome [^111mzNKq]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome is an inherited disease characterized by an increased risk of sudden cardiac death owing to ventricular arrhythmias in the absence of structural heart disease. Since the first description of the syndrome > 20 years ago, considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved and the strategies to stratify at-risk patients. The development of repolarization-depolarization abnormalities in patients with Brugada syndrome can involve genetic alterations, abnormal neural crest cell migration, improper gap junctional communication, or connexome abnormalities. A common phenotype observed on the electrocardiogram of patients with Brugada syndrome might be the result of different pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, risk stratification of this patient cohort is critical, and although some risk factors for Brugada syndrome have been frequently reported, several others remain unconfirmed. Current clinical guidelines offer recommendations for patients at high risk of developing sudden cardiac death, but the management of those at low risk has not yet been defined. In this Review, we discuss the proposed mechanisms that underlie the development of Brugada syndrome and the current risk stratification and therapeutic options available for these patients.

The Brugada syndrome has gained wide recognition throughout the world and today is believed to be responsible for 4% to 12% of all sudden deaths and approximately 20% of deaths in patients with structurally normal hearts. The incidence of the disease is on the order of 5 per 10 000 inhabitants and, apart from accidents, is the leading cause of death of men under the age of 50 in regions of the world where the inherited syndrome is endemic. This minireview briefly summarizes the progress made over the past decade in our understanding of the clinical, genetic, cellular, ionic, and molecular aspects of this disease.

### The Brugada syndrome revisited [^115xntVE]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is a rare but well-defined cause of sudden cardiac death. The key underlying abnormality is a decrease in net depolarising current due to a genetic defect, though recent evidence also implicates structural abnormalities in some patients. Diagnosis requires a Brugada-type ECG as well as typical clinical features: such clinical considerations are currently key in guiding risk stratification and hence management. Whilst pharmacological therapies are under investigation, the only intervention with a robust evidence base remains insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Further research will be required to allow more effective risk stratification and hence more rational therapy.

### Brugada syndrome [^116ZmPuU]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Since its first description in 1992 as a new clinical entity, the Brugada syndrome has aroused great interest among physicians and basic scientists. Two consensus conferences held in 2002 and 2005 helped refine the current accepted definite diagnostic criteria for the syndrome, briefly, the characteristic ECG pattern (right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation in right precordial leads) together with the susceptibility for ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. In the last years, clinical and basic research have provided very valuable knowledge on the genetic basis, the cellular mechanisms responsible for the typical ECG features and the electrical susceptibility, the clinical particularities and modulators, the diagnostic value of drug challenge, the risk stratification of sudden death (possibly the most controversial issue) and, finally, the possible therapeutic approaches for the disease. Each one of these points is discussed in this review, which intends to provide updated information supplied by recent clinical and basic studies.

### Drugs and Brugada syndrome patients: review of the literature, recommendations, and an up-to-date website (www.brugadadrugs.org) [^114p9S8X]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide, the Brugada syndrome has been recognized as an important cause of sudden cardiac death in individuals at a relatively young age. Importantly, many drugs have been reported to induce the characteristic Brugada syndrome-linked ECG abnormalities and/or (fatal) ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to review the literature on the use of drugs in Brugada syndrome patients, to make recommendations based on the literature and on expert opinion regarding drug safety, and to ensure worldwide online and up-to-date availability of this information to all physicians who treat Brugada syndrome patients.

Methods

We performed an extensive review of the literature, formed an international expert panel to produce a consensus recommendation to each drug, and initiated a website (www.brugadadrugs.org).

Results

The literature search yielded 506 reports for consideration. Drugs were categorized into one of four categories: (1) drugs to be avoided (n = 18); (2) drugs preferably avoided (n = 23); (3) antiarrhythmic drugs (n = 4); and (4) diagnostic drugs (n = 4). Level of evidence for most associations was C (only consensus opinion of experts, case studies, or standard-of-care) as there are no randomized studies and few nonrandomized studies in Brugada syndrome patients.

Conclusion

Many drugs have been associated with adverse events in Brugada syndrome patients. We have initiated a website (www.brugadadrugs.org) to ensure worldwide availability of information on safe drug use in Brugada syndrome patients.

### Controversies in Brugada syndrome [^1152MQXd]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is an inherited channelopathy associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, often occurring during sleep or resting conditions. Although this entity has been described more than 20 years ago, it remains one of the most debated among channelopathies, with several open questions on its genetic substrate, arrhythmia mechanisms, and clinical management. Studies on the genetics and physiopathology bases of the Brugada syndrome have opened novel investigative pathways and concepts that are now entering the field of cardiovascular genetics and are applied to other inherited arrhythmias. In this perspective, Brugada syndrome can be seen as an example on how basic science discoveries have influenced clinical management and led to novel therapeutic approaches.

### J-wave syndromes: Brugada and early repolarization syndromes [^112HSUMB]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

A prominent J wave is encountered in a number of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including the Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndromes. Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndromes differ with respect to the magnitude and lead location of abnormal J waves and are thought to represent a continuous spectrum of phenotypic expression termed J-wave syndromes. Despite two decades of intensive research, risk stratification and the approach to therapy of these 2 inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndromes are still undergoing rapid evolution. Our objective in this review is to provide an integrated synopsis of the clinical characteristics, risk stratifiers, and molecular, ionic, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying these 2 fascinating syndromes that have captured the interest and attention of the cardiology community in recent years.

Introduction

Since its description, the Brugada Syndrome (BrS) has gained increased scientific interest as a cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) in young and otherwise healthy individuals. Brugada syndrome is believed to be a genetic disease, although the majority of clinically confirmed cases lack molecular validation, due to our current lack of understanding of the genetics of this syndrome. While more than 20 genes have been considered as causative of this syndrome and included in diagnostic panels, the disease causal role of all these genes, except SCN5A, has been recently challenged, citing the lack of systematically obtained evidence.

Variants in the SCN5A gene are found in ∼21% of all BrS probands. The current limited knowledge about the genetic basis of BrS prevents the expansion of the diagnostic panel to include genes other than SCN5A. It is imperative to understand the genetics of this syndrome before using molecular validation for decision-making about patient care.

Many people with the syndrome are completely unaware, as they can live for decades, or even their whole life, without symptoms. However, the first manifestation of the syndrome can be unexpected SCD, and genetic testing cannot always identify those at risk.

Currently, the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) is the main therapeutic option for high-risk patients. Recent pioneering studies have identified a discrete arrhythmogenic substrate (AS) located in the epicardium of the right ventricle, which is related to both the type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern and ventricular arrhythmia (VA) inducibility, thus representing a key phenotypic expression of the disease. Accordingly, the presence and electrophysiological properties of the AS likely have a crucial role in the clinical manifestation, alongside the natural history of BrS.

To date, in the setting of BrS, there is a lack of information regarding genotype–phenotype association. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to evaluate the role of current genetic testing among a large series of BrS probands at risk of SCD.

### Brugada syndrome: an exemplar for the genomic basis of sudden death [^112cJCpQ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2025). Medium credibility.

The inherited arrhythmia syndrome, Brugada Syndrome (BrS), is a leading cause of autopsy negative sudden death: the sudden arrhythmic death syndrome. Historically, BrS was believed to exhibit a Mendelian (autosomal dominant) mode of inheritance, caused by rare variants in SCN5A, the gene coding for the alpha subunit of the main cardiac sodium voltage channel. Challenges to this paradigm have arisen. For example, the majority of BrS cases do not exhibit rare variants in SCN5A. Moreover, genotype-phenotype mismatch in families has been observed. These findings suggest a more complex genetic architecture underpinning BrS. Subsequent large genomic studies of international patient cohorts have shown an unexpectedly high contribution of common genetic variation to its phenotypic development and severity. This has led to an alternative disease hypothesis whereby BrS develops as result of accumulated genetic and environmental risk surpassing a 'disease threshold' - the higher the accumulated risk, the more severe the clinical phenotype. Whilst expansion of standard clinical genetic testing to include an assessment of common variation might assist with diagnosis and phenotypic severity prediction in BrS, its incorporation into clinical practice presents inherent challenges which require careful consideration.

### Brugada syndrome: report of the second consensus conference [^114PxMYC]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Since its introduction as a clinical entity in 1992, the Brugada syndrome has progressed from being a rare disease to one that is second only to automobile accidents as a cause of death among young adults in some countries. Electrocardiographically characterized by a distinct ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads, the syndrome is associated with a high risk for sudden cardiac death in young and otherwise healthy adults, and less frequently in infants and children. Patients with a spontaneously appearing Brugada ECG have a high risk for sudden arrhythmic death secondary to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. The ECG manifestations of Brugada syndrome are often dynamic or concealed and may be unmasked or modulated by sodium channel blockers, a febrile state, vagotonic agents, alpha-adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, a combination of glucose and insulin, hypo- and hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and alcohol and cocaine toxicity. In recent years, an exponential rise in the number of reported cases and a striking proliferation of articles defining the clinical, genetic, cellular, ionic, and molecular aspects of the disease have occurred. The report of the first consensus conference, published in 2002, focused on diagnostic criteria. The present report, which emanated from the second consensus conference held in September 2003, elaborates further on the diagnostic criteria and examines risk stratification schemes and device and pharmacological approaches to therapy on the basis of the available clinical and basic science data.

### Brugada syndrome [^116Mbc3p]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac channelopathy associated with an elevated risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death compared with the general population. Since its initial description in 1992 by Pedro and Josep Brugada, there has been tremendous progress in our understanding and management of BrS. The condition is characterized by 'coved' ST segment elevations in the anterior precordial electrocardiogram leads, which occasionally requires additional pharmacological provocation for diagnosis. Substantial geographical variation in the prevalence, genetic characteristics and clinical behaviour of BrS exists. Improvements in the understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of the condition have been made over the past 30years, opening avenues for the discovery of diagnostic and management opportunities. In this Primer, we discuss the evolving epidemiology of BrS, the emerging genetic understanding of the condition, as well as its diagnosis and management. We summarize the major societal guideline recommendations pertaining to BrS and highlight the potential for technological advancements, such as digital health and machine learning, to improve patient care.

### Comparative effectiveness of implantable defibrillators for asymptomatic Brugada syndrome: a decision-analytic model [^116DgEku]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited disorder associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) attributable to ventricular arrhythmias. Yet SCD risk is variable and most patients will not have an event. Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) can avert SCD, but are associated with immediate and long‐term risks, require repeated interventions to maintain, are expensive, and may reduce quality‐of‐life. Therefore, proper risk stratification and recommendations for ICD implantation are of critical importance in BrS management.

Some individuals are at sufficiently high SCD risk that ICDs are clearly indicated, such as those with a history of malignant arrhythmias. Conversely, some are at recognizably low risk such that ICDs are not recommended, such as asymptomatic individuals with normal resting ECGs. In contrast, the optimal management of asymptomatic individuals with spontaneous ST‐segment elevation in the right precordial leads (ie, type I Brugada pattern), who have an ≈3‐fold SCD risk, is unclear and current guidelines do not provide explicit recommendations for or against ICD. Management typically includes observation, though risk stratification with electrophysiologic study (EPS) and ICD implant for high risk findings may be reasonable. At the same time, recent innovations such as the subcutaneous ICD may offer a favorable adverse event profile, thereby potentially altering the risk‐benefit equation in favor of ICD‐based strategies.

Although uncertainty in the optimal management of BrS remains a challenge, the rarity of the condition renders a definitive clinical trial impractical. We therefore developed a decision‐analytic model to estimate the comparative effectiveness of contemporary management strategies for individuals with asymptomatic BrS and spontaneous type I electrographic pattern, across a range of plausible clinical scenarios.

### Does the age of sudden cardiac death in family members matter in Brugada syndrome? [^112b2Xnc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a heterogeneous genetic ion channel disorder that is associated with an increased risk of major arrhythmic events (MAE) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Brugada syndrome is characterized by coved‐type (Type‐1) ST elevation appearances in the right precordial leads. The prevalence of patients with a Brugada ECG Type‐1 pattern varies among different populations, ranging from 0% to 0.4%. The most common mutation responsible for BrS is the SCN5A mutation, which is present in 20% to 30% of patients and has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of a family history of SCD in characterizing the disease and prognosis. However, data from other studies report conflicting results and suggest that a family history of SCD is not useful as a risk stratification tool. Risk stratification for ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of SCD remains challenging in asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome. In this study, we aimed to assess whether a family history of SCD is associated with an increased risk of MAE in patients with BrS by performing a systematic review and meta‐analysis.

### Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome with a sodium-channel-blocker test: who should be tested? Who should not? [^1148snzD]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Intravenous infusion of sodium-channel blockers (SCB) with either ajmaline, flecainide, procainamide, or pilsicainide to unmask the ECG of Brugada syndrome is the drug challenge most commonly used for diagnostic purposes when investigating cases possibly related to inherited arrhythmia syndromes. For a patient undergoing an SCB challenge, the impact of a positive result goes well beyond its diagnostic implications. It is, therefore, appropriate to question who should undergo a SCB test to diagnose or exclude Brugada syndrome and, perhaps more importantly, who should not. We present a critical review of the benefits and drawbacks of the SCB challenge when performed in cardiac arrest survivors, patients presenting with syncope, family members of probands with confirmed Brugada syndrome, and asymptomatic patients with suspicious ECG.

Use, misuse, and pitfalls of the drug challenge test in the diagnosis of the Brugada syndrome. *Diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is based on the modified Shanghai criteria (see Table 2). Indications to perform SCBT depend on symptoms, family history, and baseline ECG. Before performing the test, patients should be informed about test specificity, risk of complications, and generally excellent prognosis if asymptomatic. All-comers: asymptomatic patients and patients with symptoms including ventricular fibrillation/aborted cardiac arrest. Lethal arrhythmic events: sudden cardiac death, ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator interventions (i.e. shocks or antitachycardia pacing delivered for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation). ECG, electrocardiogram; RVOT, right ventricular outflow tract; SCBT, sodium channel blocker test.

### Brugada syndrome… [^114oEtvS]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

A patient who presented with a new apparent seizure was found to have abnormal electrocardiographic findings, with classic features of the Brugada syndrome. He had spontaneous episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, easily inducible ventricular fibrillation at electrophysiological study in the absence of structural heart disease, and a negative neurological evaluation. These findings suggested that sustained ventricular arrhythmias known to be associated with the Brugada syndrome and resultant cerebral hypoperfusion, rather than a primary seizure disorder, were responsible for the event. Patients with the Brugada syndrome often present with sudden death or with syncope resulting from ventricular arrhythmias. In consideration of its variability in presentation sometimes mimicking other disorders, primary care physicians and internists should be aware of its often transient electrocardiographic features.

### Meta-analysis of clinical outcome after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in patients with Brugada Syndrome [^112GJnHG]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to summarize the clinical outcome of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome.

Background

Brugada syndrome is characterized by cardiac conduction abnormalities and a high risk of ventricular arrhythmias that may result in sudden cardiac death. A complete overview of clinical outcome, appropriate and inappropriate interventions, and complications after ICD therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome is lacking.

Methods

The online MEDLINE database was searched for published reports and yielded 828 studies on outcome and complications after ICD therapy in patients with Brugada syndrome. After careful evaluation, 22 studies including a total of 1,539 patients were included in the meta-analysis.

Results

In total, 1,539 patients (mean age 45 years, 18% women) underwent ICD implantation for primary (79%) or secondary (21%) prevention of sudden cardiac death. During a mean follow-up of 4.9 years, the appropriate and inappropriate ICD intervention rates were 3.1 and 3.3 per 100 person-years, respectively. The cardiac mortality rate was 0.03 per 100 person-years and noncardiac mortality rate was 0.3 per 100 person-years. ICD-related complications per 100 person-years consisted of lead malfunction (1.6), psychological complication (1.3), infection (0.6), lead dislocation (0.4), and any complication (0.6).

Conclusions

Patients with Brugada syndrome judged to be at high risk for ventricular arrhythmia may significantly benefit from ICD therapy, which is associated with an appropriate ICD intervention rate of 3.1 per 100 person-years and low cardiac and noncardiac mortality rates. Inappropriate ICD interventions and ICD-related complications may lead to considerable morbidity.

### Brugada syndrome, exercise, and exercise testing [^1155Gga3]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

There are few data on the risk of exercise and the role of exercise stress testing in Brugada syndrome. We sought to address this deficiency using a systematic literature review. We identified 98 English-language articles possibly addressing exercise in Brugada syndrome by searching PubMed and Google Scholar from January 1990 through November 2013 using the keywords "Brugada syndrome", "exercise", "exercise testing", and "syncope" alone and in combinations. Abstracts were reviewed, and those articles pertaining to Brugada syndrome and exercise were reviewed in full. We identified 18 articles reporting on Brugada syndrome and exercise. This pool included 2 large studies of 93 and 50 Brugada subjects undergoing exercise testing, plus 16 case reports. There were no reports of exercise-related sudden death, but there were 4 cases of syncope after exercise. We identified 166 Brugada patients who underwent exercise testing. During exercise testing, there were 2 reports of ventricular tachycardia and 1 report of multiple ventricular extrasystoles. ST-segment elevation increased (ST augmentation) during the early recovery phase of exercise in 57% of patients. Exercise unmasked a Brugada electrocardiographic pattern in 5 patients. Exercise is associated with syncope and ST augmentation after exercise and may be helpful in unmasking Brugada syndrome. There are insufficient data on the risks of exercise in Brugada syndrome to make recommendations for exercise, but the observations that exercise can worsen the ST abnormalities in Brugada and produce ventricular arrhythmias suggest that patients with Brugada syndrome should be restricted from vigorous exercise.

### Brugada syndrome: clinical and genetic findings [^112pL7Yu]. Genetics in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome is a rare, inherited cardiac disease leading to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in structurally normal hearts. Clinical diagnosis requires a Brugada type I electrocardiographic pattern in combination with other clinical features. The most effective approach to unmasking this diagnostic pattern is the use of ajmaline and flecainide tests, and the most effective intervention to reducing the risk of death is the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. To date, 18 genes have been associated with the disease, with the voltage-gated sodium channel α type V gene (SCN5A) being the most common one to date. However, only 30–35% of diagnosed cases are attributable to pathogenic variants in known genes, emphasizing the need for further genetic studies. Despite recent advances in clinical diagnoses and genetic testing, risk stratification and clinical management of patients with Brugada syndrome remain challenging. Genet Med 18 1, 3–12.

### Fever-induced Brugada pattern: how common is it and what does it mean? [^112VQyZG]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Fever is known to unmask the Brugada pattern on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and trigger ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Brugada syndrome. Genetic studies in selected cases with fever-induced Brugada pattern have identified disease-causing mutations. Thus, "fever-induced Brugada" is a recognized clinical entity. However, its prevalence has not been systematically evaluated.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Brugada pattern in consecutive patients with fever.

Methods

ECGs of patients with fever admitted to the emergency department were evaluated for the presence of Brugada pattern and compared with ECGs of consecutive nonfebrile patients.

Results

ECGs of 402 patients with fever and 909 without were evaluated. Type I Brugada pattern was 20 times more common in the febrile group than in the afebrile group (2% vs. 0.1%, respectively, P = 0.0001). All patients with fever-induced type I Brugada pattern were asymptomatic and remained so during 30 months of follow-up.

Conclusion

Type I Brugada pattern is definitively more common among patients with fever, suggesting that asymptomatic Brugada syndrome is more prevalent than previously estimated.

### Present status of Brugada syndrome: JACC state-of-the-art review [^115RfMAg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is an inherited disorder associated with risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in a structurally normal heart. Diagnosis is based on a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern (coved type ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm followed by a negative T-wave in ≥ 1 of the right precordial leads V 1 to V 2), observed either spontaneously or during a sodium-channel blocker test. The prevalence varies among regions and ethnicities, affecting mostly males. The risk stratification and management of patients, principally asymptomatic, still remains challenging. The current main therapy is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, but radiofrequency catheter ablation has been recently reported as an effective new treatment. Since its first description in 1992, continuous achievements have expanded our understanding of the genetics basis and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Currently, despite several genes identified, SCN5A has attracted most attention, and in approximately 30% of patients, a genetic variant may be implicated in causation after a comprehensive analysis.

### Does the age of sudden cardiac death in family members matter in Brugada syndrome? [^116wgxgP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that a history of SCD among family members of age younger than 40 years was associated with a higher risk of MAE. A mere presence of a family history of SCD without a clear age definition is not a risk predictor in BrS. We propose that a family history of SCD in the young could be a prognostic factor to predict MAE in patients with BrS. Larger prospective cohort studies are needed to valid our observation.

### Brugada syndrome in sports cardiology: an expert opinion statement of the Italian society of sports cardiology (SICSport) [^1152RDcP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a genetic disorder marked by a characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in right precordial leads, which is associated with an increased risk of ventricular fibrillation in the absence of structural heart disease. Despite advancements in understanding its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment, there is considerable variability in how sports cardiologists approach BrS. This expert opinion by the Italian Society of Sports Cardiology (SICSPORT) aim to review the current definition, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, risk stratification, and treatment of BrS and provide guidance for sport eligibility provides guidance for sports doctors and cardiologists in assessing competitive sports eligibility in athletes with BrS. A multiparametric approach to diagnosis and risk stratification is recommended, noting that the presence of a Brugada ECG pattern (BrP) does not confirm a BrS diagnosis. The risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is low in asymptomatic individuals with type 1 BrP, especially those with a drug-induced pattern. Pharmacological testing is not required for type 2 or 3 patterns without other risk factors. Low-risk individuals do not require therapy, while intermediate or high-risk patients may need pharmacological treatment, ICD implantation, or ablation. Asymptomatic individuals with type 2 or 3 BrP, no family history of SCD, and no other risk factors may be eligible for competitive sports, as well as asymptomatic type 1 BrP without risk factors and negative electrophysiological study. Conversely, sports eligibility should be denied in patients with BrS who have a history of syncope or cardiac arrest (high-risk subjects), regardless of ICD presence.

### The Brugada syndrome: clinical, genetic, cellular, and molecular abnormalities [^117AwREu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The Brugada syndrome is an arrhythmic syndrome characterized by a right bundle branch block pattern and ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads of the electrocardiogram in conjunction with a high incidence of sudden death secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. No evidence of structural heart disease is noted during diagnostic evaluation of these patients. In 25% of families, there appears to be an autosomal dominant mode of transmission with variable expression of the abnormal gene. Mutations have been identified in the gene that encodes the alpha subunit of the sodium channel (SCN5A) on chromosome 3. This genetic defect causes a reduction in the density of the sodium current and explains the worsening of the above electrocardiographic abnormalities when patients are treated with sodium channel blocking antiarrhythmic agents, which further diminish the already reduced sodium current. The prognosis is poor with up to a 10% per year mortality. Antiarrhythmic drugs including beta-blockers and amiodarone have no benefit in prolonging survival. The treatment of choice is the insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### ACC / AHA / HRS 2008 guidelines for device-based therapy of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [^113BRB1q]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 — Brugada syndrome: Brugada syndrome is defined by "ST-segment elevation across the right precordial leads in association with a high risk of SCD", shows autosomal dominant inheritance with "more than 90% of those affected" being male, and cardiac events "occur predominantly in the third and fourth decades of life". For prevention, "implantation of an ICD is the only therapeutic measure to prevent SCD". Syncope with spontaneous ECG changes signals higher risk: "Patients with syncope and the ECG pattern of spontaneous ST-segment elevation have a 6-fold higher risk of cardiac arrest than patients without syncope and the spontaneous ECG pattern". Electrophysiological testing "had a low positive predictive value (23%), but over a 3-year follow-up, it had a very high negative predictive value (93%)", while genetics currently has limited prognostic utility: "Specific mutations in the SCN5A gene do not identify a subset of patients at higher risk of cardiac events". Holter ectopy is typically absent: "Patients with Brugada syndrome usually do not have ventricular extrasystoles or nonsustained runs of VT at Holter recording". SCD denotes sudden cardiac death; ICD denotes implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; ECG denotes electrocardiogram; VT denotes ventricular tachycardia.

### The Brugada syndrome [^113x1aFF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome describes the syndrome of sudden cardiac death in the setting of the following electrocardiographic findings: right bundle branch block pattern with ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. The right bundle branch block may be incomplete while the ST segment elevation is minimal. The electrocardiographic findings are not constant. Patients suspected of having Brugada syndrome should be promptly referred for electrophysiological testing and treatment. Rapid referral and placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is associated with an excellent prognosis, whereas failure to diagnose this condition is associated with a high risk for sudden death. Therefore, it is imperative that all emergency physicians be familiar with the typical ECG manifestations of Brugada syndrome. Three illustrative cases are presented with a review of the syndrome.

### Reappraisal of reported genes for sudden arrhythmic death: evidence-based evaluation of gene validity for Brugada syndrome [^1157a4oT]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Implicit in the genetic evaluation of patients with suspected genetic diseases is the assumption that the genes evaluated are causative for the disease based on robust scientific and statistical evidence. However, in the past 20 years, considerable variability has existed in the study design and quality of evidence supporting reported gene-disease associations, raising concerns of the validity of many published disease-causing genes. Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an arrhythmia syndrome with a risk of sudden death. More than 20 genes have been reported to cause BrS and are assessed routinely on genetic testing panels in the absence of a systematic, evidence-based evaluation of the evidence supporting the causality of these genes.

Methods

We evaluated the clinical validity of genes tested by diagnostic laboratories for BrS by assembling 3 gene curation teams. Using an evidence-based semiquantitative scoring system of genetic and experimental evidence for gene-disease associations, curation teams independently classified genes as demonstrating limited, moderate, strong, or definitive evidence for disease causation in BrS. The classification of curator teams was reviewed by a clinical domain expert panel that could modify the classifications based on their independent review and consensus.

Results

Of 21 genes curated for clinical validity, biocurators classified only 1 gene (SCN5A) as definitive evidence, whereas all other genes were classified as limited evidence. After comprehensive review by the clinical domain Expert panel, all 20 genes classified as limited evidence were reclassified as disputed with regard to any assertions of disease causality for BrS.

Conclusions

Our results contest the clinical validity of all but 1 gene clinically tested and reported to be associated with BrS. These findings warrant a systematic, evidence-based evaluation for reported gene-disease associations before use in patient care.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — genetic risk and testing considerations: Because only a single gene has been linked to the Brugada syndrome, there is still insufficient information about the contribution of genetic defects in predicting clinical outcome, and mutations in the SCN5A gene do not identify a subset of patients at higher risk of cardiac events. Genetic analysis may help identify silent carriers so that they can remain under clinical monitoring to detect early manifestations of the syndrome; furthermore, once identified, silent mutation carriers should receive genetic counseling and discussion of the risk of transmitting the disease.

Brugada syndrome — causes, inheritance, demographics, and triggers: The syndrome is associated with a characteristically abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) and a high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in individuals with a structurally normal heart; the disease is transmitted with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, and the clinical expression is modified by gender as 90% of the affected individuals with a diagnostic ECG are male. Only 1 Brugada syndrome disease gene has been identified so far, the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A), although non-SCN5A loci have also been reported but the disease gene(s) at these loci remain to be identified. Cardiac events occur predominantly in males in the third and fourth decades of life, and fever is a predisposing factor for cardiac arrest in the Brugada syndrome.

### Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome: clinical characteristics, electrocardiographic parameters, and auxiliary testing [^113LvCyV]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Risk stratification in Brugada syndrome remains a clinical challenge because the event rate is low but the presenting symptom is often cardiac arrest (CA). We review the data on risk stratification. A history of CA or malignant syncope is a strong predictor of spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), whereas the prognostic value of a history of familial sudden death and the presence of a SCN5A mutation are less well defined. On the electrocardiogram, the presence of spontaneous type I electrocardiogram increases the risk for VF in all studies, whereas the presence of fragmented QRS complexes and early repolarization correlates with increased risk in several studies. Signal-averaged techniques using late potentials and microscopic T-wave alternans show some promising results in small studies that need to be confirmed. The value of electrophysiologic studies for predicting spontaneous VF remains controversial, and this includes programmed stimulation protocols that avoid a third extrastimuli or stimulation from the right ventricular outflow. Risk prediction is particularly challenging in children and women.

### Cardiac channelopathies: clinical diagnosis and promising therapeutics [^116kY73f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Brugada Syndrome

BrS is an inherited channelopathy that predisposes patients to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Its prevalence is around 3 to 5 per 10 000 people, and it is 8 to 10 times more frequent in male patients. The clinical manifestations of BrS vary, with approximately two thirds of patients being asymptomatic and one third presenting with syncope or palpitations and dizziness. Nonetheless, SCD can be the first manifestation of the disease, with BrS being involved in 4% to 12% of all SCD cases and up to 28% of SCDs in individuals with structurally normal hearts. SCD and arrythmias tend to occur during periods of rest, sleep, or after consuming large meals, which are associated with episodes of enhanced vagal tone and bradycardia. BrS is also associated with other conduction abnormalities, including first‐degree atrioventricular block, right bundle branch block, intraventricular conduction delay, and sick sinus syndrome.

### Genetics can contribute to the prognosis of Brugada syndrome: a pilot model for risk stratification [^113RWcQw]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Brugada syndrome is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder leading to sudden death predominantly in the 3–4 decade. To date the only reliable treatment is the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator; however, better criteria for risk stratification are needed, especially for asymptomatic subjects. Brugada syndrome genetic bases have been only partially understood, accounting for < 30% of patients, and have been poorly correlated with prognosis, preventing inclusion of genetic data in current guidelines. We designed an observational study to identify genetic markers for risk stratification of Brugada patients by exploratory statistical analysis. The presence of genetic variants, identified by SCN5A gene analysis and genotyping of 73 candidate polymorphisms, was correlated with the occurrence of major arrhythmic events in a cohort of 92 Brugada patients by allelic association and survival analysis. In all, 18 mutations were identified in the SCN5A gene, including 5 novel, and statistical analysis indicated that mutation carriers had a significantly increased risk of major arrhythmic events (P = 0.024). In addition, we established association of five polymorphisms with major arrhythmic events occurrence and consequently elaborated a pilot risk stratification algorithm by calculating a weighted genetic risk score, including the associated polymorphisms and the presence of SCN5A mutation as function of their odds ratio. This study correlates for the first time the presence of genetic variants with increased arrhythmic risk in Brugada patients, representing a first step towards the design of a new risk stratification model.

### Fever-induced Brugada-Pattern electrocardiogram [^115Dtroz]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Brugada syndrome is an increasingly recognized syndrome characterized by a particular electrocardiography (ECG) pattern and clinical criteria and has a high incidence of sudden death in patients with structurally normal hearts. The Brugada ECG pattern can be unmasked by drugs, ischemia, and fever.

Case Report

We present the case of a 47-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with flu-like symptoms and syncope. On arrival, he was febrile and his ECG showed a Brugada pattern. Although this pattern resolved once his fever resolved, the cardiologists were concerned that his syncopal episode might have been due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, and the patient was admitted for implantable cardiac defibrillator placement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Fever and other stressors can unmask a Brugada pattern on ECG, and if patients have concerning clinical criteria, they should receive emergent cardiology follow-up.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Systematic review questions on sudden cardiac death (SCD) prevention identify two topics: for asymptomatic patients with Brugada syndrome, "what is the association between an abnormal programmed ventricular stimulation study and SCD and other arrhythmia endpoints?" and "What is the impact of ICD implantation for primary prevention in older patients and patients with significant comorbidities?", where ICD indicates implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### Impact of clinical and genetic findings on the management of young patients with Brugada syndrome [^114M6T89]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an arrhythmogenic disease associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) that seldom manifests or is recognized in childhood.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical presentation of pediatric BrS to identify prognostic factors for risk stratification and to propose a data-based approach management.

Methods

We studied 106 patients younger than 19 years at diagnosis of BrS enrolled from 16 European hospitals.

Results

At diagnosis, BrS was spontaneous (n = 36, 34%) or drug-induced (n = 70, 66%). The mean age was 11.1 ± 5.7 years, and most patients were asymptomatic (family screening, (n = 67, 63%; incidental, n = 13, 12%), while 15 (14%) experienced syncope, 6(6%) aborted SCD or symptomatic ventricular tachycardia, and 5 (5%) other symptoms. During follow-up (median 54 months), 10 (9%) patients had life-threatening arrhythmias (LTA), including 3 (3%) deaths. Six (6%) experienced syncope and 4 (4%) supraventricular tachycardia. Fever triggered 27% of LTA events. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 22 (21%), with major adverse events in 41%. Of the 11 (10%) patients treated with hydroquinidine, 8 remained asymptomatic. Genetic testing was performed in 75 (71%) patients, and SCN5A rare variants were identified in 58 (55%); 15 of 32 tested probands (47%) were genotype positive. Nine of 10 patients with LTA underwent genetic testing, and all were genotype positive, whereas the 17 SCN5A-negative patients remained asymptomatic. Spontaneous Brugada type 1 electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern (P = 0.005) and symptoms at diagnosis (P = 0.001) were predictors of LTA. Time to the first LTA event was shorter in patients with both symptoms at diagnosis and spontaneous Brugada type 1 ECG pattern (P = 0.006).

Conclusion

Spontaneous Brugada type 1 ECG pattern and symptoms at diagnosis are predictors of LTA events in the young affected by BrS. The management of BrS should become age-specific, and prevention of SCD may involve genetic testing and aggressive use of antipyretics and quinidine, with risk-specific consideration for the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### Brugada syndrome [^114mMpD7]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an "inherited" condition characterized by predisposition to syncope and cardiac arrest, predominantly during sleep. The prevalence is ∼1:2,000, and is more commonly diagnosed in young to middle-aged males, although patient sex does not appear to impact prognosis. Despite the perception of BrS being an inherited arrhythmia syndrome, most cases are not associated with a single causative gene variant. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings support variable extent of depolarization and repolarization changes, with coved ST-segment elevation ≥ 2 mm and a negative T-wave in the right precordial leads. These ECG changes are often intermittent, and may be provoked by fever or sodium channel blocker challenge. Growing evidence from cardiac imaging, epicardial ablation, and pathology studies suggests the presence of an epicardial arrhythmic substrate within the right ventricular outflow tract. Risk stratification aims to identify those who are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, with well-established factors being the presence of spontaneous ECG changes and a history of cardiac arrest or cardiogenic syncope. Current management involves conservative measures in asymptomatic patients, including fever management and drug avoidance. Symptomatic patients typically undergo implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion, with quinidine and epicardial ablation used for patients with recurrent arrhythmia. This review summarizes our current understanding of BrS and provides clinicians with a practical approach to diagnosis and management.

### Type-I paradox of Brugada syndrome [^113gk8Vj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Insights From the Present Study for the "Type‐I Paradox" of Brugada Syndrome

One can postulate 2 explanations, not mutually exclusive, for the "type‐I paradox". Both imply that ST‐segment elevation is mechanistically necessary for the development of spontaneous VF (even if that is not always the case). 11 According to the first explanation, patients who have spontaneous type‐I at presentation simply have it more often and therefore have higher risk of developing VF. 12 After all, among patients with Brugada syndrome undergoing repeated ECGs or 12‐lead Holter recordings with continuous ST‐segment analysis, those with VF have longer time periods with ST‐segment elevation. 13, 14

A second explanation for the "type‐I paradox" could well be that patients with drug‐induced type‐I ECG consist of 2 subgroups: (1) patients presenting with a nondiagnostic ECG and a positive SCB test, who then develop a spontaneous type‐I pattern at least once during follow‐up; and (2) otherwise similar patients who never develop a spontaneous type‐I ECG. This second group could be larger than we think: If we compare the incidence of VF among patients who have spontaneous versus drug‐induced type I at presentation, a risk repeatedly reported as 1% versus 0.3% annual risk, 5 by then assuming that VF events in the drug‐induced category occur only in patients who have "yet unrecognized" spontaneous type I, one may calculate that only 3 out of 10 patients with drug‐induced type I will ever develop a spontaneous type I. In studies performing repeated ECG or Holter recordings after a SCB test, only 29% 2 to 35% 13 are "caught" with a spontaneous type I. Clearly, this partition will depend on the frequency of ECG recordings done over time and needs to be better defined. As discussed elsewhere, 15, 16 truly false‐positive responses to a SCB test do exist and such patients are expected to have an excellent prognosis.

### Long-term trends in newly diagnosed Brugada syndrome: implications for risk stratification [^115sCS5c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A proband of Brugada syndrome (BrS) is the first patient diagnosed in a family. There are no data regarding this specific, high-risk population.

Objectives

This study sought to investigate the Brugada probands diagnosed from 1986 through the next 28 years.

Methods

We included 447 probands belonging to families with a diagnostic type 1 electrocardiogram Brugada pattern. The database was divided into 2 periods: the first period identified patients who were part of the initial cohort that became the consensus document on BrS in 2002 (early group); the second period reflected patients first diagnosed from 2003 to January 2014 (latter group).

Results

There were 165 probands in the early group and 282 in the latter group. Aborted sudden death as the first manifestation of the disease occurred in 12.1% of the early group versus 4.6% of the latter group (p = 0.005). Inducibility during programmed electrical stimulation was achieved in 34.4% and 19.2% of patients, respectively (p < 0.001). A spontaneous type 1 electrocardiogram pattern at diagnosis was present in 50.3% early versus 26.2% latter patients (p = 0.0002). Early group patients had a higher probability of a recurrent arrhythmia during follow-up (19%) than those of the latter group (5%) (p = 0.007). The clinical suspicion and use of a sodium-channel blocker to unmask BrS has allowed earlier diagnoses in many patients.

Conclusions

Since being first described, the presentation of BrS has changed. There has been a decrease in aborted sudden cardiac death as the first manifestation of the disease among patients who were more recently diagnosed. These variations in initial presentation have important clinical consequences. In this setting, the value of inducibility to stratify individuals with BrS has changed.

### Use, misuse, and pitfalls of the drug challenge test in the diagnosis of the Brugada syndrome [^111qUsV4]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome (BrS) requires the presence of a coved (Type 1) ST segment elevation in the right precordial leads of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The dynamic nature of the ECG is well known, and in patients with suspected BrS but non-diagnostic ECG at baseline, a sodium channel blocker test (SCBT) is routinely used to unmask BrS. There is little doubt, however, that in asymptomatic patients, a drug-induced Brugada pattern is associated with a much better prognosis compared to a spontaneous Type 1 ECG. The SCBT is also increasingly used to delineate the arrhythmogenic substrate during ablation studies. In the absence of a "gold standard" for the diagnosis of BrS, sensitivity and specificity of the SCBT remain elusive. By studying patient groups with different underlying diseases, it has become clear that the specificity of the test may not be optimal. This review aims to discuss the pitfalls of the SCBT and provides some directions in whom and when to perform the test. It is concluded that because of the debated specificity and the overall very low risk for future events in asymptomatic individuals, patients should be properly selected and counseled before SCBT is performed and that SCBT should not be performed in asymptomatic patients with a Type 2 Brugada pattern and no family history of BrS or sudden death.

### Sex differences in cardiac arrhythmia: a consensus document of the European Heart Rhythm Association, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^116ARNTj]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome — sex differences show that clinical manifestations of Brugada syndrome are eight-fold more frequent in adult men than in adult women, and Brugada syndrome has well described sex differences with greater symptoms and event rates and more frequently spontaneous Type 1 ECG in post-pubertal male patients. Brugada syndrome is genetically diagnosed in approximately 20–25% of clinical cases and has been linked to mutations in 10 different genes. Pregnancy and the peri-partum period seem to be well tolerated in women with Brugada syndrome, and there are no systematic reports on sex differences in rare channelopathies such as Short QT syndrome or in patients with CPVT.
