## Question

Elderly female with right upper quadrant abdominal pain after eating. Gallbladder ultrasound is normal. What is recommended next test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended next test for an elderly woman with postprandial right upper quadrant pain and a normal gallbladder ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and key differentials in this demographic. Then, I should verify the limitations of a normal ultrasound and what it does not exclude. Next, I will prioritize the next best test based on guideline hierarchies and patient-specific risk. After that, I should outline alternative pathways if the first test is unrevealing. Finally, I will integrate red flags, escalation triggers, and a practical algorithm with supporting evidence and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. In an elderly woman, postprandial RUQ pain raises concern for biliary disease, but atypical presentations are common, and ultrasound can miss acalculous cholecystitis, gallbladder dyskinesia, choledocholithiasis, and even gallbladder torsion, so I should not anchor prematurely on a normal ultrasound result [^116iGhZo] [^11721Yne] [^1132mxDk].

> Wait, let me verify the implications of a normal ultrasound. Ultrasound is the first-line test for suspected biliary disease, but it has imperfect sensitivity for acalculous cholecystitis and functional gallbladder disorders, and it can miss small stones or sludge, especially in the cystic duct or common bile duct, so a normal study does not exclude clinically significant biliary pathology in this scenario [^115XDdSy] [^11721Yne] [^116U7eDt].

> I need to check the guideline hierarchy for the next best test when ultrasound is normal but suspicion persists. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria and contemporary emergency care guidance support hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) as the next step to evaluate for cystic duct obstruction and functional gallbladder disease, with CT reserved for equivocal cases or when alternative diagnoses are suspected, and MRCP or EUS considered if choledocholithiasis remains a concern [^111dW4BF] [^115opEoo] [^115iNuFq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the rationale for HIDA first. HIDA directly assesses cystic duct patency and gallbladder ejection fraction, enabling detection of acalculous cholecystitis and gallbladder dyskinesia that ultrasound can miss, and it aligns with surgical society guidance on selecting patients with suspected biliary dyskinesia for cholecystectomy when the ejection fraction is reduced and symptoms are reproduced [^112FdDdA] [^111dW4BF].

> Let me consider the practical protocol for HIDA. I should ensure the patient fasts appropriately, typically about 4 hours, to avoid false positives from recent gallbladder emptying, and if cholecystokinin-stimulated ejection fraction is measured, a value less than about 35% supports gallbladder dyskinesia and correlates with symptom improvement after cholecystectomy in appropriately selected patients [^117PzRRw] [^112FdDdA].

> But wait, what if HIDA is unavailable or contraindicated. In that case, I should pivot to contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which can identify acute cholecystitis, gangrenous changes, gallbladder torsion, and alternative intra-abdominal causes that ultrasound may miss, and is particularly useful in the elderly where pretest orientation can be challenging and complications are more common [^117UBS6z] [^112RyrSJ] [^111dW4BF].

> I should double-check the role of MRCP and EUS if choledocholithiasis remains in the differential. MRCP is noninvasive and highly accurate for detecting common bile duct stones, while EUS offers comparable sensitivity and specificity and is preferred when MRCP is contraindicated or unavailable; both are endorsed for intermediate-risk patients after initial ultrasound [^115iNuFq] [^117TpBZo].

> Next, I should review red flags and escalation triggers. If the patient develops fever, jaundice, hypotension, altered mental status, or refractory pain, I need to urgently reassess for acute cholangitis or complicated cholecystitis and escalate to CT or MRCP and surgical consultation, because delays in source control increase morbidity and mortality in this population [^117UBS6z] [^112RyrSJ].

> Let me synthesize the decision pathway. Given persistent postprandial RUQ pain in an elderly woman with a normal ultrasound, the next best test is HIDA with cholecystokinin stimulation to assess cystic duct patency and ejection fraction. If HIDA is unavailable or nondiagnostic, obtain contrast-enhanced CT to evaluate for acalculous cholecystitis, torsion, or alternative diagnoses. If choledocholithiasis remains suspected, proceed to MRCP or EUS based on availability and patient factors [^111dW4BF] [^117UBS6z] [^115iNuFq].

> I will now examine the role of functional testing beyond HIDA. If HIDA is normal and symptoms persist, I should reconsider the differential to include sphincter of Oddi dysfunction using Rome IV criteria and consider MRCP or manometry in expert centers, recognizing that invasive manometry carries risk and should be reserved for carefully selected patients after noninvasive testing is unrevealing [^113Qswdk] [^112akcJt].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked gallbladder torsion. In thin, elderly women with sudden RUQ pain and a distended, displaced gallbladder, torsion can mimic cholecystitis. CT may show a horizontally oriented, displaced gallbladder with a swirl sign at the pedicle, and a high index of suspicion is warranted because torsion requires emergent operative management to prevent ischemia and perforation [^112RyrSJ] [^113NaDMm].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. A normal gallbladder ultrasound in an elderly patient with classic biliary-type pain does not exclude disease. HIDA is the most appropriate next test to evaluate for acalculous cholecystitis and dyskinesia, with CT as an alternative when HIDA is not feasible or when complications or alternative diagnoses are suspected, and MRCP or EUS pursued if ductal stones remain a concern [^11721Yne] [^117UBS6z] [^115iNuFq].

---

The next best test is a **HIDA scan with CCK** to evaluate for acalculous cholecystitis or gallbladder dyskinesia when ultrasound is normal but biliary symptoms persist [^112FdDdA] [^112akcJt]. If the HIDA scan is inconclusive or unavailable, **MRCP or EUS** should be considered to detect small stones, sludge, or strictures not seen on ultrasound [^115iNuFq] [^112pW3EF]. CT is less sensitive for early cholecystitis but may help identify alternative diagnoses if biliary imaging is non-diagnostic [^111ohNPF] [^117UBS6z].

## Differential diagnosis in elderly patients with RUQ pain and normal gallbladder ultrasound

In elderly patients with RUQ pain and a normal gallbladder ultrasound, the **differential diagnosis** includes:

- **Acalculous cholecystitis**: Inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, more common in elderly patients and often associated with critical illness, diabetes, or vascular disease [^114cvf3s].

- **Gallbladder dyskinesia**: Functional motility disorder causing biliary colic without stones, diagnosed by reduced gallbladder ejection fraction on HIDA scan with CCK stimulation [^112FdDdA] [^112akcJt].

- **Choledocholithiasis**: Small stones or sludge in the common bile duct that may be missed on ultrasound, particularly if the ducts are not dilated [^113J1knp] [^11721Yne].

- **Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction**: Functional obstruction at the sphincter causing biliary-type pain, often requiring specialized testing [^113Qswdk] [^112akcJt].

- **Non-biliary causes**: Peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, hepatic pathology, renal colic, or musculoskeletal pain [^112BidjC] [^11721Yne].

---

## Recommended next diagnostic test: HIDA scan with CCK stimulation

The **HIDA scan with CCK stimulation** is the recommended next diagnostic test for elderly patients with RUQ pain and a normal gallbladder ultrasound. This nuclear medicine study evaluates gallbladder function and cystic duct patency, helping differentiate acalculous cholecystitis and gallbladder dyskinesia from other causes of biliary pain [^112FdDdA] [^114NcbQY].

---

### Indications for HIDA scan

Indications include suspected **acalculous cholecystitis**, particularly in elderly patients with persistent RUQ pain and normal ultrasound, and suspected **gallbladder dyskinesia**, characterized by biliary colic without gallstones and reduced gallbladder ejection fraction [^112FdDdA] [^114S4DDg].

---

### Diagnostic criteria and interpretation

- **Normal HIDA scan**: Gallbladder visualization within 60 minutes indicates normal cystic duct patency and gallbladder function.

- **Acalculous cholecystitis**: Non-visualization of the gallbladder or delayed visualization suggests cystic duct obstruction and inflammation.

- **Gallbladder dyskinesia**: Reduced gallbladder ejection fraction (< 35%) after CCK stimulation indicates functional motility disorder [^112FdDdA].

---

### Clinical utility and limitations

The HIDA scan is **highly sensitive and specific** for acalculous cholecystitis and gallbladder dyskinesia, making it the preferred next test in this clinical scenario [^112FdDdA] [^114NNQvx]. Limitations include false positives in prolonged fasting, recent meal intake, or chronic gallbladder disease; careful patient preparation and clinical correlation are essential [^117PzRRw].

---

## Alternative diagnostic tests if HIDA scan is inconclusive or unavailable

If the HIDA scan is inconclusive or unavailable, **alternative diagnostic tests** include:

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MRCP | Suspected choledocholithiasis or biliary strictures | Non-invasive, high sensitivity for small stones and strictures | Limited availability, contraindications (e.g. pacemaker) |
| EUS | Suspected choledocholithiasis or small gallbladder polyps | High sensitivity for small stones and polyps, minimal invasiveness | Requires sedation, specialized equipment |
| CT scan | Suspected alternative intra-abdominal pathology (e.g. pancreatitis, malignancy) | Widely available, good for alternative diagnoses | Limited sensitivity for early cholecystitis, radiation exposure |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach** to evaluating RUQ pain in elderly patients. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, and if results are normal but clinical suspicion persists, a HIDA scan with CCK stimulation is recommended to assess gallbladder function and cystic duct patency [^115XDdSy] [^112FdDdA]. MRCP or EUS are considered when choledocholithiasis or biliary strictures are suspected, and CT is reserved for alternative diagnoses or when other imaging is inconclusive [^115iNuFq] [^117UBS6z].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In elderly patients with RUQ pain and a normal gallbladder ultrasound, the next best diagnostic test is a **HIDA scan with CCK stimulation**. This test evaluates gallbladder function and cystic duct patency, helping identify acalculous cholecystitis and gallbladder dyskinesia. If the HIDA scan is inconclusive or unavailable, MRCP or EUS should be considered to detect small stones, sludge, or strictures, and CT may be used to identify alternative diagnoses [^112FdDdA] [^115iNuFq] [^111ohNPF].

### Role of ultrasound and CT in the workup of right upper quadrant pain in adults in the emergency department: a retrospective review of more than 2800 cases [^111ohNPF]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare ultrasound and CT in the diagnostic evaluation of right upper quadrant pain in adults in the emergency department. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective review was conducted of adult emergency department encounters for right upper quadrant pain over a 5-year period, excluding those for prior cholecystectomy, current pregnancy, and trauma. Imaging study reports were reviewed for gallbladder and nongallbladder explanations of right upper quadrant pain and were considered positive for cholecystitis when two or more supportive features were present. Encounter outcomes were evaluated on the basis of pathology data and clinical management. RESULTS. Among the encounters, 2859 met the study inclusion criteria, and 18% met the study definition of cholecystitis by pathologic or clinical criteria. The following metrics showed no statistically significant difference between ultrasound and CT, respectively: sensitivity, 61% and 55%; specificity, 91% and 92%; positive predictive value, 63% and 63%; and negative predictive value, 91% and 90%. Both modalities were performed in 20% of encounters. In the subgroup analysis, ultrasound showed an acute nongallbladder abnormality that was missed at a preceding CT examination in only 1 of 238 cases (0.4%). CT showed an acute nongallbladder abnormality missed at a preceding ultrasound examination in 103 of 322 cases (32%). CONCLUSION. CT is noninferior to ultrasound in both ruling in and ruling out the diagnosis of cholecystitis in adult patients undergoing emergency evaluation of right upper quadrant pain and offers the advantage of depicting acute nongallbladder abnormalities.

Question 1: diagnosis: which test for elderly

Diagnosis algorithms of acute cholecystitis are based on clinical picture, laboratory data, and imaging finding. Despite recent advances in non-invasive imaging in the last decades, there is still uncertainty in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in patients of all ages. Moreover, age-related changes involving pain perception, biliary tract physiology, and stress response to tissue injury may modify the clinical picture of ACC occurring in an elderly patient, making diagnosis even more complicated. Literature search identified approximately 70 publications on Embase and 140 on Medline.

Statement 1.1: There is no single investigation with sufficient diagnostic power to establish or exclude acute cholecystitis without further testing even in elderly people (LoE 2 GoR B). Combination of symptoms, signs, and laboratory tests results may have better diagnostic accuracy in confirming the diagnosis of ACC. (LoE 4 GoR D)

The most typical symptom of ACC is abdominal pain with a proportion of patients with right hypochondrial pain and epigastric pain of 72–93% in patients of all ages. Same range of 73–98% typical right hypochondrial and epigastric pain has been reported in studies focused on the elderly patients. Atypical pain or no pain at all has been associated with an acute cholecystitis in 12% and 5% of elderly people respectively. Vomiting has been reported in 38–48% of elderly patients in two studies. Abdominal tenderness or guarding was reported in 64.7% of patients over 65 years old in one study, while signs of peritonitis have been reported in 5.3–14.5% of elderly patients.

In one study, the rate of positive Murphy's sign in elderly people has been reported to be 43.3%. Another study reported a sensitivity of 0.48, specificity of 0.79, and a positive predictive value of 0.58 for Murphy's sign in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis in the elderly. Fever has been reported in 36–74% of patients with ACC (8–10), but only 6.4% to 10% of patients with ACC had a temperature > 38 °C. Clinical features including pain, fever, abdominal defense, and vomiting have been compared in different age decades within elderly patients without finding any difference in old and very old patients. No study comparing the role of pain or other clinical features in young versus old patient has been found.

### Symptomatic cholecystolithiasis after laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^113tuc9Z]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

A 45-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of upper abdominal pain. Seven months earlier a laparoscopic cholecystectomy had been carried out and a solitary gallstone removed together with the gallbladder. The patient now suffered from pain of the same character but lower intensity compared to the situation before the operation. At admission there were no abnormal laboratory findings, especially no signs of infection or cholestasis. Ultrasound revealed a stone in a gallbladder-like structure in the right epigastric region. ERCP revealed an inconspicuous cystic duct stump and no pathological findings in the extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts. MRCP and CT showed a cyst-like structure in the gallbladder region containing a concrement. The patient was transferred to the Department of Surgery for exploratory laparotomy, and a residual gallbladder with an infundibular gallstone was removed. The recurrent upper abdominal pain was obviously caused by a gallstone redeveloped after incomplete laparoscopic gallbladder resection. Retrospectively it could not be discerned whether a doubled or a septated gallbladder was the reason for the initial incomplete resection.

### Functional gallbladder and sphincter of oddi disorders [^112akcJt]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The functional disorder of the gallbladder (GB) is a motility disorder caused initially either by metabolic abnormalities or by a primary motility alteration. The functional disorders of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) encompass motor abnormalities of either the biliary or the pancreatic SO. Dysfunction of the GB and/or biliary SO produce similar patterns of pain. The pain caused by a dysfunction of the pancreatic SO can be similar to that of acute pancreatitis. The symptom-based diagnostic criteria of motility dysfunction of the GB and biliary SO are episodes of moderate to severe steady pain located in the epigastrium and right upper abdominal quadrant that last at least 30 minutes. GB motility disorder is suspected after gallstones and other structural abnormalities have been excluded. This diagnosis should then be confirmed by a decreased GB ejection fraction induced by cholecystokinin at cholescintigraphy and after disappearance of the recurrent biliary pain after cholecystectomy. Symptoms of biliary SO dysfunction may be accompanied by features of transient biliary obstruction, and those of pancreatic SO dysfunction are associated with elevation of pancreatic enzymes and even pancreatitis. Biliary-type SO dysfunction is more frequently recognized in postcholecystectomy patients. SO manometry is valuable to select patients with sphincter dysfunction; however, because of the high incidence of complications, these patients should be referred to an expert unit for such assessment. Thus invasive tests should be performed only in the presence of compelling clinical evidence and after noninvasive testing has yielded negative findings. The committee recommends that division of the biliary or pancreatic sphincters only be considered when the patient has severe symptoms, meets the required criteria, and other diagnoses are excluded.

### Is hyperkinetic gallbladder an indication for cholecystectomy? [^11642tpT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The (99m) technetium-labelled hepato imino diacetic acid (HIDA) scan is widely used to evaluate patients with biliary colic with a normal trans-abdominal ultrasound scan. Most studies recommend cholecystectomy for patients with biliary dyskinesia, defined by gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) of less than 35–40% on HIDA scan. There are no recommendations regarding management of hyperkinetic gallbladder defined by GBEF of greater than 80% on HIDA scan. The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes following cholecystectomy on patients with biliary colic associated with hyperkinetic gallbladder.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with biliary colic associated with hyperkinetic gallbladder that underwent cholecystectomy in our practice from July 2014 to February 2018. Data collection included age, gender, body mass index, preoperative symptoms, comorbidities, additional tests, ejection fraction, surgery, and histopathology of the gallbladder. Symptomatic improvement was assessed during routine 2-week postoperative visit and a follow-up phone interview.

Results

Thirty-two patients had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period for symptomatic hyperkinetic gallbladder. All the patients had abdominal pain related to food intake and 17 (53%) patients had worsening of symptoms with CCK infusion. The average GBEF was 92%. Chronic cholecystitis was seen in 29 (90%) patients on pathology. 23 (74%) patients had complete resolution of biliary symptoms, 5 (16%) had improved symptoms, and 3 (10%) had no change in symptoms.

Conclusion

Patients with biliary colic and hyperkinetic gallbladder respond favorably to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our results suggest that patients with biliary colic in the setting of hyperkinetic gallbladder have symptomatic improvement following cholecystectomy.

### Hepatobiliary scintigraphy of evolving spontaneous biliary leak [^115kjF8k]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with Crohn's disease, who presented to the ED with abdominal pain. Initial imaging by CT and US showed mild biliary tree dilatation, mild gallbladder distension, and pericholecystic fluid. The cystic and common bile ducts were patent without bile leak on cholescintigraphy. The next day, MRCP revealed free fluid extending from the gallbladder fossa to the right lower quadrant. Subsequently, a repeat cholescintigraphy was performed which was positive for bile leak. This case highlights the use of multiple imaging modalities in assessing abdominal pain, pre-and post-biliary leak.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions from benign and self-limited disease to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis. Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful (e.g., constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction), whereas others are of little value (e.g., anorexia has little predictive value for appendicitis). The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, and computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary disease, which may cause abdominal pain; and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Avoid other imaging tests apart from ultrasound for the… [^111aRGpj]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic workup of acute right upper quadrant pain is informed by risk factors for cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound based on availability, examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. When the clinical features, examination, laboratory and ultrasound findings are congruent, no further imaging is required.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^114cvf3s]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine and Infectious Diseases Society of America ICU fever guidelines — abdominal ultrasound can potentially diagnose acalculous cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, liver or kidney abscesses, perforated bowel, ascites, and/or appendicitis as potential sources of fever, and in surgical patients can identify surgical wound abscesses and determine if they are amenable to drainage. Acalculous cholecystitis, an important but often unrecognized cause of fever in critically ill patients, may be suspected with right upper quadrant pain, although this is commonly absent; in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of a febrile episode. However, a lack of data on false-positive and false-negative results in patients without abdominal signs or symptoms precludes a firm recommendation supporting routine diagnostic abdominal ultrasound.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117TpBZo]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Performance of ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE Guidelines

In ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines, patients are stratified into high risk, intermediate risk, or low risk for CBDS based on various clinical, biochemical, and ultrasound criteria, as presented in Table 4. All three guidelines recommend ERCP or laparoscopic treatment for CBDS for patients stratified as high risk, MRCP or EUS for patients stratified as intermediate risk, and no additional workup prior to cholecystectomy for patients stratified as low risk. Given these similarities, we have applied identical strategies when performing the meta‐analysis of these guidelines by treating these three‐tiered stratification systems as predictive tools with two distinct thresholds, as detailed in the "Data Analysis" section above.

TABLE 4
Summary of ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019 and ESGE guidelines.

Data for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are available from 21 studies with 12,047 patients, 17 studies with 9271 patients, and 8 studies with 5028 studies, respectively. For distinguishing patients at high risk for CBDS from those not at high risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 65% (CI: [57,73]), 63% (CI: [53,73]), and 62% (CI: [50,74]) and pooled specificities of 57% (CI: [48,66]), 75% (CI: [65,83]), and 82% (CI: [71,90]), respectively. For distinguishing patients at low risk for CBDS from those greater than low risk, ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines have pooled sensitivities of 97% (CI: [92,99]), 95% (CI: [90,98]), and 84% (CI: [70,93]) and pooled specificities of 7% (CI: [3,18]), 11% (CI: [7,18]), and 15% (CI: [8,28]), respectively. Overall, the AUCs for ASGE 2010, ASGE 2019, and ESGE guidelines are 0.65, 0.74, and 0.73 respectively, with their ROCs and summary ROCs as presented in Figure 2A–C. Test of similarity suggests the guidelines are dissimilar (p = 0.000001 for the overall comparison between three guidelines and p < 0.02 for all pairwise comparisons between guidelines). The jointly estimated ROC curves are presented in Figure 2D.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^1159KirJ]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Diagnostic strategies

The fully paired study design, with all imaging tests in all patients and with the panel based final diagnosis as the reference standard, allowed a comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of multiple imaging strategies. We compared the following single imaging strategies: (1) diagnosis after clinical evaluation, (2) clinical diagnosis plus plain radiographs, (3) ultrasonography in all patients, and (4) CT in all patients. In addition, we investigated the following conditional ultrasonography and CT strategies: (5) ultrasonography first in all patients and CT in those with a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography and (6) ultrasonography in all patients and CT only in patients with inconclusive ultrasonography.

We also investigated imaging strategies driven by patients' characteristics, in which only selected patients would have initial ultrasonography, with CT after a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography, whereas all others would have initial CT. For initial ultrasonography in these strategies, we selected (7) younger patients (< 45 years), for whom exposure to ionising radiation is most hazardous, and (8) non-obese patients (body mass index < 30 kg/m²), in whom ultrasonography is more likely to be diagnostic. In another strategy (9) both younger and non-obese patients would have initial ultrasonography.

A common clinical view is that the choice of imaging for acute abdominal pain should be guided by the location of pain. Therefore, we investigated strategies in which the selection of ultrasonography or CT was driven by the abdominal quadrant in which the pain was predominantly located. In strategy (10) the choice of investigation was based on the American College of Radiology guidelines, which recommend ultrasonography for pain in the right upper quadrant and computed tomography for pain in the other quadrants and for diffuse abdominal pain. In an alternative pain location driven strategy (11) patients with pain in the right upper quadrant or right lower quadrant would have initial ultrasonography and all others would have initial CT. The box summarises the strategies investigated.

### CT of acute abdomen in the elderly [^112RyrSJ]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory process

The most common inflammatory processes seen in the elderly are cholecystitis, appendicitis and diverticulitis.

Cholecystitis and cholangitis

Acute cholecystitis stands as the predominant cause of inflammatory process requiring emergency surgery in the elderly (Tables 2 and 3). In more than 90% of cases, it is due to gallstone, with untreated gallstones generally thought to potentially lead to acute cholecystitis in 10 to 20% of individuals. Age is a strong risk factor of biliary stone and, consequently, of cholecystitis and cholangitis. The epidemiological MICOL study has shown that the prevalence of gallstones in males and females was 15% and 24% at 70 and 24% and 35% at 90, respectively. Ultrasound (US) is recommended as the first-choice imaging method for the morphological diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, because of its non-invasiveness, widespread availability, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness However, there is a growing trend towards the use of CT in cases of suspected cholecystitis, particularly in the elderly, where CT scans are performed in half of all cases. There are several reasons for this: CT is widely used in industrialized countries to investigate acute abdominal pain; pre-imaging orientation is more difficult in the elderly; CT permits the diagnosis of an alternative condition or a coincident pathology that would alter therapy; lastly, age is a risk factor for acute gangrenous cholecystitis, for which contrast-enhanced CT is recommended. CT findings of gangrenous cholecystitis (Fig. 8) include irregular thickening of the gallbladder wall, poor contrast enhancement of the gallbladder wall (interrupted rim sign), membranous structures within the lumen, (intraluminal flap or intraluminal membrane), gas in the gallbladder lumen or wall, increased density of fatty tissue around the gallbladder, and peri-gallbladder abscess. The diagnosis of gangrenous cholecystitis should lead to emergency cholecystectomy. In the same way, gallbladder volvulus, a rare disease resulting from a twist of the gallbladder along its axis, necessitates prompt surgical intervention because of the risk of ischemia, necrosis, and perforation. Gallbladder volvulus has clinical and physical manifestations similar to acute cholecystitis, making it challenging to distinguish before performing a CT scan. CT may reveal (Fig. 9) dilatation of the gallbladder, displacement of the gallbladder outside its anatomical fossa, rotation of the gallbladder axis from vertical to horizontal, twist along the gallbladder's vascular pedicle with a swirl sign and abrupt tapering of the cystic duct and ischemic signs on the gallbladder wall.

### Acute gallbladder torsion-a continued pre-operative diagnostic dilemma [^117PPSCD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute gallbladder volvulus continues to remain a relatively uncommon process, manifesting itself usually during exploration for an acute surgical abdomen with a presumptive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The pathophysiology is that of mechanical organo-axial torsion along the gallbladder's longitudinal axis involving the cystic duct and cystic artery, and with a pre-requisite of local mesenteric redundancy. The demographic tendency is septua- and octo-genarians of the female sex, and its overall incidence is increasing, this being primarily attributed to increasing life expectancy. Despite significant challenges in pre-operative diagnosis, a high index of suspicion and prompt surgical intervention results in an overall mortality of approximately 5 percent.

Case Report One

A 99-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 3 day history of acute onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain with intermittent radiation to the right flank and back. It was described as colicky in nature on a baseline dull character, and with no obvious precipitating, aggravating or relieving factors. Associated phenomena included anorexia and nausea, but no constitutional upset, vomiting, or change in bowel habit. Her medical history included peptic ulcer disease, uncontrolled hypertension, tobacco abuse, diverticulosis, a hiatal hernia, and dementia. Her surgical history was significant for an appendectomy.

Clinical physical examination revealed an apyrexic frail patient in no acute distress with stable vital signs. Focused abdominal examination demonstrated a soft, mildly distended abdomen with tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, and a positive Murphy's sign. There was no overt peritonism. A reducible left inguinal hernia was also appreciated. Laboratory parameters yielded a mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and hypokalemia. Her liver function enzymes were elevated in a cholestatic distribution with a total bilirubin of 3.9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL, and an alkaline phosphatase of 150 IU/L.

### Evaluating patients with right upper quadrant pain [^117DxLpY]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Many disorders of the liver, gallbladder, and biliary tree may cause right upper quadrant pain and clinical diagnosis may be challenging. Imaging plays a key role in establishing a prompt diagnosis and guiding appropriate management. Although ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice for most hepatobiliary disorders, radionuclide imaging, computed tomography (CT), and MR imaging also play important roles. Acute cholecystitis may be associated with many complications that have characteristic imaging features. MR cholangiopancreatography achieves high accuracy in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and allows for noninvasive imaging when ultrasonography and CT are indeterminate.

Background

A 33-year-old white female with a history of cholecystectomy presented to the emergency department with intermittent severe abdominal pain radiating from the left upper quadrant to the right upper quadrant, associated with nausea and emesis. Three weeks previously the patient had presented to the emergency department with similar pain in the abdomen. Laboratory investigations had revealed elevated bilirubin, transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels. At that time, pain and liver chemistry test results improved and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3. She denied a history of alcohol use, new medications, or the ingestion of other toxins.

Investigations

History and physical examination, liver chemistry tests, viral hepatitis serology tests, autoimmune serology tests, abdominal ultrasound, liver biopsy, and an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram.

Diagnosis

Choledocholithiasis.

Management

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram with sphincterotomy, removal of an 8 mm distal common bile duct stone, and pancreatic stent placement.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

Biliary dyskinesia — patient selection and diagnostic criteria for laparoscopic cholecystectomy are described: Patients with symptoms of biliary obstruction without evidence of gallstones, but with abnormal gall bladder emptying may benefit from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Symptoms may include episodic, severe, steady pain, frequently with fatty food intolerance, located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium, with or without radiation to the back or shoulder lasting at least 30 minutes but less than several hours, and may potentially be associated with nausea and vomiting. Abnormal gallbladder emptying is usually defined as a gallbladder ejection fraction of less than 35% with cholescintigraphy after injection of cholecystokinin, and severe symptoms, a very low gallbladder ejection fraction (< 14%), and reproduction of symptoms with cholecystokinin administration may be more predictive of resolution of symptoms after cholecystectomy. In patients who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary dyskinesia, stones are found in specimens 10–12% of the time indicating a significant false negative rate for gallbladder ultrasound in this group of patients.

### Gallbladder imaging interpretation pearls and pitfalls: ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging [^114NNQvx]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The gallbladder is a source of common disease processes with a wide variety of presentations. Common pathologies include acute or chronic cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, cancer, polyps, and postoperative complications. Accurate imaging assessment of the gallbladder can be very challenging and fraught with potential pitfalls. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for the initial evaluation of patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. CT is often used as part of a broader evaluation of patient's abdominal pain if nongallbladder pathologies are also suspected. MRI/MRCP is typically reserved for problem-solving and evaluating patients who present with cholestatic presentation. We discuss common pitfalls, diagnostic challenges, and problem-solving approaches to the imaging evaluation of common gallbladder patho logies.

### Efficacy and safety of B-mode ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage combined with laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in elderly and high-risk patients [^116skeXo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Study subjects

This study enrolled 35 elderly (all > 65 years old) and high-risk AC patients who underwent B-mode ultrasound-guided PTGD combined with LC (PTGD + LC group) at Ethe First People's Hospital of Wenzhou between January 2010 and April 2014. A separate group of 35 elderly and high-risk AC patients were randomly selected from a pool of 186 cases who underwent only LC (LC group) during the same period at the same hospital. The PTGD + LC group contained 23 males and 12 females, with a mean age of 69.2 ± 11.4 years. The LC group contained 20 males and 15 females, with a mean age of 71.5 ± 11.5 years. The diagnostic criteria and evaluation of severity were based on the revised Tokyo guidelines 2012, namely, local signs of inflammation (Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness), systemic symptoms of inflammation (fever, elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein), and findings from computed tomography (CT) scans and ultrasonograms. By admission time, the onset period in patients ranged from 6 h to 72 h, with an average of 30 h. All the patients had upper abdominal pain or right upper abdominal pain. Among the total 70 patients in this study, 46 cases had fever, 54 cases had shoulder and back radiating pain and all patients exhibited right upper abdominal tenderness by physical examination. A total of 51 cases showed positive Murphy's sign and 40 cases had palpable and swollen gallbladder with tenderness. Leukocytes count in all patients were elevated and were in the 2.2 ± 0.5 grade, based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade. Gallbladder swelling and wall thickening were found using liver and gallbladder B-ultrasound and 26 cases had pericholecystic fluid and 63 cases had cholecystolithiasis. All subjects in the LC and PTGD + LC groups met the following study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: (1) elderly AC patients (> 65 years old) with cardiac, brain and lung comorbidities, and unable to tolerate surgery; (2) patients with AC and empyema of gall-bladder, failing to response well to non-surgical therapies; (3) severe AC patients with disease for more than 48–72 h, diameter of gallbladder enlargement 8 cm, and gallbladder wall of thickening 4 mm. Exclusion criteria: (1) patients with dysfunction in blood coagulation and severe bleeding tendency; (2) patients with massive ascites; (3) patients with gallbladder in free state; (4) patients' gallbladder with clear or inappropriate puncture route; (5) patients with general peritonitis and suspected perforation of gallbladder.

### Acalculous cholecystitis with gallbladder necrosis in a patient presenting without abdominal pain [^116U7eDt]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

An 83-year-old man with a history of chronic myelogenous leukaemia in remission maintained with bosutinib presented with new-onset fevers. He denied pain and had no other focal symptoms. Ultrasound imaging revealed mild gallbladder wall thickening. Non-contrasted CT revealed right upper quadrant inflammation of indeterminate source. The diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis was made on the third day when a CT with oral contrast demonstrated a remarkably inflamed biliary tree. The gallbladder was surgically removed and found to be necrotic. The case highlights an unusual presentation for a well-known condition. Both ultrasound and CT have limited diagnostic sensitivity for acalculous cystitis. This case adds to existing literature to support development of acalculous cholecystitis in non-critically ill patients. Clinicians should maintain awareness of this condition among patients presenting to the hospital or clinic with abdominal pain. Careful discussion with radiology and surgery is indicated to guide diagnostic testing when initial imaging results are indeterminate.

### Decision making in patients with acute abdominal pain at a university and at a rural hospital: does the value of abdominal sonography differ? [^111NE7ZX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Stage III

[Fig. 1]: Knowing the result of the sonography, the surgeon on call had to decide which steps to take next on the basis of clinical necessity. Options included surgery, conservative treatment, discharge, or additional examinations, such as CT-scan, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), gastroscopy, and others. Women whose pain was suspected to have gynaecological causes following the investigations mentioned above were seen at both hospitals by the gynaecologist on call (UH 6%/RH 9%).

Stage IV

[Fig. 1]: The final diagnosis was either obtained from the operating surgeon's report or in a telephone interview with the family physician 2–4 weeks after presentation to the ED.

The term non-specific abdominal pain (NSAP) was used when no diagnosis was found.

We defined and identified the 3 following outcomes (table 2 /table 3):

Statistics

All information was entered in a computerised database by means of a standard PC-based spread sheet and statistics were calculated with the assistance of a biostatistician. Patient groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test, since criteria for normal distribution were not fulfilled. Categorical data were analysed by the Chi-square test, or the Fisher exact test if the expected samples size was smaller than five. A p-value smaller than 0.05 was considered significant.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability. Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered. If ultrasonography results are inconclusive in pregnant patients, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred over computed tomography when available.

Imaging findings

Pericholecystic fluid (fluid around the gallbladder)
Distended gallbladder, edematous gallbladder wall
Gallstones (impacted in cystic duct)
Murphy's sign can be elicited on ultrasound examination

US is the investigation of choice in patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis.

A meta-analysis by Kiewiet et al. included studies on CT, MRI, and hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan in addition to those on US. Data on the diagnostic accuracy of CT is limited. Kiewiet et al. identified only one study including 49 patients. CT findings of acute cholecystitis included gallbladder distension (41%), gallbladder wall thickening (59%), peri-cholecystic fat density (52%), peri-cholecystic fluid collection (31%), sub-serosal edema (31%) and high gallbladder bile attenuation (24%). Thus, there is no single CT feature which is useful in the diagnosis of ACC. Furthermore, the ionizing radiation to which patients are exposed is an issue. CT is therefore usually indicated when sonography is non-diagnostic or in patients with confusing signs and symptoms. Kiewiet et al. included three studies on MRI including a total of 131 patients. Summary sensitivity was 85% (95% CI: 66 to 95%) and specificity was 81% (95% CI: 69 to 90%). There was substantial heterogeneity for sensitivity (I² = 65%) and no heterogeneity for specificity (I² = 0%). In a head-to-head comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of MRI was comparable with that of US. The comparison was however based on two studies including only 59 patients; therefore, the strength of evidence is low.

### A case of inflammatory pseudotumour of the gallbladder presenting as a big mass of uncertain behavior [^117Wgii3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 60-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Room with abdominal pain, fever, pruritus and jaundice since 1 week. The patient had a history of smoking and a family history of pancreatic cancer.

On physical examination, a hard and painful mass was identified on the right hypochondrium. Blood laboratory examination showed extrahepatic cholestasis enzymes (total bilirubin 8,44 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 8,31 mg/dl, AST 529 U/L; ALT 728 U/L; GGT 3974 U/L; LDH 353 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 876,4 U/L. In anamnesis, the patient referred to abdominal pain occurring during the last 6 months located in the right upper quadrant, which had been interpreted as biliary colic by her general practitioner.

Tumour markers and blood count showed no alterations. Viral serology, autoimmunity antibodies, metanephrines and urine normetanephrine were within the normal range.

A large mass associated with the gallbladder was identified by abdominal ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced CT scan disclosed a large soft tissue mass originating from the gallblader with homogenous contrast enhancement and without clear infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma. The mass displaced the transverse colon, hepatic flexure and duodenum. No lymphadenopathies were identified in the hepatoduodenal ligament, pancreas, retroduodenum or celiac axis (Fig. 1 a, b) The gallbladder was distended, contained stones, and had a regular lumen, while there was slight dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct on magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1 c).

An abdominal ultrasound scan revealed a distended gall bladder with the diameter of the common bile duct at the upper limit of normal. It also revealed free fluid within the abdomen, bilateral pleural effusions and a large left ovarian cyst. The medical team became involved and ordered a CT thorax and abdomen which showed a large pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural effusions, a small amount of ascites and a large left ovary; reported as appearances most consistent with malignancy. On further assessment by a cardiologist the patient showed signs of cardiac tamponade and she underwent urgent pericardiocentesis.

### Spontaneous lesser omental herniation resolved by laparoscopic surgery: case report and systematic literature review [^112r35r9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department for an upper abdominal pain scaled at 10/10 in the visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain was associated with nausea and alimentary vomiting but without transit disorder, dyspnea, or chest pain. She presented for the first time these symptoms. Patient's history was negative for any systemic diseases, prior abdominal surgeries or trauma and her BMI was of 26. At admission, vital signs were all within normal ranges. Bowel sounds were audible and of normal tonality. Clinical examination only revealed epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness but a negative Murphy's sign. Laboratory tests were normal except for a mildly elevated leukocytosis 10.8 G/l. A point-of-care ultrasound highlighted a gallstone in the gallbladder. She received Tramadol which reduced the pain to 3/10. The diagnosis of biliary colic was retained and the patient was discharged with a 24-h follow-up appointment.

At follow-up appointment, the patient described persistent mild pain in the upper abdominal region. Laboratory tests were normal except for a mildly elevated C-reactive protein. A complete US did not find any signs of acute cholecystitis, but a moderate quantity of free intraperitoneal fluid was detected. A total abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a "closed loop" small-bowel internal hernia of the lesser omentum and free intraperitoneal fluid along the dilated upward ileal loops, in the pouch of Douglas and in peri-splenic localisation (Figs. 2, 3).

There is subtle associated fat stranding. Findings are consistent with a gallbladder mucocoele. The gallbladder wall thickening and fat stranding are suggestive of possible empyema

Mirizzi syndrome refers to a gallstone that is impacted in the cystic duct or neck of gallbladder which causes extrinsic compression on the common bile duct resulting in obstructive jaundice (Fig. 18).

Fig. 18
a Maximum intensity projection (MIP). b Axial T2-weighted MRCP image of the biliary tree. The gallbladder is distended with extensive intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The common bile duct is normal in calibre. Appearances are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome, with a stone in Hartmann's pouch of the gallbladder causing extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct

Both biliary dilatation and the offending gallstone can be seen on ultrasound; however, cross-sectional imaging with MRI or CT, or ERCP, may be needed to confirm that biliary dilatation is secondary to compression from a gallbladder/cystic duct stone rather than secondary to a CBD calculus.

Pancreaticobiliary system

The next anatomical location where gallstones can be found is outside the gallbladder but within the pancreaticobiliary system. When gallstones exit the gallbladder into the common bile duct (choledocholithiasis), they can often obstruct the normal drainage of bile which can lead to jaundice. This is typically associated with pain, unlike malignant biliary obstruction which is characteristically painless (Fig. 19).

Fig. 19
(a) Sagittal ultrasound, (b) fluoroscopic ERCP cholangiogram, (c) T2-weighted axial MRI and (d) coronal MIP MRI of the biliary tree. These images demonstrate multiple filling defects (arrows) within the common bile duct with associated biliary duct dilatation consistent with obstructing choledocholithiasis

The obstruction of biliary drainage and stasis of bile may result in infection in the form of ascending cholangitis and associated sepsis. The clinical picture associated with this is described in Reynolds' pentad consisting of fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, hypotension and altered mental status. These patients may require urgent decompression of the biliary system.

5.5 Investigations

The Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of CVS require that there is "no organic pathology" to explain the symptoms. Hence, it is reasonable to pursue some higher‐yield diagnostic investigations to exclude other disorders that may mimic CVS. Unfortunately, many patients with CVS are subjected to extensive and often repetitive diagnostic testing before the diagnosis is even considered. Diagnosing CVS efficiently and in a cost‐effective manner can be achieved by early clinical recognition based upon the Rome IV criteria, followed by a limited diagnostic workup to exclude alternative disorders. The following suggestions reflect the committee's expert opinion as there is limited published data pertaining to approach.

A basic workup for a patient with previously uninvestigated episodes of vomiting should include biochemical, endoscopic, and potentially radiographic assessments. Biochemical testing should include the following: a complete blood count, serum electrolytes and glucose, liver panel, lipase, and urinalysis. Although patients will undoubtedly receive some testing in an ED setting if presenting with a CVS episode, in general diagnostic tests should be performed after resolution to minimize confounding variables such as dehydration. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be performed to exclude organic pathology such a gastric volvulus, which may mimic CVS in rare instances. It is important not to over‐interpret some endoscopic findings, such as a Mallory‐Weiss tear, mild gastritis, or esophagitis as being causal, when those findings may more likely be epiphenomena reflective of recent retching and vomiting. Imaging studies including a right upper quadrant ultrasound could reveal biliary disease, and a small bowel follow‐through or CT/MR enterography may also be able to exclude any obstructive lesions within the small bowel.

### Rome IV. gallbladder and sphincter of oddi disorders [^113Qswdk]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Rome IV diagnostic criteria for functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder" for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

The Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Biliary Sphincter of Oddi Disorder is a clinical calculator used in the field of gastroenterology. This calculator is specifically designed for patients who are suspected of having functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder, a condition characterized by recurrent biliary-type pain or pancreatitis with a dilated bile or pancreatic duct but without any obvious structural abnormalities.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder. It uses a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results to determine the likelihood of this disorder. The criteria include recurrent episodes of upper abdominal pain, absence of gallstones or other structural abnormalities, and abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry or elevated liver enzymes during episodes of pain.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include the presence of other structural or metabolic diseases that could explain the patient's symptoms, such as gallstones, pancreatitis, or liver disease. Additionally, patients who have had their gallbladder removed (cholecystectomy) may not be suitable for this calculator, as the symptoms of functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder can mimic those of post-cholecystectomy syndrome.

The Rome IV diagnostic criteria calculator assesses whether a patient meets the conditions for a functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder. It uses a provided set of boolean inputs related to specific symptoms and diagnostic test results. Based on these inputs, the calculator assigns numerical scores, sums them up, and provides an interpretation of whether the diagnostic criteria are met.

For each input:

1. **Located in the epigastrium and/or right upper quadrant**: 1 point if true
2. **Builds up to a steady level and lasts ≥ 30 minutes**: 1 point if true
3. **Occurs at different intervals not daily**: 1 point if true
4. Severe enough to interrupt daily activities or lead to an emergency department visit: 1 point if true
5. **Not significantly < 20% related to bowel movements**: 1 point if true
6. **Not significantly < 20% relieved by postural change or acid suppression**: 1 point if true
7. **Elevated liver enzymes or dilated bile duct, but not both**: 1 point if true
8. **Absence of bile duct stones or other structural abnormalities**: 1 point if true
9. The remaining inputs (nausea and vomiting, radiation to the back and/or right infra-subscapular region, waking from sleep, normal amylase/lipase, abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry, hepatobiliary scintigraphy) contribute 0 points regardless of the boolean value.

The calculator sums up the points from each boolean input. The total score ranges from 0 to 8.

Interpretation of the total score:

- If the total score is 8, the interpretation is "Diagnostic criteria are met". This suggests that all the required conditions consistent with a functional biliary sphincter of Oddi disorder have been identified through the inputs.
- A score less than 8 results in the interpretation "Diagnostic criteria are not met". This indicates that not all necessary conditions for the disorder have been satisfied.

Table of input scoring:

| **Input** | **Score if true** |
|-|-|
| Located in the epigastrium and/or right upper quadrant | 1 |
| Builds up to a steady level and lasts ≥ 30 minutes | 1 |
| Occurs at different intervals not daily | 1 |
| Severe enough to interrupt daily activities or lead to an emergency department visit | 1 |
| Not significantly < 20% related to bowel movements | 1 |
| Not significantly < 20% relieved by postural change or acid suppression | 1 |
| Elevated liver enzymes or dilated bile duct, but not both | 1 |
| Absence of bile duct stones or other structural abnormalities | 1 |
| Nausea and vomiting | 0 |
| Radiation to the back and/or right infra-subscapular region | 0 |
| Waking from sleep | 0 |
| Normal amylase/lipase | 0 |
| Abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry | 0 |
| Hepatobiliary scintigraphy | 0 |

### Hepatobiliary imaging and its pitfalls [^11721Yne]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

In summary, US is the initial imaging modality for the evaluation of acute right upper quadrant pain. It permits accurate diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and successfully identifies multiple other causes of patient symptomatology. Some of these processes lie outside the hepatobiliary system and include renal infection and obstruction, pancreatitis and its sequelae, duodenal or colonic perforation or mass lesions, peritoneal tumor spread, adrenal hemorrhage, and even remote problems, such as pneumonia. The limitations on US include incomplete imaging of the liver, most often at the dome or beneath ribs on the surface, and incomplete visualization of lesion boundaries, particularly with some infections and tumors. For these clinical scenarios, contrast-enhanced CT is complementary to US and should be encouraged. In the biliary tree, US has limitations in situations in which the ducts are not dilated and sometimes with imaging the extra hepaticducts, especially distally. For these patients, CT or MR imaging (MRCP) is especially useful. If one keeps the clinical scenario in mind and always images a patient where he or she hurts, US is a powerful and effective diagnostic method for evaluating acute right upper quadrant pain.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage using a novel cautery-enhanced, endoscopist-deployed lumen-apposing metal stent [^1118YSyc]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

An 85-year-old woman presented with right upper abdominal pain and fever. Examination revealed tenderness in the right hypochondrium with a positive Murphy's sign. White cell count was 16.3 × 109/L, but liver function was normal. Transabdominal ultrasound confirmed acute cholecystitis with a 6-mm cystic duct stone. Owing to the patient's pre-existing Alzheimer's disease and frail pre-morbid condition, we decided for endoscopic ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage (EUS-GBD) after discussion with the patient's main caregiver.

The procedure was performed in an endoscopy suite with fluoroscopy capabilities and the patient was placed in the prone position under conscious sedation (Video 1). A linear echoendoscope (GF-UCT260; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was advanced to the first part of the duodenum and a distended gallbladder up to 10 cm and a 6-mm cystic duct stone were identified (Fig. 1). There were no stones in the common bile duct.

Fig. 1
Endoscopic ultrasound images of a distended gallbladder and cystic duct stone. Arrow (←) shows the cystic duct stone.

EUS-GBD was performed via direct puncture with a novel cautery-enhanced, lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) (Hanarostent Z-EUS IT; M. I. Tech, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) (Fig. 2). This is a 12 mm (diameter) × 30 mm (length) fully-covered, lumen-apposing stent with an inter-flange distance of 22 mm. The opening and deployment of the proximal and distal flanges of the stent were fully controlled by the endoscopist. The opening of the distal flange was confirmed on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) (Fig. 3), while the proximal flange was visualized endoluminally (Fig. 4). The procedure took 20 minutes and there was good drainage of purulent bile at the end. Abdominal X-ray confirmed a good stent opening and the presence of the air cholecystogram (Fig. 5). The patient's fever subsided and her white cell count normalized by day two after the procedure and she was discharged with a one-week course of oral antibiotics.

### Rare cause of abdominal pain and fever in a pregnant woman [^113YkAZh]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Presentation

A pregnant woman (third trimester) presented with intense abdominal pain, nausea and myalgia. The patient was obese (body mass index 38) and was being treated for high blood pressure, hyperuricemia and hypothyroidism. She had chronic renal deficiency related to focal segmental glomerular sclerosis requiring dialysis. The physical examination at admission revealed a fever of 39°C and an acute abdomen with abdominal guarding in the right upper quadrant without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. There were no clinical signs of pre-eclampsia. Fetal ultrasound and a Doppler of the umbilical vessels were normal. Laboratory tests showed normal liver and liver function (total protein 95%, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin normal). The white cell count was 10×10⁹/l (90% neutrophils), with a normal platelet count. Blood, urine and vaginal cultures were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed isolated thickening of the gallbladder wall without cholelithiasis. Empirical antibiotic treatment was begun with intravenous amoxicillin. Six days later, the patient's condition had worsened with increased abdominal pain, persistent fever and liver test abnormalities (AST-ALT 6N). However, bilirubin, hepatic synthesis tests, as well as leucocyte and platelet counts were still normal. A caesarean section followed by coelioscopy was decided. Coelioscopy revealed a liver with numerous necrotic spots (see figure 1).gutjnl;66/11/1911/GUTJNL2016313097F1F1GUTJNL2016313097F1Figure 1Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed a liver surface covered with numerous white necrotic spots.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^112ZKTRB]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Prompt endoscopy is, therefore, not required for most patients with dyspepsia and should be reserved for those with other risk factors, defined above. However, there is variation in age-based gastric cancer risks, which are lower in the majority of Western populations, excluding African-Americans and Latin-Americans, and higher in South-east Asian countries, such as China, Japan and Korea. A reduction in the age threshold is also required in patients with a family history of gastro-oesophageal cancer.

As pancreaticobiliary disease can present with upper gastrointestinal symptoms, this may need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of dyspepsia. However, a previous systematic review demonstrated that gallstones are only associated with abdominal pain with the characteristics of biliary colic, not with symptoms suggestive of dyspepsia. Moreover, response following cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gallstones, in terms of the resolution of abdominal pain, appears to be associated with the presence of episodic pain with a duration of less than 1 year prior to surgery. This suggests that indiscriminate use of abdominal ultrasound in patients with symptoms suggestive of dyspepsia should be avoided, unless the upper abdominal pain has the characteristics of biliary colic, and has been present for less than 1 year. NICE states that imaging should be considered in patients ≥ 60 years old with new onset abdominal pain and weight loss to exclude the possibility of pancreatic cancer.

Observers

After clinical assessment at the ED, all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation to the ED. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the observers: the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To guarantee a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalising the ultrasound part of the case record form.

The CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, so all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist. Contrary to ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours. To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed (< 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, 1.000–5.000, 5.000–10.000 or > 10.000 examinations).

Ultrasound

To standardise the ultrasound examination, a general survey of the abdomen was performed and findings were recorded on a digital case record form. In this case record form, the following general image characteristics and specific radiological features were recorded: image quality, visualisation of the painful quadrant (quadrant of interest), infiltration of mesenteric fat (hyperechoic tissue), free fluid, abscess, free intra-peritoneal air and fistulas. Image characteristics were assessed per organ: gallbladder, bile duct, liver, pancreas, appendix, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, vascular system, kidneys, and if appropriate, the female reproductive system. In the case of abnormalities further specification on the observed abnormality was warranted. All observers recorded an ultrasound diagnosis. Observers assigned their diagnoses based on the imaging findings in combination with the clinical information provided by the treating physician, no specific set of criteria was provided per diagnosis, reflecting daily practice. Ultrasound cases in which the quadrant of interest could not be visualised, were considered examinations with low quality.

Table 1
Guidelines and criteria for uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis

This variation in criteria for surgery was one of the reasons for initiating the SECURE trial, which tested one set of symptom criteria. The study randomized patients with gallstones and abdominal pain between usual care (diagnostics and treatment based on hospital standard care) and a restrictive strategy. In the restrictive arm of the study, cholecystectomy was advised only for patients who had all five prespecified symptoms based on the Rome III criteria and on predictors identified during a previous clinical study: severe pain in attacks, pain in the upper right quadrant or epigastrium, pain lasting 15–30 min or longer, pain radiating to the back, and positive response to simple analgesics. The primary aim of the SECURE trial was to assess the percentage of patients who were pain-free after 1 year of follow-up. The trial demonstrated a 7 per cent higher cholecystectomy rate in the usual-care arm (75 per cent of 537 patients) compared with the restrictive arm (68 per cent of 530 patients) (P = 0.005). Despite more cholecystectomies, the usual-care strategy resulted in more patients who were pain-free after 12 months of follow-up (60 versus 56 per cent respectively; P = 0.316). Rates of gallstone-related complications were similar in the two groups: 8 per cent in the usual-care and 7 per cent in the restrictive arm (P = 0.155). The SECURE trialalso illustrated the limited validity of Rome III criteria regarding the indication for cholecystectomy in patients with cholecystolithiasis; 35 per cent of patients with typical biliary colic (by Rome definition) reported persistent gastrointestinal symptoms after surgery.

Case presentation

A 57-year-old Chinese female patient was admitted with slight right-upper-quadrant pain for 2 months, and she did not recall any episode of severe pain. She had a long history of headache but had not visited any neurologist. She was afebrile, without positive Murphy's sign or any other acute syndrome. Lab tests showed normal complete blood count, coagulation, tumor marker, and liver function results. Specifically, the levels of CA19–9, CA125, and CEA were 21.83 U/mL (normal reference range < 27 U/mL), 9.11 U/mL (normal < 35 U/mL), and 1.28 ng/mL (normal < 5 ng/mL), respectively. Initial ultrasound evaluation indicated hyperechoic structure inside the gallbladder and thickened gallbladder wall (Fig. 1). An enhanced CT scan showed irregular presentations of an enlarged gallbladder (10.0 cm × 4.6 cm × 4.3 cm), with a rough and thickened gallbladder wall and median-density lesions inside the gallbladder (Fig. 2). Notably, there was also a fusion of multiple lesions forming a thick, high-density layer attached to the inner wall. Further MRI showed a high T1-weighted and a low T2-weighted smooth-edged signal on the inner surface (Fig. 3). A flocculent lesion with mixed-density signal was confirmed by MRI. Further gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) contrasted scan showed signal enhancement of the gallbladder wall, and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) analysis demonstrated a significantly high signal with smooth edge inside the gallbladder.

If the patient presents with pain, tenderness to transducer compression should be assessed for the presence of the ultrasound Murphy sign, and the presence of pericholecystic fluid should be assessed. If the operator is uncertain about abnormalities found, a comprehensive right upper quadrant sonogram should be requested.

### Right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Do not forget about ovarian torsion on the computed tomography scan [^112b81r8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most common chief complaints of patients presenting to emergency departments, and emergency physicians (EPs) often evaluate patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Ovarian torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain, but early diagnosis is essential for salvage of the affected ovary. The diagnostic study of choice for ovarian torsion is a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler, but it is important for EPs and radiologists to be aware of findings of ovarian torsion that might appear on computed tomography (CT).

Case Report

We present a case of a young female with right lower quadrant abdominal pain with CT evidence of ovarian torsion that was not recognized; the patient was discharged and then called back when the study was over-read as concerning for ovarian torsion. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? The presence of radiographic findings associated with ovarian torsion on a CT scan should encourage an EP to order a pelvic ultrasound with color Doppler (if available) and obtain an obstetrics/gynecology consult.

### Ultrasonographically detected gallbladder polyps: a reason for concern? A seven-year follow-up study [^115vdcar]. BMC Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Methods

In November and December 1996 we conducted a prospective epidemiological study on the prevalence of alveolar echinococcosis in Römerstein, a rural community in southwestern Germany. As part of this study, the population was also examined for gallbladder polyps. Subjects were informed of the additional examination of the gallbladder at the time of the examination itself in order to minimize bias related to a potentially higher response rate on the part of inhabitants with upper abdominal complaints or disorders of the gallbladder. The present study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics commission of Ulm University.

Ultrasound examinations

All inhabitants aged six years and older were asked to present for examination after a four-hour fasting period. All study participants underwent ultrasound examination of the gallbladder at which gallbladder size in three axes, the gallbladder wall and gallbladder lumen were assessed. In cases of inconclusive findings regarding differentiation between gallbladder stones and gallbladder polyps, patients were examined in standing position.

The initial ultrasound examinations in 1996 were carried out by 8 assistants of the University Hospital of Ulm in 4 cubicles, where examinations were performed simultaneously. All personnel had been trained by the same experienced ultrasound examiner before the study, and this examiner was present in the examination room to provide a second opinion in cases in which the primary examiner could not give a definite diagnosis. The ultrasound examinations in 1999 and 2003 were all performed by the same experienced examiner.

The diagnosis of gallbladder polyps was made on the basis of the following criteria: hyperechoic structures without acoustic shadow that projected from the gallbladder wall into the gallbladder lumen and were either pedunculate or broad based; unequivocal visualization in two planes (longitudinal and in cross-section); no change in position of the wall change secondary to change in subjects' position; unremarkable gallbladder wall; unequivocal differentiation between a gallbladder septum and a gallbladder polyp. The diagnosis of "gallbladder polyp" was made only in cases fulfilling all the above criteria.

Ultrasound examinations were performed using three different types of ultrasound scanners (two units of the type ATL 800 and one ATL 9 HDI, manufactured by ATL Ultrasound Medical Systems, Bothell, WA, USA, each with either a 3.5–5 MHz or 4–7 MHz convex transducer head; and a Siemens Sonoline 400, manufactured by Siemens AG, Erlangen, Germany with a 5 MHz convex transducer head) by trained examiners working under supervision. The number of polyps and the diameter in millimeters of the largest polyp were then documented.

### Acute gallbladder torsion-a continued pre-operative diagnostic dilemma [^1155nYix]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Acute gallbladder volvulus continues to remain a relatively uncommon process, manifesting itself usually during exploration for an acute surgical abdomen with a presumptive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. The pathophysiology is that of mechanical organo-axial torsion along the gallbladder's longitudinal axis involving the cystic duct and cystic artery, and with a pre-requisite of local mesenteric redundancy. The demographic tendency is septua- and octo-genarians of the female sex, and its overall incidence is increasing, this being attributed to increasing life expectancy. We discuss two cases of elderly, fragile women presenting to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Their subsequent evaluation suggested acute cholecystitis. Ultimately both were taken to the operating room where the correct diagnosis of gallbladder torsion was made. Pre-operative diagnosis continues to be a major challenge with only 4 cases reported in the literature diagnosed with pre-operative imaging; the remainder were found intra-operatively. Consequently, a delay in diagnosis can have devastating patient outcomes. Herein we propose a necessary high index of suspicion for gallbladder volvulus in the outlined patient demographic with symptoms and signs mimicking acute cholecystitis.

### Sonography of acute cholecystitis and its mimics [^112EnirK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain is a common complaint. Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the primary diagnostic consideration in most adults presenting with acute onset RUQ abdominal pain; however, a variety of other conditions can mimic AC. Abdominal ultrasound (US) receives the highest score for imaging appropriateness for these patients. This article reviews the sonographic findings of uncomplicated and complicated AC and provides practical technical tips. The radiologist should be familiar with conditions that can mimic AC, be able to suggest these alternative diagnoses when findings are present on US, and recommend additional tests or procedures, if needed.

### What is the role of the cholecystokinin stimulated HIDA scan in evaluating abdominal pain in children? [^111W7egR]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Cholecystokinin stimulated HIDA (CCK-HIDA) has been used to identify patients with biliary dyskinesia and select patients likely to benefit from cholecystectomy. The appropriate use of this study in children remains controversial and this study aims to better understand the utility of this test.

Methods

Children who underwent a CCK-HIDA for evaluation of abdominal pain over a 15-year period were included, after excluding infants and patient's s/p liver transplant. Relevant clinical and outcomes data were abstracted and analyzed.

Results

124 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 14.5 ± 2.6 years, Mean BMI was 27.9 ± 9.9 and 96 (77.4%) presented with right upper quadrant or epigastric pain. The mean ejection fraction (EF) was 58.5 ± 31.8%, with 37 (29.8%) < 35% EF. Using receiver operating curve analysis no specific EF threshold value predictive of resolution of symptoms was identified (AUC 0.510; p = 0.94). Using EF < 35% and > 35% and < 20% and > 20%, no association was noted with partial/complete resolution of symptoms. On multivariate regression analysis neither EF nor pain reproduction with CCK administration were independently associated with resolution of symptoms.

Conclusions

These data suggest that the CCK-HIDA scan is a poor predictor of benefit from cholecystectomy. Prospective large studies would help in identifying better criterion for patient selection, especially with the trend of increasing surgery for functional gallbladder disorders.

### Ursodeoxycholic acid for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease after bariatric surgery: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial (UPGRADE trial) [^114boo4f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary outcome measure

The primary endpoint of this study is symptomatic gallstone disease after 24 months, defined as hospital admission or hospital visit for symptomatic gallstone disease. Hospital visit is a condition, because all patients with noteworthy symptoms will eventually visit the hospital. Mild and self-limiting complaints are not a large burden to the health care system or to the patient, and usually gallstone involvement is not objectified in these patients. Symptomatic gallstone disease is defined as biliary pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or biliary colics. Acute pancreatitis is diagnosed in the presence of two of the three following: upper abdominal pain; serum lipase or amylase levels above 3 times the upper level of normal; characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Pancreatitis is regarded of biliary origin when imaging reveals gallstones, sludge or a dilated common bile duct, or when laboratory investigation reveals an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level > 2 times higher than normal values, with ALT > aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Acute cholecystitis and cholangitis are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the updated Tokyo Guidelines. Acute cholecystitis is diagnosed in the presence of at least one local sign of inflammation (either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count). Choledocholithiasis is defined as the presence of stones in the extrahepatic bile ducts as proven by clinical imaging, or clinical suspicion based on abnormal liver function tests in combination with upper abdominal pain for which an ERCP or PTC was indicated. Cholangitis is diagnosed when there is a sign of systemic inflammation (fever/shaking chills or laboratory evidence of inflammatory response) and either clinical or laboratory evidence of cholestasis (total bilirubin ≥ 34 μmol/L, or increased serum alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, ALT, or AST > 1.5× higher than the upper limit of normal value) or evidence of cholestasis on biliary imaging (biliary dilatation or evidence of the etiology on imaging). Biliary colics are defined as upper abdominal pain (either right upper quadrant or epigastric pain) lasting at least 30 min with gallstones visible on ultrasound, according to the Rome criteria. In case of doubt whether a participant has reached the primary endpoint, endpoint adjudication will be done by an independent blinded committee.

### Epstein-Barr in a patient presenting with right upper quadrant pain: a case report from the emergency department [^116ymMFA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Right upper quadrant abdominal pain and elevated cholestasis blood tests are usually associated with bacterial calculous cholecystitis. However, viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also manifest with a similar clinical picture and is an important differential diagnosis.

Case Report

This case report discusses a young woman presenting to the emergency department with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The initial assessment revealed a positive Murphy's sign, elevated white blood count, and a cholestatic pattern on liver function tests, leading one to suspect bacterial calculous cholecystitis and initiating antibiotic therapy. However, clinical examination also revealed tonsillar exudates and differential white blood cell count revealed monocytosis and lymphocytosis rather than a high neutrophil count. The patient tested positive for EBV. Furthermore, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed gallbladder wall edema with no gallstones, leading one to conclude that the clinical manifestation and laboratory results were due to an EBV infection. Antibiotic therapy was ceased and the patient did not require surgical intervention. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Calculous bacterial cholecystitis usually entails antibiotic therapy and cholecystectomy. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis of EBV, as it usually does not require either of these and resolves spontaneously.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRight upper quadrant pain [^115opEoo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Although right upper quadrant pain is a very common clinical presentation, it can be nonspecific. However, acute cholecystitis is very often the diagnosis of exclusion. This review focuses on the recommended imaging evaluation in the most commonly encountered clinical scenarios presenting with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, including suspected biliary disease, suspected acute cholecystitis, and suspected acalculous cholecystitis. This document hopes to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures that are available and commonly employed in these clinical settings. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

The initial assessment of these patients includes 2 dominant objectives: confirming the diagnosis and establishing its severity. Despite a wide array of options (US, HIDA, CT, MR), the revised Tokyo consensus guidelines represent the best parameters for directing diagnosis and treatment. Based on diagnostic sensitivities of 90% to 95%, abdominal US remains the initial modality of choice. Because it can be performed by the ACS within the emergency department itself, it is also cost saving and rapid. Identification of gallbladder wall thickening (> 5 mm), an obstructing gallstone in the gallbladder neck, pericholecystic fluid, US Murphy's sign and/or dilation and thickening of the common bile duct (CBD) are important signs that contribute to defining the diagnosis. Unfortunately CT imaging is far less specific and frequent in confirming this diagnosis. After confirmation however, the disease should be classified according its severity (grade I = mild, II = moderate, III = severe). While grade II refers to the presence of systemic signs of inflammation, grade III cholecystitis includes dysfunction of at least one organ/system (Table 1).

### Evaluating the patient with right upper quadrant abdominal pain [^115Az56X]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is among the most common complaints in the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes gastrointestinal (GI) and non-GI causes for pain. Evaluation of patients requires a combination of history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging. This article details the anatomy and physiology of the right upper abdomen and approach to the history and physical examination of the most common diseases encountered in the emergency department. "Can't miss", non-GI diagnoses are discussed. Best practices of laboratory and imaging, and treatment of most common diagnoses of RUQ pain are reviewed.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis or cholangitis — subsequent imaging after equivocal ultrasound in non-pregnant adults is addressed as follows: In non-pregnant adults with suspected acute cholecystitis or acute cholangitis, if initial US is equivocal/non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, the panel suggests obtaining an abdominal CT scan as subsequent imaging to diagnose acute cholecystitis or acute cholangitis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). CT with IV contrast is preferable and usually appropriate when CT is obtained for subsequent imaging, and the diagnosis of acute cholangitis should include clinical signs (jaundice, fever, chills, and right upper quadrant [RUQ] abdominal pain), laboratory findings (indicators of inflammation and biliary stasis), and imaging findings (biliary dilatation or evidence of an etiology [eg, stricture, stone, obstructing mass]). The panel did not identify any studies assessing the accuracy of abdominal US or CT for the diagnosis of acute cholangitis and relied on indirect evidence from acute cholecystitis; because acute cholecystitis and acute cholangitis are uncommon in children, evidence in children was not systematically reviewed, and it would be reasonable to mirror the imaging pathway for adults in children.

### Performance of diagnostic guidelines in the evaluation of choledocholithiasis in patients with acute biliary presentation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115kJknF]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In this systematic review, we have identified 6 diagnostic guidelines predicting CBDS in patients with acute biliary presentation. Of these, there is sufficient data in the literature for the meta‐analysis of the original ASGE guidelines in 2010, the revised ASGE guidelines in 2019, and the ESGE guidelines. All three guidelines stratify patients into high, intermediate, or low risk categories for CBDS, and are similar in their management recommendations.

When the guidelines are used to distinguish patients at low risk for CBDS from those at greater than low risk, both iterations of ASGE guidelines have excellent pooled sensitivities of 95%–97% for CBDS, while that of the ESGE guidelines is lower at 84%. The observed difference may reflect the inclusion of patients older than 55 as intermediate risk in both ASGE but not the ESGE guidelines, even though age was found to be a nonspecific and minimally predictive criterion in a meta‐analysis of predictor performance by Wang et al. These high sensitivities can be utilized to advantage clinically, because a low‐risk classification can reliably rule out most CBDS and allow low‐risk individuals to proceed to cholecystectomy without additional investigations. At this diagnostic threshold, all guidelines have poor specificities for CBDS from 7% to 15% only, resulting in many patients classified as at least intermediate risk thus prompting for additional investigations.

### Does this patient have acute cholecystitis? [^111pmgwj]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although few patients with acute abdominal pain will prove to have cholecystitis, ruling in or ruling out acute cholecystitis consumes substantial diagnostic resources.

Objective

To determine if aspects of the history and physical examination or basic laboratory testing clearly identify patients who require diagnostic imaging tests to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

Data Sources

Electronic search of the Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, and English-language articles from January 1966 through November 2000 indexed in MEDLINE. We also hand-searched Index Medicus for 1950–1965, and scanned references in identified articles and bibliographies of prominent textbooks of physical examination, surgery, and gastroenterology. To identify relevant articles appearing since the comprehensive search, we repeated the MEDLINE search in July 2002.

Study Selection

Included studies evaluated the role of the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests in adults with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Studies had to report data from a control group found not to have acute cholecystitis. Acceptable definitions of cholecystitis included surgery, pathologic examination, hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan or right upper quadrant ultrasound, or clinical course consistent with acute cholecystitis and no evidence for an alternate diagnosis. Studies of acalculous cholecystitis were included. Seventeen of 195 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data from the 17 included studies. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus with a third author.

Data Synthesis

No clinical or laboratory finding had a sufficiently high positive likelihood ratio (LR) or low negative LR to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Possible exceptions were the Murphy sign (positive LR, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.8–8.6) and right upper quadrant tenderness (negative LR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–1.1), though the 95% CIs for both included 1.0. Available data on diagnostic confirmation rates at laparotomy and test characteristics of relevant radiological investigations suggest that the diagnostic impression of acute cholecystitis has a positive LR of 25 to 30. Unfortunately, the available literature does not identify the specific combinations of clinical and laboratory findings that presumably account for this diagnostic success.

Conclusions

No single clinical finding or laboratory test carries sufficient weight to establish or exclude cholecystitis without further testing (eg, right upper quadrant ultrasound). Combinations of certain symptoms, signs, and laboratory results likely have more useful LRs, and presumably inform the diagnostic impressions of experienced clinicians. Pending further research characterizing the pretest probabilities associated with different clinical presentations, the evaluation of patients with abdominal pain suggestive of cholecystitis will continue to rely heavily on the clinical gestalt and diagnostic imaging.

### Torsion of the gallbladder: a rare but important differential to consider when treating acute cholecystitis non-operatively [^113NaDMm]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented with postprandial epigastric pain. She had normal vital signs, inflammatory markers and liver function tests. Ultrasound and CT of the abdomen demonstrated features consistent with acute cholecystitis. Her medical comorbidities and extensive abdominal surgical history prompted the decision to treat non-operatively. Despite optimal medical management, worsening abdominal pain and uptrending inflammatory markers developed. She underwent an emergency laparoscopy which revealed a necrotic gallbladder secondary to an anticlockwise complete gallbladder torsion; a rare condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality if managed non-operatively. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was achieved without complication and the patient had an uneventful recovery. Preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder is difficult. However, there are certain patient demographics and imaging characteristics that can help surgeons differentiate it from acute cholecystitis; a condition which can be safely managed non-operatively in selected patients. The differentiating features are elaborated on in this case report.

### Restrictive strategy versus usual care for cholecystectomy in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain (SECURE): a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority trial [^116KhQ8g]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

International guidelines advise laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat symptomatic, uncomplicated gallstones. Usual care regarding cholecystectomy is associated with practice variation and persistent post-cholecystectomy pain in 10–41% of patients. We aimed to compare the non-inferiority of a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection with usual care to assess (in)efficient use of cholecystectomy.

Methods

We did a multicentre, randomised, parallel-arm, non-inferiority study in 24 academic and non-academic hospitals in the Netherlands. We enrolled patients aged 18–95 years with abdominal pain and ultrasound-proven gallstones or sludge. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either usual care in which selection for cholecystectomy was left to the discretion of the surgeon, or a restrictive strategy with stepwise selection for cholecystectomy. For the restrictive strategy, cholecystectomy was advised for patients who fulfilled all five pre-specified criteria of the triage instrument: 1) severe pain attacks, 2) pain lasting 15–30 min or longer, 3) pain located in epigastrium or right upper quadrant, 4) pain radiating to the back, and 5) a positive pain response to simple analgesics. Randomisation was done with an online program, implemented into a web-based application using blocks of variable sizes, and stratified for centre (academic versus non-academic and a high vs low number of patients), sex, and body-mass index. Physicians and patients were masked for study-arm allocation until after completion of the triage instrument. The primary, non-inferiority, patient-reported endpoint was the proportion of patients who were pain-free at 12 months' follow-up, analysed by intention to treat and per protocol. A 5% non-inferiority margin was chosen, based on the estimated clinically relevant difference. Safety analyses were also done in the intention-to treat population. This trial is registered at the Netherlands National Trial Register, number NTR4022.

Findings

Between Feb 5, 2014, and April 25, 2017, we included 1067 patients for analysis: 537 assigned to usual care and 530 to the restrictive strategy. At 12 months' follow-up 298 patients (56%; 95% CI, 52.0–60.4) were pain-free in the restrictive strategy group, compared with 321 patients (60%, 55.6–63.8) in usual care. Non-inferiority was not shown (difference 3.6%; one-sided 95% lower CI -8.6%; p non-inferiority = 0.316). According to a secondary endpoint analysis, the restrictive strategy resulted in significantly fewer cholecystectomies than usual care (358 [68%] of 529 vs 404 [75%] of 536; p = 0.01). There were no between-group differences in trial-related gallstone complications (40 patients [8%] of 529 in usual care vs 38 [7%] of 536 in restrictive strategy; p = 0.16) and surgical complications (74 [21%] of 358 vs 88 [22%] of 404, p = 0.77), or in non-trial-related serious adverse events (27 [5%] of 529 vs 29 [5%] of 526).

Interpretation

Suboptimal pain reduction in patients with gallstones and abdominal pain was noted with both usual care and following a restrictive strategy for selection for cholecystectomy. However, the restrictive strategy was associated with fewer cholecystectomies. The findings should encourage physicians involved in the care of patients with gallstones to rethink cholecystectomy, and to be more careful in advising a surgical approach in patients with gallstones and abdominal symptoms.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^117XAyts]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach (regular text) to sequentially presented clinical information (bold). Additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process (italics) is integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical Information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began having left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

### Biliary hyperkinesia: an indication for cholecystectomy? [^114NcbQY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The main indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy are stone-related diseases in adults. With a normal abdominal ultrasound (US), a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan with ejection fraction (EF) is recommended to evaluate gallbladder function. Biliary dyskinesia or low gallbladder EF (EF < 35%) is a recognized indication for cholecystectomy. Recent articles report long-term resolution of symptoms in children with high EFs on the HIDA scan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of patients with biliary colic and hyperkinetic gallbladder to cholecystectomy. We suggest that laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be a considerable surgical option in a subset of the adult population whose workup for food-related biliary abdominal pain is negative except for the high-value EF on HIDA scan.

Methods

Data were consecutively collected from all patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between June 2012 and June 2019 at a single institution. Cases were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients older than 17 years of age with the negative US (no stone, no sludge, no gallbladder wall thickening) and EF greater than 80% on cholecystokinin (CCK)-HIDA scan were included in this study. All patients were seen at 2 weeks and 10–16 months after surgeries.

Results

Over 7 years from June 2012 until June 2019, of 2116 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 59 patients (2.78%) met study criteria. Postprandial abdominal pain was the most common symptom (43, 72.90%) followed by nausea/vomiting. Forty-seven patients (74.6%) had a reproduction of symptoms with CCK infusion. The average EF was 88.51%. Final pathology showed chronic cholecystitis in 41 (69.5%) patients, cholesterolosis in 13 (22%), polyp in 2 (3.4%). Thirty-six (61%) patients had complete resolution of symptoms, 9 (15%) patients had partial resolution, and 14 (24%) patients had no change. There was a complete resolution rate of 61% and an improvement rate of 76%.

Conclusions

In patients with biliary symptoms, negative ultrasound, and elevated EF on HIDA scan (EF > 80%), laparoscopic cholecystectomy led to a significant rate of symptomatic relief. Interestingly, 94% also had unexpected pathologic findings. This disease process requires further analysis, but this could represent a new indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the adult population.

### Insufficient cholecystectomy diagnosed by endoscopic ultrasonography [^115yYPcn]. Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent attacks of upper right quadrant pain after cholecystectomy are not infrequent. In most of these cases, the cause of the pain remains undiagnosed. Insufficient cholecystectomy has been described as a rare cause of post-cholecystectomy pain, although the true incidence is unknown. It is difficult to diagnose a residual gallbladder or a large cystic duct with residual stones, due to the size of the remaining structures. This report presents three patients who had experienced a long period of agonizing biliary-type pain after cholecystectomy. Abdominal ultrasound examinations, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in one patient, were normal. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated the presence of a small cystic structure with echogenic foci compatible with a residual gallbladder containing small gallstones. Two of the three diagnoses were confirmed by repeat surgery. EUS thus appears to be a valuable method for diagnosing insufficient cholecystectomy, and should be considered in patients with persistent pain attacks after cholecystectomy.

### Long-term follow-up of non-operated patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones: a retrospective study evaluating the role of hepatobiliary scanning [^117BtnYb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most cases of gallstone disease are asymptomatic and incidentally found during routine abdominal ultrasonography. The average risk of developing symptoms in gallstone disease is 2.0–2.6% per year. When symptoms do occur, treatment by cholecystectomy is advised. Thus, the diagnosis of "symptomatic" gallbladder (GB) stones is an essential step in the decision to operate. A symptom of gallstone disease is biliary colic, which is a severe steady pain lasting more than 15–30 min, usually located in the epigastrium and/or right upper quadrant, and sometimes radiating to the back. However, if patients have nonspecific symptoms, such as indigestion, discomfort, fat intolerance, and bloating in the presence of a GB stone, it is difficult to determine if these symptoms are associated with GB disease. Gallstone-associated symptoms may occasionally be vague, and are usually confused with other symptoms of gastrointestinal disease. This may explain why biliary symptoms are not relieved in 6–33% of patients after cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy in such patients is delayed because of the vague nature of symptoms, and a significant portion of these patients do not undergo the procedure even though they have symptoms.

There has been no useful objective modality to differentiate gallstone-related symptoms from other etiologies or to predict symptom recurrence. Hepatobiliary (HB) scanning is a sensitive diagnostic modality for acute cholecystitis, and is also useful for predicting the severity of cholecystitis. However, the associations between HB scan results and gallstone-related symptoms have not been well elucidated. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the role of HB scanning for predicting symptom recurrence in patients with vague symptomatic gallstone disease who have not undergone cholecystectomy.

### Biliary giardiasis in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus [^114Agp8j]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (CD4 count, 446/mm3) developed a protracted course of abdominal pain, weight loss, and increasing liver function tests after undergoing a metronidazole treatment regimen for Giardia enteritis. Three months later, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) showed dilated common and intrahepatic bile ducts and luminal irregularities of the common bile duct. Seven months after the onset of his acute diarrhea, a repeat ERCP with aspiration demonstrated many Giardia trophozoites and cysts in the bile and continued structural abnormalities consistent with cholangiopathy. A 10-day course of high-dose intravenous metronidazole did not resolve these signs or symptoms. A gallbladder ultrasound showed a thickened wall. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy led to resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase over an 8-month period. Gallbladder histopathology revealed chronic cholecystitis, but no parasites were seen on hematoxylin and eosin staining or with Giardia antigen enzyme immunoassay testing of the gallbladder. The patient refused to undergo a follow-up ERCP, but a right upper quadrant ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen were normal.

### ACR appropriateness criteria right upper quadrant pain [^111dW4BF]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute right upper quadrant pain is a common presenting symptom in patients with acute cholecystitis. When acute cholecystitis is suspected in patients with right upper quadrant pain, in most clinical scenarios, the initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound. Although cholescintigraphy has been shown to have slightly higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, ultrasound is preferred as the initial study for a variety of reasons, including greater availability, shorter examination time, lack of ionizing radiation, morphologic evaluation, confirmation of the presence or absence of gallstones, evaluation of bile ducts, and identification or exclusion of alternative diagnoses. CT or MRI may be helpful in equivocal cases and may identify complications of acute cholecystitis. When ultrasound findings are inconclusive, MRI is the preferred imaging test in pregnant patients who present with right upper quadrant pain. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^1112wtpC]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

S6. The CFF recommends that all PwCF who have the cholestatic liver test (Direct Bilirubin, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase) elevation, abdominal pain consistent with a biliary cause, and inconclusive abdominal US should undergo magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to detect hepatolithiasis, choledocholithiasis, biliary strictures, and/or biliary obstruction.

PwCF are at risk for biliary complications, which include the development of symptomatic large-duct biliary strictures, gallbladder disease, and intra/extrahepatic biliary lithiasis leading to obstruction. This can manifest clinically with acute cholangitis in the setting of right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and/or fever and chills. Although abdominal US imaging has excellent diagnostic accuracy for gallbladder pathology, it is less accurate for the detection of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree abnormalities. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography imaging is superior to US for assessment of the biliary tree and has been well-studied in chronic biliary diseases – and in small case series of PwCF. – Therefore, in PwCF who have findings that are concerning for biliary disease without an adequate explanation by US imaging, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography should be obtained to help guide therapeutic decisions.

Monitoring recommendations

M1. The CFF recommends that in PwCF and liver involvement, a liver-specific physical examination be performed at least annually and at each in-person visit to monitor for the progression of disease.

The most common physical exam finding of aCFLD is an enlarged firm liver with or without splenomegaly. Other findings of progressive liver disease, such as ascites, are typically absent until the late stages of aCFLD. A composite score including liver and spleen size on physical exam, in addition to ALT and GGT values had a greater sensitivity and specificity (85% and 82%, respectively) for predicting microscopic liver injury compared to hepatomegaly alone. As such, a more nuanced physical exam of the liver including size (enlarged vs. normal), texture (smooth vs. nodular), and firmness is recommended. Despite low specificity, a liver-specific physical exam is noninvasive, easily repeatable, requires minimal additional time, and no additional cost, thus yielding a favorable cost-to-benefit ratio. We recommend liver-specific physical exam for persons with CFHBI and aCFLD at each in-person visit, at a minimum of once per year.

Abnormal results warrant further testing. If test results do not suggest an alternate diagnosis, then empiric treatment of CVS is recommended.

An 18-year-old woman with a complex past medical history presented with 2 days of vomiting and lower abdominal pain. She had been admitted for the majority of the previous 5 months for recurrent pancreatitis and had undergone a cholecystectomy. Additional symptoms included nausea, anorexia, constipation, and a 40-lb weight loss over 4 months. She appeared uncomfortable, and an examination was remarkable for tachycardia, hypertension, and diffuse abdominal tenderness to light palpation. Her initial laboratory test results revealed mildly elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 68 U/L, alanine aminotransferase 80 U/L) and a normal lipase. She was admitted for pain control and nutritional support. Over the next few days, the lipase increased to 1707 U/L. Despite optimizing her management for acute pancreatitis, the patient's symptoms persisted. Further history gathering and laboratory testing ultimately revealed her diagnosis. Our expert panel reviews her hospital course and elucidates the management of our eventual diagnosis.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults… [^1165DTYU]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

11 or other gynecologic complications, such as salpingitis or a tuboovarian abscess. In patients with epigastric pain, simultaneous amylase and lipase measurements are recommended because an elevated lipase level with a normal amylase level is not likely to be caused by pancreatitis. 13 Liver chemistries are important in patients with right upper quadrant pain. A urinalysis should be obtained in patients with hematuria, dysuria, or flank pain. A urine pregnancy test should be performed in women of childbearing age who have abdominal pain to narrow the differential diagnosis and to determine whether certain imaging studies are appropriate. Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea is recommended for women at risk of sexually transmitted infections. Left upper quadrant pain is caused by a variety of clinical conditions; therefore, imaging recommendations are not clear-cut.

If the patient's history and physical examination suggest esophageal or gastric pathology, endoscopy is recommended. In other patients with left upper quadrant pain, CT is useful because it provides imaging of the pancreas, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and vasculature. In general, CT is highly effective at identifying patients with nonspecific abdominal pain who need urgent intervention. 18 Plain radiography of the abdomen may help diagnose bowel obstruction with multiple dilated loops of the bowel and air-fluid levels, although similar findings may occur with paralytic ileus. Women of childbearing age present a specific challenge when making decisions about diagnostic imaging. Gynecologic causes of abdominal pain are more common in these women, and radiation exposure should be avoided if pregnancy is likely.

Therefore, abdominal or transvaginal ultrasonography is generally recommended for evaluating left lower quadrant pain in women of childbearing age. If urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis is suspected, urinalysis is appropriate. Patients with colic, fever, steatorrhea, or a positive Murphy's sign should receive ultrasonography. The evaluation of right lower quadrant pain is guided by the patient's history. Patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of appendicitis should receive CT and urgent surgical consultation. Normal CT findings should trigger additional urine, colon, or pelvic examination.

### Acute gallbladder torsion: an unexpected intraoperative finding [^1132mxDk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The symptoms of gallbladder torsion are largely non-specific and this makes preoperative diagnosis difficult on the basis of history and physical examinations alone. Patient typically presents with acute onset abdominal pain with or without vomiting. There may be the presence of a tender mobile mass indicating a 'floating gallbladder'. Our patient presented atypically with features of bowel obstruction and a tender mass around the umbilicus. Lau et al proposed triple triads for a clinical diagnosis of gallbladder torsion, which include specific symptoms (short history, abdominal pain and early vomiting), physical signs (abdominal mass, absence of toxaemia and pulse rate-temperature discrepancy) and patient's physical characteristics (thin, elderly and deformed spine). The clinical features may mimic that of acute cholecystitis but low frequency of fever and jaundice, absence of toxaemia and poor response to antibiotic therapy can help differentiate it from cholecystitis.

Laboratory investigations are largely unhelpful. Raised white blood cell count and C-reactive protein are frequent findings especially with the onset of gangrenous cholecystitis. Liver function tests are usually normal in patients with gallbladder torsion. Imaging investigations like ultrasound and Computerised tomography (CT) may complement the diagnosis of gallbladder torsion but are sometime non-specific. Ultrasound scan will normally identify the enlarged gallbladder inferior to its normal anatomical position with a thickened wall and surrounded by free fluid.

Kitagawa H et al provided CT criteria for identifying gallbladder torsion and this include fluid collection between gallbladder and gallbladder fossa of the liver, the presence of horizontal rather than vertical axis of the gallbladder, the presence of a well-enhanced cystic duct located on the right side of the gallbladder and signs of inflammation such as oedema and thickening of the wall. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings include a high signal intensity within the gallbladder wall on T1-weighted images suggesting haemorrhagic infarct and necrosis. The presence of a large anteriorly floating gallbladder away from normal anatomical location with gross wall thickening and without gallstones in an elderly woman with kyphosis can be suggestive of gallbladder torsion.

Case Report Two

An 89-year-old Caucasian female with no significant past medical history presented with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain of approximately 5 hours duration. The pain radiated to the right flank, was crampy with intensities of sharpness, and was precipitated by a large meal. There were no aggravating or relieving factors. Associated phenomena included anorexia and nausea, but no fevers, chills or change in bowel habit. Her past surgical history was significant for an appendectomy.

Focused clinical abdominal examination revealed a soft, mildly distended abdomen tender to palpation in the right hypochondrium; a positive Murphy's sign was present. She was afebrile with stable vital signs; laboratory parameters were within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a distended gallbladder with mild wall thickening (Figure 5). There was no evidence of gallstones or biliary duct dilatation. A sonographic Murphy's sign was positive. A HIDA scan demonstrated non-filling of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction (Figure 6).

After appropriate consent, the patient was taken to the operating room for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with a pre-operative diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. After entering the peritoneal cavity and appropriate establishment of pneumoperitoneum, exploration quickly revealed an obvious necrotic gallbladder in the right upper quadrant. Further investigation noted that the gallbladder was twisted 180 degrees on its small pedicle with a thrombosed cystic artery. Following reduction of the torsion, the gallbladder was resected in the standard laparoscopic fashion. Histology demonstrated congested and ischemic serosa with necrotic mucosa consistent with torsion. Her post-operative course was unremarkable and she was discharged on post-operative day 1.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis (with videos) [^111Dzo9D]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" for acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis serve as a clinical tool for the identification and classification of this condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious gallbladder inflammation, and to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis are composed of local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs of inflammation include Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs of inflammation encompass fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

The diagnosis of definite acute cholecystitis is established if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation. Suspected acute cholecystitis is diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not. If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established.

These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding in the early identification and appropriate management of patients with this condition.

The diagnostic system for acute cholecystitis evaluates three categories of clinical signs: local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Each category has specific options that, when selected, contribute to determining the likelihood of acute cholecystitis.

Here's how inputs are processed:

- **Local signs of inflammation**:

- Murphy's sign
- Right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness

- **Systemic signs of inflammation**:

- Fever
- Elevated C-reactive protein
- Elevated white blood cell count

- **Imaging findings**:

- Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis

The diagnosis hinges on whether certain combinations of these indicators are present. The computation works as follows:

1. **If imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis (F) are confirmed, along with any local sign of inflammation (Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness) and at least one systemic sign of inflammation (fever, elevated C-reactive protein, or elevated white blood cell count), the patient meets the criteria for definite acute cholecystitis.**

2. **If any local sign of inflammation is observed along with any systemic sign and the imaging findings, this reinforces the suspected acute cholecystitis diagnosis. However, since this computation is logically identical to the criteria for definite acute cholecystitis, the system confirms the diagnosis right away.**

3. **If the conditions for definite or suspected acute cholecystitis are not fully met with the provided inputs, the system concludes that the criteria for acute cholecystitis are not satisfied.**

The system functions by evaluating the logical presence of these signs and symptoms, ensuring the assessment is grounded in established medical criteria. This method allows healthcare providers to systematically determine the likelihood of acute cholecystitis, guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic actions.
