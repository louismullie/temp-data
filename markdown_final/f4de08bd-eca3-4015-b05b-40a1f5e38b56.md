## Question

When should you initiate statin therapy in a patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to start statin therapy and is looking for a step-by-step pathway to guide that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework and guideline anchors. Then, I should classify prevention setting into secondary versus primary prevention. Next, I will define who should start statins and at what intensity, and how different societies operationalize risk and targets. After that, I need to cover baseline labs, monitoring, and safety considerations. Then, I will examine management of statin-associated muscle symptoms and how to rechallenge. Finally, I should outline escalation with nonstatin therapies, adherence and shared decision making, and special populations including older adults and diabetes, all while double-checking for internal consistency and correcting any numbering or definitional slips along the way [^1138QxsW] [^1153pqA3] [^117GSdEj] [^115iS1La].

> Let me first confirm the foundation: regardless of pharmacotherapy, intensive lifestyle modification is recommended for all adults to reduce lifetime ASCVD risk, including diet, physical activity, weight management, and smoking cessation, and this should be emphasized before, during, and after any statin decision, as it synergizes with lipid-lowering benefits [^1138QxsW].

> Hold on, I should verify the core triage step because everything downstream depends on it; the first decision is whether this is secondary prevention (clinical ASCVD present) or primary prevention (no prior ASCVD), as recommendations and intensity differ substantially by this classification in the AHA/ACC 2018 and ESC/EAS 2019 frameworks, and I will keep the steps consistent since the draft reasoning had a minor numbering mismatch pointing from Step 1 to Step 3 for secondary prevention; I will standardize that secondary prevention actions immediately follow classification to avoid confusion [^1138QxsW].

> For secondary prevention, I need to ensure we initiate high-intensity statin therapy as early as possible after an ASCVD event or diagnosis, regardless of baseline LDL-C, for example atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg, and if the patient is very high risk or not achieving goals despite maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor according to risk and LDL-C response; if age is over 75 or there are features predisposing to adverse effects, a moderate-intensity approach with close monitoring is reasonable, but benefits still generally outweigh risks in older secondary prevention populations [^115iS1La] [^1138QxsW] [^117GSdEj].

> Now, for primary prevention, I should confirm USPSTF thresholds; adults aged 40–75 years with one or more risk factors (dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or higher should start a statin, and those with 7.5% to less than 10% risk should be considered for statins based on a clinician–patient discussion; importantly, evidence is insufficient to start statins routinely for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older, so decisions there require individualized judgment; wait, I almost conflated this with an acute MI context, but that would be secondary prevention and follows the high-intensity pathway above, so I will keep this strictly to primary prevention thresholds here [^112rA5Hz] [^111KfXap] [^115dRRXQ].

> Let me think about the 2018 AHA/ACC "statin benefit groups" because they operationalize primary prevention differently; high LDL-C of 190 mg/dL or higher at age 20–75 years warrants high-intensity statin irrespective of calculated risk, adults 40–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL should receive at least moderate-intensity statins (often high-intensity if multiple risk factors), and adults 40–75 years without diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL should be treated if 10-year ASCVD risk is 7.5% or greater after a clinician–patient risk discussion; for borderline or intermediate risk, risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) can refine decisions, and I should confirm that CAC zero may allow deferral in selected cases without strong risk enhancers [^1138QxsW].

> Next, I should review diabetes-specific considerations; the Endocrine Society advises statins in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD stages 1–4 or post-transplant irrespective of calculated risk, and in selected type 1 diabetes scenarios such as long disease duration, microvascular complications, CKD, obesity with atherogenic dyslipidemia, or retinopathy, again privileging risk phenotype over calculator estimates; ESC/EAS also recommends statins for high and very high-risk diabetes patients and emphasizes treating elderly high-risk individuals as in younger patients, which I will integrate for those over 75 with high-risk features even though USPSTF labels evidence as insufficient for routine primary prevention decisions in that age group [^111CtrVM] [^117C4aVr] [^1143Mdhd] [^113tTDHW].

> I need to ensure I am precise about intensity and targets because AHA/ACC and ESC/EAS differ slightly; AHA/ACC is intensity based, aiming for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction with high-intensity or ≥ 30% with moderate-intensity statins according to risk category, whereas ESC/EAS is target based and, for very high risk, aims for at least a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline and an absolute LDL-C goal below 55 mg/dL, with structured escalation if targets are not met; keeping both frameworks in mind helps tailor to regional practice and patient context [^1138QxsW] [^117GSdEj].

> Before initiating therapy, wait, let me verify safety baselines; obtain baseline hepatic transaminases to contextualize any future abnormalities, elicit prior muscle symptoms or statin intolerance, and consider baseline CK when muscle concerns exist; routine serial ALT or CK monitoring is not generally necessary absent symptoms, but having a baseline improves attribution if symptoms arise, and older age, renal or hepatic impairment, interacting drugs, or prior intolerance should push toward moderate intensity initially with careful follow-up [^114Be4jV] [^115e7nuf] [^115MujGV] [^114r5oB3].

> I should double-check monitoring cadence; reassess adherence, lifestyle, and lipid response 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose change, then every 3–12 months based on risk and stability, titrating intensity to achieve the expected relative LDL-C reduction or absolute target per the chosen framework; if the LDL-C reduction is suboptimal at follow-up, first confirm adherence and secondary causes, then uptitrate or add nonstatins; observational data suggest that failing to achieve robust LDL-C reduction is associated with higher subsequent CVD risk, which reinforces early verification and therapeutic adjustment, though I should be cautious interpreting nonrandomized estimates [^114r5oB3] [^1138QxsW] [^115fKKmp].

> For statin-associated muscle symptoms, hold on, I should verify the recommended sequence; with severe symptoms, stop immediately and evaluate for rhabdomyolysis; with mild to moderate symptoms, pause the statin to assess causality, then rechallenge with the same or a different statin at a lower dose, up-titrating as tolerated; alternate-day or low-dose long half-life statins can help many previously intolerant patients, and most patients can ultimately tolerate some regimen; meanwhile, the absolute excess risk of early muscle symptoms is small, while the long-term absolute cardiovascular benefit is substantially larger, especially in secondary prevention and higher-risk primary prevention [^113Apwef] [^111Rja8b] [^117ATCuN] [^116NaGWq].

> Next, I will examine nonstatin escalation; in very high-risk secondary prevention or in primary prevention patients who remain above LDL-C thresholds despite maximally tolerated statins, add ezetimibe first, then a PCSK9 inhibitor if goals remain unmet, and in acute coronary syndromes, early addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors is reasonable when targets are not reached on high-intensity statins, recognizing payer and access constraints may limit real-world uptake despite strong outcomes data [^1138QxsW] [^115Da8wV] [^115iS1La].

> But wait, what if the barrier is not selection but implementation; real-world data show underuse of statins and inadequate intensification remain common even among the highest-risk patients, so I need to embed shared decision making, address misperceptions about side effects, and use simple, visual decision aids to align choices with evidence and patient values, which can improve uptake and persistence of appropriate therapy [^112uARWX] [^116Xz77D] [^117HGcEt].

> Finally, I should summarize the clinical flow to ensure nothing was missed; classify prevention setting first, initiate high-intensity statin promptly for secondary prevention, in primary prevention apply USPSTF thresholds or AHA/ACC benefit groups with CAC and risk enhancers for borderline cases, adopt intensity or target frameworks per society guidance, collect baseline safety labs and history, reassess at 4–12 weeks with titration toward expected reduction or targets, manage muscle symptoms with rechallenge strategies, and escalate with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors when indicated, all reinforced by lifestyle modification and shared decision making, noting that the totality of randomized evidence shows clear net benefit for statins in appropriate primary and secondary prevention populations [^1138QxsW] [^1153pqA3] [^117GSdEj] [^114QX3as].

Start a statin when a patient has **clinical ASCVD** [^1138QxsW] or **LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL** [^115e1AQY]. For primary prevention, initiate in **adults 40–75 years with diabetes** [^1138QxsW] or with ≥ 1 CVD risk factor and a **10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10%** [^1153pqA3]. Consider statins at **7.5–10%** risk [^111KfXap] after shared decision-making. In **adults ≥ 76 years** [^115dRRXQ], use individualized assessment due to limited evidence [^111jo1uN]. For acute coronary syndromes, start **high-intensity statins** as early as possible [^115iS1La], regardless of baseline LDL-C [^117T55DC].

---

## Secondary prevention

Statin therapy is strongly recommended for patients with **established ASCVD** [^1138QxsW]; **clinical ASCVD** includes coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease [^115e1AQY]. For **acute coronary syndromes (ACS)**, initiate high-intensity statin therapy as early as possible [^115iS1La], regardless of baseline LDL-C [^117GSdEj].

---

## Primary prevention

Statin therapy is recommended for **primary prevention** [^115HRh7E] based on specific risk factors and calculated cardiovascular risk [^114QX3as].

---

### LDL-C levels

**LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL** [^1138QxsW] warrants statin initiation regardless of other risk factors.

---

### Diabetes mellitus

**Adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes** [^1138QxsW] should initiate statin therapy regardless of calculated cardiovascular risk.

---

### Calculated cardiovascular risk

**Adults aged 40–75 years without diabetes** should initiate statin therapy if they have one or more cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking) [^112rA5Hz] and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% [^1153pqA3]. For **intermediate risk (7.5–10%)** [^111KfXap], consider statin therapy after shared decision-making that incorporates patient preferences and potential benefits [^117DtuU5].

---

## Special populations

---

### Elderly patients

Evidence is insufficient to support routine statin initiation in **adults aged ≥ 76 years** [^115dRRXQ]; decisions should be individualized based on patient preferences, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^1146NCUt].

---

### Patients with hypertriglyceridemia

In hypertriglyceridemia, **triglycerides > 200 mg/dL** [^112Z18YD] warrant statins as first-line therapy [^1178237d] for high-risk patients to reduce cardiovascular risk.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Lipid levels**: Reassess 4–12 weeks [^1138QxsW] after initiation or dose adjustment, then every 3–12 months as needed.
- **Liver enzymes**: Obtain baseline [^114Be4jV] hepatic transaminase levels before initiating statin therapy [^114r5oB3].
- **Muscle symptoms**: Monitor for statin-associated muscle symptoms [^113Apwef] and adjust therapy if necessary [^117ATCuN].

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management. It was accompanied by a risk assessment report on the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
- **Methods**: A panel of experts free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were used for the estimation of ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence concerning the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in persons who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.
- **Recommendation**: The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce the lifetime risk for ASCVD. It introduces several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications (ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors) to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is strongly recommended before deciding on statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator first triages patients into four risk categories. Those at intermediate risk deserve a focused clinician-patient discussion before the initiation of statin therapy.

### Adherence to blood cholesterol treatment guidelines among physicians managing patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^114EAtB1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The ACC/AHA blood cholesterol treatment guidelines recommend statin therapy for all patients after experiencing an acute cardiovascular event. Previous analyses have shown that physicians have been slow to adopt guidelines, and many patients remain untreated or undertreated with statins following a cardiovascular event. However, reasons for this remain unknown. This analysis used electronic medical records and patient chart data from Reliant Medical Group (Worcester, Massachusetts) to evaluate physician adherence to the 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines when treating patients with evidence of acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the reasons for the observed treatment decisions.

Less than 50% of acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients were treated according to the ACC/AHA guidelines. Nearly 42% of patients not treated according to guidelines received a lower statin intensity than recommended. The most common reason cited by 41.8% of physicians for treating with a statin intensity below the recommended intensity was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol stable or at goal, despite ACC/AHA guidelines recommending specific statin intensities rather than specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In conclusion, physician and patient education on the importance of maximizing lipid-lowering therapy in this high-risk patient population should be emphasized.

### Cholesterol, not just cardiovascular risk, is important in deciding who should receive statin treatment [^114NHQMZ]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins, including the most recent ones, fail to make the best use of the evidence from clinical trials. They concentrate on absolute CVD risk as a statin indication and do not consider that a major determinant of therapeutic benefit is the magnitude of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or non-HDL cholesterol reduction achieved. This decrease is proportional to the pretreatment concentration. We set out to apply this knowledge to the calculation of the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNT) and to critically assess how guidelines performed at different degrees of CVD risk across a range of LDL or non-HDL cholesterol concentrations.
- **Methods and results**: The number needed to treat to prevent one event revealed the exclusion from treatment for some individuals with higher cholesterol levels, who may benefit more than others who are needlessly exposed to statins with no realistic prospect of benefit. Furthermore, the abandonment of cholesterol therapeutic goals disadvantaged people with higher levels.
- **Conclusion**: These problems can be overcome by basing the decision to treat on the NNT calculated from both absolute CVD risk and the LDL or non-HDL cholesterol reduction achievable with statin treatment. This need not add an additional layer of complexity for the clinician, because computer programs already used to estimate CVD risk could be easily amended, thus permitting more effective deployment of statins in the population.

### Discontinuation and restarting in patients on statin treatment: prospective open cohort study using a primary care database [^116Ei4jh]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

- **Statin prescribing**: Tables 1 and 2 present descriptive statistics for the primary and secondary groups, respectively. Most patients began treatment using simvastatin (79% and 68% for the primary and secondary prevention groups, respectively), with fewer starting on atorvastatin (16% and 25%, respectively). Most users did not switch statins (81% and 78%); however, of those who did, 52% and 49% changed to atorvastatin, and 28% and 33% to simvastatin. At the time of stopping or leaving the cohort, 72% and 63% were still on simvastatin, and 21% and 28% on atorvastatin. Most restarters resumed on their most recently prescribed statin (78% and 80%), but of the 22% and 20% who changed statins, 42% and 37% switched to atorvastatin, and 29% and 37% to simvastatin. Among patients who restarted, the most common drug was simvastatin (67% and 63%), followed by atorvastatin (22% and 26%).
- **Tables**:

### Uptake of statin guidelines to prevent and treat cardiovascular disease [^116Xz77D]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In December 2013, cholesterol treatment guidelines changed the approach to statin therapy by recommending fixed doses of low-, medium-, or high-intensity statins based on cardiovascular risk. We sought to evaluate the guideline's adoption in a diverse group of practices.
- **Methods**: Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed electronic health record data the year before and two years following the guideline publication in 45 practices across 8 states. We examined associations based on patient, clinician, and practice characteristics and interviewed 24 clinicians and practice leaders to inform findings.
- **Results**: The proportion of patients adherent with all recommendations two years after the guideline only increased from 18.5% to 20.3% (P < .01). There were clinically insignificant increases in statin use across risk strata (1.7% to 3.5%) and small increases in high-intensity statin use (2.6% to 4.6%). Only half of patients with cardiovascular disease (52.9%) were on any statin, not much different from patients at moderate (49.6% to 50.9%) or low (41.6% to 48.7%) risk. Multiple patient factors (risk, use of health care), clinician factors (age), and practice factors (type, rurality) were associated with statin use. Clinicians reported patient resistance to statins but liked having a risk calculator to guide discussions.
- **Conclusion**: Despite general agreement with the benefits of statins, the guideline was poorly implemented. Marginal differences in statin use between the highest and lower risk strata of patients is concerning. Rather than intensifying statin potency and recommending more patients at risk of cardiovascular disease start statin use, other factors may need to be addressed.

### Shared decisions: A qualitative study on clinician and patient perspectives on statin therapy and statin-associated side effects [^117HGcEt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Clinicians and patients agreed that a decision support tool that summarized recent guidelines, was simple and algorithmic, and included resources and visuals to improve communication is needed. A patient stated, "Because if you do see a picture like that, I know me, a lot of times a picture is worth a thousand words".

Another patient mentioned the utility of videos explaining risks and benefits of statin therapy:

"… you know, with all the technology now and everything, in fact, your team could probably come up with something… post a video you can click on, you know, make it required if you're taking, or prescribed statins that it is a requirement that you watch this… that's very inexpensive and that's very easy, everybody's got a smart phone now, they can click on it and watch it for 5 minutes. Five minutes should be plenty, I mean if it is kind of laid out".

Clinicians expressed how a decision aid could facilitate their statin decision-making and adverse effect management. The clinical decision support tool should be simple and in the form of an algorithm or a decision tree that is colorful with few branches, circles, arrows, or boxes to minimize confusion. This decision aid should:

- **Summarize recent guidelines on statin use**: Include statin starting dosages, options for various statins, safety profiles, strategies to manage statin-associated side effects (SASEs) like nonstatin alternatives, ruling out secondary causes of SASEs, and statin titration.
- **Include strategies**: To rechallenge statin intolerant patients.

Clinicians felt the decision aid could significantly assist in their practice.

### Statin eligibility in primary prevention: From a risk-based strategy to a personalized approach based on the predicted benefit [^117PxV5a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Guidelines have recommended statin initiation based on absolute cardiovascular risk. We tested the hypothesis that a strategy based on the predicted cardiovascular benefit, compared with the risk-based approach, modifies statin eligibility and the estimated benefit in a population in primary cardiovascular prevention. The study included 16,008 subjects (48 ± 6 years, 73% men) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 70 to < 190 mg/dL, not on lipid-lowering drugs, who underwent a routine health screening in a single center.

For the risk-based strategy, the criterion for statin eligibility was defined as a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk of ≥ 7.5%. In the benefit-based strategy, subjects were considered for statin according to the predicted absolute cardiovascular risk reduction so that the number of statin candidates would be the same as in the risk-based strategy. The benefit-based strategy would replace 11% of statin candidates allocated in the risk-based approach with younger, lower risk subjects with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Using the benefit-based strategy, 13% of subjects with 5.0% to < 7.5% ASCVD risk would shift from a statin-ineligible to a statin-eligible status, whereas 24% of those with 7.5% to < 10.0% ASCVD risk would become statin ineligible. These effects would transfer the benefit from higher to lower risk subjects. In the entire population, no clinically meaningful change in the benefit would be expected.

### Effect of statin therapy on muscle symptoms: An individual participant data meta-analysis of large-scale, randomised, double-blind trials [^117ATCuN]. Lancet (2022). High credibility.

In these trials, statin therapy caused approximately 11 additional reports of any muscle pain or weakness per 1000 patients during the first year, but showed little excess thereafter (although there was some evidence that a risk persisted beyond the first year for more intensive regimens). This finding contrasts with the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy, which are observed in year 1 but are then twice as high during each subsequent year that treatment continues, as previously reported (9% [99% CI 3–15%] in year 1 vs. 24% [95% CI 21–26%] in years 1 to ≥ 5). Consequently, provided that statin therapy is taken for some years, the absolute reductions in major vascular events will greatly exceed any small excess of muscle symptoms occurring soon after treatment initiation.

For example, for every 1000 people in whom LDL cholesterol is lowered by approximately 1 mmol/L for 5 years (i.e. an effect easily achievable in almost all patients with a moderate-intensity statin), statins might cause 11 (generally mild) episodes of muscle pain or weakness but prevent 50 major vascular events in those with pre-existing vascular disease (secondary prevention) and 25 major vascular events in those without pre-existing vascular disease (primary prevention). Moreover, a high-intensity regimen that can reduce LDL cholesterol by 50% would, on average, produce at least a 2 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in people with an LDL cholesterol of 4 mmol/L or more (e.g. which was the measured concentration in approximately a third of people not taking a statin in the UK Biobank).

### Cardiovascular risk estimation and eligibility for statins in primary prevention comparing different strategies [^117NCuPG]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Recommendations for statin use for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) are based on the estimation of the 10-year CHD risk. It remains unclear which risk algorithm and guidelines should be used in European populations. Using data from a population-based study in Switzerland, we first assessed 10-year CHD risk and eligibility for statins in 5,683 women and men aged 35 to 75 years without cardiovascular disease. This assessment involved comparing recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology, both without and with extrapolation of risk to age 60 years, the International Atherosclerosis Society, and the US Adult Treatment Panel III.
- **Classification of high-risk participants**: The proportions of participants classified as high-risk for CHD were 12.5% (15.4% with extrapolation), 3.0%, and 5.8%, respectively.

- **Eligibility for statins**: Proportions of participants eligible for statins were 9.2% (11.6% with extrapolation), 13.7%, and 16.7%, respectively.

Assuming full compliance with each guideline, the expected relative decreases in CHD deaths in Switzerland over a 10-year period would be 16.4% (17.5% with extrapolation), 18.7%, and 19.3%, respectively. The corresponding numbers needed to treat to prevent one CHD death would be 285 (340 with extrapolation), 380, and 440, respectively. In conclusion, the proportion of subjects classified as high risk for CHD varied over a fivefold range across recommendations. Following the International Atherosclerosis Society and the Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations might prevent more CHD deaths at the cost of higher numbers needed to treat compared with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines [^115MujGV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for statin-induced myopathy, specifically with respect to pretreatment assessment, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend deciding on the choice of the appropriate statin and dose based on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD risk, and potential for adverse effects to maximize the safety of statins. Offer moderate-intensity statin therapy to patients otherwise requiring high-intensity statin therapy if they possess characteristics predisposing them to statin-associated adverse effects. Recognize that characteristics predisposing patients to statin adverse effects include, but are not limited to:

- **Multiple or serious comorbidities**: Including impaired renal or hepatic function
- **History of previous statin intolerance or muscle disorders**
- **Unexplained ALT elevations**: ≥ 3 times the ULN
- **Patient characteristics or concomitant use of drugs affecting statin metabolism**
- **Age**: > 75 years

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^113uc8xV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Lipid lowering with statin therapy has been the cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of ASCVD over the past three decades. High-intensity statins can reduce LDL-C levels by ≥ 50%, which has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of major ASCVD events. The magnitude of LDL-C lowering is directly related to efficacy; however, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and data from JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) confirm wide variation in the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved among individuals treated with statins.

In terms of safety, statins are generally well tolerated, but statin-associated adverse effects occur in some patients. The most frequent are statin-associated muscle symptoms, reported to affect between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 10,000 people treated with standard doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms, or the fear of such symptoms, are key factors leading to statin discontinuation or nonadherence, which remain challenging in clinical practice and contribute to adverse ASCVD outcomes. Statins can also cause adverse effects on glucose homeostasis and modestly increase the risk of new-onset diabetes in individuals with predisposing risk factors, including those with prediabetes. This does not detract from recommendations to use statins in this population, given the associated reduction in ASCVD risk.

### The benefits of statin therapy — what questions remain [^114mdTm9]. Clinical cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Early hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) trials provided the first evidence of the benefits of statin therapy in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Outcomes data from more recent trials involving atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin have expanded the patient population shown to benefit from statin therapy. Studies are evaluating the benefits of lowering lipid levels with statins to levels below established goals, as well as examining benefits in special patient populations and evaluating the value of surrogate markers of CHD. Early trials provided a solid foundation of knowledge on the efficacy and safety of statins. Recent and ongoing trials generate new data to resolve remaining questions in the fields of CHD prevention and lipidology.

### Adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with atherosclerotic disease [^111uxg9M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In a sample of 126,419 privately insured patients with a history of ASCVD and on statin therapy, less than 1% of patients were started on a PCSK9 inhibitor in the four years following the introduction of the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agents in this therapeutic class. Over this time period, the proportion of potentially eligible patients with ASCVD on statin therapy who were initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor modestly increased. Before 2018, the proportion of these patients started on a PCSK9 inhibitor was approximately 1% and, from 2018 through mid-2019, the proportion of patients started on PCSK9 inhibitor therapy rose to approximately 2%. This was despite clinical trials showing improvement in cardiovascular outcomes, guidelines recommending PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with ASCVD at high cardiovascular risk, and price reductions in these drugs over this time period.

The low use of PCSK9 inhibitors among patients with ASCVD was not substantially different among the various patient groups with ASCVD identified over the study period. The most inclusive group (i.e. patients with ASCVD on a statin) and the most stringent group (i.e. patients with ASCVD who were highly adherent to a high-intensity statin for a year with suboptimal LDL-C levels) both had less than 1% PCSK9 inhibitor initiation. Additionally, we found that after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical characteristics, patients with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the past year were less likely to be initiated on a PCSK9 inhibitor, suggesting the highest-risk patients may not be receiving PCSK9 inhibitor therapy.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). High credibility.

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD, is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011), and in light of new data, an update of this review is required.
- **Objectives**: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.
- **Search methods**: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4, 2011), and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.
- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with a minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and other related metrics).

### Statin-associated muscle symptoms: Impact on statin therapy-European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel Statement on assessment, aetiology and management [^111Rja8b]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Therapy for patients with statin-associated muscle symptoms can be challenging.

- **Statin-based therapies**: If symptoms or CK abnormalities resolve after discontinuing the statin, consider either treatment with the same statin at a lower dose or switching to an alternative statin. If tolerated, doses can be up-titrated to achieve the LDL-C goal or as much LDL-C reduction as possible with minimal muscle complaints. If these strategies are not tolerated, alternate day or twice-weekly dosing can be considered to achieve the LDL-C goal. Despite methodological limitations such as small size, retrospective nature, open label, or non-randomized design, studies have shown that either alternate day or twice-weekly dosing strategies can reduce LDL-C by 12–38% and are tolerated by approximately 70% of previously intolerant patients. Generally, lower doses of a high-intensity statin with a long half-life (such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin) are more appropriate.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology published the first expert consensus decision pathway (ECDP) on the role of non-statin therapies for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Since the publication of that document, additional evidence and perspectives have emerged from randomized clinical trials and other sources, particularly considering the longer-term efficacy and safety of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in secondary prevention of ASCVD. Most notably, the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) trial, and SPIRE-1 and -2 (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction of Vascular Events), assessing evolocumab and bococizumab, respectively, have published final results of cardiovascular outcomes trials in patients with clinical ASCVD and in a smaller number of high-risk primary prevention patients. In addition, further evidence on the types of patients most likely to benefit from the use of ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy after acute coronary syndrome has been published. Based on results from these important analyses, the ECDP writing committee judged that it would be desirable to provide a focused update to help guide clinicians more clearly on decision making regarding the use of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in patients with clinical ASCVD with or without comorbidities.

### Individualized statin benefit for determining statin eligibility in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^116sv9By]. Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease on the basis of predicted cardiovascular risk without directly considering the expected benefits of statin therapy based on the available randomized, controlled trial evidence.

- **Methods and results**: We included 2,134 participants representing 71.8 million American residents potentially eligible for statins in primary prevention from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the years 2005 to 2010. We compared statin eligibilities using two separate approaches: a 10-year risk-based approach (≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) and an individualized benefit approach (i.e. based on predicted absolute risk reduction over 10 years [ARR10] ≥ 2.3% from randomized, controlled trial data). A risk-based approach led to the eligibility of 15.0 million (95% confidence interval, 12.7–17.3 million) Americans, whereas a benefit-based approach identified 24.6 million (95% confidence interval, 21.0–28.1 million). The corresponding numbers needed to treat over 10 years were 21 (range, 9–44) and 25 (range, 9–44). The benefit-based approach identified 9.5 million lower-risk (< 7.5% 10-year risk) Americans not currently eligible for statin treatment who had the same or greater expected benefit from statins (≥ 2.3% ARR10) compared with higher-risk individuals. This lower-risk/acceptable-benefit group includes younger individuals (mean age, 55.2 versus 62.5 years; P < 0.001 for benefit-based versus risk-based) with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (140 versus 133 mg/dL; P = 0.01).

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^1162HYKj]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

To assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in patients after initiation of statins and the future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a prospective cohort study was conducted. The study involved 165,411 primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink who were free of CVD before statin initiation. Each participant had at least one pre-treatment LDL-C measurement within 12 months before and one post-treatment LDL-C measurement within 24 months after statin initiation. According to national guidelines, a less than 40% reduction in baseline LDL-C within 24 months was classified as a sub-optimal statin response. Cox proportional regression and competing-risks survival regression models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and sub-HRs for incident CVD outcomes related to LDL-C response to statins.

In the results, 84,609 patients (51.2%) exhibited a sub-optimal LDL-C response to initiated statin therapy within 24 months. Over 1,077,299 person-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 6.2 years, there were 22,798 CVD events (12,142 in sub-optimal responders and 10,656 in optimal responders). Among sub-optimal responders, as compared to optimal responders, the HR for incident CVD was 1.17 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.20) and 1.22 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.25) after adjusting for age and baseline untreated LDL-C. Considering competing risks resulted in slightly lower but similar sub-HRs for both unadjusted (1.13, 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.16) and adjusted (1.19, 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.23) cumulative incidence functions of CVD.

The study concludes that optimal lowering of LDL-C is not achieved within two years in over half of the patients in the general population who initiate statin therapy.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111LRNyB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL-C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline-recommended LDL-C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of over 600,000 US patients with established ASCVD. During the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid-lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL-C goals. A retrospective cohort study of approximately 1.5 million patients with a history of at least one major ASCVD event reported that over 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high-risk criteria had LDL-C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2-year period, two-thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dL and only 17% received tr.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro/con debate [^113tJw6v]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The other 'big' safety issue is the increased rate of diabetes by an absolute risk of 0.5% (95% CI 0.1–1%, P = 0.012). However, outcomes for those who progressed from an HbA1c below to above the diagnostic threshold to define new onset diabetes were the same as those not developing new onset diabetes in the trials. We know that patients with established diabetes experience even greater risk reductions from statins in placebo-controlled trials. This is not a reason to be concerned over statins in 'eligible for treatment' populations.

We are unlikely to quantify adverse events much further; there is inevitable subjective weighting and interpretation of the data. This will always attract those who want to argue from one or another standpoint, and there is probably too much sediment to ever clear now.

### Heterogeneity in statin indications within the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [^114DriJC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

A standard ("core") implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 lipid guidelines, based on 10-year risk, dramatically increases the statin-eligible population in older Americans, raising controversy in the cardiovascular community. The guidelines also endorse a more "comprehensive" risk approach based in part on lifetime risk, though the impact of this broader approach on statin eligibility remains unclear. We studied the impact of two different implementations of the new guidelines ("core" and "comprehensive") using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The "core" guidelines led to 72.0 million subjects qualifying for statin therapy. In contrast, the broader "comprehensive" application resulted in nearly a twofold greater estimate for statin-eligible subjects (121.2 million), with the greatest impact among those aged 21 to 45 years. Subjects indicated for statin therapy under comprehensive guidelines had a greater burden of cardiovascular risk factors and a higher lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease than those not indicated for statins. Men aged 21 to 45 years had a 3.13-fold increased odds of being eligible for statin therapy only under the "comprehensive" guidelines versus standard "core" guidelines (95% confidence interval 2.82 to 3.47, p < 0.0001). There were no racial differences. In conclusion, the "comprehensive" approach to statin eligibility espoused by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 guidelines would increase the statin-eligible population to over 120 million Americans, particularly among younger adults.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115HRh7E]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and death in the US and is responsible for more than one in every four deaths. Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death, accounting for 43% of deaths attributable to CVD in the US. In 2019, an estimated 558,000 deaths were caused by coronary heart disease, and 109,000 deaths were due to ischemic stroke.

The objective of this update is to revise the 2016 recommendation. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a review of evidence regarding the benefits and potential harms of statins in reducing CVD-related morbidity, mortality, and all-cause mortality.

The target population includes adults aged 40 years or older without a history of known CVD and who do not exhibit signs and symptoms of CVD.
- **Evidence assessment**: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that statin use for preventing CVD events and all-cause mortality in adults aged 40 to 75 years, with no history of CVD but possessing one or more CVD risk factors (such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater, has at least a moderate net benefit. For those with an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 7.5% to less than 10%, statin use has at least a small net benefit. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of statin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in individuals without CVD history but with lower estimated risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for statin-induced myopathy, particularly concerning treatment modifications, the ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend managing muscle symptoms such as pain, tenderness, stiffness, cramping, weakness, or fatigue in statin-treated patients according to the following management strategy:

- **Severe symptoms**: Discontinue statins promptly in patients developing unexplained severe muscle symptoms or fatigue, and obtain an evaluation for rhabdomyolysis.

- **Resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms**: Discontinue statins until the symptoms can be evaluated in patients developing mild-to-moderate muscle symptoms. Resume the original or a lower dose of the same statin, if not contraindicated, to establish a causal relationship between muscle symptoms and statin therapy if mild-to-moderate symptoms resolve after statin discontinuation. Discontinue the original statin if a causal relationship exists, and switch to a low dose of a different statin once muscle symptoms resolve. Increase the dose gradually as tolerated once low-dose statin is tolerated.

- **Non-resolving mild-to-moderate symptoms**: Consider evaluating for other causes of muscle symptoms if they or elevated CK levels do not resolve completely after two months without statin treatment.

- **Non-statin causes**: Resume statin therapy at the original dose if persistent muscle symptoms are determined to arise from a condition unrelated to statin therapy or if the predisposing condition has been treated.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^115fKKmp]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

To assess low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response in patients after initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), a prospective cohort study was conducted. The study involved 165,411 primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. These patients were free of CVD before starting statins and had at least one pre-treatment LDL-C measurement within 12 months before, and one post-treatment LDL-C measurement within 24 months after, statin initiation. According to national guidelines, a reduction of less than 40% in baseline LDL-C within 24 months was classified as a sub-optimal statin response. Cox proportional regression and competing-risks survival regression models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and sub-HRs for incident CVD outcomes in relation to LDL-C response to statins.

The results demonstrated that 84,609 (51.2%) patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response to statin therapy within 24 months. During 1,077,299 person-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 6.2 years, there were 22,798 CVD events, 12,142 occurring in sub-optimal responders and 10,656 in optimal responders. In sub-optimal responders, compared with optimal responders, the HR for incident CVD was 1.17 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.20) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.25) after adjustments for age and baseline untreated LDL-C. Considering competing risks resulted in lower but similar sub-HRs for both unadjusted (1.13, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.16) and adjusted (1.19, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.23) cumulative incidence function of CVD.

In conclusion, optimal lowering of LDL-C is not achieved within two years in over half of the patients in the general population.

### Present status of statin therapy [^113CCdo8]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk. This combination is potentially an ideal risk-reducing strategy, especially when complemented by lifestyle changes. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention, where the absolute risk reduction is much less, are more complex. These decisions involve considering both LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, the combination of intense exercise and statin therapy further reduces mortality risk, making it an ideal risk-reducing approach.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. Long-term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following a catastrophic event, such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid-lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.
- **Pharmacological management**: Guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events. However, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis, including coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography, a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high-risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL-C lowering is therefore critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization.

This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Prior to the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines, often referred to as the "2013 guidelines", LDL‐C goals were set at < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for those with two or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for individuals with known CVD or a risk factor equivalent. The guidelines were revised in 2013, moving away from a "treating to goal" approach concerning LDL‐C and instead focusing on treating with the most suitable statin intensity based on the patient's risk.

The four statin benefit groups identified in the guidelines are:

- **Patients with clinical ASCVD**.

- **Adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL)**.

- **Patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL)**.

- **Patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention)**.

With some exceptions regarding age and risk, high‐intensity statin therapy is generally recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is advised for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For individuals in statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate the 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine the appropriate course of action. Additionally, the 2013 guidelines no longer suggest monitoring LDL‐C to assess the achievement of specific LDL‐C targets.

### Initiation patterns of statins in the 2 years after release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline in a large US health plan [^111P7FJK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol management guideline suggests several significant changes to the former treatment paradigm for lipid therapy. One of the most controversial aspects of the guideline is the movement away from a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target attainment approach to a statin initiation strategy. This strategy selects statin intensity based on clinical trial evidence of reduction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by use of statins in specific populations. The ACC/AHA guideline recommendations result from an analysis of pooled evidence from randomized clinical trials.

The guideline recommends evaluating a patient's future risk for ASCVD events. For those individuals in whom the benefit of statin treatment was likely to be greater than the risk of adverse events, statin therapy was recommended. With this approach, individuals should be placed on the evidence-based, preferred intensity of statin, with adjustments made, if necessary, to accommodate any tolerability issues. Monitoring LDL-C levels would then be performed to assess the appropriate response to a specific intensity of statin therapy and adherence to therapy. In following this evidence-based approach, the recommendation for many of these patients is a high-intensity statin. (Figure 1, references removed.)

### Effect of individualizing starting doses of a statin according to baseline LDL-cholesterol levels on achieving cholesterol targets: The achieve cholesterol targets fast with atorvastatin stratified titration (ACTFAST) study [^115UtQ6Q]. Atherosclerosis (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate whether selecting the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-cholesterol levels was effective in achieving cholesterol targets. Participants with LDL-C levels between 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and ≤ 5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/day) based on their LDL-C levels and statin use status at baseline. If required, a single uptitration was administered at six weeks. There was no washout period for subjects who switched treatments (ST). By the study's end, 80% of the subjects who followed the fixed-dose strategy (SF) (82%, 82%, 83%, and 72% with 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively) and 59% of the ST group (60%, 61%, and 51% with 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively) reached their LDL-C target. The ST group experienced an additional 21–41% reduction in LDL-C compared to baseline statins. Atorvastatin was well tolerated throughout the study.

The conclusion of the study confirms that individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C values allows a large majority of high-risk subjects to safely achieve their target cholesterol levels within 12 weeks, with either the initial dose or a single titration.

### Guideline-based statin eligibility, coronary artery calcification, and cardiovascular events [^112hL4er]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for cholesterol management defined new eligibility criteria for statin therapy. However, it is unclear whether this approach improves the identification of adults at higher risk of cardiovascular events.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the ACC/AHA guidelines enhance the identification of individuals who develop incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or have coronary artery calcification (CAC) compared with the National Cholesterol Education Program's 2004 Updated Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) guidelines.

This longitudinal community-based cohort study involved participants drawn from the offspring and third-generation cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study. Participants underwent multidetector computed tomography for CAC between 2002 and 2005 and were followed up for a median of 9.4 years for incident CVD.

Statin eligibility was determined based on Framingham risk factors and low-density lipoprotein thresholds for ATP III, whereas the pooled cohort calculator was used for ACC/AHA.
- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was incident CVD (myocardial infarction, death due to coronary heart disease [CHD], or ischemic stroke). Secondary outcomes were CHD and CAC (as measured by the Agatston score).

Among 2435 statin-naive participants (mean age, 51.3 [SD, 8.6] years; 56% female), 39% (941/2435) were statin eligible.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, the CCS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of statin therapy usually between 8–10 years of age. This is advised if LDL-C remains ≥ 4.9 mmol/L or ≥ 4.1 mmol/L with a family history of premature ASCVD or other cardiovascular risk factors or risk conditions.

### A point-by-point response to recent arguments against the use of statins in primary prevention: This statement is endorsed by the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^112yqeQY]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, a debate over the merits of statin therapy in primary prevention was published in the Wall Street Journal. The statin opponent claimed that statins should only be used in secondary prevention and never in any primary-prevention patients at risk for cardiovascular events. In this evidence-based rebuttal to those claims, we review the evidence supporting the efficacy of statin therapy in primary prevention.

Cardiovascular risk is a continuum in which those at an elevated risk of events stand to benefit from early initiation of therapy. Statins should not be reserved until following a patient suffers the catastrophic consequences of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the assertions of the statin opponent, this principle has been demonstrated through reductions in heart attacks, strokes, and mortality in numerous randomized controlled primary-prevention statin trials.

Furthermore, data show that once a patient tolerates the initial treatment period, the few side effects that subsequently emerge are largely reversible. Accordingly, every major guidelines committee endorses statin use in secondary prevention and selectively in primary prevention for those with risk factors.

The foundation for prevention remains increased physical activity, better dietary habits, and smoking cessation. However, prevention of heart attacks, strokes, and death from cardiovascular disease does not have to be all or none — all statin or all lifestyle. In selected at-risk individuals, the combination of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes is more effective than either alone.

### Safety and efficacy of statin therapy [^116NaGWq]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

The 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on blood cholesterol management marked a significant shift in delineating the primary patient groups benefiting from statin therapy, emphasizing higher-intensity statin treatments. In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended incorporating nonstatin therapies, such as ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy for individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above specific thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, concerns about their long-term safety have arisen.

Potential adverse effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been recognized for some time, yet new concerns include the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment, and hemorrhagic stroke associated with statin use, as well as the risks involved in achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. Heightened media attention on adverse events linked to statins has unfortunately led to discontinuation of statin therapy, nonadherence, or reluctance to initiate statin treatment.

This review explores the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence, providing reassurance to clinicians about statin safety. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^114r5oB3]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the best approach to monitor lipid profiles in patients before and during treatment. Generally, lipids should be assessed at least twice before starting drug therapy and then repeated 8–12 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment. For individuals being treated for secondary prevention of ASCVD or higher risk primary prevention with LDL-C below treatment intensification thresholds, monitoring annually is reasonable. For low-risk primary ASCVD prevention individuals with LDL-C levels below treatment intensification thresholds, less frequent monitoring (i.e. every 5 years) may be appropriate.
- **Laboratory assessment of patients with dyslipidemias**: For biochemical monitoring for adverse effects of statins, we advocate that ALT and creatine kinase (CK) should be measured before starting treatment to obtain a baseline as a point of reference should future concerns arise; however, routine monitoring is generally unnecessary. Several studies have concluded that the rates of statin-induced elevations of aminotransferase levels are rare and may not be significantly different than in the general population. Statins are not contraindicated in individuals with mild baseline elevation in transaminases (< 3× upper limit of normal [ULN]) or in those with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and these individuals do not seem to be at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Statins are, however, contraindicated in those with decompensated cirrhosis or acute liver failure.

### Utility of nontraditional risk markers in individuals ineligible for statin therapy according to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines [^116CUPxf]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

In the general population, the majority of cardiovascular events occur in people at the low to moderate end of population risk distribution. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends consideration of statin therapy for adults with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 7.5% based on traditional risk factors. Whether the use of nontraditional risk markers can improve risk assessment in those below this threshold for statin therapy is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a population sample free of clinical CVD at baseline, we calibrated the Pooled Cohort Equations (cPCE). ASCVD was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. Adults with an initial cPCE < 7.5% and elevated levels of additional risk markers (abnormal test) whose new calculated risk was ≥ 7.5% were considered statin eligible. These criteria included low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 160 mg/dL; family history of ASCVD; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/dL; coronary artery calcium score ≥ 300 Agatston units or ≥ 75th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity; and ankle-brachial index < 0.9. We compared the absolute and relative ASCVD risks among those with versus without elevated posttest estimated risk. We calculated the number needed to screen to identify 1 person with an abnormal test for each risk marker, defined as the number of participants with baseline cPCE risk < 7.5% divided by the number with an elevated risk marker.

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1135PJdz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. National guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol who are at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. The lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has led some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease.

Upon review of the literature, we conclude that data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over both the short and long term, and there is a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Primary prevention statins in older adults: Personalized care for a heterogeneous population [^115ijWzk]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Low credibility.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of cholesterol acknowledge a lack of robust randomized clinical trial data to support routine use of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults older than 75 years. Shared decision making is emphasized because potential recommendations should reflect limitations of the data, as well as heterogeneity of the older adult population, spanning the robust to the most frail. Although the National Institute on Aging recently funded PRagmatic EValuation of EvENTs And Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in OldEr Adults (PREVENTABLE), a trial to study benefits of statins in very old adults, data are not anticipated for 5 years. Thus, interim guidance is essential. Furthermore, even when PREVENTABLE is completed, individual idiosyncrasies among older adults suggest that decisions for each patient will still need to be personalized, relative to their unique clinical situation. In this article, we present three case studies to highlight dynamics that commonly impact choices regarding statins in older adults. Details underlying shared decision making are also described, including the evolving application of coronary artery calcium to inform this practice.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^113puV6h]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

- **Bottom line**: When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in aging populations.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^117T55DC]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **European perspectives**: In patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the guidelines recommend starting high-intensity statin or the maximum tolerated dose as early as possible and regardless of initial LDL-C values, to reach the goals for the very high-risk group of a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline and a goal of < 55 mg/dL (class I, level A). Lipid levels should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after ACS to determine whether a reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL have been achieved.

	- If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is not achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended (class I, level B). If the goal of < 55 mg/dL is still not achieved on a maximum tolerated dose of a statin and ezetimibe after 4 to 6 weeks, a combination with a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (class I, level A). For patients who present with an ACS and whose LDL-C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (including prior to discharge) should be considered (class II, level C).

### A long-term benefit approach vs standard risk-based approaches for statin eligibility in primary prevention [^1175ya2m]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

A 10-year benefit-based approach to statin therapy in primary prevention includes younger individuals with higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevents more cardiovascular events than a risk-based approach. However, a 10-year treatment duration likely underestimates the expected benefits of statins.

- **Objective**: To model the impact of a 30-year benefit approach to select individuals for statin therapy.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) data set included samples of the U.S. population from the 2009–2010, 2011–2012, and 2013–2014 data collection cycles. Individuals between 40 to 60 years old who did not have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or LDL-C levels greater than 190 mg/dL and who were not taking statins were included. Data analysis took place from November 2017 to August 2018.

- **Exposures**: We calculated the 10-year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 10-year and 30-year absolute risk reduction (10-year ARR and 30-year ARR) of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for each individual.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Number of individuals meeting eligibility for statins based on 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, 10-year ARR, or 30-year ARR.

- **Results**: A total of 1688 individuals were included, representing 56.6 million U.S. individuals. Statin eligibility based on 7.5% CVR10 was 9.5%; based on 2.3% 10-year ARR, 13.0%; and based on 15% 30-year ARR, 17.5%.

### Sub-optimal cholesterol response to initiation of statins and future risk of cardiovascular disease [^1127upoK]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical implications**: Statins rank among the most commonly prescribed drug classes. Recent revisions of clinical guidelines for CVD risk reduction have significantly expanded the population of patients deemed eligible for statin therapy. As the high levels of statin prescribing in the UK are similar to those in the United States and many other countries, the findings should translate well, particularly to other similar western populations. There was a substantial duration of follow-up for outcomes. A wide range of potential confounders were also evaluated and adjusted for in the analyses.

Based on evidence from clinical trial settings, the response of patients to statins varies widely, with reductions in LDL-C values following the administration of statins ranging from 5–70%. In our study using a large general population reflecting routine practice, over half of the patients had a sub-optimal LDL-C response.

Currently, there is no management strategy in clinical practice which takes into account patient variations in LDL-C response, and no guidelines for predictive screening before commencement of statin therapy. Validated clinical decision tools that can predict cholesterol response to statins, or to non-statin drugs, with interventions to help clinicians tailor and optimise statin treatments for individual patients are needed.

### Is statin-modified reduction in lipids the most important preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease? A pro/con debate [^114tREGm]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Statins, the most prescribed medications worldwide, act as lipid modifiers and have been available for over 25 years. Among all drug classes, they are among the most investigated, with over a million patient-years of trial data and publications in prestigious medical journals. Remarkably, significant debate persists about their role in healthcare. This is due to vocal concerns over their potential risks, including links to suicide and cancer, and allegations that they are ineffective in women or the elderly. Furthermore, there are assertions that the entire published dataset, involving over 200,000 consenting trial participants, is compromised due to predominantly industry-funded studies. Conversely, billions of dollars have been invested in generating an evidence base for statins. This investment has been followed by promotional activities that have generated substantial profits, supported by a powerful scientific lobby advocating their benefits as wonder drugs. This lobby warns that continued skepticism about their value risks patient lives. So, who is right?

### Earlier intervention in the management of hypercholesterolemia: What are we waiting for [^115YnKKk]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The thesis advanced here is that we are initiating treatment of hypercholesterolemia (and other risk factors) too late in life. Initiating treatment at, for example, age 30 years instead of age 60 years might very well prevent not just 30% of events, as in the 5-year statin trials, but perhaps as many as 60%.
