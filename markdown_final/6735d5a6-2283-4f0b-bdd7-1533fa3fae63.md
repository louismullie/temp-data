## Question

A patient on warfarin presents with an INR of 10 and no bleeding. How would you manage this patient?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient on warfarin with an INR of 10 and no bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the INR and excluding spurious causes. Then, I should assess bleeding risk and thrombotic risk to frame urgency. Next, I will decide on immediate actions, including whether to give vitamin K and what dose and route. After that, I need to plan monitoring and follow-up. Finally, I should address root causes, consider switching anticoagulation, and outline special situations and documentation needs, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and available evidence [^112kAsVR] [^111B2dYR] [^116fSqcC].

> Let me first confirm the INR and exclude preanalytic error, because a sudden INR of 10 in a previously stable patient raises suspicion for a spurious result; I should repeat the INR using a fresh sample with proper fill volume and correct citrate concentration, and I should verify any recent changes in diet, supplements, alcohol, or interacting drugs before committing to reversal decisions [^116qsgmB] [^112rg8jE].

> Next, I should review bleeding risk and thrombotic risk to calibrate urgency; an INR of 10 confers a substantial short-term bleeding risk, and although the exact 30-day major bleeding risk at INR > 10 is not precisely quantified, cohort data show that INR > 5 carries a nontrivial risk and that risk rises with higher INR, so I need to act promptly while balancing thrombotic risk from the underlying indication such as atrial fibrillation or mechanical valve [^116VKuhs] [^1174t4EA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about vitamin K; I initially thought to give 2.5–5 mg oral vitamin K right away because INR > 10 is high risk, but wait, let me verify guideline nuances and evidence quality before deciding on the dose and route [^112kAsVR] [^111B2dYR].

> I will now examine guideline direction: CHEST suggests oral vitamin K for INR > 10 without bleeding, but the grade is weak and the balance of benefits and harms is uncertain, and a large retrospective cohort found no reduction in bleeding or thromboembolism with vitamin K and even a signal toward higher mortality, so I should be cautious and individualize the decision rather than reflexively administering vitamin K to every nonbleeding patient with INR > 10 [^112kAsVR] [^111B2dYR] [^111kHxkR].

> Let me consider the immediate, low-risk action: hold warfarin now, because interruption alone will lower the INR over the next 2–3 days, and this avoids the potential downsides of vitamin K such as transient warfarin resistance and rebound phenomena; I should confirm that the patient has no imminent procedures or high bleeding risk features that would push me toward active reversal [^1138gnTN] [^1168hT6z].

> But wait, what if the patient is at very high bleeding risk or needs faster INR correction; in that case, I should reconsider and use low-dose oral vitamin K, typically 1–2.5 mg, recognizing that oral administration is preferred over subcutaneous, and that IV vitamin K is generally reserved for bleeding or urgent reversal needs due to anaphylaxis risk and faster onset; I should double-check that the INR is truly > 10 and that the patient can reliably take and absorb oral vitamin K before choosing this path [^113NHhBh] [^116eWgBY] [^1135Nc6p].

> Next, I should review monitoring; I need to recheck the INR within 24 hours to ensure the trajectory is downward, and if the INR remains > 4 at 24 hours, I should consider a second low-dose oral vitamin K dose, whereas if the INR is falling appropriately, I can continue observation; I should also provide strict bleeding precautions and clear return precautions for any neurologic symptoms, hematuria, melena, or hematemesis [^1135Nc6p].

> I need to ensure I address root causes now; I should perform a focused medication reconciliation including new antibiotics, antifungals, amiodarone, acetaminophen, SSRIs, and over-the-counter or herbal agents, and I should review dietary vitamin K intake, alcohol use, and intercurrent illness that could elevate INR; if a reversible cause is identified, I should correct it to prevent recurrence and document the plan to avoid future supratherapeutic INRs [^1177wzsW] [^112rg8jE] [^1118gs1J].

> Let me think about when to resume anticoagulation; once the INR is back in the therapeutic range, I can restart warfarin at a reduced dose guided by the prior stable dose and the identified precipitant, and if the indication for anticoagulation is strong and the INR excursion was due to a reversible factor, switching to a DOAC may reduce future INR variability and interaction burden, though I should confirm indication-specific eligibility and patient-specific factors before switching [^114rHUnb] [^112TSAHD] [^1118gs1J].

> I should double-check special situations; if the patient has a mechanical heart valve, I must be cautious with DOACs and generally avoid them in mitral mechanical valves, so if I used vitamin K, I may need a short period of bridging with LMWH or UFH once INR falls below therapeutic and before rewarfarinization; if urgent surgery or procedures are planned, I should follow procedure-specific reversal guidance and consider 4-factor PCC plus IV vitamin K for time-sensitive reversal rather than relying on oral vitamin K alone [^112TSAHD] [^113cfUPd] [^116uUnaS].

> Hold on, I should verify that my documentation captures the shared decision-making, especially if I withhold vitamin K; I need to record the rationale for holding warfarin alone, the bleeding and thrombotic risk assessment, the plan for close INR follow-up, patient education on bleeding precautions, and the strategy to prevent recurrence, aligning with best practices for anticoagulation management systems and patient safety [^113qPFxy] [^1113e2wp].

> In summary, my final approach is to confirm the INR and exclude spurious causes, hold warfarin immediately, avoid routine vitamin K in most nonbleeding patients with INR > 10 given uncertain benefit and potential harms, monitor INR within 24 hours with clear bleeding precautions, address reversible causes, and resume anticoagulation thoughtfully once INR is therapeutic, considering a switch to a DOAC if appropriate; I will reserve low-dose oral vitamin K for select high bleeding risk scenarios or if INR remains markedly elevated at 24 hours, and I will escalate to IV vitamin K or 4-factor PCC only if bleeding occurs or urgent reversal is required [^1135Nc6p] [^111B2dYR] [^111kHxkR] [^116eWgBY].

For a patient on warfarin with an INR of 10 and no bleeding, the recommended management is to **hold warfarin immediately** and administer **1–2.5 mg oral vitamin K** [^112kAsVR] [^1135Nc6p] to rapidly reduce the INR and mitigate bleeding risk [^116eWgBY]. Recheck the INR in **24 hours**; if it remains > 4, repeat vitamin K 1–2.5 mg orally. Do not use IV vitamin K unless rapid reversal is needed for bleeding or urgent procedures, and avoid FFP or PCC unless there is active bleeding or a critical need for rapid correction [^11187bA2]. Resume warfarin at a reduced dose once the INR is therapeutic, and investigate and correct the cause of the INR elevation [^113F3oUj] [^112rg8jE].

---

## Immediate management steps

### Confirm INR and assess clinical status

Confirm the INR with a **repeat test** to exclude laboratory error [^112rg8jE], and perform a focused **clinical assessment** for occult bleeding (mucosal, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or intracranial) and for symptoms such as headache, dizziness, weakness, or abdominal pain [^112NUQZ3].

---

### Hold warfarin therapy

Immediately **discontinue warfarin** to halt further anticoagulation and allow the INR to decline as vitamin K–dependent factors recover [^1138gnTN].

---

### Administer oral vitamin K

Give **1–2.5 mg oral vitamin K (phytonadione)** [^1135Nc6p] to accelerate INR correction; oral administration is preferred for its safety and efficacy in non-bleeding patients [^113NHhBh]. Vitamin K acts within 6–24 hours, lowering the INR more rapidly than warfarin withdrawal alone [^116eWgBY].

---

### Monitor INR and clinical status

Recheck the INR in **24 hours**; if it remains > 4, repeat oral vitamin K 1–2.5 mg. Continue daily INR checks until the INR is within the therapeutic range (typically 2.0–3.0) [^1118gs1J].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting oral vitamin K administration

- **CHEST guidelines**: For INR > 10 without bleeding, administer oral vitamin K 1–2.5 mg [^112kAsVR].

- **British Society of Haematology (BSH)**: Give 1–5 mg oral vitamin K for INR > 8.0 without bleeding, with INR rechecked the next day [^1135Nc6p].

- **Meta-analysis**: Oral vitamin K is effective for INR 4.5–10; evidence for INR > 10 is limited but supports use [^115uunTR].

---

## Risks and benefits of oral vitamin K administration

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Rapid INR reduction (6–24 h) | Rare allergic reactions |
| Lower bleeding risk than no vitamin K | Temporary warfarin resistance (manageable) |
| Safe outpatient management | Potential thrombotic risk if over-reversed |

---

## When to consider alternative interventions

Reserve **IV vitamin K (1–3 mg)** for rapid reversal when needed for bleeding or urgent procedures, and use **FFP or PCC** only for active bleeding or when rapid correction is critical, given their higher risks and resource needs [^11187bA2] [^117612rR].

---

## Resumption of warfarin therapy

Resume warfarin at a **reduced dose** once the INR is therapeutic, and adjust subsequent dosing based on frequent INR checks until stable [^113F3oUj]. Also investigate and correct the cause of the INR elevation (e.g. drug interactions, dietary changes, adherence issues) to prevent recurrence [^1177wzsW].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Educate the patient on **bleeding precautions**, symptom recognition, and adherence, and arrange close follow-up with frequent INR monitoring until stable [^113qPFxy].

---

## Summary of management algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm INR and assess for bleeding |
| 2 | Hold warfarin immediately |
| 3 | Administer oral vitamin K 1–2.5 mg |
| 4 | Recheck INR in 24 hours; repeat vitamin K if INR > 4 |
| 5 | Resume warfarin at reduced dose when INR therapeutic |
| 6 | Investigate and correct cause of INR elevation |
| 7 | Educate patient and arrange close follow-up |

---

The recommended management for a patient on warfarin with an INR of 10 and no bleeding is to **hold warfarin and give 1–2.5 mg oral vitamin K**, with INR rechecked in 24 hours; repeat vitamin K if needed. Reserve IV vitamin K, FFP, or PCC for bleeding or urgent procedures, and resume warfarin at a reduced dose once the INR is therapeutic, with close follow-up and cause correction.

Why assess anticoagulant activity?

When a patient presents in the ED, and is known or suspected to be on OAC therapy, it is often helpful to be able to measure the level of anticoagulation.
The patient has unintentionally or intentionally overdosed on the OAC, but there are no related symptoms; for example, in the case of warfarin, the patient's routine monitoring could have given an overly elevated INR value, which might be owing to an overdose or a pharmacological interaction.
The patient is experiencing a spontaneous episode of external or internal bleeding, or the latter may be suspected.
The patient has suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding.
An urgent surgical or other invasive procedure is deemed necessary because of trauma or acute illness, and it is essential for the surgical team to know the level of anticoagulation in the patient.

### Management of excessive anticoagulant effect due to vitamin K antagonists [^114Nf4wu]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Unexpectedly elevated INR values are commonly encountered in clinical practice. In the absence of bleeding, such values may be treated with either simple warfarin withdrawal or the administration of low doses of oral vitamin K. Oral vitamin K will more rapidly return the INR to the therapeutic reference interval; however, its impact on bleeding is unknown. If the INR is in excess of 10, most experts would recommend the administration of vitamin K and, in the case of active bleeding, additional administration of coagulation factors either in the form of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC). Coagulation factor replacement is required given the need to urgently correct the INR; however, vitamin K should not be forgotten since it is required to antagonize the effect of warfarin, preventing "rebound" anticoagulation after transfused coagulation factors are consumed. This paper will review the evidence supporting various treatment modalities and will provide suggestions for treatment. Future advances in this area will likely focus on evaluations of the relative merits of FFP and PCCs.

Patient engagement in restarting anticoagulation — the guidance states, "Optimal patient engagement in the decision to restart anticoagulation involves shared decision making with patients and care providers", and that discussions should cover bleeding and thrombotic risks; for context, "the 30-day mortality rate from AF without OAC may be as high as ~25% after an ischemic stroke".

Vitamin K antagonist maintenance — INR monitoring and isolated out-of-range results are addressed as follows: For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B). For patients taking VKAs with previously stable therapeutic INRs who present with a single out-of-range INR of ≤ 0.5 below or above therapeutic, we suggest continuing the current dose and testing the INR within 1 to 2 weeks (Grade 2C). For patients with stable therapeutic INRs presenting with a single subtherapeutic INR value, we suggest against routinely administering bridging with heparin (Grade 2C). For patients taking VKAs, we suggest against routine use of vitamin K supplementation (Grade 2C).

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

Restart of anticoagulation — Begin by asking, "Does the patient fall into 1 of the following groups?": NPO, awaiting an invasive procedure, pregnancy, high risk of rebleeding, or being bridged back to VKA with high thrombotic risk (see Table 6). If yes, suggest temporary or long-term parenteral anticoagulation. If no, determine if the patient is on concomitant antiplatelet therapy; if so, reassess the need for aspirin in stable CAD and reassess the need for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients after PCI and/or ACS and consider discontinuation of aspirin. Next, evaluate whether the patient is taking concurrent medications that interact with OAC levels (e.g., antiretrovirals, antifungals, antibiotics, antiarrhythmics); if present, suggest pharmacy consultation and consideration of switching either OAC or the interacting medication. If no interacting medications are identified, suggest restarting anticoagulation, then choose OAC and consider switching OAC if a reversible cause related to the OAC contributed to the bleed (e.g., high INR, renal function variation). After resumption, if bleeding reoccurred, reassess the severity of the bleed (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 — management of major bleeding on OACs (including direct-acting oral anticoagulants [DOACs] and vitamin K antagonists [VKAs]) first asks, "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC and antiplatelet agent(s); if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide local therapy/ manual compression; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no (major but not critical/life threatening), actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. After initial measures, the pathway asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and if not, it states, "Suggest administering reversal/hemostatic agents* (see Figure 3)"; once the patient is stable, it advises, "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)". Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).

Oral anticoagulant (OAC)–treated patients — assessment of bleed severity should obtain a focused history and physical examination with vital signs and laboratory evaluation to determine time of onset, location, severity, and whether bleeding is ongoing; the assessment of hemodynamic instability should be done promptly and repeated frequently; patients with major bleeds require close monitoring, ideally in the acute or critical care setting; additional considerations include the time of ingestion of last dose of anticoagulant and whether there was an intentional or unintentional overdose, and clinicians should be mindful of comorbidities and concomitant treatments that could contribute to bleeding or alter its management.

### Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^113NHhBh]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of ≤ 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).

### Preventing and managing bleeding complications in anticoagulated patients: a case based approach [^1116LnAv]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Bleeding is the most common complication of anticoagulant therapy. Despite the frequency of its occurrence, little evidence is available to guide the care of anticoagulated patients with, or at high risk of, bleeding. This article attempts, using a case based format, to describe common clinical scenarios encountered by clinicians who manage anticoagulated patients and who are bleeding. The paper is "case based" and narrative since there is little evidence to guide practice in this area.

Laboratory measurement — clinically relevant bleeding or urgent procedures: In anticoagulated patients with clinically relevant bleeding or needing an urgent unplanned procedure, measurement of anticoagulant activity is a key step, and a prothrombin time (PT) and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be requested in all such patients; patients taking a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) may be evaluated with the PT/international normalized ratio (INR), and the INR may be used to guide perioperative or bleeding management; for direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the minimum level that may contribute to bleeding risk is unknown, and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommends consideration of anticoagulant reversal for serious bleeding with a DOAC level > 50 ng/mL and for invasive procedures with high bleeding risk with a DOAC level > 30 ng/mL.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) maintenance — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency for consistently stable results: Stable INRs are defined as "at least 3 months of consistent results with no need to adjust VKA dosing". Practice varies, with "stable patients usually" tested "every 4 weeks" in North America, whereas "INR recall intervals of up to 90 days are routine" in the United Kingdom. Evidence includes three RCTs of recall intervals exceeding the 4-week standard; one compared 6- to 4-week intervals, another allowed intervals "of up to 12 weeks", and a third compared "4- to 12-week" intervals, with "none of the studies" showing differences in thromboembolism, bleeding, or INR control. Accordingly, the recommendation states: "For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B)".

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

### The risk of hemorrhage among patients with warfarin-associated coagulopathy [^116VKuhs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Among warfarin-treated patients with international normalized ratio (INR) > 5, we sought to determine the risk of major bleeding within 30 days.

Background

For warfarin-treated patients, the risk of bleeding increases as the INR rises, particularly if the INR exceeds 4. The 30-day risk of hemorrhage among outpatients with excessively prolonged INR values is unknown.

Methods

To assess anticoagulation care in the U.S., a cohort of 6,761 patients taking warfarin was prospectively assembled from 101 participating sites (43% were community-based cardiology practices). From this cohort, 1,104 patients were identified with a first episode of INR > 5.

Results

A total of 979 met eligibility criteria; complete follow-up information was available for 976 (99.7%). Ninety-six percent (n = 937) of patients had an INR value between 5 and 9; 80% of INR values were < 7. Thirteen patients (1.3%) experienced major hemorrhage during the 30-day follow-up period; among patients whose INR was > 5 and < 9, 0.96% experienced major hemorrhage. None of the bleeding events was fatal. Intervention with vitamin K was uncommon (8.7%). Warfarin doses were withheld for the majority of patients. Fifty percent of patients who were managed conservatively and retested on day 4 or 5 had an INR of 2.0 or less.

Conclusions

For warfarin-treated outpatients presenting with an INR > 5 and < 9, the 30-day risk of major bleeding is low (0.96%). Intervention with vitamin K among asymptomatic patients presenting with an INR < 9 is not routine practice in the U.S.

### Vitamin K versus warfarin interruption alone in patients without bleeding and an international normalized ratio > 10 [^111kHxkR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Reversal of an international normalized ratio (INR) > 10 with vitamin K is recommended in patients experiencing bleeding; however, information on outcomes with reversal using vitamin K in non-bleeding patients is lacking.

Objective

To compare clinical and safety outcomes between non-bleeding patients receiving warfarin with an INR > 10 who did and did not receive a prescription for vitamin K.

Patients/Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in an integrated health-care delivery system. Adult patients receiving warfarin therapy who experienced an INR > 10 without bleeding between 01/01/2006 and 06/30/2018 were included. Patients were assessed for an outpatient dispensing or in-office administration of vitamin K on the day of or the day after an INR > 10 and then clinically relevant bleeding, thromboembolism, all-cause mortality, and time to INR < 4 within the next 30 days.

Results

A total of 809 patients was included with 332 and 477 who were and were not dispensed vitamin K, respectively. Overall, mean patient age was 71.7 years, 60.1% were female and the mean INR was 10.4 at presentation. There were no differences between groups in 30-day rates of bleeding or thromboembolism (both P > .05). Patients dispensed vitamin K had a higher likelihood of mortality (15.1% versus 10.1%, P = 0.032, adjusted odds ratio = 1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.57). Overall, time to an INR < 4 was similar between groups.

Conclusion

Vitamin K administration was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in asymptomatic patients with an INR > 10.

### Emergency department management of patients on warfarin therapy [^1168nfws]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To characterize warfarin management in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of patients who were receiving warfarin and were discharged from a tertiary care, academic urban ED between June and August 2007. We abstracted patient demographics, presenting complaint, international normalized ratio (INR) if tested, indication for warfarin if documented, new medications administered or prescribed in the ED, and discharge instructions. Presenting complaints were categorized according to whether they were warfarin-related and concerning for thrombosis or bleeding. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of warfarin therapy. The secondary outcome measures were frequency with which ED providers obtained an INR result, response to nontherapeutic results, administration or prescription of interacting medications, and percentage of patients receiving recommendations for anticoagulation follow-up.

Results

Two percent (111/7,195) of all patients presenting to and discharged from the ED during the study period were found to be receiving warfarin. Seventy-one percent (79/111) had an INR checked. Nontherapeutic INRs were recorded for 49% (39/79) of patients; ED providers intervened to address these results in 21% (8/39) of cases. Seventy-one percent (5/7) of patients with a supratherapeutic INR received an intervention compared with 9% (3/32) of patients with a subtherapeutic INR. Seventeen percent (19/111) and 13% (14/111) of patients received or were prescribed potentially interacting medications, respectively. Recommendations for specific anticoagulation follow-up were documented for 19% (21/111) of all patients.

Conclusion

Patients receiving warfarin frequently present to the ED and often have nontherapeutic INRs. Potential areas for improvement in ED management include greater attention to subtherapeutic INRs, interacting medications, and discharge planning.

### International normalized ratio versus plasma levels of coagulation factors in patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy [^113BG1iE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The key question when managing patients on warfarin therapy who present with life-threatening bleeding is how to use the international normalized ratio (INR) to best direct corrective therapy. The corollary question for the clinical laboratory is at what level will the INR reflect a critical value that requires notifying the clinician.

Objective

To determine the levels of vitamin K-dependent factors over a range of INR values.

Design

Evaluation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor levels on plasma remnants from patients in whom a prothrombin time and INR was ordered to monitor warfarin therapy. There were a total of 83 specimens evaluated with an INR range from 1.0 to 8.26.

Results

The mean activity levels of all 4 factors remained near or above 50% when the INR was less than 1.5. The average factor X level was 23% when the INR range was 1.6 to 2.5, but levels of factors II, VII, and IX did not drop below the hemostatic range until the INR was greater than 2.5. At an INR of 3.6 or more, the activity levels of all 4 factors were less than 30% in more than 90% of the specimens.

Conclusion

Levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X declined with increasing INR but not at the same rate and not to the same level at a given INR. However, most of the values were below the hemostatic value once the INR was 3.6 or more, the level that was also considered critical for physician notification.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116eWgBY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) reversal — Several options exist for reversal of VKAs, including administration of vitamin K, PCCs, and plasma; vitamin K can be given orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, and slow intravenous administration (in 25 to 50 mL normal saline over 15 to 30 minutes) effects a more predictable and rapid reduction in the INR (4 to 6 hours) compared with oral (18 to 24 hours), although the administration of vitamin K does not result in immediate correction of coagulopathy and for a major bleed warranting reversal must be accompanied by a repletion strategy (if 4F-PCC is unavailable, PCCs or plasma may be used). PCCs contain purified vitamin K-dependent clotting factors; nonactivated 3-factor PCCs contain FII, FIX, and FX with negligible FVII, protein C, and S, whereas nonactivated 4F-PCCs contain FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and proteins C and S, and only 4F-PCCs are licensed for rapid VKA reversal. For VKA reversal, 4F-PCCs are dosed on the basis of INR and body weight (INR 2 to < 4 at 25 U/kg, INR 4 to 6 at 35 U/kg, and INR > 6 at 50 U/kg; max dose 5,000 units capped at 100 kg body weight), and per unit volume 4F-PCCs contain approximately 25 times (25 U/mL) the concentration of vitamin K-dependent factors as compared with plasma (1 U/mL); therefore, PCC can be given in a much smaller volume at a much faster infusion rate (8×) compared with plasma and is preferred.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^112rg8jE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The relevance of the INR for VKA-treated patients

The INR is a standardised method for reporting results of the PT assay, which is sensitive to the coagulation factors prothrombin, tissue factor and factors V, VII and X. As these coagulation factors depend on vitamin K for synthesis, the INR reflects anticoagulation owing to warfarin. For a warfarin-anticoagulated patient, the INR can aid decision-making around the measures that may be needed to normalise coagulation activity and stop or stabilise bleeding.

Elevated INRs can arise from direct overdosing, as well as interactions between warfarin and numerous other drugs or herbal remedies, as the result of fluctuations in dietary vitamin K owing to dietary changes or intake of nutritional supplements, or as a consequence of alcohol abuse. Concurrent conditions, such as hepatic or biliary disease, gastrointestinal illness or sepsis also can increase the INR. In such situations, the cause of the elevation needs to be identified so that repeated incidents and the resultant increased bleeding risk can be avoided. In the event of a self-reported and/or unexplained elevation in INR, retesting in the ED can confirm the elevation and exclude erroneous results. However, in the ED itself, testing artefacts such as under filling tubes when drawing blood for INR testing can yield falsely elevated INR results owing to excess levels of citrate in the test sample. Errors can be avoided by use of the correct sample tubes and ensuring that they are adequately filled.

Finally, patients are treated with warfarin to manage thrombosis or reduce the risk of stroke or other thromboembolic events. Therefore, when a VKA-treated patient presents at the ED, the INR should be confirmed to be in the therapeutic range, and intervention may be required when it is not. If necessary, the patient should be referred for appropriate warfarin management on discharge.

### French clinical practice guidelines on the management of patients on vitamin K antagonists in at-risk situations (overdose, risk of bleeding, and active bleeding) [^114zHD5h]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

The present report from several French medical societies in the field and the French National Authority for Health provides an expert consensus for the management of patients on vitamin K antagonists in at-risk situations (overdose, risk of bleeding, and active bleeding). Asymptomatic VKA overdose is defined as an International Normalized Ratio (INR) value above the upper limit of the therapeutic target. In this case, the guidelines describe the rapid reduction of the INR down to the therapeutic range, either by omitting a dose or using vitamin K. Regarding the haemorrhagic complications, the guidelines address the management of these patients according to the severity of bleeding, and especially focus on the use of prothrombin complex concentrate. Finally, the consensus addresses the management of patients in cases of elective or emergency surgery or other invasive procedures, and discusses whether treatment should be continued or not, and whether VKA substitution by heparin — "bridging anticoagulation" — is needed.

### Massive warfarin overdose management in an adolescent patient [^111nHXMm]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Warfarin is a widely used oral anticoagulant with established reversal guidelines in the setting of a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). Limited literature exists on managing acute warfarin overdoses in patients who are not chronically anticoagulated.

Case

A 15-year-old male, with no indication for anticoagulation, presented to a pediatric emergency department after an acute 1,000mg warfarin ingestion. He had no significant complaints upon presentation aside from a mild intermittent headache. His past medical history was significant for anxiety, depression, Tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and polysubstance misuse. Computed tomography of his head was unremarkable and serum acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol concentrations were negative. Approximately 16h post-ingestion, his INR was 1.9 with an increase to 3.3 by 26h. The regional poison center was consulted and recommended, consistent with the CHEST guidelines, holding treatment with vitamin K until INR was > 10 or if signs or symptoms of bleeding occurred. The patient was admitted for monitoring and by hospital day (HD) #4, his INR had risen to > 11.8 at which point oral vitamin K 10mg was administered. On HD #7, the patient was deemed stable for transfer to inpatient psychiatry after repeat INRs of 2.9 and 3.4.

Discussion

Case reports have demonstrated early administration of vitamin K can temporarily lower INR and prevent detection of rebound. The CHEST warfarin reversal guidelines describe the risks and benefits with respect to bleeding and thrombosis in the non-intentional overdose patient. Application and extrapolation of these guidelines to acute overdose in patients who lack an indication for anticoagulation may or may not be warranted.

Conclusion

While established clinical guidance exists on reversing a supratherapeutic INR in patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin, the risks and benefits of extrapolating this approach are unclear in those who lack an indication for anticoagulation.

### Vitamin K for reversal of excessive vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115n2bb9]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10 are at increased risk of bleeding. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administering vitamin K in patients receiving VKA therapy with INR between 4.5 and 10 and without bleeding. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials in April 2018. Search strategy included terms vitamin K administration and VKA-related terms. Reference lists of relevant studies were reviewed, and experts in the field were contacted for relevant papers. Two investigators independently screened and collected data. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Six studies (1074 participants) were included in the review and meta-analyses. Pooled estimates indicate a nonsignificant increased risk of mortality (RR = 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–2.47), bleeding (RR = 2.24; 95% CI, 0.81–7.27), and thromboembolism (RR = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.35–4.78) for vitamin K administration, with moderate certainty of the evidence resulting from serious imprecision as CIs included potential for benefit and harm. Patients receiving vitamin K had a nonsignificant increase in the likelihood of reaching goal INR (1.95; 95% CI, 0.88–4.33), with very low certainty of the evidence resulting from serious risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Our findings indicate that patients on VKA therapy who have an INR between 4.5 and 10.0 without bleeding are not likely to benefit from vitamin K administration in addition to temporary VKA cessation.

### Comparative effectiveness of warfarin management strategies: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117Luyy9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Warfarin management strategies

Twenty-two trials compared usual care with other warfarin management strategies. The practice of usual care appeared similar across these trials, although some details of the protocols varied. These variations ranged from physicians adjusting the warfarin dose based on INR readings and dosing algorithms to practices where physicians managed INR monitoring and warfarin dosing adjustments without the support of an anticoagulation protocol (Appendix 3). Healthcare providers in the 12 AMS trials were pharmacists (6 trials), a multidisciplinary team (1 trial), nurses (1 trial), and unspecified healthcare providers (4 trials). In 9 PST trials, patients performed their own INR tests during the maintenance phase at the following frequencies: once a week (5 trials), every two weeks (3 trials), every month (1 trial), or at an unknown frequency (1 trial). Warfarin dosing instruction was received from various sources, including computer application/software guiding healthcare providers (4 trials), physicians (2 trials), and unspecified healthcare providers (3 trials). The frequency of INR measurements by patients in the 13 PSM trials were as follows: once a week (6 trials), every two weeks (4 trials), at patient's discretion (2 trials), or at unspecified intervals (1 trial).

Risk of bias of included trials

Since the risk of bias may vary for certain steps in RCTs across different outcomes, the risk of bias in the included trials was assessed and reported separately for each outcome (see Appendix 4). Among the 15 trials reporting all-cause mortality, 9 were justified as having a low risk of bias, 4 an unclear risk, and 2 a high risk of bias. For other outcomes, a higher proportion of trials exhibited an overall unclear risk of bias. This was attributed to the need for clearer reporting of outcome assessments. For example, 14 out of 18 trials, and 12 out of 17 trials were justified as having unclear risk of bias for major bleeding, and major TE.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^114KX42i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is so widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) on a regular basis, either for the same reasons as the population in general or as a result of the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails.

The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades, but recently, the newer agents dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban and apixaban (collectively, novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not give an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs, and alternative tests are therefore needed for use in emergency settings. This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### Low-dose oral vitamin K is safe and effective for outpatient management of patients with an INR > 10 [^115uunTR]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-dose oral vitamin K effectively returns an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0 to an INR of 2.0–3.0 within 24 h in about 70% of patients. However, the efficacy of oral vitamin K for the treatment of higher INR values has only been studied in one small randomized trial. Treatment of markedly prolonged INR values with low-dose oral vitamin K is attractive because it has the potential to greatly simplify the management of such patients.

Methods

In our tertiary care anticoagulation clinic patients with an INR of more than 10 were managed as outpatients with simple warfarin withdrawal and, where feasible, low-dose (2 mg) oral vitamin K. Only patients with additional complications such as bleeding or unexplained symptoms were admitted to hospital.

Results

Eighty-five patients had 89 episodes of an INR value of more than 10.0. Fourteen patients were admitted to the hospital for management. In the other 75 episodes patients were managed as outpatients by warfarin withdrawal. In 24 episodes patients did not receive vitamin K. In 51 episodes patients were also given oral vitamin K. None of the patients given oral vitamin K experienced bleeding requiring medical intervention (95% confidence interval (CI) 0–6%). In contrast there were three clinically important bleeding episodes amongst the patients managed with simple warfarin withdrawal (95% CI 0–34%). Patients given vitamin K were also more likely to have an INR < 5 by day 3 than those managed by withdrawal of warfarin alone. Two patients admitted to hospital and given intravenous vitamin K at higher doses became temporarily refractory to anticoagulation while there were no such complications in those treated with low-dose oral vitamin K.

Conclusion

Low-dose (2 mg) oral vitamin K, coupled with temporary warfarin discontinuation, appears to be a safe and effective treatment for severe warfarin associated coagulopathy in non-bleeding patients.

### New oral anticoagulants: which one should my patient use? [^113GEt11]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin. Focusing on these features, this paper (a) compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin (b) identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features, (c) reviews their current indications, and (d) uses this information to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to management of bleeding, VKAs, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to administer 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (if available) in addition to IV vitamin K over FFP and IV vitamin K treatment to rapidly achieve INR correction in patients with AF developing life-threatening bleeding on warfarin.

### Bleeding in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists who would have been excluded from trials on which the indication for anticoagulation was based [^113BXqPY]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective antithrombotic agents and advocated in guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease. However, in the trials underlying these guidelines, many patients were excluded. We performed a case-control study in 993 patients receiving VKAs, who required hospitalization for bleeding, and contrasted them to 993 matched control patients on VKAs, who were hospitalized for an infection. We analyzed whether patients and controls would have been eligible for the clinical trials on which their indication for anticoagulation was based, and estimated the risk of hemorrhage associated with exclusion criteria as applied in those trials. Approximately one quarter (23% [95% CI: 21%-26%]) of controls had one or more exclusion criteria for the trials, supporting the use of anticoagulation for their condition. Forty percent of patients presenting with bleeding had one or more exclusion criteria (95% CI: 37%-43%). Having one exclusion criterion resulted in a 2.9-fold increased risk of bleeding (95% CI: 2.2–3.9), and this risk increased sharply when more than one exclusion criterion was present. VKAs are often prescribed to patients who would not have qualified for clinical trials, and in these patients a careful consideration should be made regarding the expected efficacy and the risk of bleeding.

### Treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy: a physician survey [^111gsmvc]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

(1) To determine physician preferences in the management of warfarin-induced excessive anticoagulation (AC); and (2) to assess compliance with the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for the reversal of excessive AC.

Design

Cross-sectional physician survey.

Participants

Members of the Canadian Society of Internal Medicine practicing in Ontario, Canada.

Measurements and Results

Physicians were asked to provide management preferences in six clinical scenarios describing warfarin-induced excessive AC. The scenarios represent various combinations of international normalized ratio (INR) value, treatment setting, and presence and severity of bleeding. In scenarios with INRs < 5.2 without bleeding, conservative approaches complying with the ACCP guidelines, such as withholding warfarin or reducing its dose, were most common. In scenarios with high INRs (ie, > 7.1) and/or bleeding, the selection of vitamin K in any form ranged between 71% and 82%. However, compliance with the ACCP-recommended doses and the routes of vitamin K administration ranged from 1 to 10%. In five of the six scenarios, subcutaneous injection, a route not recommended by the ACCP, was the most common method of vitamin K delivery.

Conclusions

Physician preferences for the reversal of warfarin-induced excessive AC were highly variable and, in most cases, did not follow the recommendations of the ACCP consensus guidelines. Furthermore, the widespread reported use of subcutaneous vitamin K is concerning because this route of vitamin K administration has been demonstrated to be less effective than IV administration of vitamin K. These findings highlight the need for randomized controlled trials to compare the efficacy of different routes of administration of vitamin K for warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

Periprocedural management

Whether to discontinue VKAs in patients undergoing a procedure depends on the degree of invasiveness and expected bleeding. Minor dental or surgical procedures associated with minimal bleeding risk may allow for continuation of VKA; however, coordination with the proceduralist and the provider managing anticoagulation is needed. For more invasive procedures, VKA doses should be held 4 to 5 days before the procedure to allow INR values to return to normal. Because of the initial prothrombotic state and delayed onset of anticoagulation with initiation of VKAs, a practice of bridging with a shorter-acting anticoagulant (usually UFH or LMWH) may be instituted. Adult studies have shown that perioperative bridging therapy may not be needed for most patients, especially in light of the fact that it has been shown to lead to a threefold increased risk of major bleeding. Adult patients who may require bridging are those at high risk of thrombosis, including patients who have had a recent VTE within the previous month, who have a history of VTE during prior pauses in anticoagulation therapy, or in those who are undergoing a procedure with high inherent risk for VTE. A single-center retrospective study in children reported no instances of major bleeding or thromboembolism in 61 instances of periprocedural interruption in warfarin, whether bridging was instituted or not, and, therefore, the authors suggest bridging only for pediatric patients at high risk for thrombosis. Postoperatively, anticoagulation should be initiated as soon as the bleeding risk has declined and it is deemed safe by the proceduralist. For those who are bridging, the bridging agent should be continued until the INR has reached desired therapeutic range.

Management of bleeding

Management of bleeding in patients with VTE being treated with VKAs is mostly extrapolated from the adult data. The adult guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians suggest that for INR between 4.5 and 10 without bleeding, VKAs should be held until the INR returns to the desired range. For INRs of > 10 without bleeding, VKAs should be reversed with oral vitamin K. For major bleeding at any INR level, VKAs should be reversed rapidly with IV vitamin K along with an activated prothrombin concentrate. Limited pediatric data have shown that most children on VKAs with supratherapeutic INR values and no bleeding symptoms may be safely monitored with observation alone.

Oral anticoagulation management systems and self-testing include the following: We suggest that health-care providers who manage oral anticoagulation therapy should do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dosing decisions. For patients treated with VKAs who are motivated and can demonstrate competency in self-management strategies, including the self-testing equipment, we suggest patient self-management (PSM) rather than usual outpatient INR monitoring (Grade 2B), and for all other patients, we suggest monitoring that includes the safeguards in our best practice statement 3.5. For dosing decisions during maintenance VKA therapy, we suggest using validated decision support tools (paper nomograms or computerized dosing programs) rather than no decision support (Grade 2C). Remarks: Inexperienced prescribers may be more likely to improve prescribing with use of decision support tools than experienced prescribers.

### Intensity of anticoagulation with warfarin and risk of adverse events in patients presenting to the emergency department [^114i1Bfj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The ability of patients receiving warfarin to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) within the desired therapeutic range is important for both efficacy and risk of adverse events. It is unclear whether the desired INR is maintained in patients receiving warfarin who present to the emergency department (ED) and whether they have a higher rate of adverse events.

Objective

To evaluate the intensity of anticoagulation with warfarin and the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications in patients in the ED.

Methods

A prospective observational study was performed using a convenience sample of patients receiving warfarin and presenting to the ED over an 18-week period. Data were collected using a standardized form that included chief complaint, history of present illness, past medical history, medication history, and allergy status. Information from the physical examination, laboratory results, and other diagnostic tests obtained as part of routine assessment in the ED, was used as necessary. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose INR was within, above, or below the desired therapeutic range. Bleeding complications and thromboembolic events were recorded in an attempt to determine the relationship between the intensity of anticoagulation and adverse outcomes.

Results

Two hundred one patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 74.0 (13.2) years; 53.7% were female. Primary indications for warfarin were atrial fibrillation (75.6%) and venous thromboembolic disease (14.9%). A therapeutic INR was observed in 88 patients (43.8%; 95% CI 37.1 to 50.7), while 45 patients (22.4%; 95% CI 17.2 to 28.7) and 68 patients (33.8%; 95% CI 27.6 to 40.6) had subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic INRs, respectively. Overall, there were 28 (18 major and 10 minor) bleeding complications (13.9%; 95% CI 9.8 to 19.4) and 4 thromboembolic events (2.0%; 95% CI 0.6 to 5.2). Among patients with a bleeding complication, 14 (50.0%) had a supratherapeutic INR, while 2 patients who experienced a thromboembolic event (50.0%) had a subtherapeutic INR.

Conclusions

The majority of patients receiving warfarin on presentation to the ED had INRs outside the desired therapeutic range. By establishing the impact of warfarin-related adverse events in this population, focused interventions can be established in this setting to address factors that can be targeted to reduce these events.

### A surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part one: warfarin and new direct oral anticoagulant medications [^116HwxHZ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Warfarin is often a contributor to bleeding events requiring hospitalization. Warfarin, alone or in combination with other mediations, was implicated in one-third of emergency hospitalizations for medication-related adverse events in the elderly between 2007 and 2009. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or retroperitoneal hemorrhage leading to hospitalization is as high as 16% per year, and the risk of fatal bleeding is as high as 3%. As warfarin use is relatively common, preinjury warfarin use in trauma victims is frequently encountered. In trauma patients aged 65 and older admitted to US trauma centers, roughly 1 in 10 can be expected to be on warfarin therapy at the time of injury, complicating management. Not surprisingly, patients on warfarin therapy at the time of traumatic injury are at higher risk of mortality.

The risk of warfarin-associated hemorrhage is correlated with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the international normalized ratio (INR), with the risk of bleeding increased by a factor of 1.43 for each 0.5 unit increase in INR. For warfarin to be effective and relatively safe, the therapeutic window for the medication is between an INR of 2 and 3 (or slightly higher for mechanical valves). However, INR levels outside of this therapeutic window over the course of warfarin therapy are commonplace, increasing thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk. Factors contributing to a supratherapeutic INR include interactions with other medications (particularly antibiotics), acute medical illness and traumatic brain injury or other trauma-related hemorrhage.

3: Poor documentation:

Patients were often not issued with patient-held information and written dosage instructions at start of therapy, or discharged from hospital without an appointment for next INR measurement or for consultation with appropriate healthcare professional. New referrals to anticoagulation service had incomplete information making appointments more challenging for the haematology team. Patients were affected by reduced quality of anticoagulation leading to potentially life-threatening over or under coagulation.

4: Failure to consider significant pharmacological interactions:

Not enough safe practice had been promoted regarding co-prescribing one or more clinically significant interacting medicines or informing anticoagulant services that an interacting medicine had been prescribed. Co-prescribed medications were frequently not documented on the referral form, with the consequence that the anticoagulation team were unable to identify any potentially dangerous interactions in a timely manner.

1 Introduction

Anticoagulant therapy is fundamental for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. With an aging population, the number of people requiring chronic oral anticoagulation to manage conditions such as atrial fibrillation is increasing. Options for anticoagulation have been increasing – currently available options include vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, primarily warfarin) and the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban). However, several studies describe the risk of hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants. VKA use has been associated with more than double the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) versus non-use, while patients receiving DOAC therapy have a lower or comparable risk of ICH or major bleeding compared with VKA therapy. While DOACs have significantly changed the anticoagulation therapy landscape, DOAC-treated patients remain at some risk of major bleeding (up to 5% of patients, based on clinical trial data).

Prompt anticoagulation reversal during severe/life-threatening bleeding events is a key component of multimodal therapy in these complex and fortunately rare clinical scenarios. However, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit–risk ratio of supporting hemostasis and potentially promoting post-reversal thrombosis. The advisability of administering reversal agents depends upon several clinical factors, including patient stability, timing of last anticoagulant dose, baseline coagulation assays (particularly international normalized ratio [INR] in the case of VKA-related hemorrhage), and product availability. Reversal and other management strategies are often administered sequentially if required to obtain adequate control of bleeding.

VKA reversal can be achieved by various treatment approaches including fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs; including 3- or 4-factor PCC [3F-PCC or 4F-PCC] and activated PCC [aPCC]). Historically, clinicians used FFP for VKA reversal, but PCCs have taken precedence in this setting. In contrast to FFP, PCCs require a lower infusion volume and shorter infusion time, are associated with a lower risk of pathogen transmission, and have a more rapid impact on INR. Several clinical trials have found 4F-PCCs to be effective agents for urgent VKA reversal in patients with major bleeding or prior to emergency surgery. The potential for increased post-treatment risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) with 4F-PCCs is a concern, though several studies have shown this risk to be similar to that with FFP.

### Comparative effectiveness of warfarin management strategies: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117Du8h3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin K antagonists are one of the main anticoagulants used in the treatment and prevention of thrombosis in various medical conditions, such as venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and mechanical heart valve replacement. Warfarin is the most widely used VKA in many countries globally, although there has been a declining trend in its use following the availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) since 2010. However, warfarin continues to be a vital therapeutic option worldwide. In addition to its relatively low cost, warfarin is associated with lower risk of gastrointestinal bleedingand all-cause mortalitycompared to some DOACs. Furthermore, warfarin is superior to DOACs in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, mechanical heart valves, and valvular AF. However, to achieve the benefits of warfarin, patients require careful and frequent monitoring with dose adjustment due to warfarin's narrow therapeutic index.

Warfarin management encompasses several approaches tailored to optimize treatment outcomes and ensure patient safety. Usual care typically involves regular in person clinic visits for International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring, with dose adjustments made by healthcare providers based on test results and patient factors. Anticoagulation management services (AMS), or anticoagulation clinics, offer a more specialized approach where trained healthcare professionals (often nurses and/or pharmacists) provide comprehensive management, including INR testing, education, and dose adjustments using a systematic approach. Patient self-testing (PST) empowers patients to conduct their own INR tests, with results reported to healthcare providers for dose advice. To ensure successful self-monitoring, appropriate patient education on how to accurately perform and interpret these tests is essential. Patient self-management (PSM) goes a step further, enabling patients to adjust their own warfarin dose based on self-testing results and dosing decision aids, which requires further education on effectively managing dosages. The proportion of patients receiving different types of warfarin management varies by region, healthcare system, and patient preference. Generally, most patients are managed by usual care or AMS, with about 4% managed by PST. The proportion of patients managed by PSM is expected to be significantly smaller than those managed by PST.

Anticoagulant Transitioning

As with any high‐risk medication such as anticoagulants, clinical situations may arise that require transitioning to or off of DOAC therapy. Two common transition scenarios include (1) switching between anticoagulants and (2) periprocedural management.

Switching Between Anticoagulants

It is not uncommon to require transition from one anticoagulant to another because of either cost, comorbid conditions, patient preference, hospitalization, thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, or procedures. Five scenarios exist that comprise DOAC therapy switching from/to another anticoagulant:
VKA to DOAC
DOAC to VKA
DOAC to DOAC
DOAC to parenteral anticoagulant
Parenteral anticoagulant to DOAC

For all scenarios, assessment of each drug's pharmacokinetic profile (ie, half‐life), pharmacodynamics profile (INR for VKA or activated partial thromboplastin time for unfractionated heparin, etc), as well as patients' renal function, must be taken into account. The ultimate goal is to limit interruption of the therapeutic anticoagulation during the transition to minimize the risk of atherothrombosis. In certain cases, this requires overlap of the 2 anticoagulants. See Table 6. 92

Table 6
Algorithm for Switching Between Anticoagulants

Transitioning between VKA and DOAC and vice versa requires additional explanation that takes into account the INR measurement. When transitioning from a VKA to a DOAC, the half‐life of the VKA compound is imperative to guide therapy. Since warfarin is the principle VKA utilized in the United States, with a half‐life of ≈36 to 48 hours, it is advisable to stop warfarin and check INR at least 3 days later. DOACs can be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2; see Table 7 for management strategies based on INR values. 38 When converting from a DOAC to a VKA, providers should administer DOACs concomitantly with VKAs because of the VKAs' known slow onset of action (≈5–10 days). 38 An INR should be rechecked between days 3 and 5 of warfarin therapy. INRs should be checked just before the dose of the DOAC because of their ability to elevate INR values. The INRs should be monitored frequently for at least the first month until INR stability has been achieved (ie, ≥ 3 consecutive INR readings at goal).

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Warfarin overdose: a 25-year experience [^111mE2A1]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disease. While guidelines exist for management of a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio following therapeutic warfarin use, these guidelines are not designed for management of the acute warfarin overdose. There is a paucity of literature describing the latter. The primary objective of this manuscript is to characterize the coagulopathy and describe the bleeding events that occur after a warfarin overdose. A secondary goal is to describe the amount of vitamin K administered to patients presenting with warfarin overdoses. A retrospective chart review of patients admitted with an acute warfarin overdose at two tertiary care medical centers in the United States was conducted. Clinical characteristics were abstracted, and bleeding categories (major, minor, trivial) were defined a priori. Twenty-three patients were admitted during the time period; males accounted for 15/23 (62.5%) subjects. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 43 (32–48.5)years. Seventeen subjects received vitamin K, with a median (IQR) dose of 15 (10–50)mg. The maximal total amount of vitamin K administered to a single patient during the index hospitalization was 110 mg. Three bleeding events occurred; one classified as major, and two as minor. All patients made a full recovery. In this case series of acute warfarin overdose, nearly all patients developed a coagulopathy, and nearly three-quarters of patients received vitamin K. Bleeding events occurred in a minority of patients.

### The safety of oral anticoagulants registry (SOAR): a national, ED-based study of the evaluation and management of bleeding and bleeding concerns due to the use of oral anticoagulants [^112T8qTP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The Safety of Oral Anticoagulants Registry (SOAR) was designed to describe the evaluation and management of patients with oral anticoagulant (OAC)-related major bleeding or bleeding concerns who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute illness or injury. Patients in the ED are increasingly taking anticoagulants, which can cause bleeding-related complications as well as impact the acute management of related or unrelated clinical issues that prompt presentation. Modifications of emergency evaluation and management due to anticoagulation have not previously been studied.

Methods

This was a multicenter observational in-hospital study of patients who were judged to be experiencing an active OAC effect and had (a) an obvious bleeding event or (b) were deemed at risk for serious bleeding spontaneously, after injury, or during an indicated invasive procedure. Diagnostic testing, therapies employed, and clinical outcomes were collected.

Results

Thirty-one US hospitals contributed data to SOAR. Of 1513 subjects, acute hemorrhage (AH) qualified 78%, while 22% had a bleeding concern (BC). Warfarin was the index OAC in 37.3%, dabigatran in 13.3%, and an anti-Factor X in 49.4%. The most common sites of AH were gastrointestinal (51.0%) and intracranial (26.8%). In warfarin-treated patients, the mean (IQR) presenting INR was 3.1 (2.2, 4.8) in AH patients and 3.9 (2.4, 7.2) in BC patients. Three-fifths of SOAR patients were treated with factor repletion or specific reversal agents, and those patients had a longer length of stay. In addition, seven (0.76%) of the treated patients experienced an in-hospital thrombotic complication; two of these seven died on the index admission, both of fatal pulmonary embolism. Vitamin K was used and dosed inconsistently in both warfarin and NOAC cohorts.

Conclusion

Care of anticoagulated patients in the acute care setting is inconsistent, reflecting the diversity of presentation. As the prevalence of OAC use increases with the aging of the US population, further study and targeted educational efforts are needed to drive more evidence-based care of these patients.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^117BC8Le]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of OACs

The effects of warfarin on coagulation extend over the drug's half-life of several days; hence, simply stopping warfarin will not rapidly reverse the anticoagulated state. Emergency management of patients treated with warfarin is discussed in depth in many clinical guidelines that advise on interventions according to INR status, the need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity; these are reviewed in table 3. Vitamin K 1 (phytonadione), administered orally or intravenously, can be used to accelerate warfarin reversal to some extent by counteracting its effects on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis. The effect of vitamin K 1 on reversal of VKA-based anticoagulation is not immediate but will progress over 18–24 h or more as the liver synthesises sufficient quantities of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors II, VII, IX and X) to re-establish effective clotting, a process that takes even longer in the presence of liver disease or other metabolic or nutritional problems.

Clinical prediction rules for bleeding while taking vitamin K antagonists (VKA) — The annual incidence of warfarin-associated major bleeding is estimated at 1% to 3%, and the performance of a rule was considered moderate if the likelihood ratio for a high score to predict major bleeding was > 5.0 and strong if it was ≥ 10.0; two variants of the same clinical prediction rule had a likelihood ratio of ~9. The independently validated mOBRI (modified Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) includes predictors age ≥ 65 years, history of stroke, GI bleed in the past 2 weeks, and at least one of the following comorbidities: recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit level < 30%, creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL, or diabetes mellitus; one point is given for each, with high risk defined as ≥ 3 points. For patients initiating VKA therapy, we suggest against the routine use of clinical prediction rules for bleeding as the sole criterion to withhold VKA therapy (Grade 2C).

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^1168hT6z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^112P542H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range and effect on serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I(2) = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in-range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I(2) = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in-range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I(2) = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in-range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) adverse events and peri-procedural/bleeding management — Reported pediatric event rates include major bleeding 0% to 5.5%, other bleeding 0% to 35.5%, and thrombosis 0% to 13.8%. For procedures, VKA doses should be held 4 to 5 days before the procedure, and bridging with a shorter-acting anticoagulant (usually UFH or LMWH) may be instituted; however, adult studies have shown perioperative bridging may not be needed for most patients due to a threefold increased risk of major bleeding. A single-center pediatric series reported no increases of major bleeding or thromboembolism in 61 instances of peri-procedural interruption in warfarin whether or not bridging was used, and the authors suggest bridging only for pediatric patients at high risk for thrombosis; for those who are bridging, the agent should be continued until the INR has reached desired therapeutic range. For elevated international normalized ratio (INR), adult guidelines suggest that for INR between 4.5 to 10 without bleeding, VKAs should be held until the INR returns to the desired range, and for INRs of > 10 without bleeding, VKAs should be reversed with oral vitamin K.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1138gnTN]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal by interruption — expected INR decline: Interruption of VKAs may be sufficient in patients who need an elective invasive procedure or in asymptomatic patients with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and a low risk for bleeding, and it takes approximately 2.5 days for an INR between 6.0 and 10.0 to decline to < 4.0; with acenocoumarol, the decline is probably no more than 1 day for most patients, phenprocoumon will probably result in a much slower decline, and fluindione is similar to warfarin so a similar decline should be expected.

### Management of thrombophilia [^112fM3Kq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

It is now possible to identify acquired and hereditary risk factors in a substantial percentage of patients presenting with a venous thrombotic event. Discovery of the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations has greatly increased the percentage of patients in whom venous thrombosis can be attributed to hereditary thrombophilia. There is, however, considerable uncertainty as to how this information should be used in patient management. Although prolonged anticoagulation at an international normalized ratio of 2–3 is highly effective in preventing thrombotic recurrences, this benefit is partially offset by major bleeding which occurs at an average rate of 2%-3% per year. A decision as to the overall benefit of extended anticoagulation in the individual patient requires assessment of the risk of recurrence in the absence of treatment vs. the bleeding risk associated with prolonged anticoagulation. Low-intensity warfarin therapy or novel anticoagulants such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors may prove effective strategies for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with thrombophilia.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of COUMADIN anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing COUMADIN therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent COUMADIN therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of COUMADIN administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of COUMADIN is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to COUMADIN overdosage.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with coronary artery disease — comparative antithrombotic strategies indicate that moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] 2.0 to 3.0) reduced myocardial infarction and stroke but increased bleeding 6.0- to 7.7-fold; combining aspirin with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR less than 2.0) was not superior to aspirin alone. High-intensity oral anticoagulation (INR 3.0 to 4.0) is more effective than aspirin but increases bleeding, and aspirin plus moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is more effective than aspirin alone, is as effective as high-intensity warfarin, and has similar bleeding risk; trials have not addressed moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) alone. For long-term management in patients with CAD and atrial fibrillation, options include aspirin alone, aspirin plus moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0), or warfarin alone (INR 2.0 to 3.0); in those with stroke risk factors, the latter two are more effective but involve more bleeding and inconvenience, and without close INR control the combination may carry greater bleeding risk. For most patients with stable CAD, warfarin anticoagulation alone (target INR 2.0 to 3.0) should provide satisfactory antithrombotic prophylaxis against both cerebral and myocardial ischemic events.

### Emergency management of bleeding associated with old and new oral anticoagulants [^1168WbBV]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

As major prescribers of oral anticoagulants, cardiologists must be familiar with strategies to manage bleeding, the principal complication associated with all anticoagulants, and to reverse anticoagulant effects in acute-care settings. The purpose of this manuscript is to review currently available information regarding dabigatran and rivaroxaban, the 2 novel oral anticoagulants approved to date in the United States. Further, we suggest reasonable interventions for the clinician faced with a patient who suffers a major bleeding event while receiving one of these agents. Data sources were peer-reviewed publications, US Food and Drug Administration documents in the public domain, and approved US prescribing information for dabigatran (Pradaxa) and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Strategies for management of bleeding and reversal of anticoagulant effects from warfarin include vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and prothrombin complex concentrates. For rivaroxaban and dabigatran, appropriate therapies include support and observation, which are likely to be effective for the majority of patients because of the short half-lives of these agents. In severe life-threatening hemorrhage, clotting-factor substitutes may be appropriate in certain situations. Validated protocols specific to each agent remain to be developed.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

### Optimizing use of current anticoagulants [^113JMyLa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although warfarin has been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation therapy for decades, evidence-based methods for improving the quality of warfarin therapy remain underused. The arrival of new anticoagulants that do not require routine laboratory monitoring and lack the significant dietary and drug interaction potential that are seen with warfarin is an important evolutionary step in the management of thromboembolic disease. However, it will be years before the efficacy and long-term safety of these new agents are defined. Newer oral anticoagulants will be more expensive than generic warfarin. This article examines various approaches to optimize the clinical use of warfarin. For patients able to achieve stable anticoagulation control, warfarin remains an important therapeutic option, delivering similar clinical outcomes at a fraction of the cost to the health care system.

### The acute management of haemorrhage, surgery and overdose in patients receiving dabigatran [^113G5TdU]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In England and Wales, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and in Scotland the Scottish Medicines Consortium, have recently recommended the anticoagulant, dabigatran, to be considered as an option for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with atrial fibrillation. As prescriptions for dabigatran increase, clinicians will need to be prepared to deal with complications such as bleeding (spontaneous and trauma-related) as well as patients who require semi-urgent or urgent surgery.

The recently published 9th American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guidelinesstate that 'there is insufficient clinical experience to firmly guide the management of major bleeding, suspected overdose, urgently needed surgery, or urgent invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in patients who are taking this new drug'. These comments offer little solace or guidance to a clinician faced with having to manage one of the above described scenarios. This paper aims to provide practical advice to clinicians on the laboratory investigation and acute management of patients presenting while anticoagulated with dabigatran.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^113kApjt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Management of patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with lower gastrointestinal bleeding emphasizes procedural safety and selective reversal: endoscopic hemostasis can be considered safe and effective in patients who have an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 or less. Although most patients with LGIB on VKAs are unlikely to require reversal, we suggest reversal of patients who present with a life-threatening LGIB and have an INR substantially exceeding the therapeutic range; for those requiring reversal to prevent stroke in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is preferred to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) because of the rapidity of INR reduction (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In patients with minor bleeding who are unlikely to require a hospital-based intervention (e.g. Oakland score ≤ 8), oral anticoagulants may be held, and reversal is unnecessary; for patients with more significant bleeding requiring hospitalization, oral anticoagulants should be held at admission. Endoscopic therapy is effective even at moderately elevated INR levels (2.5 or less); however, reversal agents should be considered before endoscopy in patients with severe bleeding with hemodynamic instability and significant prolongation in INR substantially exceeding therapeutic levels.

Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs", and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017".

### A three-year prospective study of the presentation and clinical outcomes of major bleeding episodes associated with oral anticoagulant use in the UK (ORANGE study) [^115vSMkx]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

A key strength of this study is that the data were prospectively collected by over 30 hospitals across the UK, with information retrieved directly from patients' case notes and not from large databases in which data are collected for different reasons, or missed by administrative coding. – This has enabled us to document for the first time in the UK the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients who develop major bleeding associated with different OAC when prescribed for any clinical indications. Additionally, over three-quarters of cases were fully reported within 90 days of the major bleeding episode, ensuring a high degree of fidelity with actual events and minimizing the chance of recall bias. Furthermore, we were able to collect data on the acute management of major bleeding, whereas this is not usually possible from large data sets. Our analysis showed a very low level of inter-hospital variation, which suggests that our findings should be generalizable to the wider population and potentially further afield. Moreover, the design of the study meant that we did not rely on patients' consent, a further potential source of selection bias.

Our study also provides data on the outcomes of major bleeding that are more generalizable to contemporary practice than those observed in the randomized clinical trials. Patients in the latter were more highly selected, and the management of major bleeding in the trials appears different from current recommended practice; for example, among those with major bleeding in the open-label warfarin arm of the RELY trial only 27% received vitamin K and 1% received a prothrombin complex concentratein contrast to over 70% for both in our study.

We identified patients who developed major bleeding on OAC and were admitted to hospital, but it is possible that not every case was captured, because they were not triaged to emergency departments, and thus could have been missed by the research team. The upshot is that we may have collected data on the more severe bleeding cases with consequently worse outcomes, although we expect the numbers affected to be relatively small. Furthermore, it could be argued that warfarin cases would have been easier to capture through the prescription of prothrombin complex concentrate. However, the methods of case identification were designed to capture all cases of major bleeding from hospitals, independently of the type of OAC, but we recognize that some cases could have been inadvertently missed.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^111ffQko]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are indicated for the treatment of thrombosis and in the prevention of thromboembolism. This includes the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), prevention of thrombosis in medically ill and postsurgical patients, and the prevention of thromboembolic stroke in atrial fibrillation. Patients using OACs are likely to be seen in the emergency department (ED) for the same reasons as other individuals of similar age and health, but also because all anticoagulant therapies carry a risk of treatment-related bleeding that, if it occurs, may require emergent evaluation and treatment.

The vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin (eg, Coumadin, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, New York, USA) has been the standard OAC for > 50 years, with > 30 million prescriptions written annually in the United States alone. As well as the increased bleeding risk common to anticoagulants, the complex and variable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin create the further challenge of avoiding unpredictable subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Bleeding resulting from supratherapeutic activity ranges in severity from clinically manageable epistaxis to life-threatening intracranial haemorrhage. In a prospective observational study in the UK, warfarin was implicated in 10.5% of adult hospital admissions for adverse drug reactions over a 6-month period ending in April 2002. Following a survey (2004–2005) of nationally representative public health surveillance data in the United States, which disclosed that warfarin was implicated in 17.3% of ED visits for adverse drug events in older adults, Budnitz et al observed that despite frequent emergency visits for warfarin-related adverse drug events, as one of a small group of 'often critical' medications, warfarin should not be labelled as inappropriate for use in older adults, according to Beers criteria. Many patients on warfarin who are seen in the ED for anticoagulation-related or other issues have either a subtherapeutic or a supratherapeutic international normalised ratio (INR). More than 90% of warfarin-related emergency hospitalisations in older patients are attributed to unintentional overdose.

### Does celecoxib potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin? A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^11138n1o]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The management of patients who are receiving warfarin therapy and have musculoskeletal problems that require treatment with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) is problematic because NSAID use may increase the risk for bleeding. Cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs such as celecoxib may be less likely to promote gastrointestinal bleeding; however, there are concerns that they could potentiate the anticoagulation effect of warfarin.

Objective

To determine whether celecoxib potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, as measured by the international normalized ratio (INR).

Methods

We performed a randomized, controlled, crossover trial to assess the effect on INR of celecoxib versus codeine (control treatment) in 15 patients who were receiving warfarin therapy and required analgesic treatment for osteoarthritis. During Phase 1 of the study, patients were randomly allocated to receive celecoxib 200 mg/day or codeine phosphate 7–15 mg 3–4 times daily for 5 weeks. During Phase 2 of the study, patients stopped the first study medication and started the other study medication; there was no drug-free interval between phases. Weekly INR testing was performed during the 10 week study period. Adopting the intent-to-treat principle, we used generalized estimating equations to analyze the data.

Results

There was no significant difference in the mean INR values during each 5 week treatment period when patients received either celecoxib or codeine. There was, therefore, insufficient evidence to reject the hypothesis that these 2 treatments had an equal effect on the INR (mean difference [95% CI] 0.10 [-0.04 to 0.24]; p = 0.16) based on mean imputation. This finding was confirmed after we repeated the analysis with multiple imputations (mean difference [95% CI] 0.093 [-0.16 to 0.35]; p = 0.47).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that treatment with celecoxib does not potentiate the INR when taken with warfarin. Larger randomized trials are warranted to address the effects of coadministered warfarin and celecoxib on clinical outcomes.

### Management of patients taking warfarin… [^115na3Mj]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Experts at the College of American Pathologists recently recommended that the INR be checked at least four times during the first week of therapy. This frequency could then be gradually decreased, based on the stability of the INR. Because the risk of hemorrhage is highest in the first six to 12 weeks of treatment, checking the INR weekly may be reasonable during this time. The maximum interval between tests should be no more than four to six weeks., dietary indiscretion or a change in the patient's health. If no reversible cause is found, a change in dosage may be made, with a review of the INR within two weeks. Close attention to the INR is needed because the patients who have the most variation in results are most likely to develop hemorrhage or thromboembolism. In asymptomatic patients whose INR is elevated, temporary discontinuation of the drug is an option, but administration of vitamin K1 will shorten the time to return to the target INR.

There is indirect evidence that use of vitamin K1 is associated with a lower incidence of hemorrhage. Oral vitamin K. 1 is effective and may have fewer risks than the parenterally administered form. When a patient's INR is between 5 and 9, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends temporary discontinuation of warfarin therapy. If the patient is at risk for hemorrhage, low-dose oral vitamin K 1 also should be given. If the INR is elevated and the patient is bleeding, fresh-frozen plasma or a concentrate of clotting factors will be required. A repeat INR should be obtained shortly after the fresh-frozen plasma is given. More fresh-frozen plasma may be needed because its effects are fairly short-lived. A large dose of vitamin K1 should also be given. Vitamin K1 will probably need to be readmin-istered because the half-life of warfarin is longer than the half-life of vitamin K1.

Daily INR measurements will be needed. Patients who are managed with anticoagulation-consultation services have fewer adverse events and lower rates of bleeding, although these services are not commonly employed. Future improvements to management of patients on warfarin therapy include the use of handheld devices that can measure the INR at a site remote from the physician's office or laboratory.

### Anticoagulation therapy in the… [^1139FRHM]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Loading doses of warfarin may increase the patient's risk of bleeding episodes early in therapy by eliminating or severely reducing the production of functional factor VII. The administration of loading doses is a possible source of prolonged hospitalization secondary to dramatic rises in INR that necessitate increased monitoring. Administration of loading doses has also been hypothesized to potentiate a hypercoagulable state because of severe depletion of protein C. The practice of using loading doses should be abandoned because it has no effect on the inhibition of thrombosis. Hemorrhagic Complications The most common complication of warfarin therapy is bleeding, which occurs in 6 to 39 percent of recipients annually. 4, 21 The incidence of bleeding is directly related to the intensity of anticoagulation.

With the reductions in anticoagulation intensity that have evolved over the past 20 years, the incidence of hemorrhagic complications has decreased dramatically. In patients receiving warfarin therapy, the median annual rate of major bleeding ranges from 0. 9 to
2. 7 percent, and the median annual rate of fatal bleeding ranges from 0. 07 to
0. 7 percent. The incidence of complications varies within the ranges, depending on the clinical indication and the intensity of anticoagulation. Intracranial hemorrhage accounts for approximately 2 percent of the reported hemorrhagic complications of warfarin therapy and is associated with a mortality rate of 10 to 68 percent. 22 If bleeding occurs during warfarin therapy, the physician should immediately consider the severity of bleeding, the intensity of anticoagulation at the time of the bleeding episode and whether the patient has completed most of the prescribed course of therapy.

Recommendations for the reversal of high INR values in patients with or without bleeding are summarized in Figure 4. 4 Warfarin resistance is common after the administration of large doses of vitamin K. If anticoagulation therapy must be continued, heparin therapy should be initiated until the effects of vitamin K have been reversed and the patient is again responsive to warfarin. This reduction in events was associated with similar major bleeding rates. Interestingly, in the adjusted-dose group, the INR was greater than 3 in seven of the 12 major bleeding events.

### Warfarin management with mild elevation of INR… [^1131KT3C]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Using warfarin increases the risk of hemorrhage, particularly when the International Normalized Ratio rises above the therapeutic range. Most experts agree that when the INR exceeds four or five, the warfarin dosage should be decreased. However, there currently is no consensus about how to treat the asymptomatic patient who has a mildly elevated INR in the 3. 2 to
3. 4 range. In addition, the anticoagulation service telephoned every patient who had an elevated INR and asked about any potential cause for the increase and assessed any risk for bleeding. The warfarin dosage, and the time and value of the follow-up INR were recorded for analysis. Adverse events were recorded for the anticoagulation group. A cohort of 231 patients was analyzed for the study, with 103 of those in the anticoagulation service group. The anticoagulation service group had only one episode of epistaxis in the 30 days after the elevated INR.

Patients in the primary care group were more likely to have a reduction in their warfarin dosage than patients in the anticoagulation service group. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the median INR. In a subgroup analysis, the patients in the anticoagulation service group were more likely to have a follow-up therapeutic INR than those in the primary care group. The median follow-up INR in those with no change in the dosage was 2. 7,
2. 5 in those who reduced the dosage by 1 to 20 percent, and 1. 7 in patients who had the dosage reduced by 21 to 43 percent. The authors conclude that maintaining the same warfarin dosage in asymptomatic patients with a slightly elevated INR of 3. 2 to
3. 4 is appropriate management for these patients. They add that a dosage reduction of more than 20 percent should be avoided in patients with mild elevation of the INR because of the increased risk of subsequent adverse events.

This strategy provides physicians with a management option that does not increase the risk of bleeding but also does not decrease the INR to subtherapeutic levels. — k. e. m.

### Bleeding with anticoagulants: ACC releases expert… [^117BSntu]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

- Major and nonmajor bleeding requiring hospitalization, surgery, or transfusion should be controlled and oral anticoagulants discontinued.
- Major life-threatening bleeding or bleeding at a critical site warrant a reversal agent. From the AFP Editors. Withholding Anticoagulants Major and nonmajor bleeding requiring hospitalization, surgery, or transfusion should be controlled and oral anticoagulants discontinued. In patients with nonmajor bleeding, temporary discontinuation of anticoagulants may be necessary. Factors affecting this decision include whether the anticoagulation is therapeutic or supratherapeutic, upcoming invasive procedures, the patient's underlying bleeding risk, concern for slow bleed or need for further evaluation of clinical impact of bleed, presence of anemia requiring transfusion, and medical comorbidities.

Using Reversal Agents In patients with a major bleeding event, even if it is not at a critical site or life threatening, local therapy, manual compression, and supportive care should be provided. Any antiplatelet agents should be discontinued, and those receiving vitamin K antagonists should also be given intravenous vitamin K. Any comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding should be managed, and surgical management of bleeding should be considered. Available agents include 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate for warfarin, dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban; activated prothrombin complex concentrate as a second-line option for dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban; idarucizumab for dabigatran; and plasma for warfarin if 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate is not available.

Patients with nonmajor bleeding that requires hospitalization, surgery, or transfusion and who are on vitamin K antagonists should receive oral or intravenous vitamin K. Those not on vitamin K antagonists should not receive a reversal agent. Local therapy, manual compression, and supportive care should be provided; antiplatelets discontinued; contributing comorbidities managed; and surgery considered. For all other nonmajor bleeding, anticoagulants may be continued if clinically indicated; however, these patients should also receive local therapy and manual compression. Antiplatelet treatment should be reassessed to determine if it should be discontinued, comorbidities should be managed, and anticoagulant dosing reevaluated.

### Monitoring warfarin therapy… [^116uJFYd]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Laboratory studies demonstrated a prothrombin time of 24. 0, an International Normalized Ratio of
4. 65 and a hemoglobin level of 150 g per L. Local measures to control the bleeding failed. Hemostasis was ultimately achieved by placing anteroposterior packing soaked in bacitracin, oxymetazoline and 4 percent cocaine solution. Anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K, 2. 5 mg subcutaneously, and 2 U of fresh frozen plasma. By the next morning, the PT had nearly normalized to 15. 0 and the INR was 1.
71. The patient declined readmission for heparin anticoagulation therapy and was followed daily in our clinic. The lowest hemoglobin level was 102 g per L. Nasal packing was removed after five days without incident, and the patient was restarted on his usual dosage of warfarin. His response was still subtherapeutic when he returned home five days later. We identified two major teaching points in this case.

The first was that the reversal of anticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K was overly aggressive, since the bleeding was controlled. Patients with prosthetic valves are at high risk for systemic embolism, necessitating higher INR values. By administering vitamin K and plasma, coagulopathy was corrected at the cost of increasing the risk of systemic embolism. The cost of fresh frozen plasma and the risk of infection are factors to consider. A more elegant solution, as outlined by Drs. Horton and Bushwick, would have been to hold off the warfarin therapy, follow the PT and INR values, and restart warfarin therapy at a lower dosage while watching for bleeding. In the case presented, the patient experienced epistaxis at an International Normalized Ratio of 4. 65 that required treatment with nasal packing.

Recent literature suggests that if rapid reversal were necessary, the administration of intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrate would be indicated. Rapid reversal with intravenous vitamin K via slow infusion is safe, effective and more rapid than reversal with subcutaneous vitamin K; a minimum of six to 12 hours is necessary to evaluate responsiveness.
