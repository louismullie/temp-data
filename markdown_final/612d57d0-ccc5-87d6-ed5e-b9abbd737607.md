## Question

ferous sulfate dose IDA

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ferrous sulfate dosing for iron deficiency anemia, including how to calculate elemental iron, what dose to start with, how often to dose, special populations, and how to monitor response. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the elemental iron content and how to translate tablet strength into usable iron. Then, I should verify the hepcidin-mediated absorption physiology that informs dosing frequency. Next, I will review guideline-based dosing recommendations and reconcile them with newer evidence on alternate-day dosing. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, older adults, and post-bariatric patients. Finally, I will outline monitoring, expected response, and when to escalate to intravenous iron, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the elemental iron content so I don't misstate dosing. A standard 325 mg ferrous sulfate tablet contains about 65 mg of elemental iron, and many OTC products list 65 mg elemental iron per tablet, which aligns with the pharmacologic convention that ferrous sulfate is roughly 20% elemental iron by weight, so 325 mg × 0.2 ≈ 65 mg elemental iron per tablet [^9eab597d] [^5cce280b] [^85060e74].

> Wait, let me verify the physiologic rationale for dosing frequency before jumping to regimens. Oral iron acutely increases serum hepcidin for up to 24–48 hours, which inhibits ferroportin and reduces fractional absorption from subsequent doses; thus, split daily dosing can paradoxically lower cumulative absorption compared with once-daily or alternate-day strategies, and this has been demonstrated in iron-depleted women using isotope-labeled iron studies showing higher fractional absorption with alternate-day dosing than with consecutive-day dosing [^7327d54f] [^e96674b9] [^03465fff].

> I should confirm guideline positions and reconcile them with newer data. The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends starting with one ferrous sulfate tablet daily and, if not tolerated, reducing to every other day or switching formulation or route, which reflects a pragmatic balance of efficacy and tolerability. The AGA advises once-daily dosing at most and notes that every-other-day dosing may be better tolerated with similar or equal absorption, while acknowledging that evidence is still evolving and not uniformly conclusive across all populations [^79dd9f29] [^73dba1e6] [^a00ffb6f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternate-day superiority in all settings. Randomized trials in adults with IDA show mixed results: some studies suggest comparable hemoglobin responses with alternate-day versus daily dosing and better tolerability, whereas others show no significant advantage in hemoglobin rise, so I should be cautious about overgeneralizing. Mechanistically, alternate-day dosing can increase fractional absorption, but clinical outcomes may be similar when total weekly iron exposure is comparable, and patient-specific factors like adherence and side effects often drive the better net response [^beab2095] [^e96674b9] [^03465fff].

> Let me think about a practical starting regimen. A reasonable first-line approach is 325 mg ferrous sulfate once daily, providing about 65 mg elemental iron, taken on an empty stomach or with a small amount of vitamin C to enhance absorption if tolerated. If gastrointestinal side effects occur, I should consider switching to every-other-day dosing with a higher single dose, such as 120–130 mg elemental iron, or using a different salt or formulation, while avoiding sustained-release products that release iron distal to the duodenum and may be less effective [^79dd9f29] [^73dba1e6] [^11061dfe].

> I need to check special populations carefully. In pregnancy, ACOG supports oral iron as first-line therapy, and many guidelines historically used 100–200 mg elemental iron daily, but emerging data suggest that lower, once-daily dosing may suffice in some patients, and alternate-day regimens can improve tolerability. A recent randomized trial in pregnant women with IDA found no significant hemoglobin advantage to alternate-day over daily dosing, reinforcing that either strategy can be acceptable with close monitoring [^dfb4eefc] [^e7edeba3] [^d36d37e4].

> For children, I should confirm weight-based dosing. The most consistently supported pediatric dose is 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, typically given as ferrous sulfate in divided doses or once daily depending on tolerance. A randomized trial in infants and young children showed that 3 mg/kg/day of elemental iron as ferrous sulfate was effective and achieved better hemoglobin and ferritin responses than iron polysaccharide complex, supporting ferrous sulfate as preferred in this age group [^6ff026bf] [^fa92b80f].

> In older adults, I should double-check the evidence for low-dose strategies. Studies in octogenarians demonstrate that 15–50 mg elemental iron daily can normalize hemoglobin as effectively as 150 mg, with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects, so starting low and titrating based on tolerance and response is sensible, and alternate-day dosing can further improve adherence in those with side effects [^8c91c7be] [^cc261f64].

> For patients after bariatric surgery, I need to ensure I'm not recommending oral therapy that won't work. Malabsorption and ongoing blood loss are common, so IV iron is often preferred when IDA is significant or oral therapy fails. If oral iron is attempted, higher daily elemental iron doses may be used, but expectations should be tempered and escalation to IV iron should be prompt if there is inadequate response [^7dc90263] [^c742d349].

> Next, I should review monitoring and expected response so I can catch nonresponders early. A practical approach is to recheck hemoglobin in 2–4 weeks and expect a rise of about 1–2 g/dL if iron is being absorbed and blood loss is controlled. A hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency and an appropriate response to therapy, and treatment should continue for roughly 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replete stores, with periodic follow-up to detect recurrence [^80df5a00] [^79dd9f29] [^7e0a572d].

> But wait, what if there is no response or the patient cannot tolerate oral iron. I should confirm adherence, review administration technique, and evaluate for ongoing blood loss or malabsorption. If oral iron is ineffective or not tolerated, intravenous iron is appropriate, with modern formulations allowing 1–2 infusions to replete deficits, and IV iron is particularly advantageous in inflammatory states, CKD, IBD with active disease, post-bariatric surgery, or when rapid repletion is needed [^73dba1e6] [^c226577c] [^cdb68180].

> I should double-check a potential inconsistency I noticed earlier. Some summaries suggest vitamin C coadministration improves absorption and is commonly recommended, but a large randomized trial found no added benefit of vitamin C for hemoglobin response or iron loading, so I should qualify that recommendation. If used, it may help in select patients, but it is not mandatory and should not replace attention to timing, tolerance, and adherence [^90aba997] [^2bcd92de].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable answer is as follows: for adult iron deficiency anemia, start ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily, which delivers about 65 mg elemental iron, taken on an empty stomach or with a small amount of vitamin C if needed for absorption. If not tolerated, switch to alternate-day dosing with 120–130 mg elemental iron per dose or use a different oral salt, and if there is inadequate response or intolerance, escalate to intravenous iron. Monitor hemoglobin in 2–4 weeks expecting a 1–2 g/dL rise, continue for about 3 months after normalization, and tailor dosing for pregnancy, pediatrics, older adults, and post-bariatric patients as above [^79dd9f29] [^73dba1e6] [^7e0a572d].

The standard adult dose of ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia is **325 mg once daily** [^79dd9f29] or every other day [^a00ffb6f], providing 65 mg of elemental iron per dose [^9eab597d]. This regimen balances efficacy and tolerability, as higher or divided doses increase gastrointestinal side effects without improving absorption due to hepcidin-mediated feedback [^7327d54f] [^e96674b9]. For patients who cannot tolerate daily dosing, **alternate-day dosing** with 120–130 mg elemental iron is reasonable and may improve absorption and tolerability [^e96674b9] [^beab2095]. Continue therapy for about 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replete iron stores, and monitor for a hemoglobin rise of about 1 g/dL every 2–4 weeks [^79dd9f29] [^7e0a572d].

## Standard dosing recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 325 mg ferrous sulfate once daily (65 mg elemental iron) [^79dd9f29] [^9eab597d].
- **Alternate-day dosing**: 120–130 mg elemental iron every other day may improve absorption and tolerability [^e96674b9] [^beab2095].
- **Duration**: Continue for approximately 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replete iron stores [^79dd9f29].

---

## Rationale for current dosing strategies

Recent evidence shows that **once-daily or alternate-day dosing** is as effective as divided dosing, with better tolerability [^7327d54f] [^e96674b9]. Hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron absorption, rises after oral iron and persists for 24–48 hours, limiting absorption from subsequent doses; thus, less frequent dosing can improve fractional absorption [^7327d54f] [^e96674b9].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current dosing

- **Alternate-day dosing**: Higher fractional absorption and similar hemoglobin response compared with daily dosing in iron-deficient women [^e96674b9] [^7327d54f].
- **Once-daily dosing**: Comparable hemoglobin rise to divided dosing with fewer gastrointestinal side effects [^b17eeaa0] [^03465fff].
- **Low-dose therapy**: 15–50 mg elemental iron daily can be effective in elderly patients with fewer side effects [^8c91c7be] [^cc261f64].

---

## Factors influencing dosing adjustments

- **Tolerance**: Reduce dose or switch to alternate-day dosing if gastrointestinal side effects occur [^66e48c4d] [^a00ffb6f].
- **Severity of anemia**: More severe anemia may require closer monitoring and consideration of intravenous iron if oral therapy fails [^ef4bc942] [^cbd61487].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and concurrent medications may influence dosing and absorption [^cc261f64] [^03465fff].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor **hemoglobin** every 2–4 weeks; expect a rise of about 1 g/dL every 2–4 weeks if therapy is effective [^7e0a572d] [^80df5a00]. Assess ferritin after 4–8 weeks to confirm repletion of iron stores [^notfound]. Evaluate adherence and side effects at each visit to optimize therapy [^9dd8c36d].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Dosing strategy** | **Elemental iron dose** | **Frequency** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Standard dose | 65 mg | Once daily | Effective and well tolerated |
| Alternate-day dosing | 120–130 mg | Every other day | Improved absorption and tolerability |
| Low-dose therapy | 15–50 mg | Once daily | Effective in elderly with fewer side effects |

---

The recommended ferrous sulfate dose for iron deficiency anemia is **325 mg once daily** (65 mg elemental iron), with alternate-day dosing as a reasonable alternative to enhance absorption and tolerability [^79dd9f29] [^a00ffb6f].

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

Treatment of IDA

17. We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

18. We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

19. Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

20. We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

21. We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see text), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

22. There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see text), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality-low, consensus-92%, statement strength-weak).

23. After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bba815d5]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts remain the mainstay of oral iron supplementation. Their high efficacy is offset by poor tolerability and reduced compliance, which sparked the development of alternative oral iron supplements. Recent studies with ferrous sulfate provided new insights on optimal dosage and frequency. Additional adequately powered RCT are required to address open questions on efficacy, side effects, optimal dosage and frequency of different types of oral iron supplements for selected groups of patients. As none of the old or new oral iron formulations has shown non-inferiority versus intravenous iron, comparisons against the gold standard (ferrous sulfate) would be more informative. The effects of oral iron supplements on hepcidin should also be investigated in animal models and clinical studies. Based on current knowledge, the choice between iron formulations should depend on the individual's iron status, tolerance, absorption capacity, and specific therapeutic goals.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Effect of low-dose ferrous sulfate vs iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in young children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^fa92b80f]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affects millions of persons worldwide, and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment in infants and children. Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly prescribed oral iron despite iron polysaccharide complex possibly being better tolerated.

Objective

To compare the effect of ferrous sulfate with iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in infants and children with nutritional IDA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, superiority randomized clinical trial of infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA (assessed by history and laboratory criteria) that was conducted in an outpatient hematology clinic at a US tertiary care hospital from September 2013 through November 2015; 12-week follow-up ended in January 2016.

Interventions

Three mg/kg of elemental iron once daily as either ferrous sulfate drops or iron polysaccharide complex drops for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included complete resolution of IDA (defined as hemoglobin concentration > 11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume > 70 fL, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent > 25 pg, serum ferritin level > 15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity < 425 μg/dL at the 12-week visit), changes in serum ferritin level and total iron-binding capacity, adverse effects.

Results

Of 80 randomized infants and children (median age, 22 months; 55% male; 61% Hispanic white; 40 per group), 59 completed the trial (28 [70%] in ferrous sulfate group; 31 [78%] in iron polysaccharide complex group). From baseline to 12 weeks, mean hemoglobin increased from 7.9 to 11.9 g/dL (ferrous sulfate group) vs 7.7 to 11.1 g/dL (iron complex group), a greater difference of 1.0 g/dL (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.6 g/dL; P < .001) with ferrous sulfate (based on a linear mixed model). Proportion with a complete resolution of IDA was higher in the ferrous sulfate group (29% vs 6%; P = 0.04). Median serum ferritin level increased from 3.0 to 15.6 ng/mL (ferrous sulfate) vs 2.0 to 7.5 ng/mL (iron complex) over 12 weeks, a greater difference of 10.2 ng/mL (95% CI, 6.2 to 14.1 ng/mL; P < .001) with ferrous sulfate. Mean total iron-binding capacity decreased from 501 to 389 μg/dL (ferrous sulfate) vs 506 to 417 μg/dL (iron complex) (a greater difference of -50 μg/dL [95% CI, -86 to -14 μg/dL] with ferrous sulfate; P < .001). There were more reports of diarrhea in the iron complex group than in the ferrous sulfate group (58% vs 35%, respectively; P = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate compared with iron polysaccharide complex resulted in a greater increase in hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks. Once daily, low-dose ferrous sulfate should be considered for children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^73dba1e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^b1d847e6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Conventional oral iron formulations

The British Society of Gastroenterology recommends ferrous preparations, specifically ferrous sulphate, as first-line therapy for iron replenishment as they are cheap, have good bioavailability, available in multiple preparations and have been shown to replenish iron stores and correct anaemia effectively. However, there are also many limitations to their use, with the most common being the frequency and severity of side effects. A systematic review demonstrated that GI side effects were the most problematic with constipation being the most frequent complaint, followed by nausea and diarrhoea. This will have a resultant effect on patient adherence, likely leading to cessation and, thus, inadequate treatment.

The appropriate dosing of ferrous iron preparations is also a contentious issue between clinicians. To adequately replenish iron stores, therapeutic treatment of IDA was initially felt to require 200 mg of iron sulphate 2–3 times per day in order to raise Hb by 20 g/L over a 4-week period, with treatment continuing for 3 months. However, the daily doses of elemental iron should not be greater than 100 mg/dayas the body can only absorb 10–20 mg of iron per day. It should be noted that 200 mg of ferrous sulphate is equivalent to 65 mg of elemental iron.

A recent study compared oral iron dosing regimens in women with mild anaemia with divided daily, once daily and alternate-day dosing. The results demonstrated superiority with alternate-day dosing, with 33% greater fractional iron absorption over 14 doses. In addition, a randomised trial of elderly patients with IDA received 15 mg, 50 mg or 150 mg of elemental iron per day. After 2 months, the mean increase in Hb was the same in all groups (1.4 g/dL); however, adverse effects were significantly greater with higher doses. It is, therefore, an evolving view that a single daily dose (40–60 mg) or a slightly higher alternate-day dose (80–100 mg) is the preferred dosing regimen in order to reduce the side effects and optimise the proportion of elemental iron absorbed.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^daad4201]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In two prospective, open-label RCT with non-anemic, iron-deficient, premenopausal women, the participants received ferrous sulfate containing three different iron isotopes. The first study examined the differences between intake of 60 mg elemental iron on consecutive versus alternate days, while the second study assessed the impact of split dosing of 120 mg elemental iron (in two doses of 60 mg each per day) versus single daily dosing. In line with the pilot data, split dosing twice per day, as well as single daily dosing of 120 mg iron induced hepcidin, which diminished iron absorption the next day. Using the same methodology, a cross-over study involving premenopausal women with IDA compared iron absorption from ferrous sulfate at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg elemental iron administered either on two consecutive days or on alternate days. Total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was almost twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days. In a RCT with IDA patients, the primary endpoint of a 2 g/ dL rise in hemoglobin at 3 and 6 weeks was reached by significantly more patients taking 60 mg elemental iron twice daily versus 120 mg on alternate days. However, the median hemoglobin rise in the "alternate day" arm at 6 weeks was not significantly different from that in the "twice daily" arm at 3 weeks, while the treatment was better tolerated in the "alternate day" group. Similar results were obtained by other studies involving IDA patients. Current evidence supports the concept that intermittent iron supplementation every other day may be as effective as daily supplementation in controlling IDA, but with fewer adverse effects, at least in women of reproductive age. Nevertheless, this view is based on a small number of studies, some of them with methodological limitations. Thus, validation in more robust and adequately powered RCT with IDA patients of various etiologies is warranted. In any case, the new findings are reflected in the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, which recommend an initial treatment of IDA with " one tablet per day of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered ". It should be noted that all data favoring oral iron supplementation every other day were obtained using ferrous sulfate. Therefore, the recommendation for intermittent iron intake is restricted to ferrous salts. Whether this also applies to other iron supplements remains to be examined. There is evidence that ferric maltol induces hepcidin similarly to ferrous sulfate in IBD patients, while ferric citrate promoted a stronger increase in hepcidin compared to ferrous sulfate in non-dialysis CKD patients. On the other hand, administration of iron protein succinylateor sucrosomial ® irondid not affect hepcidin in rats and mice, respectively. Interestingly, ferric citrateor sucrosomial ® ironeffectively increased hemoglobinization in mouse models of hepcidin overexpression. These findings may be relevant to anemic patients who respond poorly to conventional oral iron supplements and require intravenous iron. This occurs in a subset of IBD or CKD patients who exhibit restricted iron availability for erythropoiesis due to inflammatory hepcidin induction (and impaired renal clearance of hepcidin in CKD), combined with IDA or not. The same considerations apply to patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), a genetic disorder caused by inactivation of the hepcidin suppressor TMPRSS6.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^cc261f64]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Management of IDA

Management of IDA in older adults includes iron supplementation and addressing the cause of IDA. Repletion of iron using oral iron formulations, typically containing 50 to 65 mg of elemental iron, can be challenging for many older adults because of side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.

A misconception exists that high-dose oral iron, 3 times a day, represents the best way to treat IDA. The absorption of oral iron is optimal when it is taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before a meal or 2 hours after a meal). Alternate day dosing of oral iron also allows better absorption because there is an acute rise in hepcidin for 24 hours after oral iron is ingested. For management of IDA in older adults, 1 study found equivalent hemoglobin response and iron repletion, but with less toxicity, with once daily iron at 15 mg compared with 50 mg or 150 mg of iron daily. Consequently, in patients who do not tolerate formulations with > 50 mg of elemental iron, a switch to low-dose iron formulations should be considered.

IV iron is recommended for patients who have an intolerance or inadequate response to oral iron or malabsorption conditions such as history of gastric bypass. Numerous IV iron formulations exist. Iron replacement has been previously reviewed. From a practical perspective, institutions may have preferred IV iron formulations.

The patient in case 2 was treated with 1 dose of IV low–molecular weight dextran 1000 mg. Her walking endurance improved, and she achieved a normal hemoglobin level. She continued oral ferrous sulfate every other day because of an ongoing need for aspirin for secondary prevention of CAD. We concluded that the patient had occult gastrointestinal bleeding from either gastritis or an occult source. Small-bowel interrogation is a consideration now or in the future. We recommended at least annual monitoring for development of new symptoms or recurrence of IDA.

Case 2 educational points

In older adults with IDA, it is important to determine the cause of iron deficiency and review how the patient is taking oral iron and adherence to iron supplementation and side effects. Counsel patients on methods of taking iron that will promote optimal absorption, such as alternate day dosing and taking it on an empty stomach. IV iron is generally safe for older adults and should be used in patients who are unable to tolerate, or respond inadequately to, oral iron supplementation.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^4cb8ed71]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

When we evaluated age-adjusted doses of supplementation (see online supplemental appendix 3 for the age-specific dose categories), trials in the lowest dose tertile across all ages used lower amounts than recommended by WHO (10–12.5 mg/day for ages 6–23 months, 30 mg/day for ages 24–59 months and 30–60 mg/day for ages 5–12 years). Compared with lower age-adjusted doses of supplementation and adjusting for baseline anaemia, moderate doses were associated with greater improvements in haemoglobin, ferritin and IDA (table 3; online supplemental appendix 6). However, the lower dose still produced benefits; and no linear dose–response was seen: compared with lower dose, the highest doses were not associated with significantly greater effects.

When comparing the effect of iron stratified by the baseline prevalence of anaemia, trials conducted among entirely anaemic populations demonstrated approximately twofold increases in haemoglobin (global p interaction < 0.001) and reductions in endline anaemia (global p interaction = 0.004) relative to non-anaemic populations (online supplemental appendix 7). Heterogeneity was observed for some outcomes by child age and sex, although there was no consistent pattern. Effects of iron on haematologic outcomes were similar across WHO regions, except for the impact on IDA (global p interaction = 0.007). Comparing types of supplements, ferrous sulfate was associated with the largest increases in haemoglobin (p = 0.02) and serum ferritin (p = 0.005) and the largest reduction in IDA (p < 0.001) compared with other iron formulations.

Cosupplementation

In factorial trials of iron and zinc supplementation, a borderline interaction was seen for iron effects on the prevalence of anaemia, with stronger reductions in anaemia among children not receiving zinc (PR = 0.41 (0.33, 0.50)) versus those receiving zinc (PR = 0.64 (0.48, 0.84)) (p interaction = 0.048) (table 4). No significant differences by zinc cosupplementation were seen for haemoglobin, ferritin, ID or IDA, although effects generally appeared qualitatively stronger without zinc cosupplementation for each of these outcomes. Zinc alone provided no statistically significant benefits for haematologic outcomes (online supplemental appendix 8). There was no statistically significant difference in the effect of iron supplementation when administered with or without vitamin A. Vitamin A alone improved haemoglobin and anaemia outcomes (online supplemental appendix 8).

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^896c53cc]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 4: Avoid packed red blood cell transfusion for asymptomatic children with IDA and no active bleeding.

The fourth ASH-ASPHO recommendation advises against the transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in asymptomatic children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with no evidence of hemodynamic instability or active bleeding. IDA is the most common cause of anemia across all age groups, and it affects 2 billion individuals worldwide, including 2 million in the United States. IDA usually develops over time (ie, chronic process), and most patients are asymptomatic, even those with very low hemoglobin. The 2 key steps in managing IDA in children are (1) initiating iron replacement therapy by oral or intravenous routes, which usually leads to a rapid increase in hemoglobin levelsand (2) treating the underlying etiologies (eg, restricting excessive cow's milk intake for toddlers or starting hormonal contraceptive therapy for adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding). Ferrous sulfate is a frequently prescribed oral iron formulation divided into 2 or 3 daily doses, or as a low-dose once-per-day regimen. Often ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated because of adverse gastrointestinal effects. Furthermore, there has been growing evidence to support the utility and the benefits of using alternate-day oral iron supplementation among adults with IDA, especially women. Several studies, including recent randomized controlled trials, reported evidence to suggest comparable hemoglobin response with higher fractional iron absorption and better tolerability using an alternate-day regimen compared with a twice-per-day regimen; there are no similar data in the current literature on pediatric IDA, and future studies are needed to address this research question. Recent studies have also reported data supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron replacement in children and teenswho have demonstrated a poor response to oral iron formulations.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^5a933e1e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Elderly population

Another high-risk population are the elderly where prevalence of iron deficiency increases rapidly with age due to reduce oral intake, poor absorption and excess loss. A meta-analysis of trial data shows treatment of iron deficiency with both oral and intravenous iron reduces blood transfusion requirements and increases Hb levels but does not significantly impact mortalityOral supplementation is recommended for treatment of IDA in this population, and lower doses of oral iron may be effective and better tolerated among elderly patients. For those whose oral treatment has been unsuccessful, intravenous treatment should be considered to avoid adverse effects and effectively treat anaemia. However, potential adaptations of oral therapy should also be considered such as liquid formulations or reducing dose frequency.

IDA in surgery

There is a growing field of evidence to focus on the impact of iron deficiency on morbidity and mortality in the perioperative period. Recently published national guidance recommends that IDA should be identified and treated pre and postoperatively, whether that be via oral or intravenous iron supplementation. Intravenous iron is recommended for those who are unable to tolerate oral iron, those with functional iron deficiency and those with surgical procedures close to the time the IDA was diagnosed. Further research is necessary to assess the impact of the timing of iron replacement prior to surgery.

Pregnancy

Anaemia in pregnancy is defined as Hb < 110 g/L with ferritin levels < 100 μg/L. The total iron loss in pregnancy approximately 1000 mg, and, thus, the recommended daily dietary allowance for iron in pregnancy is 27 mg compared with 8 mg in the adult non-pregnant population. The usual recommended dose of elemental iron is 80 mg, which is equivalent to 250 mg of oral iron sulphate tablets. Intermittent oral iron has been reported to be effective as daily iron dosing in raising Hb levels and is associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects. However, a meta-analysis has demonstrated intravenous iron sucrose improved Hb (mean difference 7.17 g/L) and serum ferritin levels (mean difference 49.66 ug/L) while ferric carboxymaltose improved Hb levels (mean difference 8.52 g/L), compared with oral ferrous sulphate. Furthermore, side effects were less common with the parenteral formulations, but included local pain, skin irritation and rarely allergic reactions.

### Iron absorption from supplements is greater with alternate day than with consecutive day dosing in iron-deficient anemic women [^9ea3e5fc]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia affects ~33% of the world population and accounts for 8.8% of global disability. Iron deficiency (ID) is considered the most prevalent cause of anemia globally. In the United States, nearly 10% of 12 to 49-year-old females have ID. Oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) is recommended to treat ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Because iron absorption from oral supplements tends to be low, current recommendations call for daily provision of high doses of FeSO 4, in the range of 60–200 mg, preferably split into 2 or 3 daily doses. – With larger iron doses, the proportion of the dose absorbed, termed the fractional iron absorption (FIA), decreases, and large amounts of unabsorbed iron can cause gut inflammation, and increase free radical production and peroxidation in the gut mucosa. This may result in gastrointestinal side effects, which are commonand typically dose dependent. Furthermore, an increase in colonic iron can reduce abundances of beneficial commensal gut bacteria and increase abundances of potential enteropathogens.

Hepcidin, the central systemic controller of iron homeostasis in mammals is a 25-amino acid peptide mainly produced by the liver, and is regulated by iron, hypoxia, inflammation and erythropoiesis. Hepcidin binds to ferroportin, mainly expressed on enterocytes, hepatocytes and macrophages, leading to internalization and degradation of ferroportin. Thus, high serum hepcidin (SHep) reduces dietary iron absorption and recycling of iron from senescent erythrocytes. Large oral doses of iron acutely increase SHep in a dose-dependent fashion, with the increase in SHep persisting for ~24 hours (h). The increase after iron administration is distinctfrom the natural circadian increase in SHep over the day. We previously showed that twice daily administration of 60 mg oral iron sharply augments the circadian SHep increase and results in higher SHep on the next day compared to once daily dosing with 120 mg iron.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^6d578d7e]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and pre-anemic iron deficiency are the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most commonly prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate, while other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used. In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol, or nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial® iron. Oral iron supplementation is usually efficacious in correcting iron-deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores but causes gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications. Herein, we critically review literature on relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements, and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^ffdb46f2]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron is essential for oxygen transport, respiration and several biochemical functions by virtue of its ability to form coordination complexes and shuttle between its ferrous (Fe 2+) and ferric (Fe 3+) forms. However, redox reactivity renders iron potentially toxic and excess, unshielded iron promotes oxidative tissue damage. Thus, a balanced iron supply is important, as both iron deficiency and overload cause morbidity.

While iron is abundant, its bioavailability is low. This poses a risk of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) or non-anemic iron deficiency (ID), which are managed by oral (and in specific cases intravenous) iron replacement therapy. During the last years, new oral iron formulations have been added to many already available, while several studies raised questions on optimal dosing and frequency. Recent advances and knowledge gaps in this emerging field are discussed herein.

### Single-dose intravenous iron vs oral iron for treatment of maternal iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^63d3f367]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Maternal iron deficiency anemia is a persistent global health challenge with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Obstetric guidelines advocate for first-line treatment of moderate iron deficiency anemia with twice-daily oral iron; however, rates of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy remain above global targets and are rising.

Objective

Determine whether single-dose intravenous iron for primary treatment of maternal iron deficiency anemia in the second trimester is superior to twice daily oral iron in reducing incidence of low birth weight infants and maternal anemia at delivery.

Study Design

This is a parallel, 3-arm, semiblind superiority randomized controlled multicenter trial across 4 sites in India from March 15, 2021-May 12, 2023. Participants were singleton pregnancies at 14 to 17 weeks with moderate iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin 7.0–9.9 g/dL) who were randomized 1:1:1 to (1) 60 mg oral ferrous sulfate twice daily; or single-dose infusion of (2) intravenous ferric derisomaltose or (3) intravenous ferric carboxymaltose. Two intravenous arms were selected as these are the only 2 intravenous iron formulations publicly available in India. All participants received folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy and antihelminthic therapy, as recommended by national guidelines. The dual primary outcomes were: (1) low birth weight (< 2500 grams) and (2) attainment of a maternal nonanemic state (hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 g/dL at 30–34 weeks or delivery) for each intravenous iron arm vs oral iron; intravenous iron arms were not compared to each other. Secondary outcomes included safety measures, and other maternal and infant outcomes. Participants with hemoglobin < 7 g/dL or < 1 g/dL improvement on therapy received rescue treatment with intravenous iron or blood transfusion as determined by their provider. Sensitivity analyses included defining nonanemic state as achieving hemoglobin ≥ 11.0 without need for additional IV iron or transfusion. Comparison of each intravenous iron arm to oral iron was conducted with a 2-sided alpha set at 0.0005 for achieving nonanemic state and 0.0245 for low birth weight for each intravenous iron arm using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test stratified by enrollment site.

Results

The oral iron, ferric derisomaltose, and ferric carboxymaltose arms included 1450, 1456, and 1462 participants respectively. There was a reduced rate of low birth weight with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (25.2%, relative risk 0.87 [97.55% confidence interval 0.75, 0.99], P = 0.017), but not intravenous ferric derisomaltose (29.1%, relative risk 0.98 [97.55% confidence interval 0.86, 1.12], P = 0.71) vs oral iron (29.3%). Achievement of nonanemic state was not improved: intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (relative risk 1.05 [99.95% confidence interval 0.97–1.15]) and intravenous ferric derisomaltose (relative risk 1.06 [99.95% confidence interval 0.98, 1.16]) vs oral (69.7%). In sensitivity analysis, there was increased rate of achieving nonanemic state without use of additional IV iron or transfusion in both intravenous ferric derisomaltose (relative risk 1.25 (1.13–1.396), P < .0001) and intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (relative risk 1.24 (1.12–1.38), P < .0001) vs oral iron.

Conclusion

First-line treatment of moderate maternal iron deficiency anemia with single-dose infusion of intravenous iron results in a reduced incidence of low birth weight infants (intravenous ferric carboxymaltose vs oral) and a higher incidence of attaining maternal nonanemic state without use of additional iron or blood transfusion (intravenous ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose vs oral). Clinical guidelines should address the potential benefit of single-dose intravenous iron as the primary treatment of moderate iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy.

### Iron supplementation in singleton pregnancy: is there a benefit to doubling the dose of elemental iron in iron-deficient pregnant women? a randomized controlled trial [^fcdd1896]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of doubling the 30mg dose of iron in women with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in singleton pregnancies.

Study Design

Prospective randomized controlled trial. Iron-deficient women were randomized during the second trimester to receive one or two capsules of daily iron supplement, containing 34mg of ferrous sulfate, from 17 weeks until 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was hemoglobin (Hgb) at 35 weeks. Secondary outcomes included ferritin at 35 weeks, Hgb during pregnancy and postpartum, birth weights, preterm birth rate, gastrointestinal side effects, intravenous iron administration and compliance.

Results

In all, 160 women were randomized to receive one capsule and 164 received two capsules. Both groups had similar Hgb (10.1gdl -1) and ferritin (9.3 and 9.4ngl -1) at allocation. Hgb concentration in both groups was similar at 35 weeks (10.8gdl -1). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

In IDA pregnant women, a single dose of iron is as effective as a double dose.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^a4cf83f5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: In individuals with inflammatory bowel disease and iron-deficiency anemia, clinicians first should determine whether iron-deficiency anemia is owing to inadequate intake or absorption, or loss of iron, typically from gastrointestinal bleeding. Active inflammation should be treated effectively to enhance iron absorption or reduce iron depletion. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Intravenous iron therapy should be given in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, iron-deficiency anemia, and active inflammation with compromised absorption. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia, oral iron supplements initially should be used to replenish iron stores. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in patients with ongoing bleeding who do not respond to oral iron therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: In individuals with portal hypertensive gastropathy and iron-deficiency anemia without another identified source of chronic blood loss, treatment of portal hypertension with nonselective β-blockers can be considered. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: In individuals with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to gastric antral vascular ectasia who have an inadequate response to iron replacement, consider endoscopic therapy with endoscopic band ligation or thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: In patients with iron-deficiency anemia and celiac disease, ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet to improve iron absorption. Consider oral iron supplementation based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance, followed by intravenous iron therapy if iron stores do not improve. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Deep enteroscopy performed in patients with iron-deficiency anemia suspected to have small-bowel bleeding angioectasias should be performed with a distal attachment to improve detection and facilitate treatment. Small-bowel angioectasias may be treated with ablative thermal therapies such as argon plasma coagulation or with mechanical methods such as hemostatic clips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Endoscopic treatment of angioectasias should be accompanied with iron replacement. Medical therapy for small-bowel angioectasias should be reserved for compassionate treatment in refractory cases when iron replacement and endoscopic therapy are ineffective.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia: a survey of pediatric hematology / oncology specialists [^10b402a9]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common hematologic condition in children and adolescents in the United States (US). No prior reports have described the management of IDA by a large cohort of pediatric hematology/oncology specialists.

Procedure

A 20-question electronic survey that solicited responses to two hypothetical cases of IDA was sent to active members of the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) in the US.

Results

Of 1,217 recipients, 398 (32.7%) reported regularly treating IDA and completed the survey. In a toddler with nutritional IDA, 15% (N = 61) of respondents reported ordering no diagnostic test beyond a complete blood count. Otherwise, wide variability in laboratory testing was reported. For treatment, most respondents would prescribe ferrous sulfate (N = 335, 84%) dosed at 6 mg/kg/day (N = 248, 62%) divided twice daily (N = 272, 68%). The recommended duration of iron treatment after resolution of anemia and normalized serum ferritin varied widely from 0 to 3 months. For an adolescent with heavy menstrual bleeding and IDA, most respondents recommended ferrous sulfate (N = 327, 83%), with dosing based on the number of tablets daily. For IDA refractory to oral treatment, intravenous iron therapy was recommended most frequently, 48% (N = 188) using iron sucrose, 17% (N = 68) ferric gluconate, and 15% (N = 60) low molecular weight iron dextran.

Conclusion

The approach to diagnosis and treatment of IDA in childhood was widely variable among responding ASPHO members. Given the lack of an evidence base to guide clinical decision making, further research investigating IDA management is needed.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bde6cc85]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal dosage and frequency of oral iron supplementation

The elemental iron content (actual amount of iron available for absorption) differs between commercial iron formulations (Table 1). Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing ~60–70 mg elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach, to reach a daily dose of ~200 mg elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to reach the target of increasing hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple dosing per day. The studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aiming to prevent iron overload. These are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption(Figure 2).

Thus, the effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study with non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate in different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, so that each participant served as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher triggered induction of hepcidin for up to 24 h, which decreased fractional iron absorption from a subsequent dose the following day. Hepcidin levels returned to baseline after 48 h, restoring efficient iron absorption. These early data seem to disqualify the split dosing of ferrous sulfate two or three times per day, and even favor intermittent intake every second day versus daily dosing, to bypass the hepcidin blockade and increase fractional iron absorption.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

### Management of iron deficiency [^ef4bc942]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Screening and treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy: a review and appraisal of current international guidelines [^dda56a54]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in pregnancy is a common diagnosis that is associated with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. There remains uncertainty regarding how best to screen for, prevent, and treat established IDA in pregnancy. There is no consensus on the benefits of routine iron supplementation in pregnancy, with concerns regarding potential harmful effects of routine iron supplementation in women who are iron replete. Fourteen international guidelines were selected and appraised and compared by a multidisciplinary team. The AGREE II GRS tool was used. Each reviewer independently made their own assessment, and the scores from 1 to 7 were also collated and averaged for an overall score incorporating seven domains: process of development, clarity of presentation, completeness of reporting, clinical validity, and overall quality. The reviewers' scores were also individually compared according to discipline. The mean score across all the guidelines was 4.4 (range 3.5–6.5). Only half of the guidelines recommend routine iron in pregnancy. In terms of screening recommendations, five guidelines recommend screening with ferritin in addition to a full blood count in pregnancy, two recommend selective screening with ferritin for at risk groups only, and one guideline suggests using ferritin where feasible. Although many of the guidelines recommend similar doses of oral elemental iron of 100-200mg daily for the treatment of established IDA in pregnancy, two recommend twice or three times daily dosing. Only five guidelines give hemoglobin rises to expect within specific timeframes. There remains a need to clarify the optimal screening method, dosing regimen, timing, and route of iron supplementation in pregnancy. Robust randomized controlled data are needed to guide appropriate prevention and management.

### The efficacy and safety of vitamin C for iron supplementation in adult patients with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^90aba997]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

During the prelatent iron deficiency phase, an iron-rich diet can treat most cases. However, patients with IDA require iron supplements to replenish storage iron, restore normal hematopoiesis, treat anemia, and relieve symptoms.

Oral iron supplementation is the primary approach to restore iron levels for patients with IDA. Numerous nonheme iron supplements are available, and ferrous sulfate and ferric succinate supplements are the most commonly used. Vitamin C is the only dietary constituent other than animal tissue that has been shown to promote iron absorption. Iron absorption occurs predominantly in the duodenum and upper jejunum, where ferrous iron can be transported into small intestine mucosal epithelial cells. When taken orally, iron is always oxidized to the Fe 3+ state from its original form. It requires an acidic gastrointestinal environment to be dissolved adequately for absorption. Vitamin C can create a more acidic environment in the stomach and prevent the oxidization of ferrous iron to ferric iron. However, in a series of 12 individuals treated with iron during intake of a regular or vitamin C–supplemented diet, the effect of vitamin C on promoting iron absorption from a complete diet was far less pronounced than that from a single meal. The facilitating impact of vitamin C with food on iron status is minimal. Therefore, whether vitamin C has additional advantages, such as improving the efficacy of iron tablets and, thus, speeding up the recovery of anemia, remains poorly understood. Whether iron tablets with vitamin C supplements should be recommended is controversial.

To our knowledge, until now there has not been a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess whether vitamin C supplements are necessary for patients with IDA taking iron tablets. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a rigorous RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of oral iron supplements alone or combined with vitamin C in patients with IDA. We designed a single-center, equivalence RCT to evaluate whether oral iron supplements alone were comparable with oral iron supplements plus vitamin C and to verify whether vitamin C routinely used with iron supplements can improve iron absorption.

### Randomized, controlled trial of single versus 3-times-daily ferrous sulfate drops for treatment of anemia [^9946a1aa]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Adherence to treatment of iron-deficiency anemia often is poor in both developed and developing countries. The current standard therapy is ferrous sulfate drops (or syrup) administered 3 times daily. It is possible that adherence would improve with a single-dose daily treatment regimen. We compared the use of single versus 3-times-daily ferrous sulfate drops, at the same total iron dose, on treatment of anemia in infants.

Methods

To obtain a large enough cohort of anemic subjects, we performed the study in rural Ghana. Using a prospective, randomized, controlled design, we studied 557 anemic children (age range: 6–24 months; hemoglobin values: 70–99 g/L). One group (n = 280) received ferrous sulfate drops once daily (40 mg elemental iron), and the control group (n = 277) received ferrous sulfate drops 3 times per day (total dose, 40 mg elemental iron). Treatment lasted for 2 months. Hemoglobin and serum ferritin values were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.

Results

Successful treatment of anemia (hemoglobin > 100 g/L) occurred in 61% of the single-dose and in 56% of the 3-times-daily group. Geometric mean ferritin levels increased significantly in each group from baseline to the final visit. Side effects were minimal and similar between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

A single versus a 3-times-daily dose of ferrous sulfate drops over 2 months resulted in a similar rate of successful treatment of anemia, without side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of a single-dose daily regimen to treat anemia. Although not examined in the current study, use of a single-dose daily regimen may improve adherence to treatment of anemia in infants.

### Oral iron therapy: current concepts and future prospects for improving efficacy and outcomes [^4d96cf4a]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) and iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) are global public health concerns, most commonly afflicting children, pregnant women and women of childbearing age. Pathological outcomes of ID include delayed cognitive development in children, adverse pregnancy outcomes and decreased work capacity in adults. IDA is usually treated by oral iron supplementation, typically using iron salts (e.g. FeSO 4); however, dosing at several-fold above the RDA may be required due to less efficient absorption. Excess enteral iron causes adverse gastrointestinal side effects, thus reducing compliance, and negatively impacts the gut microbiome. Recent research has sought to identify new iron formulations with better absorption so that lower effective dosing can be utilized. This article outlines emerging research on oral iron supplementation and focuses on molecular mechanisms by which different supplemental forms of iron are transported across the intestinal epithelium and whether these transport pathways are subject to regulation by the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^7e0a572d]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of oral iron supplements

The bioavailability of a drug is typically assessed by measuring its serum concentration. Experimental studies with anemic patients, and non-anemic blood donorssuggested that this also applies to iron supplements, as the response to treatment correlated with increased serum iron and transferrin saturation. On the other hand, it has been argued that the dynamic nature of the transferrin pool renders a transient increase in serum iron irrelevant to the efficacy of iron supplementation.

In any case, efficacy can be effectively monitored by assessing the fraction of iron that is absorbed and incorporated into hemoglobin, and most importantly, by measuring the hemoglobin concentration response to iron supplementation. An optimal response to oral iron therapy is expected to increase hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. A hemoglobin increase of 1 g/dL within 4 weeks is considered reasonable. Repletion of body iron stores, reflected by serum ferritin > 100 μg/L often requires longer treatment.

Ferrous salts

Ferrous sulfate is the least expensive and most frequently prescribed iron formulation in many countries; thus, it is considered as the gold standard in oral iron supplementation. Ingestion of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salts) is expected to promote a rapid surge in serum iron and effectively increase hemoglobinization and iron stores. The use of ferrous sulfate, fumarate or gluconate is recommended as a first line treatment for IDA in adults by the current British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Slow-release ferrous salt supplements have performed poorly in several studies, possibly due to delayed liberation of encapsulated Fe 2+ past the duodenum and upper jejunum, where iron absorption is optimal. Hence, serious concerns have been raised on their efficacy, and their use is not recommended.

### The impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation during pregnancy: a pilot randomized trial [^5d6c140f]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Oral iron is first-line medication for iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. We conducted a pilot randomized trial to investigate the impact of different doses of oral iron supplementation started early in pregnancy on women without anemia for 4 main outcomes: recruitment and protocol compliance, adherence, maintenance of maternal hemoglobin, and side effects. At antenatal clinic visits, participants were allocated to 1 of 3 trial arms in a 1:1:1 ratio: 200 mg ferrous sulfate daily, alternate days, or 3 times per week. The participants were followed to delivery. Baseline characteristics of 300 recruited participants were well matched between trial arms. The mean proportion of tablets taken as expected per participant was 82.5% overall (72.3%, 89.6%, and 84.5% for the daily, alternate days, and 3 times a week arm, respectively). There was a lower overall adherence rate in the daily arm (47%) than in the alternate days (62%) and the 3 times per week (61%) arms. A reduction in hemoglobin between randomization and 28 weeks' gestation seemed smaller for the daily arm. A range of side effects were commonly reported at baseline before starting interventions and at later antenatal visits. Many side effects of iron overlapped with normal pregnancy symptoms. A daily iron dosing schedule might give the best opportunity for delivering an adequate iron load during pregnancy in women without anemia. Further randomized trials powered on clinical outcomes are needed to establish the clinical effectiveness of oral iron supplementation to prevent iron deficiency anemia. This study was registered (#ISRCTN12911644).

### Iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing in iron-depleted women: two open-label, randomised controlled trials [^7327d54f]. The Lancet: Haematology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines to treat iron deficiency recommend daily provision of ferrous iron divided through the day to increase absorption. However, daily dosing and split dosing might increase serum hepcidin and decrease iron absorption from subsequent doses. Our study aim was to compare iron absorption from oral iron supplements given on consecutive versus alternate days and given as single morning doses versus twice-daily split dosing.

Methods

We did two prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trials assessing iron absorption using (54 Fe)-labelled, (57 Fe)-labelled, or (58 Fe)-labelled ferrous sulfate in iron-depleted (serum ferritin ≤ 25 μg/L) women aged 18–40 years recruited from ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich, Switzerland. In study 1, women were randomly assigned (1:1) to two groups. One group was given 60 mg iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) on consecutive days for 14 days, and the other group was given the same doses on alternate days for 28 days. In study 2, women were assigned to two groups, stratified by serum ferritin so that two groups with similar iron statuses could be formed. One group was given 120 mg iron at 0800 h (± 1 h) and the other was given the dose split into two divided doses of 60 mg at 0800 h (± 1 h) and 1700 h (± 1 h) for three consecutive days. 14 days after the final dose, the groups were each crossed over to the other regimen. Within-individual comparisons were done. The co-primary outcomes in both studies were iron bioavailability (total and fractional iron absorption), assessed by measuring the isotopic label abundance in erythrocytes 14 days after administration, and serum hepcidin. Group allocations in both studies were not masked and primary and safety analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02175888 (study 1) and NCT02177851 (study 2) and are complete.

Findings

For study 1, 40 women were enrolled on Oct 15–29, 2015. 21 women were assigned to the consecutive-day group and 19 to the alternate-day group. At the end of treatment (14 days for the consecutive-day group and 28 days for the alternate-day group), geometric mean (-SD, +SD) cumulative fractional iron absorptions were 16.3% (9.3, 28.8) in the consecutive-day group versus 21.8% (13.7, 34.6) in the alternate-day group (p = 0.0013), and cumulative total iron absorption was 131.0 mg (71.4, 240.5) versus 175.3 mg (110.3, 278.5; p = 0.0010). During the first 14 days of supplementation in both groups, serum hepcidin was higher in the consecutive-day group than the alternate-day group (p = 0.0031). In study 2, 20 women were enrolled between Aug 13 and 18, 2015. Ten women were assigned to receive once-daily dosing and ten were assigned to receive twice-daily divided dosing. No significant differences were seen in fractional (day 1–3 geometric mean: 11.8% [7.1, 19.4] once daily vs 13.1% [8.2, 20.7] twice daily; p = 0.33) or total iron absorption (day 1–3: 44.3 mg [29.4, 66.7] once daily vs 49.4 [35.2, 69.4] twice daily; p = 0.33) between the two dosing regimens. Twice-daily divided doses resulted in a higher serum hepcidin concentration than once-daily dosing (p = 0.013). No grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in either study.

Interpretation

In iron-depleted women, providing iron supplements daily as divided doses increases serum hepcidin and reduces iron absorption. Providing iron supplements on alternate days and in single doses optimises iron absorption and might be a preferable dosing regimen. These findings should be confirmed in iron-deficient anaemic patients.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^9dd8c36d]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — management of iron supplementation notes that although no formal recommendation is provided, clinicians should recognize available oral and intravenous formulations with varying costs and side effects, and in most patients an initial trial of oral supplementation should be given as it is generally effective, available, inexpensive, and safe. There is no strong evidence that any of the available oral formulations is more effective or better tolerated than the others. Historically, a daily dose of 150–200 mg of elemental iron has been recommended, but some studies suggest that lower dosing or every-other-day dosing may improve tolerability and absorption. Taking iron supplements with food or using enteric-coated formulations may improve tolerability but decrease absorption, and vitamin C co-administration is commonly recommended as it enhances absorption and may improve response to oral iron. If such a response is not seen, assessment for nonadherence (due to side effects or other reasons), malabsorption, or ongoing blood loss exceeding iron intake is needed. Intravenous iron may be appropriate in selected patients, such as those with impaired absorption due to prior gastric surgery, with inflammatory bowel disease or chronic kidney disease, or in whom blood loss exceeds the ability to replete iron orally, and consultation with a hematologist is often helpful when intravenous iron repletion is required.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^2bcd92de]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Daily versus alternate-day iron supplementation for pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia: a randomized controlled trial [^e7edeba3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the most effective regimen to raise hemoglobin (Hb) by comparing alternate-day dosing of iron to daily dosing in pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia. Women with Hb < 11.0g/dL and ferritin ≤ 25 µg/L between 12 0/7 and 34 0/7 weeks' gestation were recruited. A total of 88 patients were randomized using block randomization with 1:1 allocation to receive either 1 tablet of 325mg ferrous sulfate on consecutive days or 2 tablets every other day. The primary outcome, the change in Hb after 6 weeks of treatment was assessed using an analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline level. Secondary outcomes included change in ferritin, hepcidin, side effects, and compliance. Patients completed a questionnaire to assess for adverse symptoms and adherence was monitored by installing a pill reminder app on smartphones of patients. A total of 88 patients were consented. The daily iron group had a greater proportion of nulliparous women (40 vs. 7%). Most patients (98%) had mild anemia (Hb: 9–10.9g/dL) at recruitment, with a median gestational age of 28.1 weeks (interquartile range [IQR]: 25.6, 30.9) and median duration of treatment of 42 days (IQR: 35, 45). At 6 weeks, the daily iron group had a mean increase in Hb of 0.8 ± 0.9g/dL, whereas the alternate-day iron group had a mean increase of 0.5 ± 1.0g/dL (baseline adjusted difference of means: -0.3 [95% confidence interval: -0.7, 0.1], p = 0.15). Frequency of adverse effects attributable to iron were similar between groups. Patient self-reported compliance to treatment was also similar between groups. Among those that used the app, compliance was higher among the daily group compared with the alternate daily group (median: 95.5% [IQR: 75, 100] vs. 85% [IQR: 40, 92]), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). This trial suggests that there are no significant differences between alternate-day iron supplementation and daily iron supplementation for treating iron deficiency anemia. · Intermittent iron provides no additional benefit compared to daily iron in the treatment of anemia. · Patient compliance to treatment was similar between the groups. · The frequency of side effects was not significantly different between the groups.

### Screening and supplementation for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^af100707]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Implementation — screening and supplementation during pregnancy should reflect the evidence gap and clinical judgment, as there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or supplementation during pregnancy for iron deficiency with or without anemia, and in the absence of evidence, clinicians should use their clinical judgment regarding whether to screen for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and whether to provide routine iron supplementation during pregnancy. Screening often includes measurement of hematologic indices (eg, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and ferritin values as proxies of iron deficiency anemia), and an abnormal screening test result may be followed by treatment with iron therapy; supplementation refers to routine provision of low-dose supplemental iron or intake of iron-fortified foods without specifically measuring hematologic indices. Other organizations' guidelines vary, and screening and supplementation for iron deficiency with or without anemia during pregnancy are common.

### Effect and safety of intravenous iron compared to oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy [^243ac271]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Intravenous iron is increasingly used to treat iron-deficient anaemia (IDA) in pregnancy. A previous network meta-analysis suggested that intravenous irons have a greater effect on haematological parameters than oral irons; however, the impact on serious pregnancy complications such as postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) or the need for blood transfusion was unclear. Since then, several new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect and safety of intravenous versus oral iron preparations for treating IDA in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP) for eligible studies. The latest search was performed on 19 March 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included RCTs in pregnant women with confirmed IDA (haemoglobin (Hb) level < 11 g/dL as per World Health Organization (WHO) criteria) comparing intravenous (iron sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, ferumoxytol) and oral (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate) iron preparations.

Outcomes

Our outcomes were antenatal and postnatal Hb levels, antenatal and postnatal anaemia status, PPH, blood transfusion, maternal satisfaction, maternal well-being, breastfeeding, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, and adverse events (AEs).

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias in the included RCTs.

Synthesis Methods

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and scientific rigour, evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and extracted data. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a fixed-effect model in the first instance. We reported dichotomous data as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Included Studies

We included 13 RCTs (3939 participants) mainly conducted in India and Africa (8/13). Gestational age at baseline ranged from 13 to 37 weeks, and Hb levels ranged from 5.0 to just below 11.0 g/dL. The most frequently compared preparations were intravenous iron sucrose versus oral ferrous sulfate (5/13). Most RCTs were at low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence ranged from moderate to very low, mainly due to concerns over attrition bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.

Synthesis Of Results

Antenatal outcomes Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb level three to six weeks after treatment start (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.69; 11 RCTs; 2935 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and likely reduces anaemia status three to six weeks after treatment start (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.86; 5 RCTs; 2189 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb level around birth (MD 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.77; 6 RCTs; 1574 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and likely reduces anaemia status around birth (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.93; 4 RCTs; 1240 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Postpartum outcomes Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron may slightly increase Hb level postpartum (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68; 3 RCTs; 1950 participants; low-certainty evidence). It may also reduce anaemia status (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.73; 3 RCTs; 1950 participants; low-certainty evidence) and severe anaemia postpartum (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.84; 2 RCTs; 1581 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence for the latter outcome is very uncertain. Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.20; 3 RCTs; 2251 participants; low-certainty evidence) and likely results in little to no difference in the need for blood transfusion (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.60; 6 RCTs; 2592 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or rates of breastfeeding (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.12; 1 RCT; 404 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No trials reported on maternal satisfaction or maternal well-being. Adverse outcomes Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron may have little to no effect on maternal mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.13 to 6.39; 4 RCTs; 2152 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely does not increase maternal morbidity: severe infections (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.18; 1 RCT; 1881 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and prolonged hospital stay (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21; 1 RCT; 1764 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may not increase admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) (RR 1.99, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.87; 2 RCTs; 2069 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared with oral iron, intravenous iron likely does not increase AEs (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.35; 1 RCT; 349 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may not increase serious AEs (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.59; 1 RCT; 1934 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, individual AEs were inconsistently reported across trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Intravenous iron likely slightly increases Hb levels and likely reduces anaemia in pregnancy compared to oral iron. Hb levels postpartum may be slightly increased with intravenous iron, but the effect on postpartum severe anaemia status is very uncertain. Intravenous iron may result in little to no difference in PPH, and blood transfusion rates are likely unaffected by route of administration. Synthesis of adverse outcomes proved challenging due to their rarity and suboptimal reporting. The effects of intravenous iron on maternal mortality and admissions to the ICU are very uncertain, and there is likely little to no difference between groups in severe infections and prolonged hospital stay. Intravenous iron likely does not increase AEs and may not increase serious AEs; however, the 95% CIs in both cases include potential harm. Furthermore, this finding should be treated cautiously due to the varied adverse event profiles of both types of iron preparations. Data from the ongoing multicentre trials may address some of the identified evidence gaps. However, there is a clear need to strengthen the co-ordination of research efforts around clinically important time points of outcome measure, homogeneity of their definition, and safety reporting.

### Efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose versus ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: subgroup analysis of Korean women [^c31e4aeb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

According to worldwide estimates, 30% of women of reproductive age are anemic and at least half of these cases are attributed to iron deficiency (ID). The prevalence of anemia is 14–52% in women without iron supplementation and 25% even with supplementation, depending on iron dosage. Throughout pregnancy, total iron requirements increase to meet the major hematologic changes of the mother and the increasing demands of the growing fetus. This increased demand for iron puts the mother and offspring at risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, fetal growth restriction, and increased newborn and maternal mortality. Furthermore, ID may predispose a person to postpartum IDA, peripartum blood transfusion, infections, and precipitate heart failure.

IDA during pregnancy is often treated with oral iron supplement. However, due to gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation, compliance is often poor and results in subsequent discontinuation. As such, intravenous iron administration are increasingly being recommended for women who are non-compliant with oral iron, have severe IDA, or those who require rapid intervention. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM; Ferinject ®) is a dextran-free parenteral iron preparation that allows rapid administration of weekly high single doses of iron and had been approved for the treatment of IDA by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in 2007, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, and Korea FDA in 2010.

In the FER-ASAP (FERrric carboxymaltose-Assessment of SAfety and efficacy in Pregnancy) study, pregnant women (gestational weeks 16–33) with IDA were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to FCM or ferrous sulfate (FS) for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels improved at comparable rates in both treatments; however, significantly higher number of women achieved anemia correction within a shorter time frame with FCM (84%) than with FS (70%; P = 0.031). FCM treatment significantly improved the quality of life (QoL) from baseline up to delivery, and there were markedly fewer gastrointestinal treatment-related adverse events (AEs) with FCM (11%) than with FS (15%).

Regarding screening and diagnosis for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that a good response to iron therapy (hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal.

Oral IRT

It is usual to start treatment for IDA as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory investigation, so that the treatment and investigation of IDA proceed in parallel. There is usually a beneficial rise in Hb within 2 weeks of commencing oral IRT. Oral iron preparations often stain the stools and may cause constipation, so it is usual practice to pause these prior to bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Therefore, if a patient is to be investigated for IDA within 2 weeks, it would be appropriate to delay treatment until after the colonoscopy has been completed. There is no need to withhold oral iron before gastroscopy or CT colonography.

Traditionally oral iron salts were taken as split dose, two or three times a day. More recent data suggest that lower doses and more infrequent administration may be just as effective, while probably associated with lower rates of adverse effects. In addition, it may be inconvenient for some people to find three periods during the day to take iron on an empty stomach.

Various oral iron preparations are available in the UK (table 3). Traditional oral iron salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate and ferrous fumarate) are inexpensive, effective, safe and readily available — and they remain the standard therapies for IDA. Their use is supported by considerable clinical experience and observational data. In a pooled analysis of trial data, 72.8% of patients with IDA demonstrated a satisfactory response to an oral iron formulation, defined as an Hb rise of > 10 g/L within 2 weeks, though rates of normalisation of Hb were lower with continued bleeding or clinically evident GI disease.

Table 3
A comparison of oral iron preparations available in the UK (February 2021)

A Cochrane analysis in 2014 highlighted that the reviewed trials were of poor quality, but concluded that in comparison to placebo oral IRT significantly improves Hb levels in IDA, and probably reduces blood transfusion requirements. When given in standard doses there do not appear to be important differences in efficacy or adverse events, although side effects may be lower with less than daily dosing. Modified release preparations (table 3) release iron in the more distal small bowel beyond the areas of most active assimilation — they do not enhance iron absorptionor reduce side effects, and their use is not recommended.

### Iron absorption from supplements is greater with alternate day than with consecutive day dosing in iron-deficient anemic women [^e96674b9]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

In iron-depleted women without anemia, oral iron supplements induce an increase in serum hepcidin (SHep) that persists for 24 hours, decreasing iron absorption from supplements given later on the same or next day. Consequently, iron absorption from supplements is highest if iron is given on alternate days. Whether this dosing schedule is also beneficial in women with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) given high-dose iron supplements is uncertain. The primary objective of this study was to assess whether, in women with IDA, alternate-day administration of 100 and 200 mg iron increases iron absorption compared to consecutive-day iron administration. Secondary objectives were to correlate iron absorption with SHep and iron status parameters. We performed a cross-over iron absorption study in women with IDA (n = 19; median hemoglobin 11.5 mg/dL; mean serum ferritin 10 mg/L) who received either 100 or 200 mg iron as ferrous sulfate given at 8 AM on days 2, 3 and 5 labeled with stable iron isotopes 57Fe, 58Fe and 54Fe; after a 16-day incorporation period, the other labeled dose was given at 8 AM on days 23, 24 and 26 (days 2, 3 and 5 of the second period). Iron absorption on days 2 and 3 (consecutive) and day 5 (alternate) was assessed by measuring erythrocyte isotope incorporation. For both doses, SHep was higher on day 3 than on day 2 (P < 0.001) or day 5 (P < 0.01) with no significant difference between days 2 and 5. Similarly, for both doses, fractional iron absorption (FIA) on days 2 and 5 was 40–50% higher than on day 3 (P < 0.001), while absorption on day 2 did not differ significantly from day 5. There was no significant difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects comparing the two iron doses (P = 0.105). Alternate day dosing of oral iron supplements in anemic women may be preferable because it sharply increases FIA. If needed, to provide the same total amount of iron with alternate day dosing, twice the daily target dose should be given on alternate days, as total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was approximately twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days (P < 0.001). In IDA, even if hepatic hepcidin expression is strongly suppressed by iron deficiency and erythropoietic drive, the intake of oral iron supplements leads to an acute hepcidin increase for 24 hours. The study was funded by ETH Zürich, Switzerland. This study has been registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03623997.

### An assessment for diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for management of pediatric iron defficiency anemia in Saudi arabia: a crossectional study [^47d5dd13]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

In regard IDA treatment, elicited responses indicate that over half of our study participants base their therapeutic decision on their previous experience than on evidence. Almost all published literature recommends a dose of 3–6 mg/kg/day of iron as an efficient IDA treatment. However despite using 6 mg/kg/day being the overwhelming preference for pediatric hematology oncology specialists, there is no evidence base for such choice. Many studies have shown treatment success with low dosages. A randomized trial in Ghana compared patients to 40 mg of iron, or almost 3 mg/kg/day either as a single dosage or in three divided dosages, found similar success in both groups. Another study including 90 elderly patients compared three daily doses of iron (15 mg, 50 mg, and 150 mg). After 60 days, in all three groups, the increases in Hb concentration and SF were similar. This suggests that low oral dosage of iron treatment could be as effective as high dosage. Furthermore, in the lowest dose groups, the rates of dropout and adverse effects were lower. However, the optimal duration for oral iron supplementation has not been specified yet but previous studies recommend 3–6 months supplementation. Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program recommends 6 mg/kg/day of oral iron dose for 3–4 months. It has been suggested that Iron stores are refilled after continuation of iron therapy for 2–3 months.

Responses of participants showed a marked variability regarding the duration of continued oral iron treatment when the patient's Hb, MCV and ferritin became normal. This is comparable to Powers et al. study. However, in this study, 50.3% of respondents recommended patient's daily dose should be based on weight and 49.7% based on number of tablets compared with 64 and 36% respectively in that study. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved many safe and effective parenteral iron preparations for adult patients and children who could not responded to oral iron therapy, only 14% of participants in the present study recommended this course of action. Approximately, of 170 iron therapies used to treat and prevent IDA, ferrous sulfate was most effective and least cost compared with other oral iron treatments. Currently, it is the most frequent treatment for IDA's patients.

### New horizons in iron deficiency anaemia in older adults [^f7fc4df2]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common in older adults and associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Differentiating iron deficiency from other causes of anaemia is important to ensure appropriate investigations and treatment. It is possible to make the diagnosis reliably using simple blood tests. Clinical evaluation and assessment are required to help determine the underlying cause and to initiate appropriate investigations. IDA in men and post-menopausal females is most commonly due to occult gastrointestinal blood loss until proven otherwise, although there is a spectrum of underlying causative pathologies. Investigation decisions should take account of the wishes of the patient and their competing comorbidities, individualising the approach. Management involves supplementation using oral or intravenous (IV) iron then consideration of treatment of the underlying cause of deficiency. Future research areas are outlined including the role of Hepcidin and serum soluble transferrin receptor measurement, quantitative faecal immunochemical testing, alternative dosing regimens and the potential role of IV iron preparations.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^cdb68180]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — iron supplementation and route selection are as follows: Iron supplementation should be given to all patients with IBD and IDA. In head-to-head comparisons, IV iron had greater efficacy than oral iron in achieving a hemoglobin increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.13–2.18) and greater treatment continuity (odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.13–0.59) in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials including 694 adults. Current consensus recommendations by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization recommend IV over oral iron as first-line therapy for patients with a hemoglobin level < 10 g/dL, but oral iron may be appropriate in carefully selected patients with IBD who have mild anemia and inactive disease; if oral iron is used, close follow-up evaluation is needed to assess tolerance and response.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^48f70d93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Supplementation with oral vs. intravenous iron for anemia with IBD or gastrointestinal bleeding: is oral iron getting a bad rap? [^5ad8b041]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Although iron supplementation is commonly prescribed, the amount of elemental iron needed to achieve clinical efficacy, and the optimal method of supplementation, are under debate. Use of intravenous (IV) iron replacement is increasingly being advocated. We explore the physiology of iron supplementation, review clinical data suggesting that the typical oral dosing of iron may be excessive, and compare IV and oral methods of iron supplementation with a focus on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both IV and oral iron can effectively raise hemoglobin levels in iron-deficiency anemia. There is no evidence that IV iron can raise hemoglobin at a faster pace. Side effects of oral iron are probably related to the relatively high doses of elemental iron that are typically prescribed. Emerging data suggest that low-dose iron has comparable efficacy, with fewer side effects. In IBD, both oral and IV iron are effective, and there is no convincing evidence that oral iron activates or exacerbates clinical symptoms. The use of a low starting dose of oral iron, such as one ferrous sulfate tablet per day, for treatment of iron deficiency is worth considering.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy-opportunities to optimize perinatal health and health equity [^dff477e2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Third, oral iron is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia. Because of the lack of studies of treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in a screen-detected population, the USPSTF, focused primarily on supplementation doses, with most included studies using doses between 20 and 50 mg of elemental iron. Given the high prevalence of iron deficiency during pregnancy, and the increased iron requirements, these doses are likely insufficient for adequate treatment and resulted in the lack of benefit observed. Future studies should evaluate the outcomes of iron supplementation in 3 distinct groups: participants who are iron replete, participants who are iron deficient without anemia, and participants with iron deficiency anemia. We recommend that future guidelines focused on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy should include literature that differentiates between supplementation for prevention and treatment for diagnosed iron deficiency. In addition, future reviews should distinguish between supplemental and treatment doses of oral and intravenous iron and their impacts on outcomes. Guidance on appropriate supplementation (including formulation, dosage, and timing) is also necessary due to the lack of consensus and the variability in dosing strategies found in the literature.

As the rates of iron deficiency during pregnancy increase, so too may pregnancy morbidity. Given these significant implications for public health, it is critical to conduct additional studies to examine the advantages and disadvantages of screening for and treating subclinical iron deficiency. To harmonize future study findings, it is important to standardize the diagnostic cutoff values for iron deficiency across different populations and settings and clearly differentiate between indications for supplementation vs treatment. This will also help improve the identification and treatment of at-risk individuals, address disparities in care, and ultimately mitigate adverse pregnancy and offspring outcomes.

### Optimal oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia among US veterans [^3b1d45ce]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

This cohort study was approved by the institutional review board of the Central Virginia US Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare system. A waiver of informed consent was granted because the study was a retrospective analysis. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Data Collection

Using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse, we identified patients with IDA who received their first outpatient oral iron prescription (324 mg or 325mg of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, or ferrous fumarate) for 90 days, with at least 1 refill within 120 days of the first index prescription date between 2009 and 2019. IDA was defined as hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and either (1) iron saturation (ISAT) less than 20% or (2) ferritin less than 50 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). There was no official clinical practice guideline by the Veterans Health Administration on management of IDA, and oral iron was prescribed as per treating physician clinical discretion. Patients were classified into 3 dose groups: daily (once a day), multiple doses per day (MDD; ≥ 2 times per day), and alternate day dose (ADD) based on their oral iron dosing schedule.

Baseline laboratory data consisted of data collected closest to the index prescription date, but not older than 180 days. Follow-up laboratory data were collected from 30 to 180 days following the first oral iron prescription date (index prescription date). We have only included patients who had at least 1 follow-up hemoglobin measurement during this time. Ferritin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC; calculated in micrograms per deciliter [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.179]), and ISAT were collected in those who met the aforementioned inclusion criteria. Therefore, every patient in the final cohort had continuous hemoglobin data, and within these patients, a subset had follow-up data on the other 3 iron indices.

Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR)were collected. Patients with an eGFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, patients receiving dialysis, and patients with kidney transplants were excluded. Patients were further classified based on baseline eGFR into the cohort with NKF (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and the cohort with CKD (eGFR ≥ 15 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2).

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^120b476d]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Intermittent oral iron (defined as less frequently than daily) has been reported to be at least as effective as daily dosing in raising Hb levels in young women and during pregnancy, although less effective in boosting iron stores in the short-term. Intermittent oral iron is associated with a lower incidence of GI adverse events in pregnant women (relative risk 0.56; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84).

The optimal drug, dosage and timing of oral IRT for adults with IDA are not clearly defined, and the effect of alternate day therapy on compliance and ultimate haematological response are unclear. Based on the available literature, a once daily dose of 50–100 mg of elemental iron (eg, one ferrous sulfate 200 mg tablet a day) taken in the fasting state may be the best compromise option for initial treatment. Whatever agent and regimen are chosen, it is essential to monitor the initial haematological response, and modify as appropriate with apparent therapeutic failure.

The best option for patients with significant intolerance to oral IRT (usually GI disturbance) is also unclear. Depending on the individual, oral ferric maltol, alternate day oral iron and parenteral iron are all options. The standard practice of switching to a different traditional iron salt is not supported by evidence.

Ferric maltol is a relatively new preparation, which is licenced for the treatment of IDA of any cause. In patients with inactive IBD, previous intolerance to or failure of traditional iron salts and moderate IDA (Hb > 95 g/L), 12 weeks of treatment with ferric maltol normalised the Hb in 63%–66% of cases.GI side effects and overall rates of treatment cessation were comparable to placebo. Due to a relatively low iron content, the rate of iron loading is comparatively slow with ferric maltol, but iron loading and tolerance were maintained during a year of active treatment, with normalisation of Hb in 89% of cases. Although more expensive than traditional iron salts, ferric maltol is considerably less expensive than parenteral irons.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^1d3a5465]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Tolerability and adverse effects of oral iron supplements

In general, the proper use of oral iron supplements is considered safe and does not cause severe adverse effects. However, it frequently triggers gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and mucosal injury, which may reduce compliance.

Ferrous salts

While efficacious in repletion of iron stores, ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts often exhibit limited tolerability due to gastrointestinal side effects. Ferrous salts may also cause teeth staining and a metallic taste in the mouth, particularly with prolonged use in liquid form or when not properly diluted before ingestion. A systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the tolerability and adverse effects of ferrous sulfate versus placebo or versus intravenous iron in 43 RCT involving 6,831 adults. The use of ferrous sulfate significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal side effects versus placebo with an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.74–3.08; P < 0.0001), and versus intravenous iron with an odds ratio of 3.05 (95% confidence interval: 2.07–4.48; P < 0.0001). There was no significant association between odds ratio and ferrous sulfate dose. Additionally, there was no evidence that slow-release ferrous sulfate formulations were tolerated better.

Ferric complexes

Although ferric iron supplements are generally thought to be better tolerated compared to ferrous ones, there are not many directly comparative studies. In the BESTIRON RCTand the trial with infants and children aged 9–48 months, there were more reported cases of diarrhea in patients receiving ferric polysaccharide than in those receiving ferrous sulfate, but there were no significant differences in combined post hoc gastrointestinal adverse effect profiles. Likewise, there were no differences in adverse effects between women with IDA treated with ferrous glycine sulfate or iron protein succinylate. In a recent crossover, double-blind RCT in healthy women of reproductive age, microencapsulated ferric saccharate showed a better tolerability profile compared to that of ferrous sulfate regarding the incidences of symptoms, numbers of complaints/symptoms, overall intensity, and total days with symptoms.

### The clinical impact of oral iron treatment for anaemia in pregnancy in accordance with current guidance: a prospective cohort study in a maternity unit in the midlands of england [^1ba81205]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Interventions

This was a non-interventional study, and clinical management of IDA followed recommendations detailed in national guidelines, adopted into local guidance documents. To deliver best practice for anaemia management in pregnancy, we introduced a dedicated anaemia research clinic modelled on the pre-operative anaemia clinic services, as advocated nationally e.g. Women identified as anaemic were offered the option of management and follow-up through this clinic, supported by a research fellow and consultant obstetrician. The study started when earlier national guidance was in place, which recommended daily iron dose of 100–200 mg elemental iron per day; prescribed as 200 mg ferrous sulphate three times a day (65 mg elemental iron per tablet x 3 = 195 mg).

All women were offered a full blood count (FBC) to screen for IDA usually 8–12 weeks' gestation and then 28 weeks' according to standard practice. Women who consented to participate were started on oral iron no longer than 14 days from the point of diagnosis (Visit 1). Enrolled women were given verbal instructions, and written information on the correct way to take the tablets to maximise absorption.

Women were asked to return for a follow up visit, between 2 and 4 weeks after initiating treatment, when a peripheral blood count was taken to assess the therapeutic response and assessments were made of side effects and adherence (Visit 2). The variation in follow up visits was to coincide with a woman's obstetric appointments. Iron has a marketing authorisation (MA) in the UK and is being used in this study in its marketed presentation and packaging bearing the MA number.

### Efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose versus ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy: subgroup analysis of Korean women [^7a621c85]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We performed a post-hoc subgroup analysis in Korean women who participated in the Phase III FER-ASAP (FERric carboxymaltose-Assessment of SAfety and efficacy in Pregnancy) study to compare the efficacy and safety of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) with oral ferrous sulfate (FS).

Methods

Pregnant Korean women (gestational weeks 16–33) with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) were randomized 1:1 to FCM (n = 46; 1000–1500 mg iron) or FS (n = 44; 200 mg iron/day) group for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to compare the mean hemoglobin (Hb) increase at week 3; secondary objectives included change in iron parameters, quality of life (QoL), and safety.

Results

Baseline characteristics of the Korean subgroup were consistent with those of non-Korean FER-ASAP population except for lower body-mass index and higher maternal age. Hb level increases were comparable between the two treatment groups in Korean women at week 3 (FCM 1.23 ± 0.89 g/dL vs FS 1.14 ± 1.72 g/dL). Iron parameters improved over time as secondary endpoints were significantly in favor of FCM. In terms of QoL, FCM treatment significantly improved the mental and physical components as well as vitality prior to delivery. Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

FCM provided significantly greater improvements in iron parameters and QoL compared to FS in the Korean subgroup. FCM may be a preferable alternative to currently available treatments for IDA during pregnancy.

### A phase III, randomized, open-label trial of ferumoxytol compared with iron sucrose for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with a history of unsatisfactory oral iron therapy [^7773f591]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, anemia has a prevalence of ∼25%. In the United States (US), iron deficiency anemia (IDA) continues to be one of the most common types of anemia, affecting ∼1–2% of men and 2–5% of women. IDA is associated with a range of adverse health and quality-of-life (QOL)-related issues including impaired cognitive development and performance, reduced work capacity, lower resistance to infection, increased morbidity and mortality related to childbearing, restricted infant and child growth, and impaired endocrine function. There are many causes of IDA including digestive diseases and blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which are common causes in adult men and postmenopausal women, and excessive menstrual loss, which is the most common cause in women of childbearing age–. Because of the clinical impact of anemia, patients with IDA require prompt and effective iron replacement treatment to increase iron stores and raise hemoglobin (Hgb) levels to improve or maintain their QOL.

Although oral iron is the first-line treatment for patients with IDA, many patients are unable to tolerate, may not respond to, or cannot absorb oral iron. In these patients, an alternative to oral iron is required to effectively manage and treat IDA. Prior to the recent approval of ferric carboxymaltose in the US, the only approved intravenous (IV) iron formulations for the treatment of IDA in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD), that is, IDA of any underlying cause, were the iron dextrans. The iron dextran products require the administration of a test dose and, per their US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescribing information, are limited to low individual doses (100 mg), therefore requiring multiple doses to administer a typical full 1-g treatment course. However, larger doses may often be administered as infusions over a number of hours; for example, the UK labeling allows for infusion of up to 20 mg iron/kg body weight infused over 4–6 hr. The test dose is required by the FDA only for the first dose, whereas the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) requires a slower rate of administration for the first 25 mg of iron dextran for every dose, stating that "the first 25 mg of iron should be infused over a period of 15 minutes, the patient must be kept under close medical observation during this period".

### An assessment for diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for management of pediatric iron defficiency anemia in Saudi arabia: a crossectional study [^00156259]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a global public health issue that affect more than 2 billion individuals worldwide. However evidence for optimal management of IDA is lacking.

Methods

To assess the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic modalities for pediatric IDA employed by physicians in a major public healthcare facility in Riyadh, a validated questionnaire including demographic data and patient case-scenarios related to diagnosis and treatment of IDA was employed. Robust regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with overall score of participants.

Results

Of the 166 physicians surveyed 147(88.6%) were included in the study. Wide variability was observed in IDA diagnosis and therapy practises. For nutritional IDA, only 15.6% recommended no other laboratory tests in addition to CBC. The majority preferred treatment with ferrous sulfate (77.6%) divided into two doses (57.1%), but the total daily elemental iron doses varied widely from 2 to 6 mg/kg. For intravenous iron, 42.9% recommended iron dextran, 32.7% iron sucrose, and 13.4% would continue oral iron. Of all assessed factors, median score was significantly highest in pediatric hematologists compared with pediatricians, family medicine specialists and GPs; p = 0.007, and those work in tertiary care compared with those in primary care; p = 0.043. However, in multivariate robust regression analysis, overall score was only significantly associated with professional qualification [pediatric hematologist β = 13.71,95%CI 2.48–24.95, p = 0.017; pediatrician β = 1.77,95%C (− 6.05–9.59, p = 0.66; family medicine β = 2.66,95%CI-4.30–9.58, p = 0.45 compared with general practitioner].

Conclusion

Wide variations exist among physicians in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric IDA. Intervention programs and national guidelines are urgently needed.

### Are we giving too much iron? Low-dose iron therapy is effective in octogenarians [^8c91c7be]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Elderly patients are vulnerable to the dose-dependent adverse effects of iron replacement therapy. Our study examines whether low-dose iron therapy can efficiently resolve iron-deficiency anemia in patients over the age of 80 years and reduce adverse effects.

Subjects and Methods

Ninety hospitalized patients with iron-deficiency anemia were randomized to receive elemental iron in daily doses of 15 mg or 50 mg as liquid ferrous gluconate or 150 mg of ferrous calcium citrate tablets for 60 days. Thirty control patients without anemia were given 15 mg of iron for 60 days. A 2-hour iron absorption test was performed after the initial dose. Hemoglobin and ferritin levels were measured on day 1, 30, and 60 after initiating therapy. Each patient completed a weekly questionnaire regarding drug-induced adverse effects.

Results

Serum iron rose significantly in the anemic patients beginning 15 minutes after the first dose but not in nonanemic patients. Two months of iron treatment significantly increased hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations similarly in all 3 groups of iron-deficiency anemia patients (for example, hemoglobin levels rose from 10.0 g/dL to 11.3 g/dL with 15 mg/d of iron therapy and from 10.2 g/dL to 11.6 g/dL with 150 mg/d). Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel movements, and black stools were significantly more common at higher iron doses.

Conclusions

Low-dose iron treatment is effective in elderly patients with iron-deficiency anemia. It can replace the commonly used higher doses and can significantly reduce adverse effects.

### Iron preparations for women of reproductive age with iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy (FRIDA): a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^d36d37e4]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Numerous iron preparations are available for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy. We aimed to provide a summary of the effectiveness and safety of iron preparations used in this setting.

Methods

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, trial registers, and grey literature for trials published in any language from Jan 1, 2011, to Feb 28, 2021. We included trials including pregnant women with iron deficiency anaemia and evaluating iron preparations, irrespective of administration route, with at least 60 mg of elemental iron, in comparison with another iron or non-iron preparation. Three authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and did a risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane tool (version 1.0). The primary outcome was the effectiveness of iron preparations, evaluated by changes in haemoglobin concentration at 4 weeks from baseline. The secondary outcomes were change in serum ferritin concentration at 4 weeks from baseline and treatment-related severe and non-severe adverse events. We did random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses. Side-effects were reported descriptively for each trial. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018100822.

Findings

Among 3037 records screened, 128 full-text articles were further assessed for eligibility. Of the 53 eligible trials (reporting on 9145 women), 30 (15 interventions; 3243 women) contributed data to the network meta-analysis for haemoglobin and 15 (nine interventions; 1396 women) for serum ferritin. The risk of bias varied across the trials contributing to network meta-analysis, with 22 of 30 trials in the network meta-analysis for haemoglobin judged to have a high or medium global risk of bias. Compared with oral ferrous sulfate, intravenous iron sucrose improved both haemoglobin (mean difference 7.17 g/L, 95% CI 2.62–11.73; seven trials) and serum ferritin (mean difference 49.66 μg/L, 13.63–85.69; four trials), and intravenous ferric carboxymaltose improved haemoglobin (mean difference 8.52 g/L, 0.51–16.53; one trial). The evidence for other interventions compared with ferrous sulfate was insufficient. The most common side-effects with oral iron preparations were gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, and altered bowel movements). Side-effects were less common with parenteral iron preparations, although these included local pain, skin irratation, and, on rare occasions, allergic reactions.

Interpretation

Iron preparations for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy vary in effectiveness, with good evidence of benefit for intravenous iron sucrose and some evidence for intravenous ferric carboxymaltose. Clinicians and policy makers should consider the effectiveness of individual preparations before administration, to ensure effective treatment.

### Optimal oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anemia among US veterans [^b17eeaa0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Oral iron supplementation is a preferred approach to treat iron deficiency anemia (IDA). However, iron absorption from supplements in iron-depleted patients is low (2%-13% with food and 5%-28% without food). To compensate for this low absorption and to increase bioavailability, large iron doses are often administered in divided doses, typically 2 to 3 times per day.

Hepcidin is the central regulatory molecule in iron metabolism. Oral iron supplements acutely increase serum hepcidin level, and a higher level of hepcidin inhibits further absorption of iron from the gut. Hence, acute hepcidin rise triggered by a morning iron dose might lead to poor absorption of an afternoon or evening dose of oral iron. Furthermore, hepcidin levels are elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may impair the absorption of oral iron and reduce the efficacy of oral iron supplementation in patients with IDA and CKD. However, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline recommends trials of oral iron 2 to 3 times per day in patients with IDA.

A recent studyshowed no difference in fractional oral iron absorption between single daily doses vs divided daily doses in iron deficient patients without anemia. Furthermore, compared with daily iron dosing, alternate-day iron dosing showed 34% higher rate of iron absorption. However, the association of this less frequent iron supplementation with hemoglobin and iron indices has not been properly investigated among patients with IDA who have either normal kidney function (NKF) or CKD. We investigated the association of 2 to 3 times a day oral iron administration (typical clinical practice) vs once daily oral iron administration vs alternate day oral iron administration with the change of hemoglobin and iron indices in patients with NKF and CKD.

The absorption of oral iron salts is significantly impaired if taken with food. Taking iron with meals can reduce bioavailability by up to 75%. This necessitates iron being taken either in the fasting state first thing in the morning or in periods between meals during the day. It is not clear how soon after oral iron food can be taken, but the inhibitory effect of tea on iron absorption dissipates within 60 min. Despite previous suggestions of benefit, coadministration of vitamin C with oral IRT is not recommended — a recent large randomised controlled trial has confirmed that it neither enhances the haematological response or rate of iron loading, nor diminishes side effects.

Iron absorption from oral preparations is determined by a complex interplay involving total body iron stores, erythropoietic activity of the bone marrow, recent exposure of the small intestine to iron and systemic inflammation. Hepcidin is the most important inhibitor of iron absorption. Hepcidin levels follow a diurnal pattern and increase after oral iron intake, impairing fractional absorption of subsequent doses.

Short-term studies of iron-depleted but otherwise healthy women have shown that oral doses of 60 mg elemental iron stimulate increased hepcidin levels for the next 24 hours, thus reducing subsequent iron absorption by 35%–45%. As a consequence, the overall absorption of iron from 60 mg of elemental iron taken once a day was similar to that from 60 mg two times a day. Therapy with low dose oral iron has been reported to be successful and safe in elderly patients with IDA — a daily dose of 15 mg of elemental iron was as effective as 50 mg or 150 mg in terms of the Hb response, with a lower incidence of adverse effects.

There are limited data on outcomes at lower dosage frequencies. Alternate day dosing leads to a significantly increased fractional iron and total iron absorption in iron-depleted healthy women. Fractional iron absorption was significantly higher with alternate day administration of 100 mg or 200 mg elemental iron compared with daily dosing. Importantly, the overall iron absorption from 200 mg on alternate days was almost twice that from the equivalent dosage of 100 mg on consecutive days. In a randomised trial comparing treatment regimes in subjects with IDA, 60 mg elemental iron two times a day produced a faster rate of Hb rise than 120 mg on alternate days (ie, half the equivalent daily dose), though similar Hb increments were seen with alternate day dosing after the same total dose had been given, with a significantly lower prevalence of nausea.

### Identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy [^bac5d8cd]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common during pregnancy, and while most anemia is physiologic, the most common pathologic cause is iron deficiency. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends confirmation of iron deficiency anemia with iron studies when anemia is diagnosed during pregnancy but acknowledges that presumptive treatment for suspected iron deficiency anemia is common in practice. Currently ACOG does not recommend treating iron deficiency without anemia during pregnancy. Though the benefits of treating iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy are clear, the optimal route of iron repletion remains uncertain. Results of ongoing large, randomized trials will help define the optimal route of iron treatment for pregnant patients diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia.

### Alternate day versus daily oral iron for treatment of iron deficiency anemia: a randomized controlled trial [^beab2095]. Scientific Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The study Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA was published by Elamparithi Pasupathy and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Sci Rep. This study is related to the following diseases: Iron deficiency anemia. In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the trial question was: is alternate day oral iron therapy superior to daily oral iron therapy in patients with iron deficiency anemia? In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the study design was: single center, double blinded, RCT. In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the population was: 200 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with iron deficiency anemia. The key exclusion criteria were CKD; chronic liver disease; HF; malignancy; hemolytic anemia; pregnancy; blood transfusions within past 3 months; severe anemia requiring transfusion. In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the interventions were: n = 100 alternate day iron therapy (120 mg elemental iron tablets on alternate days for 8 weeks) n = 100 daily iron therapy (single tablet of 60 mg elemental iron daily for 8 weeks). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in mean improvement in hemoglobin level at week 8 (1.05 g/dL vs. 1.36 g/dL; AD -0.31 g/dL, 95% CI -1.13 to 0.51). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in improvement in ferritin level at week 4 (30.84 ng/mL vs. 17.69 ng/mL; AD 13.15 ng/mL, 95% CI -12.52 to 38.82) No significant difference in proportion of patients with at least 2 g/dL rise in hemoglobin at week 8 (17.71% vs. 22.45%; ARD -4.74, 95% CI -15.84 to 6.36). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in other adverse events. significant difference in nausea at week 4 (10.3% vs. 2%). In the Alternate day vs. daily oral iron in IDA study, the conclusion was: in patients with iron deficiency anemia, alternate day iron therapy was not superior to daily iron therapy with respect to mean improvement in hemoglobin level at week 8.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### The clinical impact of oral iron treatment for anaemia in pregnancy in accordance with current guidance: a prospective cohort study in a maternity unit in the midlands of england [^d662074e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Support and guidance on management of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy was implemented in a dedicated anaemia clinic, achieving a high level of follow-up. The study was a single centre evaluation, therefore limiting the extrapolation of the findings to other maternity populations. The implications of our work for low- and middle-income settings, where IDA is more prevalent, requires further study. Also, the timing of follow up to see if there had been a response to treatment was wider than recommended for some women. This was for pragmatic reasons, but future studies will need to address this issue.

A significant limitation was the change in guidance for oral iron treatment during the study period. The recommendations for dosing with ferrous sulphate were changed, from 200 mg three times a day, reducing it to 65 mg (one 200 mg tablet) of elemental iron per day. However, recent evidence shows that alternate day compared to consecutive day dosing does not necessarily result in higher levels of ferritin but does have reduced numbers of gastrointestinal side effects. It therefore remains possible that some of our results were affected by the dosing frequency, or the formulation of the iron preparation used, which had an impact on the frequency of side effects experienced by the women and thus affected their adherence with oral treatment. Newer or alternative formulations may improve absorption or adherence.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^8271d660]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

Intravenous iron

IV iron therapy generally showed more consistent efficacy than oral iron in increasing haemoglobin levels, although individual responses varied (Table S1). This advantage is likely due to IV iron's higher elemental iron content and favourable pharmacokinetic profile. While a single dose of oral iron generally provides about 20 mg of elemental iron daily (containing up to 30% elemental iron, with 10%–35% absorption), IV formulations like ferric carboxymaltose can deliver 500–1000 mg per dose, bypassing the intestinal hepcidin–ferroportin block by entering macrophages directly. Macrophages, with higher overall ferroportin expression than enterocytes, require significantly more hepcidin for comparable suppression of cellular iron release. Furthermore, IV iron, by directly loading iron into macrophages, upregulates ferroportin via the cellular iron regulatory IRP/IRE (iron regulatory protein/iron responsive element) pathway, preventing intracellular iron toxicity. Repeated IV iron administrations that elevate intracellular iron levels beyond a certain threshold facilitate effective, but not complete, iron mobilization from macrophages for erythropoiesis (Figure 1).

Despite the general effectiveness of IV iron therapy, case studies showed differences in administered doses, duration of effect and haemoglobin responses, even among patients with similar genotypes. Higher doses or shorter intervals between administrations generally tended to further improve haemoglobin levels (Table S1). Of note, published cases predominantly involved children with IRIDA, whose responses may differ from adults due to age‐related physiological differences.
