## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of bradycardia in adults (post-heart transplant sinus node dysfunction)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction in adults after heart transplantation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and why standard agents like atropine fail. Then, I should verify which pharmacologic options are recommended and their dosing. Next, I will check the strength of evidence and guideline class/level. After that, I need to consider alternatives if methylxanthines are contraindicated or ineffective. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, safety, and when to escalate to pacing, and I will double-check any conflicting dosing details along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. Post–heart transplant bradycardia is commonly due to sinus node dysfunction from autonomic denervation, which renders atropine ineffective because there is no vagal tone to antagonize; in fact, atropine can precipitate paradoxical heart block or sinus arrest in denervated hearts, so it is contraindicated unless there is proven parasympathetic reinnervation, which is uncommon early after transplant [^5fbb9f02] [^2346f508] [^544154cf].

> Wait, let me verify the recommended first-line pharmacologic therapy. Multiple ACC/AHA/HRS guideline sections converge on methylxanthines (theophylline or aminophylline) as reasonable to increase heart rate in post–heart transplant SND, supported by small observational studies showing restoration of sinus rates around 90 bpm and reduced pacemaker implantation in some series; this is a Class IIa recommendation with Level of Evidence C-LD [^5fbb9f02] [^363b76c0] [^0548f405] [^f5560207].

> I will now examine the specific dosing. For acute therapy, aminophylline 6 mg/kg IV diluted in 100–200 mL over 20–30 minutes is recommended; for transition or maintenance, theophylline 300 mg IV once, followed by oral theophylline 5–10 mg/kg/day in divided doses, titrated to a therapeutic serum level of 10–20 mcg/mL, with typical post-transplant maintenance around 450 ± 100 mg/day; I should confirm that these match both guideline tables and FDA labeling, which they do [^2986ac05] [^401bfa77] [^80435ab1].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence quality and limitations. The recommendation is based on small observational studies and physiologic rationale rather than randomized trials, and methylxanthines are not effective for bradyasystolic arrest outside transplant-specific contexts; thus, while reasonable in post-transplant SND, expectations should be tempered and decisions individualized based on response and tolerability [^4f5b8592] [^5fbb9f02].

> Next, I should review alternatives if methylxanthines are contraindicated or ineffective. Isoproterenol infusion 1–20 mcg/min is a reasonable temporizing measure in monitored settings, recognizing it increases myocardial oxygen demand and may worsen ischemia; dopamine or epinephrine infusions can be considered in unstable bradycardia, but again, these are second-line and should be used cautiously with close hemodynamic monitoring; importantly, atropine should be avoided in denervated hearts absent proven reinnervation [^55631348] [^6eac6188] [^544154cf].

> I need to ensure I address pacing thresholds and timing. Temporary pacing is indicated for hemodynamic compromise or when pharmacologic therapy fails, and permanent pacing is generally reserved for persistent, symptomatic SND beyond about 3 weeks post-transplant; with modern bicaval techniques, permanent pacemaker rates have fallen to roughly 2–4%, and many early bradyarrhythmias resolve spontaneously over 6–12 months, so pacing decisions should be deliberate and symptom-correlated [^a7ed82db] [^97c13827] [^b5a13686].

> Let me consider monitoring and safety. Serum theophylline levels should be checked to maintain 10–20 mcg/mL, with awareness of drug interactions and toxicity; methylxanthines can cause gastrointestinal upset, tremor, insomnia, and arrhythmias at high levels, so dose titration should be cautious, especially in the setting of renal or hepatic impairment or concomitant medications that alter clearance [^80435ab1] [^5fbb9f02].

> But wait, what if someone proposes ivabradine for this indication? I should double-check that. Ivabradine is not indicated for post–heart transplant SND; it is approved for HFrEF to reduce hospitalization and is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome without a pacemaker, so using it to treat denervation-related bradycardia would be inappropriate here [^2ceb2a48] [^fdc35640].

> In summary, I should confirm the practical regimen. For acute treatment, give aminophylline 6 mg/kg IV over 20–30 minutes; for maintenance, start theophylline 300 mg IV once, then transition to oral theophylline 5–10 mg/kg/day divided and titrate to a serum level of 10–20 mcg/mL, typically around 450 ± 100 mg/day in post-transplant patients; avoid atropine unless there is proven autonomic reinnervation, and escalate to isoproterenol or temporary pacing if methylxanthines are ineffective or contraindicated, with permanent pacing reserved for persistent symptomatic SND beyond 3 weeks [^2986ac05] [^401bfa77] [^80435ab1] [^544154cf] [^a7ed82db].

For adult post–heart transplant sinus node dysfunction, **atropine is ineffective and contraindicated** due to denervation; use methylxanthines instead [^544154cf] [^5fbb9f02]. The recommended regimen is **aminophylline 6 mg/kg IV over 20–30 minutes** [^2986ac05], or **theophylline 300 mg IV once**, followed by oral theophylline 5–10 mg/kg/day in divided doses, titrated to a serum level of 10–20 mcg/mL [^80435ab1] [^401bfa77]. If methylxanthines are contraindicated or ineffective, use isoproterenol 1–10 mcg/min IV [^a49aba6f] or temporary pacing [^584c5c76]; permanent pacing is indicated for persistent symptomatic bradycardia beyond 3 weeks [^a7ed82db].

## Pharmacological management

### Methylxanthines (first-line therapy)

Methylxanthines are the **first-line pharmacological treatment** for bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction in post–heart transplant patients [^0548f405]. They exert positive chronotropic effects by antagonizing adenosine receptors, thereby increasing heart rate [^6e8bce32].

- **Aminophylline**: 6 mg/kg IV diluted in 100–200 mL of IV fluid, administered over 20–30 minutes [^2986ac05] [^401bfa77].
- **Theophylline**: 300 mg IV once, followed by oral theophylline 5–10 mg/kg/day in divided doses, titrated to maintain serum levels of 10–20 mcg/mL [^80435ab1] [^401bfa77]. Typical post-transplant dosages average 450 mg ± 100 mg/day [^2986ac05].

---

### Alternative pharmacological agents (second-line therapy)

If methylxanthines are contraindicated or ineffective, **alternative pharmacological agents** may be considered:

- **Isoproterenol**: 1–10 mcg/min IV infusion, titrated to effect [^a49aba6f].
- **Dopamine or epinephrine**: Considered in cases of severe bradycardia with hemodynamic compromise, though they are less specific and may have more significant side effects [^6eac6188].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Temporary pacing is indicated for **hemodynamically significant bradycardia** unresponsive to pharmacological therapy [^584c5c76]. Permanent pacing is indicated if symptomatic bradycardia persists beyond 3 weeks post-transplant [^a7ed82db].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Atropine contraindication**: Atropine is ineffective and potentially harmful in post–heart transplant patients due to autonomic denervation and should not be administered [^544154cf] [^2346f508].
- **Monitoring**: Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential during acute management to assess response and detect potential complications.
- **Drug interactions**: Methylxanthines interact with immunosuppressive agents (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus), necessitating careful monitoring of drug levels and renal function [^notfound].

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — acute management emphasizes identifying and treating reversible causes, with cautions for special situations. In symptomatic patients presenting with SND, evaluation and treatment of reversible causes is recommended, and potentially reversible contributors include acute MI, atrial tachyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothyroidism, medications, infections, and metabolic abnormalities. Most patients present with chronic complaints that do not require acute treatment, and most causes are chronic and irreversible. In acute care, atropine should not be given in patients after heart transplant, and in patients with drug toxicity and severe symptoms, preparation for pacing should proceed simultaneously with pharmacologic treatment of drug toxicity.

Heart transplant — sinus node dysfunction notes that sinus bradycardia is common after transplant, with bradycardia in recipients sometimes defined as a heart rate persistently < 70 or 80 bpm, and sinus rates of < 70 to 80 bpm may be inadequate for postoperative demand. Atropine is ineffective for post–heart transplant SND. Small observational studies suggest benefit from methylxanthines: in 2 studies of 15 and 29 patients, oral theophylline was associated with restoration of a sinus rate of 90 bpm and one study showed reduced PPM implantation, whereas aminophylline infusion in invasive EPS had variable effects on sinus node function and heart rate.

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine — clinical considerations: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand and decreases coronary perfusion, it is best avoided where coronary ischemia is a concern and has only a second-line role in resuscitation, with two randomized trials in cardiac arrest showing no improvement in return of spontaneous circulation or survival. In unstable bradycardia refractory to fluids and atropine, a trial of 82 patients randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine showed no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In heart transplant recipients, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or sinus arrest in 20% of 25 patients, and parasympathetic reinnervation was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Isoproterenol, dopamine, and atropine for bradycardia — key evidence and dosing: Because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand while decreasing coronary perfusion, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia, and from a clinical standpoint it is predominantly used in the electrophysiology laboratory (1–20 mcg/ min intravenously); two RCTs of isoproterenol as adjunctive therapy in the setting of cardiac arrest did not show improved return of spontaneous circulation or survival to hospital discharge. In a trial of 82 patients with unstable bradycardia refractory to intravenous fluid bolus and atropine randomized to transcutaneous pacing or dopamine at doses of 5 mcg/ kg/ min, titrated every 2 minutes by 5 mcg/ kg/ min to a maximum of 20 mcg/ kg/ min, there was no difference in survival to hospital discharge or serious adverse events. In a study of 25 patients who had undergone heart transplant, atropine at standard clinical doses resulted in paradoxical heart block or less commonly sinus arrest in 20%, and evidence for parasympathetic reinnervation after orthotopic heart transplant was far less common, 34% versus 11% in 1 series using heart rate variability response to neck suction to test autonomic responses.

Cardiac transplantation — bradyarrhythmias and pacing: The incidence of bradyarrhythmias after cardiac transplantation varies from 8% to 23%, and most are associated with sinus node dysfunction (SND). Attempts to treat bradycardia with theophylline may minimize the need for pacing, and approximately 50% of patients show resolution of the bradyarrhythmia within 6 to 12 months. Posttransplant patients who have irreversible SND or atrioventricular (AV) block with previously stated Class I indications should have permanent pacemaker implantation, and when recurrent syncope develops late after transplantation, pacemaker implantation may be considered despite repeated negative evaluations because sudden episodes of bradycardia are often eventually documented.

Heart transplant — post-transplant bradycardia and pacing: With the adoption of bicaval heart transplant anastomoses rather than biatrial anastomoses, the pacemaker rate has decreased from 10% to 14% to 2% to 4%. Sinus node dysfunction (SND) remains the most common cause for bradycardia, accounting for approximately 80% of cases. A relationship between bradycardia and allograft rejection has not been found more generally in analyses of large databases. Guidelines for the use of permanent pacing are the same for those that apply generally for SND and atrioventricular block, with careful evaluation for symptomatic SND.

Beta-blocker–related bradycardia and heart block — management indicates that the slowing of heart rate and cardiac conduction is generally asymptomatic and generally requires no treatment; however, if the bradycardia is accompanied by dizziness or lightheadedness or if second- or third-degree heart block occurs, physicians should decrease the dose of the beta-blocker. Physicians should also consider the possibility of drug interactions, because other drugs can cause bradycardia or heart block and may be discontinued. The role of pacemaker therapy with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) to permit the use of beta-blocker therapy is entirely unknown.

Atropine and catecholamines — mechanism and dosing notes for bradycardia: Atropine is described as "a parasympatholytic drug that blocks the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor," and in the sinus node "increases sinus node automaticity at doses of approximately 0.5 to 2 mg with a half-life of approximately 2 hours." Isoproterenol "is a nonselective beta agonist with both chronotropic and inotropic effects" and in SND infusion studies some patients "may require higher dosages, or may have a vasodilatory effect." Dopamine "is a catecholamine" where "at low doses of 1 to 2 mcg/kg/min, the effect is predominantly vasodilatory, while at doses of 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min, enhanced chronotropy and inotropy predominate," with higher doses requiring caution due to "profound vasoconstriction and proarrhythmias." Epinephrine "is a catecholamine with strong alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic stimulatory effects, including increasing chronotropy, inotropy, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption."

Perioperative management of cardiac arrhythmias in heart transplant recipients — AV conduction disorders are common (> 10%), and AV pacing may be needed to maintain HR > 90 bpm; pacemaker implantation is indicated if symptomatic bradycardia persists after 3 weeks post‑transplant. Beta blockers, calcium antagonists, adenosine, and amiodarone can be used safely after HT, but amiodarone and calcium antagonists can increase calcineurin inhibitor levels requiring dose adjustment and level monitoring. Low‑dose adenosine can be used with minimal risk when initial doses are 25 mcg/kg or 1.5 mg if ≥ 60 kg with gradual increases, and tachyarrhythmias may relate to rejection or cardiac allograft vasculopathy that should be excluded.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — atropine and isoproterenol in sinus bradycardia: In patients with sinus bradycardia, atropine at dosages of 0.5 to 2 mg usually enhances automaticity, but in rare cases can be associated with intra-atrial reentry and or sinus pauses. The sinoatrial node response to atropine is bimodal, lower doses (usually < 0.5 mg) are associated with slower rates and acceleration with higher doses. In patients with hemodynamically unstable sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, atropine has demonstrated some benefit and minimal risk of worsening bradycardia, ischemia or potentiating ventricular fibrillation, and in an RCT of men undergoing elective laparoscopic prostate surgery, atropine effectively treated anesthetic induced sinus bradycardia. For isoproterenol, there are numerous case reports and series describing the salutary use in patients presenting with sinus bradycardia; however, there are no clinical trials or observational series data to support or discourage its use in this setting, and because isoproterenol increases myocardial oxygen demand through beta-1 effects while decreasing coronary perfusion attributable to beta-2 effects, it is best avoided in settings where there is concern for coronary ischemia.

Cardiovascular bradycardia — EMS key considerations include observing for decreased end-organ perfusion signs such as chest pain, shortness of breath, decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine. Consider potential culprit medications including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti-depressants, digoxin, and clonidine, and consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction, hypoxia, pacemaker failure, hypothermia, sinus bradycardia, athletes, head injury with increased intracranial pressure, stroke, spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, and cholinergic nerve agents. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed. Third-degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight-based for non-obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiogenic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine. Caution: Norepinephrine can theoretically cause reflex bradycardia.

ISHLT heart transplant recipients — anesthesia and arrhythmia considerations: Anesthesia can be safely induced if there is clear understanding that the HT is denervated, and the resting heart rate is usually higher in HT recipients. Most allografts have a resting heart rate of approximately 90 beats/min, and some have resting sinus rates as high as 130 beats/min without requiring treatment. Relative, symptomatic bradycardia requiring treatment will not respond to atropine; isoproterenol infusion and pacing are the usual modes of management. Although uncommon, the likeliest sustained atrial arrhythmia is atrial flutter, and the denervated heart is highly sensitive to adenosine such that standard doses for atrial tachyarrhythmias may result in prolonged asystole.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Nexterone) [^5e58c812]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (9 to 36 days) and its metabolite desethylamiodarone (9 to 30 days), adverse reactions or interactions, as well as observed adverse effects, can persist following amiodarone withdrawal.

5.2 Hypotension

Hypotension, the most common adverse reaction seen with intravenous amiodarone seen most often in the first several hours of treatment and is likely related to the rate of infusion. In some cases, hypotension may be refractory and result in a fatal outcome. Hypotension necessitating alterations in intravenous amiodarone therapy was reported in 3% of patients, with permanent discontinuation required in less than 2% of patients.

Treat hypotension initially by slowing the infusion; additional standard therapy may be needed, including the following: vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion. Monitor the initial rate of infusion closely and do not exceed the recommended rate [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.3 Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) Post Cardiac Transplant

In retrospective studies, amiodarone use in transplant recipients prior to heart transplants has been associated with an increased risk of PGD. PGD is a life-threatening complication of heart transplantation that presents as a left, right or biventricular dysfunction occurring within the first 24 hours of transplant surgery for which there is no identifiable secondary cause (see section 6.2). Severe PGD may be irreversible. For patients who are on the heart transplant waiting list, consideration should be given to use an alternative antiarrhythmic drug as early as possible before transplant.

5.4 Bradycardia and Atrioventricular Block

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection causes bradycardia and AV block which may require slowing the infusion rate or discontinuing NEXTERONE. In some patients, inserting a pacemaker is required. Have a temporary pacemaker available when treating a patient predisposed to bradycardia or AV block.

5.5 Hepatic Injury

Acute hepatocellular necrosis leading to hepatic coma, acute renal failure, and death has been associated with the administration of intravenous amiodarone. Intravenous infusions at much higher concentrations and rates of infusion than those recommended appear to increase this risk [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Carefully monitor patients receiving NEXTERONE Premixed Injection for evidence of progressive hepatic injury. Consider reducing the rate of administration or withdrawing NEXTERONE Premixed Injection if hepatic injury occurs.

Acute medical therapy synopsis for SND-related bradycardia — Atropine facilitates sinoatrial conduction and increases sinus node automaticity at doses of approximately 0.5 to 2 mg with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Isoproterenol is a nonselective beta agonist with both chronotropic and inotropic effects on cardiac myocytes, enhancing sinus and atrioventricular nodal function without exerting a vasopressor effect, and in patients with SND undergoing isoproterenol infusion in the electrophysiology laboratory setting, heart rate increases similar to normal controls are described, although some patients do not demonstrate a robust heart rate response, may require higher dosages, or may have a vasodilatory effect. Dopamine is a catecholamine with mixed alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and dopaminergic effects; at low doses of 1 to 2 mcg/kg/min the effect is predominantly vasodilatory, while at doses of 5 to 20 mcg/kg/min enhanced chronotropy and inotropy predominate, and higher doses may be required for a chronotropic response but must be used judiciously because of the association with profound vasoconstriction and proarrhythmias.

### Arrhythmias after heart transplantation: mechanisms and management [^5aa9d2d6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Arrhythmias: Manifestations and Management

Bradycardia and Conduction System Disease

Sympathetic denervation, ischemic injury to the sinus node, graft ischemia, and drug effects are the common underlying causes of posttransplantation bradycardia.– Some of these patients have tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, and drugs for treatment of atrial arrhythmia may worsen the bradycardia. A potential association of bradycardia with increased likelihood of rejection or graft vasculopathy is controversial. Complete AV block has been reported late after HT, with multiple possible etiologies, including postoperative injury, progressive conduction system disease associated with coronary artery disease, LV dysfunction, chronic rejection, and injury from endomyocardial biopsies. – The available retrospective series are not able to provide an exact prevalence of bradycardia episodes and AV block, but risk increases with time after transplantation.

In the perioperative period, bradycardia should be managed with temporary pacing in order to maintain heart rates higher than 90 per minute. Alternatively, isoproterenol, theophylline, or terbutaline can be used to maintain heart rate while awaiting return of normal sinus node function. Permanent pacemakers are generally indicated only for bradycardia that does not resolve and is associated with symptoms. Implantation of pacemaker is usually delayed until after the third week after transplantation. In most large series, permanent pacemakers were implanted in < 10% of patients, with a few studies documenting a higher prevalence of > 20%. In a large retrospective series, biatrial anastomosis was the major risk factor for permanent pacemaker implantation, though older donor age may contribute, and graft ischemic time has been associated in some series. Early after HT, sinus node dysfunction is the most common reason for pacemaker implantation; after 30 days, AV conduction disease and sinus node dysfunction are equally prevalent indications. However, biatrial anastomosis or need for permanent pacemaker implantation is not associated with decreased survival. A large series of patients with pacemaker implantation after HT reported that only 14.5% of patients are pacemaker dependent 6 months after implantation. Even with AV nodal disease, only 20% are pacemaker dependent. Usually AV block is intermittent, and permanent complete heart block is rare. A more recent series, however, showed that the majority of patients who had pacemakers implanted for late-onset AV block were pacemaker dependent on follow-up. A generally accepted management strategy for postoperative and late-onset bradycardia is shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

Bradycardia and sinus node dysfunction definitions in adults — The National Institutes of Health defines bradycardia as a heart rate < 60 bpm in adults other than well trained athletes, though population studies often use a lower cutoff of 50 bpm; in a Netherlands analysis the lowest second percentile for heart rate ranged from 40 to 55 bpm depending on sex and age, and sinus pauses of 2 seconds and 3 seconds have been described during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in healthy elderly patients and long-distance runners. For this document, a sinus rate < 50 bpm and/or a sinus pause > 3 seconds are potential components of the definitions of sinus node dysfunction (SND); however, the presence of sinus bradycardia or a pause > 3 seconds alone should not be used for the diagnosis of SND, and with rare exceptions, the sole reason for considering any treatment for SND is the presence of symptoms. Chronotropic incompetence is described as failure to reach a target heart rate with exertion relative to expected for age that is inadequate to meet metabolic demand.

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^ebf68f32]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals, and in patients as part of normal aging or disease (Table 1). Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. In this review, we will highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) — sinus node dysfunction (SND) pacing: Permanent pacing can alleviate symptoms from SND in adults with ACHD, and in adults with ACHD, SND is associated with higher mortality and a higher rate of atrial flutter although there is no randomized trial evaluating whether permanent pacing prevents these sequelae. Given the younger median age of presentation of sinus node disease in this group of patients, they remain at higher risk for multiple transvenous leads over their lifetime. Single-lead atrial-based pacing is an established strategy for this type of patient and pathophysiology and is recommended for patients with isolated sinus nodal disease and preserved atrioventricular conduction, and single lead atrial-based pacing aims to limit the number of leads and potentially preserve vascular patency.

End-of-life issues in advanced heart failure — mortality from heart failure is due to sudden cardiac death, bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias or progressive heart failure, typically gradual in nature but on occasion rapidly progressive. Patients who develop progressive heart failure frequently die in an intensive care setting, receive major intervention and life support, and are much less likely to die at home or receive palliative care assessment. Although there are multiple prognostic markers in heart failure, predicting life expectancy is notoriously challenging, especially given the cyclic nature of the disease. Recent technological advances have led to the use of defibrillators, re-synchronization pacemakers and MCS devices as viable treatment options for patients with heart failure. This has led to increased complexity of care.

Bradycardia management for adult congenital heart disease — recommendations specify that in adults with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) and symptomatic sinus node dysfunction (SND) or chronotropic incompetence, atrial based permanent pacing is recommended; in adults with ACHD and symptomatic bradycardia related to atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is recommended; in adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block with any symptomatic bradycardia, a wide QRS escape rhythm, mean daytime heart rate below 50 bpm, complex ventricular ectopy, or ventricular dysfunction, permanent pacing is recommended; and in adults with ACHD and postoperative second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block that is not expected to resolve, permanent pacing is recommended. In asymptomatic adults with congenital complete atrioventricular block, permanent pacing is reasonable, and in adults with repaired ACHD who require permanent pacing for bradycardic indications, a bradycardia device with atrial antitachycardia pacing capabilities is reasonable; in adults with ACHD with preexisting sinus node and/or atrioventricular conduction disease who are undergoing cardiac surgery, intraoperative placement of epicardial permanent pacing leads is reasonable. In adults with ACHD and pacemakers, atrial-based permanent pacing for the prevention of atrial arrhythmias may be considered. In selected adults with ACHD and venous to systemic intracardiac shunts, placement of endocardial pacing leads is potentially harmful.

5.3 		 	Bradycardia and Conduction Disturbances

Adult Patients

Bradycardia, sinus arrest, and heart block have occurred with Corlanor. The rate of bradycardia was 6.0% per patient-year in patients treated with Corlanor (2.7% symptomatic; 3.4% asymptomatic) and 1.3% per patient-year in patients treated with placebo. Risk factors for bradycardia include sinus node dysfunction, conduction defects (e.g., 1stor 2nddegree atrioventricular block, bundle branch block), ventricular dyssynchrony, and use of other negative chronotropes (e.g., digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone). Bradycardia may increase the risk of QT prolongation which may lead to severe ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes, especially in patients with risk factors such as use of QTc prolonging drugs [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Concurrent use of verapamil or diltiazem will increase Corlanor exposure, may themselves contribute to heart rate lowering, and should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid use of Corlanor in patients with 2nddegree atrioventricular block unless a functioning demand pacemaker is present [see Contraindications (4)].

Pediatric Patients

Bradycardia and first-degree heart block were observed in pediatric patients treated with Corlanor. Asymptomatic and symptomatic bradycardia were observed in 6.8% and 4.1% of pediatric patients treated with Corlanor, respectively. In the placebo treatment arm, 2.4% of pediatric patients had asymptomatic bradycardia, but none had symptomatic bradycardia. Bradycardia was managed through dose titration but did not result in study drug discontinuation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Management of arrhythmias after heart transplant: current state and considerations for future research [^07680a14]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Orthotropic heart transplantation remains the most effective therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure, with a median survival of ≈13 years. Yet, a number of complications are observed after orthotropic heart transplantation, including atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Several factors contribute to arrhythmias, such as autonomic denervation, effect of the surgical technique, acute and chronic rejection, and transplant vasculopathy among others. To minimize risk of future arrhythmias, the bicaval technique and minimizing ischemic time are current surgical standards. Sinus node dysfunction is the most common indication for early (within 30 days) pacemaker implantation, whereas atrioventricular block incidence increases as time from transplant increases. Atrial fibrillation can occur in the first few weeks following transplantation but is uncommon in the long term unless secondary to a precipitant such as acute rejection. The most common atrial arrhythmias are atrial flutters, which are mainly typical, but atypical circuits can be observed such as those that involve the remnant donor atrium in regions immediately adjacent to the atrioatrial anastomosis suture line. Choosing the appropriate pharmacological therapy requires careful consideration due to the potential interaction with immunosuppressive agents. Despite historical concerns, adenosine is effective and safe at reduced doses if administered under cardiac monitoring. Catheter ablation has emerged as an effective treatment strategy for symptomatic supraventricular tachycardias, including ablation of atypical flutter circuits. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is an important risk factor for sudden cardiac death, yet the role of prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implant for sudden death prevention is unclear. Current indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation are as in the nontransplant population. A number of questions for future research are posed.

Pharmacologic support for bradycardia/atrioventricular block — Atropine enhances atrioventricular nodal conduction and automaticity and is generally given in 0.5- to 1.0-mg IV increments; advanced cardiac life support recommendations advise early use for hemodynamically significant bradycardia, including atrioventricular block, yet atropine is unlikely to improve block at the His bundle or His-Purkinje level and should be used judiciously in atrioventricular block with wide QRS complexes, with adverse effects including dry mouth, blurred vision, anhidrosis, urinary retention, and delirium, and excessive increase in heart rate may be problematic in acute MI. Beta-adrenergic agonists (isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine) enhance atrioventricular nodal and His-Purkinje conduction; dopamine was equivalent to transcutaneous pacing in 1 small randomized trial of unstable bradycardia unresponsive to atropine, and isoproterenol elicited an escape rhythm in 68% of pacemaker-dependent patients undergoing generator replacement, but adverse effects may include ventricular arrhythmias and induction of coronary ischemia and isoproterenol may exacerbate hypotension. Aminophylline, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has limited evidence with several small series of up to 8 patients showing prompt reversal of atrioventricular block without adverse effects, while larger studies are lacking and a large randomized trial and a systematic review showed no benefit for aminophylline in out-of-hospital brady-asystolic cardiac arrest.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdose may lead to severe and prolonged bradycardia. In the event of bradycardia with poor hemodynamic tolerance, temporary cardiac pacing may be required. Supportive treatment, including intravenous (IV) fluids, atropine, and intravenous beta-stimulating agents such as isoproterenol, may be considered.

### Arrhythmias after orthotopic heart transplantation [^5d778256]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Arrhythmias frequently occur after orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT).

Methods and Results

The most common are ventricular premature complexes, atrial premature complexes, sinus or junctional bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter, all of which have varying clinical significance depending on associated or causative conditions. Unique etiologic factors such as allograft rejection, transplant coronary artery disease, and altered anatomy and autonomic nervous system changes require that arrhythmias be treated differently after OHT compared with the general population.

Conclusion

The potentially severe ramifications of allograft rejection and coronary artery disease make treatment of these disorders in the setting of arrhythmias as important as treating the arrhythmias themselves. At the same time, autonomic denervation and altered anatomy after transplantation complicate drug and device therapies.

### Metoprolol tartrate (metoprolol tartrate) [^755ffd53]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Heart Failure

Beta blockers, like metoprolol tartrate, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock. If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol tartrate or to discontinue it.

Ischemic Heart Disease

Do not abruptly discontinue metoprolol tartrate therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol tartrate, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1–2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, metoprolol tartrate administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue metoprolol tartrate therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.

Use During Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

Bradycardia

Bradycardia, including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol tartrate. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may be at increased risk. Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving metoprolol tartrate. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol tartrate.

### Sinus node dysfunction [^650c6eb6]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction, previously known as sick sinus syndrome, describes disorders related to abnormal conduction and propagation of electrical impulses at the sinoatrial node. An abnormal atrial rate may result in the inability to meet physiologic demands, especially during periods of stress or physical activity. Sinus node dysfunction may occur at any age, but is usually more common in older persons. The causes of sinus node dysfunction are intrinsic (e.g., degenerative idiopathic fibrosis, cardiac remodeling) or extrinsic (e.g., medications, metabolic abnormalities) to the sinoatrial node. Many extrinsic causes are reversible. Electrocardiography findings include sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses or arrest, sinoatrial exit block, chronotropic incompetence, or alternating bradycardia and tachycardia (i.e., bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome). Clinical symptoms result from the hypoperfusion of end organs. About 50% of patients present with cerebral hypoperfusion (e.g., syncope, presyncope, lightheadedness, cerebrovascular accident). Other symptoms include palpitations, decreased physical activity tolerance, angina, muscular fatigue, or oliguria. A diagnosis is made by directly correlating symptoms with a bradyarrhythmia and eliminating potentially reversible extrinsic causes. Heart rate monitoring using electrocardiography or ambulatory cardiac event monitoring is performed based on the frequency of symptoms. An exercise stress test should be performed when symptoms are associated with exertion. The patient's inability to reach a heart rate of at least 80% of their predicted maximum (220 beats per minute - age) may indicate chronotropic incompetence, which is present in 50% of patients with sinus node dysfunction. First-line treatment for patients with confirmed sinus node dysfunction is permanent pacemaker placement with atrial-based pacing and limited ventricular pacing when necessary.

2.4 First Dose Monitoring in Patients With Certain Preexisting Cardiac Conditions

Because initiation of MAYZENT treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia [HR less than 55 beats per minute (bpm)], first- or second-degree [Mobitz type I] AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

First Dose 6-Hour Monitoring

Administer the first dose of MAYZENT in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.

Additional Monitoring After 6-Hour Monitoring

If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:

The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm
The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred
The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block

If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction-related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management, begin continuous ECG monitoring, and continue monitoring until the symptoms have resolved if no pharmacological treatment is required. If pharmacological treatment is required, continue monitoring overnight and repeat 6-hour monitoring after the second dose.

Advice from a cardiologist should be sought to determine the most appropriate monitoring strategy (which may include overnight monitoring) during treatment initiation, if treatment with MAYZENT is considered in patients:

With some preexisting heart and cerebrovascular conditions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
With a prolonged QTc interval before dosing or during the 6-hour observation, or at additional risk for QT prolongation, or on concurrent therapy with QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.2)]
Receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow heart rate or AV conduction [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)]

The goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or, when appropriate, pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.

Fontan patients — intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) epidemiology, risks, and acute treatment describe that the most significant rhythm issue facing adults who have undergone the Fontan operation is recurrent IART, which is a major source of morbidity in the post-Fontan population; more than 50% of patients with atriopulmonary connections will develop IART within 15 years of operation compared with fewer than 10% with lateral tunnel or extracardiac conduit connections, and other risk factors include concomitant sinus node dysfunction and older age at time of Fontan operation; tachycardia episodes can result in significant hemodynamic compromise and, if long in duration, clot formation; once recognized, acute termination of IART can be accomplished with direct current cardioversion, overdrive pacing, or certain class I or III antiarrhythmic medications, and treatment options include elective direct current cardioversion if episodes are very infrequent, recognized promptly, and well tolerated.
