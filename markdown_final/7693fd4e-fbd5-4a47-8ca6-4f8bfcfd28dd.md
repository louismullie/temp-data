## Question

What is a Holter?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a Holter is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and nomenclature. Then, I should verify the device's technical and physical specifications. Next, I will review primary clinical purposes and indications, followed by diagnostic yield and advantages. After that, I need to check key limitations and comparative disadvantages. Finally, I will synthesize where Holter fits within the broader spectrum of ambulatory ECG monitoring and provide a concise, clinically useful definition with context.

> Let me first confirm the basic definition. A Holter monitor refers to ambulatory electrocardiography that continuously records heart rhythm, typically for 24 to 48 hours, and the terminology honors Norman Jefferis Holter, reflecting decades of clinical use since the 1960s; this establishes that Holter is a noninvasive, short-term, continuous ECG recording modality used in ambulatory settings.

> I will now examine the technical and physical specifications. The device is small and light, approximately 200–300 grams, and is commonly configured for continuous 3- or 12-lead ECG recording; historically, systems evolved from 1-channel to as many as 12 channels, enabling comprehensive rhythm surveillance, including beat-to-beat capture without active patient input; wait, I initially thought "dual-lead" was the standard, but I should correct that because although dual-lead continuous recordings have been described in postoperative cohorts, the typical ambulatory Holter configurations are 3 or 12 leads in contemporary practice [^116BeXNS].

> Next, I should review the primary clinical purpose and indications. The gold standard objective is symptom–ECG correlation when arrhythmia is suspected, especially in patients with palpitations, syncope, or presyncope; guidelines support Holter when symptoms are frequent enough to be captured (for example, at least weekly) and to correlate suspected bradyarrhythmias with symptoms, while ambulatory ECG monitoring can also be appropriate in chest pain when arrhythmia is suspected or in disease-specific contexts such as cardiac sarcoidosis to quantify arrhythmic burden, though underuse has been reported [^115kdbcs] [^115J1WXT] [^116pmt93] [^115sNi4A] [^115MrBPV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about inpatient versus ambulatory monitoring. I first thought "Holter for all STEMI patients", but wait, I should verify the precise recommendation; the ESC ACS guidelines recommend continuous ECG monitoring for at least 24 hours in STEMI and early in suspected ACS, which is hospital telemetry and not necessarily an ambulatory Holter, so I should be careful to distinguish continuous inpatient monitoring from outpatient Holter terminology in guidelines [^113s2JSh] [^111r6PzE] [^1178XPsp].

> Let me consider diagnostic utility. For patients with frequent symptoms, Holter's continuous, beat-to-beat capture provides a reasonable diagnostic yield and excellent day-to-day repeatability of ectopy counts, with particularly good utility in certain pediatric subgroups such as those with congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy; in syncope/presyncope, a randomized trial showed that a 48-hour Holter identified or excluded an arrhythmia in about a quarter of patients, with a symptom–rhythm correlation achieved in roughly one in five, which frames expectations for short-duration continuous monitoring [^113okYTd].

> But wait, what if events are infrequent; I need to ensure I highlight limitations and comparative performance. The short 24–48 hour window is a major constraint, and when symptoms are rare, external loop recorders over weeks markedly outperform Holter for symptom–rhythm correlation and overall diagnostic yield; likewise, longer-duration adhesive patch monitors over 7–14 days detect substantially more clinically relevant arrhythmias than 24-hour Holter, including AF and other events that Holter misses, while practical considerations like athlete tolerance of 12-lead systems during exertion and general issues of comfort and compliance can further limit Holter's utility [^113okYTd] [^111YKgom] [^115eRC7X] [^117ST5Dk] [^116BeXNS] [^114fLiyF].

> Let me verify where Holter sits within the broader monitoring spectrum. Guidelines position Holter as one of several external ambulatory options alongside transtelephonic/event recorders, external loop recorders, patch recorders, and mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry; the choice should be driven by symptom frequency and clinical question, with Holter best when symptoms are likely within 1–2 days, whereas event or prolonged continuous monitors are favored for rarer, intermittent episodes; emerging mHealth strategies further extend monitoring windows but require thoughtful validation and workflow integration [^111TfzCp] [^116QPz7U] [^114eTEyW].

> Synthesis time; I should double-check that my definition is clinically tight and reference-aware. A Holter monitor is a noninvasive ambulatory ECG device, typically weighing 200–300 grams, that continuously records 3- or 12-lead cardiac rhythm for about 24–48 hours to achieve symptom–ECG correlation when events are frequent, quantify ectopic/arrhythmic burden, and capture asymptomatic events; its main limitations are the brief recording window and tolerability in some contexts, so when symptoms are infrequent, guidelines and comparative studies support using external loop recorders or longer-duration adhesive patch monitors that yield higher detection rates for clinically significant arrhythmias [^111TfzCp] [^116BeXNS] [^113okYTd] [^111YKgom].

---

Holter monitoring is a **continuous ambulatory ECG** recording over 24–48 hours [^117A7Wpr] [^116BeXNS] that detects intermittent arrhythmias and correlates them with symptoms during daily activities. It is indicated for palpitations, syncope, suspected arrhythmias, and for assessing therapy or device function, but has **limited yield for infrequent events** [^113okYTd] and may miss rare arrhythmias. Extended **patch monitors** [^111YKgom] or **loop recorders** [^113okYTd] are preferred for **rare events**, whereas Holter remains a cornerstone for **frequent symptoms** or **therapy assessment**.

---

## Technical overview

Holter systems typically use **3–5 ECG leads** to capture continuous signals over 24–48 hours, with patients maintaining a **diary of symptoms** and activities for temporal correlation. Data are processed with **automated detection algorithms** [^1178XPsp], followed by clinician review to verify findings and contextualize them against reported symptoms.

---

## Clinical indications

Holter monitoring is indicated for:

- **Palpitations**: Frequent or intermittent.

- **Device evaluation**: Pacemaker/ICD function [^1145HqxP].

---

## Diagnostic yield and limitations

Holter monitoring detects frequent or daily arrhythmias but has **limited yield for infrequent events** [^113okYTd]. For rare symptoms, **extended monitoring** — such as patches [^111YKgom] or loop recorders — is superior [^111TfzCp].

---

## Comparison with other ambulatory ECG monitoring methods

| **Monitoring method** | **Duration** | **Diagnostic yield** | **Patient comfort** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Holter monitor | 24–48 hours [^117A7Wpr] | High for frequent events | Moderate | Frequent symptoms, therapy assessment |
| Patch monitor | 7–14 days [^111YKgom] | Higher for infrequent events | High | Infrequent symptoms, AF detection |
| External loop recorder | 2–4 weeks [^113okYTd] | High for infrequent events | Moderate | Infrequent symptoms, syncope |
| Implantable loop recorder | Months–years | Very high for rare events | High | Rare symptoms, cryptogenic stroke |

- **Therapy assessment**: Antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation [^114eTEyW].
- **Device evaluation**: Pacemaker/ICD function [^1145HqxP].
- **Risk stratification**: Ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death [^1146iosZ].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Short monitoring duration can miss **infrequent events**, and **patient discomfort** or **skin irritation** may reduce compliance [^114Hy7vk]. Large data volumes can create an **analysis burden** and prolong review time [^1178XPsp].

---

## Future directions

AI integration aims to enhance **detection** and **interpretation** [^114eTEyW], while **extended-duration devices** aim to increase **diagnostic yield** [^111YKgom]. Patient-centered design emphasizes greater **comfort** and **usability** [^114Hy7vk].

---

Holter monitoring is a **continuous ambulatory ECG** modality used to detect frequent arrhythmias and correlate them with symptoms, while **extended monitoring** is preferred for infrequent events.

- **External loop recorder**: A continuous tape recording system that can record heart rhythms for weeks.

- **Patch recorder**: A small adhesive device that records heart rhythms and is generally attached to the chest.

- **Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry**: A real-time monitoring system that transmits data to a monitoring center for immediate review.

### An overview of the electrocardiographic monitoring devices in sports cardiology: Between present and future [^116BeXNS]. Clinical cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Ambulatory ECG monitoring for short-term periods of 24 to 48 hours represents the simplest test available. This test is performed using a small and lightweight device, weighing approximately 200 to 300 grams, that allows for 3- or 12-lead continuous noninvasive ECG monitoring. The frequency of symptoms is crucial in determining the efficacy of this diagnostic test, ideally involving daily or more than weekly episodes. Notably, the total number of premature ventricular beats (PVBs) or the presence of a high arrhythmic burden is not predictive of structural heart disease or malignant arrhythmias. In contrast, athletes with structural heart disease or complex ventricular arrhythmias exhibited a low arrhythmic burden.

For athletes experiencing PVBs, using a 12-lead ECG monitoring system instead of a 3-lead may be less tolerated, particularly during exertion. However, it is especially useful in diagnosing by detecting PVB morphology (common or uncommon) and identifying a high arrhythmic burden (greater than 10% PVBs/24 hours). Ensuring that athletes engage in habitual training for at least 30 minutes during monitoring is crucial to ascertain whether the arrhythmic event correlates with the duration and amount of effort typically performed by the athlete.

In pharmacological management and follow-up, even a 3-lead ECG monitoring can be effective, especially when common or monomorphic PVBs are present. During the occurrence of frequent arrhythmic episodes, short-term ECG monitoring is beneficial. It records the onset and termination of arrhythmias, which is particularly useful in diagnosing and managing supraventricular arrhythmias.

### An overview of the electrocardiographic monitoring devices in sports cardiology: Between present and future [^113g2Wy8]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Low credibility.

Event recorders consist of a small portable device, which is not worn continuously. When symptoms occur, the recorder is applied directly on the chest or held with both hands and activated by the patient to record a brief, single-lead ECG trace. This trace is stored and, with more modern devices, sent via digital cell phone networks for remote event analysis. Event recorders have proven their cost-efficacy in patients reporting infrequent palpitations in the late '90s, compared with conventional 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring.

The device does not allow storage of a continuous trace and the wearer's participation is essential for the recording, which usually starts after the symptom has begun, so after the onset of the arrhythmia. Furthermore, if the subject exhibits an asymptomatic short-lived arrhythmia or an extremely debilitating symptom, the device would not be activated and therefore would not record. Thus, the main indications for these devices are not debilitating palpitations, with at least a weekly or monthly occurrence or those which are inducible in foreseeable conditions (i.e. situational), whereas their use is not indicated in asymptomatic arrhythmias.

Limitations of these devices include limited storage capacity of the strips and possible forgetfulness or untimely activation of the recording by the athlete. The battery duration of event recorders varies from a few days to up to one month.

### Ecg monitoring in syncope [^115kdbcs]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is a well-established procedure in the work-up of patients with syncope or for diagnosing arrhythmias. The investigation of syncope remains challenging, and physicians have an increasing armamentarium of diagnostic tools available. With advances in technology, the role of these tools must be continuously evaluated. The gold standard for the diagnosis of syncope is a symptom-ECG correlation. While many studies have investigated the use and indications of both short-term and long-term monitoring, there is still some uncertainty in their clinical utility and practical approach.

Use of ECG monitoring and other diagnostic tools is often subject to a "shot-gun approach" rather than a strict guideline algorithm. A systematic approach and selection of ECG monitoring tools help ensure effective usage of the limited health care resources available for managing unexplained syncope. This review aims to focus and clarify the role of short-term (Holter and external loop recorders) and long-term (implantable loop recorders) ECG monitoring in diagnosing and managing patients with unexplained syncope.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving Holter monitoring [^116pZaNv]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). High credibility.

- **Ambulatory Holters and frequent PVCs by sex**: While women in the civilian cohort underwent more ambulatory ECG monitoring (58%, Supporting Information S1: Table S1), males exhibited a greater prevalence of frequent and high‐burden premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) compared to women (12% vs. 7%, respectively). However, most studies addressing PVC suppression involve a higher percentage of female patients. This trend can likely be attributed to referral bias, where symptomatic individuals are more often referred for clinical studies involving PVC suppression, such as radiofrequency ablation or antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs).

	- The Olmsted County study supports this observation, indicating women had a higher incidence of symptomatic PVCs than men (46.2 vs. 20.5 per 100,000, respectively). Consistent with these findings, our civilian cohort suggests females more frequently undergo ambulatory Holter monitoring, possibly due to a higher incidence of symptoms or palpitations. Additionally, our study observed that females undergoing ambulatory ECG Holter monitoring were less likely to have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment compared to males, despite the occurrence of frequent PVCs. Although the reason for this is unclear, it parallels trends seen in coronary artery disease, where females reporting palpitations are less likely to receive echocardiographic evaluations than males.

	- Finally, males demonstrated a higher PVC burden than females in the cohort with preserved LVEF (odds ratio = 1.53). However, this sex difference was not evident in patients with LVEF < 50% (odds ratio = 1.15), suggesting that sex differences may become irrelevant in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction.

### Establishing reference ranges for ambulatory electrocardiography parameters: Meta-analysis [^115jek2s]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread and increasing use of ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG), there is no consensus on reference ranges for ambulatory electrocardiogram parameters to guide interpretation. We sought to determine population distribution-based reference ranges for parameters measured during ambulatory electrocardiogram in healthy adults, based on existing literature.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple databases from 1950 to 2020. Articles reporting original data from ≥ 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring in healthy adults were included. Data extraction and synthesis were performed according to Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. The prevalence, mean, and standard deviation for common parameters (sinus pauses, conduction abnormalities, and ectopy) were extracted by age group (18–39, 40–59, 60–79, and 80+ years).

- **Results**: We identified 33 studies involving 6,466 patients. Sinus pauses of > 3 seconds were rare, with a pooled prevalence of 1,000/24 hours increasing with age, from 0% (95% CI 0% to 0%) in those aged 18–39 years to 6% (95% CI 0% to 17%) in those aged 60–79 years. Episodes of supraventricular tachycardia increased from 3% (95% CI 1% to 6%) in those aged 18–39 years to 28% (95% CI 9% to 52%) in those aged 60–79 years. Ventricular ectopy of > 1,000/24 hours also increased with age, from 1% (95% CI 0% to 2%) in those aged 18–39 years to 5% (95% CI 1% to 10%) in those aged 60–79 years. Episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ranged from 0% (95% CI 0% to 1%) in those aged 18–39 years to 2% (95% CI 0% to…

### Real-time ambulatory ECG does not expedite care [^113yhnk3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

There was no statistical difference in the timing of cardiovascular procedures or acute care between AECG monitoring in real-time (non-Holter) compared with traditional Holter studies. The study did not specifically examine the health system burden of real-time monitoring compared with Holter monitors; however, this burden is critical to consider when evaluating broad use. Future, larger cohorts, including those with more Holter monitors, may provide adequate power to determine if there are specific patient groups for which real-time monitoring is appropriate.

Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

Dedicated applications and sensors within or adjunctive to mobile communication devices enable users to monitor, collect, and share physiological and health data. Their applications range from diagnostic, decision support, disease management, evaluation of medication adherence, and educational and clinical research purposes. They synergize naturally with arrhythmia evaluation and extend management to associated comorbidities and lifestyle.

- **Applications to arrhythmias**: Diagnostic evaluation is used for patients with symptoms suggestive of arrhythmias and to assess patients' response to both pharmacological and invasive treatment of arrhythmias. Screening has an increasing emphasis on atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Ambulatory ECG monitoring**: This is the cornerstone diagnostic method, and the choice of technique and time frame depend on whether symptoms (e.g. palpitations and syncope) are present and how often they occur. Since the 21st century has become the era of the AF epidemic, the emphasis has shifted to screen for asymptomatic patients at high risk of developing AF or in those with cryptogenic stroke, to enable early treatment with the hope of preventing stroke and other serious complications. Novel tools expand the time window in which information can be gathered and overcome existing limitations with traditional methods, such as intermittent physical exams or ECG for the detection of a largely asymptomatic arrhythmia.

### Even silent hypoglycemia induces cardiac arrhythmias [^116GonGr]. Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

In this issue, Chow et al. address the question of hypoglycemia-induced arrhythmias in an observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes by simultaneously equipping subjects with outpatient Holter monitors and continuous interstitial glucose monitors (CGM). All patients had insulin-treated type 2 diabetes and a history of either cardiovascular disease or two cardiovascular risk factors. The CGM recordings showed that hypoglycemia (≤ 63 mg/dL) was common, occurring 6% of the time. The authors also observed that hypoglycemia was associated with possible ischemic changes (T-wave flattening), repolarization defects (increased QT intervals corrected for heart rate), and various cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting that these events could be interconnected.

Like another CGM study, the vast majority of hypoglycemic episodes were asymptomatic and occurred at night. The authors' most striking data were the eightfold increase in bradycardia and fourfold increase in atrial ectopy during nocturnal hypoglycemia compared to daytime hypoglycemia. Mechanistically, sleep has been shown to blunt the sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia, likely contributing to the longer duration and greater severity of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

The authors propose that during the night and following a blunted sympathetic response to hypoglycemia, there may have been a disproportionate parasympathetic phase leading to bradyarrhythmias and ectopic pacemakers. Unfortunately, without other biochemical or physiologic markers of sympathetic or parasympathetic activation or potassium levels, the conclusions remain speculative.

### Comparison of continuous 24-hour and 14-day ECG monitoring for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with ischemic stroke or syncope [^115eRC7X]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Detection rate of cardiac arrhythmias**: Table 2 shows the detection rate of cardiac arrhythmias for the 14-day ECG patch and 24-hour Holter monitor. The detection rates of SVT and AVB were significantly higher for the 14-day ECG patch than for the 24-hour Holter monitor (p = .007; p = .002). Table 3 demonstrates the cardiac arrhythmias events — namely SVT, AF, pause, AVB, and VT — were detected in 38 (45.8%), 5 (6%), 1 (1.2%), 2 (2.4%), and 8 (9.6%) patients, respectively, using the 14-day ECG patch but not by the 24-hour Holter monitor.

- **Composite cardiac arrhythmias**: More composite cardiac arrhythmias were detected in 58 (69.9%) patients using the 14-day ECG patch than in 18 (21.7%) patients using the 24-hour Holter monitor (p = .006). Composite cardiac arrhythmias were detected in 47 (67.1%) and 11 (84.6%) patients with stroke and syncope, respectively, by the 14-day ECG patch, and in 16 (22.9%) and 2 (15.4%) patients with stroke and syncope, respectively, by the 24-hour Holter monitor. Table 4 shows the detection rates for cardiac arrhythmias — namely SVT, AF, pause, AVB, VT, and VF — in patients with stroke and syncope using the 14-day ECG patch and 24-hour Holter monitor. The significant differences in CCA detection rate between the 14-day ECG patch and the 24-hour Holter monitor were found in overall participants (p = .006) and both subgroups for diagnosis of stroke and syncope (both p < 0.001).

### Continuous electrocardiography for detecting atrial fibrillation beyond 1 year after stroke in primary care [^117ST5Dk]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Screening patients in a primary care setting more than one year post-stroke using 7-day Holter monitoring uncovered atrial fibrillation (AF) in 4.6% of participants without known AF. Compared with 7-day Holter monitoring, more than half of AF diagnoses were undetectable with pulse palpation, and more than 82.3% were missed by a 12-lead ECG. High versus low levels of NT-proBNP were not significantly associated with AF. Without the use of continuous electrocardiography (cECG), in addition to opportunistic pulse palpation and routine 12-lead ECG, a considerable number of patients with AF may be underdiagnosed during routine post-stroke AF screening in the primary sector.

- **Previous studies**: Previous studies of post-stroke AF detection focused on the period immediately following a stroke. A meta-analysis including 31 studies estimated an expected AF detection rate by 7-day monitoring of 8.9%. Similarly, 10-day Holter monitoring identified AF in 9% in the Find-AF (RANDOMISED) trial. The comparatively lower detection rate found in our study may be explained by a time-related dilution of participants with AF for several reasons. First is the exclusion of participants diagnosed with AF before inclusion. Second is the attrition of participants with undiagnosed AF due to the high risk of a recurrent stroke and death. Third, AF is associated with more severe strokes, and therefore, such patients more often reside in a nursing home. Due to practical issues, only patients living in their own home were approached for participation in this study. Furthermore, study participation required the ability to understand and cooperate during the study.

### 2021 ISHNE/HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert collaborative statement on mHealth in arrhythmia management: Digital medical tools for heart rhythm professionals: From the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology/Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^116gMJsA]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Accuracy**: The positive predictive value of an AF event will differ according to the pretest probability of AF in a given population (e.g. those with an established diagnosis or ≥ 1 risk factors), which is especially relevant to healthy consumers. Many technologies to identify AF are readily available directly to those without defined disease and are not deployed as individual or public health interventions. Rather, consumers who possess these technologies, such as smartwatches or smartphone-connected ECG recorders, opt into the use of these technologies. Therefore, consumer-driven AF identification is not the same as healthcare-initiated AF screening. AF identification by these devices requires confirmation since these AF screening tools have variable specificity, raising the potential of a high false-positive rate in a low-prevalence population and risks of unnecessary treatment.

	- There have been almost 500 studies assessing the accuracy of mHealth devices for AF detection, as described in recent systematic reviews. Their capabilities varied according to technologies utilized, settings, and study populations. Two large-scale screening trials were reported recently.

- **Outcomes**: No large outcome trial of screen-detected AF and hard endpoints of stroke and death has been conducted as yet. Although an incidental diagnosis of AF seems to be associated with increased risk of stroke and protection by OAC therapy, clinical trials to determine any benefit for opportunistic screening remain needed.

### Trials of implantable monitoring devices in heart failure: which design is optimal [^113bGEXy]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Implantable monitoring devices have been developed to detect early evidence of heart failure (HF) decompensation, with the hypothesis that early detection might enable clinicians to commence therapy sooner than would otherwise be possible and potentially reduce the rate of hospitalization. In addition to the usual challenges inherent to device trials, such as the difficulty of double-blinding and potential for bias, studies of implantable monitoring devices present unique difficulties because they involve assessment of therapeutic endpoints for diagnostic devices.

Problems include the lack of uniform approaches to treatment in study protocols for device alerts or out-of-range values and the requirement of levels of evidence traditionally associated with therapeutic devices to establish effectiveness and safety.

- **Approaches used to deal with these issues**: include the use of objective primary endpoints with blinded adjudication, identical duration of follow-up, and an equal number of encounters for patients in active monitoring and control groups. Treatment recommendations between groups are consistent with international guidelines.

Remote monitoring devices hold promise for reducing the rate of hospitalization among patients with HF. However, optimization of regulatory approaches and clinical trial design is needed to facilitate further evaluation of the effectiveness of combining health information technology and medical devices.

### 2021 ISHNE/HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert collaborative statement on mHealth in arrhythmia management: Digital medical tools for heart rhythm professionals: From the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology/Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^111LfQzA]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

While we await data on OAC treatment for mHealth-detected AF, the finding of the arrhythmia should initiate mHealth monitoring of NSR retention and QT intervals, which is important for those on some antiarrhythmic drugs. Discussion of cardiovascular risk factor modification and lifestyle changes are also essential, as AF coexists with comorbidities that may influence its occurrence and natural history. Alcohol reduction, treatment of OSA, moderate exercise, and weight loss have been shown to reduce AF burden.

- **Rate control**: While the primary goal of rate control is to minimize AF-related symptoms, prolonged tachycardia can result in effort intolerance or tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. Excessively low heart rate targets may increase the risk of bradyarrhythmias that result in symptoms and device implantation. The European Society of Cardiology recommends lenient resting HR targets (< 100–110). In contrast, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/HRS guidelines recommend a target rate of < 80 beats per minute. These targets are often tailored to the individual patient based on symptoms and presence or propensity for HF. mHealth technologies can be used to assess ventricular rates during AF over long time periods and evaluate the effects of rate-control therapies.

- **Sudden cardiac death**: The use of mHealth technology to diagnose ventricular arrhythmias lags behind its application to AF.

### Real-time ambulatory ECG does not expedite care [^1149w8Pi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

We identified 20,259 patients with monitors, 3,609 in the Holter group and 16,650 in the non-Holter group. The non-Holter monitor patients were of older age and had higher rates of reported comorbidities, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral arterial disease, valve disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and prior stroke/transient ischemic attack. There were fewer women and more people of White race in the non-Holter group. The groups had patients with similar left ventricular ejection fractions (mean 61 in both, P = 0.8).

- **Distribution of outcome events**: Stratified by monitoring type, these are shown in Figure 1. Among patients who underwent ablation, the median time to ablation procedure was 74 versus 72 days (P = 0.5) for Holter versus non-Holter, respectively. Among patients who underwent new cardiac implantable electronic device implantation, the median delay was 54 days versus 52 (P = 0.6); among those who initiated new anticoagulation, timing was 42 versus 31 days (P = 0.03). Time to first emergency department visit or hospitalization was 63 versus 57 days (P = 0.6) among patients who had such encounters. In multivariable models, there were no significant differences in time to intervention between Holter and non-Holter for each outcome. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for each outcome are shown in Figure 2.

### Comparison of 24-hour Holter monitoring with 14-day novel adhesive patch electrocardiographic monitoring [^111YKgom]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmias are remarkably common and often go undiagnosed because they are frequently transient and asymptomatic. Effective diagnosis and treatment can substantially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac arrhythmias. The Zio Patch (iRhythm Technologies, Inc, San Francisco, Calif) is a novel, single-lead electrocardiographic (ECG), lightweight, Food and Drug Administration-cleared, continuously recording ambulatory adhesive patch monitor suitable for detecting cardiac arrhythmias in patients referred for ambulatory ECG monitoring.

- **Methods**: A total of 146 patients referred for evaluation of cardiac arrhythmia underwent simultaneous ambulatory ECG recording with a conventional 24-hour Holter monitor and a 14-day adhesive patch monitor. The primary outcome of the study was to compare the detection of arrhythmia events over total wear time for both devices. Arrhythmia events were defined as detection of any 1 of 6 arrhythmias, including supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, pause greater than 3 seconds, atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. McNemar's tests were used to compare the matched pairs of data from the Holter and the adhesive patch monitor.

- **Results**: Over the total wear time of both devices, the adhesive patch monitor detected 96 arrhythmia events compared with 61 arrhythmia events by the Holter monitor (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Over the total wear time of both devices, the adhesive patch monitor detected more events than the Holter monitor.

### Ecg patch monitors for assessment of cardiac rhythm abnormalities [^114Hy7vk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The primary goal of long-term monitoring is the improvement of diagnostic yield. Despite the clear utility of Holter monitoring in clinical cardiology, issues of relatively low diagnostic yield, cost, and inconvenience have motivated the development of ultra-portable devices referred to as ECG patch monitors. Although the "gold standard" for assessing cardiac rhythm abnormalities remains a 12-lead Holter, there is an increasing interest in portable monitoring devices that provide the opportunity for evaluating cardiac rhythm in real-world environments such as the workplace or home.

To facilitate patient acceptance, these monitors underwent a radical miniaturization and redesign to include wireless communication, waterproofing, and a patch carrier for attaching devices directly to the skin. We review recent developments in the field of "patch" devices primarily designed for very long-term monitoring of cardiac arrhythmic events. As the body of supporting clinical validation data grows, these devices hold promise for a variety of cardiac monitoring applications.

From a clinical and research standpoint, the capacity to obtain longitudinal cardiac activity data by patch devices may have significant implications for device selection, monitoring duration, and care pathways for arrhythmia evaluation and atrial fibrillation surveillance. From a research standpoint, the new devices may allow for the development of novel diagnostic algorithms with the goal of finding patterns and correlations with exercise and drug regimens.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^113smZk9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

No other monitor feature independently predicted SVT induction (Figure 3C). The frequency of SVT episodes varied widely among different types of monitors, undoubtedly reflecting different criteria for what constitutes a reportable event (Figure 5A). The frequency of episodes was not helpful in predicting whether SVT would be induced, even among monitors from the same manufacturer. One brand of monitor (Preventice) showed a small difference in event frequency between non-inducible and inducible patients, but this difference disappeared once patients with episodes lasting ≥ 30 seconds were excluded (not shown). Patients who reported symptoms that correlated with episodes of SVT were significantly more likely to have SVT induced than patients without episodes or patients without a correlation, but these differences also disappeared when patients with episodes ≥ 30 seconds were excluded.

- **Figure 5**: The frequency of SVT episodes on monitoring does not predict SVT induction.
	- **A**: The frequency of SVT events on monitoring does not differ between patients who have SVT induced (pink) and those who do not (blue). Note that the frequency of SVT events varies widely between different types of monitors (the vertical axis is a logarithmic scale). p-values were calculated using Student's t-test assuming unequal variances, excluding outliers that were > 3× the interquartile range from the median.
	- **B**: The probability of SVT induction does not increase at higher event rates. Pastel lines show the results from different types of monitors. The solid black line shows the pooled results from.

### Which chest pain patients potentially benefit from continuous 12-lead ST-segment monitoring with automated serial ECG [^114FFxMF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

A prospective observational study was performed on 678 chest pain patients with suspected acute coronary ischemic syndrome (ACS) and the absence of clinical and ECG criteria for emergent reperfusion therapy upon presentation. This study aimed to determine how often continuous 12-lead ST-segment monitoring with automated serial ECG (SECG) results in a significant change in therapy during the initial emergency department (ED) evaluation in typical high- and low-risk chest pain patients. After obtaining an initial history, physical examination, and ECG, patients were grouped into high and low-risk subgroups based on the ED physician's assessment of the likelihood of ACS.

Significant change in therapy was defined as thrombolytic drug administration, emergent percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and intensive anti-ischemic therapy with intravenous heparin and/or intravenous nitroglycerin. SECG monitoring was continued until either the patient was taken for emergent PTCA or until 2-hour serum markers measurements were obtained. A total of 26 patients experienced a change in therapy secondary to SECG monitoring, representing 14.6% of high-risk patients and 1.1% of low-risk patients. New injury (21 patients) and new ischemia (4 patients) were the only SECG findings that led to a change in therapy. SECG monitoring resulted in 15.2 times increased odds of changing therapy in high-risk patients compared to low-risk patients (P < .0001; 95% CI 6.1 to 38.2).

Chest pain evaluation protocols that exclude these high-risk ED patients from SECG monitoring should be reevaluated. Our data also suggest that researchers designing ra…

### Arrhythmia monitoring and outcomes in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis: Insights from the Cardiac Sarcoidosis Consortium [^115MrBPV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In this multicenter international registry, we describe arrhythmia outcomes along with the key role of 24-hour Holter monitoring in detecting arrhythmic burden in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis (CS), identifying features warranting potential concern. Nevertheless, we observed that 24-hour Holter is still an underused diagnostic tool, as only 28% of patients with CS underwent Holter monitoring, suggesting it deserves wider application in everyday clinical practice.

This analysis has a potential selection bias, as arrhythmias were not evaluated in the same way within the enrolled population, and the patients who received Holter monitors might have a different arrhythmia propensity than those who were not monitored. Moreover, this analysis did not disclose the relationship between arrhythmias and patients' inflammatory milieu detected by imaging or laboratory tests and the potential influence of therapeutic strategies (e.g. immunosuppressors).

However, these data are hypothesis-generating and encourage research in CS to produce high-quality evidence on arrhythmias' hallmarks and their parallelism with disease course. Ongoing randomized controlled trials, such as the CHASM CS (Cardiac Sarcoidosis Multi-Center Randomized Controlled Trial; NCT03593759), evaluating the efficacy and safety of a combined methotrexate/prednisone therapy, and MAGIC ART (Interleukin-1 Blockade for Treatment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis; NCT04017936), testing the effects and safety of interleukin-1 blockade with anakinra, are leading the way forward to find more answers for arrhythmia management in this yet mysterious disease.

Finally, the duration of the charge allows an almost certain identification of the arrhythmic event, even in pauci-symptomatic subjects. However, since it is a single trace, distinguishing between supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias may be difficult, and oversensing or undersensing phenomena may rashly deplete the memory of the device.

### The Cox-maze III procedure success rate: Comparison by electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter monitoring and long-term monitoring [^115J1R1b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The detection of atrial arrhythmia recurrence is more accurate when using long-term (5 days to 3 weeks) continuous monitoring devices. In this study, we focus on the comparison of the recurrence of atrial arrhythmias in patients after the Cox-Maze III procedure obtained by three modalities: electrocardiography (ECG), 24-hour Holter monitoring, and long-term monitoring (LTM).

- **Methods**: Patients with follow-up longer than 6 months who reported sinus rhythm while not taking antiarrhythmic drugs were eligible. Atrial arrhythmias longer than 30 seconds were considered a recurrence. The ECG, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and LTM (5 days) reports were ascertained and compared at the same time.

- **Results**: Patients (n = 291) underwent the full Cox-Maze III procedure, with 194 eligible for the study and 76 agreeing to participate. The average time to monitoring after surgery was 9.8 (± 7.7) months. The ECGs determined 96% of patients in sinus rhythm, Holter monitoring determined 91% in sinus rhythm, and LTM indicated 84% in sinus rhythm. Comparing ECG results and LTM results revealed that 9 patients (12%) had a significant rhythm change. Holter monitoring did not capture all the patients having events lasting longer than 1 hour. No additional information was captured by the use of LTM in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

- **Conclusions**: This study reconfirmed that ECG overestimated the success rate after the Cox-Maze III operation by 12% compared with LTM. These changes may carry clinical significance when determining the success of the Cox-Maze III procedure.

### Holter monitor rhythm parameters in healthy infants, children, and adolescents: Defining reference limits with meta-analysis [^111EoWvA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to summarize and compare heart rhythm data across various pediatric subgroups. Consolidated Holter data, which included all relevant parameters from numerous studies, were compiled into a secure Excel spreadsheet. Data cleaning processes were employed to ensure consistency across studies, including standardizing definitions and measurement units. Meta-analysis was conducted using R software version 4.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with the "meta", "dplyr", "exactci", "ggplot2", and "metafor" packages, along with the RShiny tool RIMeta for reference interval calculations.

Both overall and subgroup analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were based on pediatric age ranges, as previously listed. Subgroup-specific weights were calculated to provide accurate pooled estimates for each age range. The random-effects method was used for variables that exhibited pronounced heterogeneity. For dichotomous event-based variables without marked heterogeneity, a fixed-effect model based on the inverse-variance method (plural approach) with continuity correction to stabilize variance in small-sample studies was employed. Proportions with exact 95% CIs were calculated using Blaker's exact CI through the exactbinomCI function. Weighted means with 95% CIs were computed for all variables, and 95% reference intervals were calculated for continuous variables. For comparison and to assist interpretation, unweighted means were also calculated and presented in the results tables.

Forest plots were generated.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

At home, ST-segment monitoring technology embedded in conventionally indicated ICDs, when tested in a randomized crossover study, suggested a reduction in the time from the onset of ischemia to presentation to the hospital. The AngelMed Guardian system (Angel Medical Systems, Eatontown, NJ) is approved for use in the United States for patients with prior acute coronary syndrome who remain at high risk for re-acute coronary syndrome. For lower-risk patients, mHealth may improve symptom recognition and earlier presentation, that is, symptom-to-door time.

Wearable devices that continuously monitor physiological data promise the detection, and possibly preemption, of the early stages of MI, by alerting the patient or healthcare team early. A noninvasive device consisting of a 3-lead ECG linked wirelessly to a dedicated mobile device has recently been described. Three-lead ECG tracings, as well as derived augmented limb leads, can be recorded with commercially available smartwatches. Limitations of this approach are the need for the patient or a bystander to possess the device or app and be familiar with its use before the onset of symptoms.

An emerging technology uses a credit card-sized device that is pressed against the user's chest. It collects ECG signals using a novel 3-dimensional vector approach. The signals are sent to the cloud, where they are analyzed and compared with the patient's asymptomatic baseline reading. A proprietary algorithm combines the signal analysis with the patient's historical data [text cut off].

### ECG techniques and technologies [^1119JNTi]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) continues to be a critical component of the evaluation of patients who present with signs and symptoms of emergency cardiac conditions. This tool, now approximately 100 years old, has been a standard in clinical practice for more than half a century. The application of new signal processing techniques and the expansion in the use of additional leads allow clinicians to extract increasingly detailed information from cardiac electrical activity. Understanding the technology inherent in the recording of ECGs enables a more comprehensive appreciation of the benefits and limitations of electrocardiography.

### Monitoring long-term cardiac activity with contactless radio frequency signals [^113tzKfi]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Cardiovascular diseases claim over 10 million lives annually, highlighting the critical need for long-term monitoring and early detection of cardiac abnormalities. Existing techniques like electrocardiograms (ECGs) and Holter monitors are accurate but suffer from discomfort caused by body-attached electrodes. While wearable devices using photoplethysmography offer more convenience, they sacrifice accuracy and are susceptible to environmental interference.

Here, we present a radio frequency (RF)-based (60 to 64 GHz) sensing system that monitors long-term heart rate variability (HRV) with clinical-grade accuracy. Our system successfully overcomes the orders-larger interference from respiration motion in far-field conditions without any model training. By identifying previously undiscovered frequency ranges (beyond 10-order heartbeat harmonics) where heartbeat information predominates over other motions, we generate prominent heartbeat patterns with harmonics typically considered detrimental.

Extensive evaluations, including a large-scale outpatient setting involving 6,222 eligible participants and a long-term daily life scenario where sleep data was collected over five separate random nights over two months and a continuous 21-night period, demonstrate that our system can monitor HRV and identify abnormalities with comparable performance to clinical-grade ECG-based systems. This RF-based HRV sensing system has the potential to support active self-assessment and revolutionize medical prevention with long-term and precise health monitoring.

### Fighting against sudden cardiac death: Need for a paradigm shift-adding near-term prevention and pre-emptive action to long-term prevention [^1134ikCV]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The near-term prevention approach can be facilitated by connected devices and artificial intelligence. Long-term monitoring, such as the use of an implantable loop recorder, is currently available for patients with known cardiac disease. However, it does not apply to patients without known cardiac disease, who account for a large proportion of sudden cardiac death (SCD) victims. In contrast, immediate but time-limited assessment in patients who develop symptoms might allow a broader coverage of the population, including individuals without previous cardiac history.

Prediction of SCD using the 'static' ECG, which reflects a one-time electrical status, has been disappointing, but dynamic monitoring holds promise. Sudden cardiac death prediction is likely to improve with a greater use of digitized ECG tracings, allowing for better precision in measurements and possibly automation of interpretation. Despite its limitations and the unlikelihood of its feasibility in near-term prevention strategies, the static ECG might still offer the opportunity to predict SCD in the long term, especially if specific SCD prediction criteria are identified.

Signal acquisition has become easier with the development of a wide range of connected devices. Patch ECG monitors offer a more convenient, less artefact-prone alternative to conventional Holter ECGs. Smartwatches are omnipresent and many incorporate technology to capture personalized health data. Finally, the AliveCor Kardia 6L can record a six-lead ECG and has obtained Food and Drug Administration approval.

### The diagnostic efficiency of artificial intelligence based 2 hours Holter monitoring in premature ventricular and supraventricular contractions detection [^116ajtYo]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

The single-lead Holter is a wearable device (SWCAN-SWK801, Nanjing) that records the electrical activity of the heart for over 2 hours. It consists of electrodes attached to the chest (CM2 location) and connected to a small recording device using Bluetooth 5.0. The patient wore the device throughout the monitoring period, allowing for continuous monitoring of the electrical signals of the heart. This can provide valuable information about heart rhythm and any abnormalities that may be present.

- **CNN algorithm-based analysis system**: According to our preprint article disclosed in the Research Square, all 2-hour Holter ECG data were stored and analyzed in real time using the CNN algorithm. CNNs are a specialized type of neural network designed to process data with a known grid-like topology. The network consists of eight residual blocks, each containing the following five layers:
	1. A convolution layer.
	2. A batch normalization layer.
	3. A rectified linear unit (ReLU) layer.
	4. Another convolution layer.
	5. Another batch normalization layer.

	- Both convolution layers (1 and 4) used a 3 × 3 kernel and a stride of 1. After each convolution, batch normalization is applied to prevent parameter explosion and the vanishing gradient problem. Following the batch normalization layer, we added the ReLU activation function, which outputs zero for negative inputs and retains positive inputs. This nonlinearity allows the network to create complex nonlinear representations of the ECGs for automatic feature extraction.

### The evolution of ambulatory ECG monitoring [^113rNVWe]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring has undergone continuous technological evolution since its invention and development in the 1950s. With its commercial introduction in 1963, Holter recorders have evolved from 1-channel to 12-channel devices with increasingly smaller storage media, alongside Holter analysis systems that employ advanced electronics, providing a myriad of data displays. This evolution of smaller physical instruments with increasing technological capacity has characterized the development of electronics over the past 50 years.

Currently, the technology focuses on the conventional continuous 24 to 48-hour ambulatory ECG examination and conventional extended ambulatory monitoring strategies for infrequent to rare arrhythmic events. However, the emergence of the Internet, Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and broadband transmission has positioned these modalities at the threshold of the digital world. This development has led to the adoption of more cost-effective strategies in these conventional examination methods. As a result, the emergence of mobile smartphones, coupled with digital capabilities, has led to the development of Holter smartphone applications. The potential of point-of-care applications utilizing the Holter smartphone and a vast array of new non-invasive sensors is evident in the not-too-distant future. The Holter smartphone is anticipated to contribute significantly to global health in the future.

### Real-time ambulatory ECG does not expedite care [^115SiZYD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Ambulatory ECG (AECG) is a cornerstone of diagnostic testing for cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Historically, Holter monitoring was the mainstay of such studies, with results provided only after the study was completed, downloaded, and reviewed in entirety by a healthcare professional. More recently, mobile cardiac telemetry and cardiac event monitors have emerged as routine alternatives to Holter monitoring and are distinguished in part by near real-time alerts to clinicians. Thus, they can provide much more time-sensitive diagnostics for potentially serious or emergent conditions. Prior data have shown that mobile cardiac telemetry devices have a higher diagnostic yield and more frequent initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs. However, mobile cardiac telemetry can also negatively impact healthcare resources required to receive, interpret, and act upon the identified actionable arrhythmias. Whether such tests translate into more timely interventions of these actionable arrhythmias for broader cohorts of patients undergoing rhythm monitoring is unclear.

The objective of the study is to understand the relative benefit, if any, of AECG studies with "real-time" alerts compared with traditional Holter studies, in terms of time to intervention across a broad, tertiary care population. We hypothesize real-time monitoring will lead to earlier detection of arrhythmias and earlier interventions. Specifically, we hypothesize that patients undergoing real-time AECG studies will have earlier interventions, such as cardiac device procedures.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

Sensitivity and specificity depend on the software, which can be calibrated to higher sensitivity or higher specificity, the population studied (e.g. elderly individuals have more tremor or difficulty holding the device, leading to more unreadable tracings), and the prevalence of AF in the population. This indicates that the use of such devices always requires proper evaluation for each intended use case. There is also an accessory band for a smartwatch to allow ECG recording. The single-lead ECG with automatic AF detection is recorded by touching the band's integrated sensors that transmit data to a watch application. Recently, a new 6-lead case has been developed, allowing for a 30-second recording of all 6 limb leads by touching each of the three electrodes. The QT interval may also be derived from this. Information is limited, however, on how parameters such as QTc measured on a single- (or limited number) lead ECG can reliably substitute for 12-lead ECG information. In one study, QT was underestimated by smartphone single-lead ECG. Preliminary data indicate the ability for ST monitoring for ischemia.

Such devices may be used by clinicians as point-of-care devices to obtain an interpretable rhythm strip in place of a 12-lead ECG. Additionally, patients may use these devices for ad hoc or routine evaluation of their rhythm in a home environment. The ECG data can be instantaneously transmitted for automated interpretation with the ability of the consumer to request a physician overread.

### Symbicort [^112WFPjc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

In the 12-month study, 520 patients had evaluable continuous 24-hour ECG (Holter) monitoring prior to the first dose and after approximately 1 and 4 months on treatment. No clinically important differences in ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular or supraventricular ectopic beats, or heart rate were observed among the groups treated with Symbicort 160/4.5, formoterol, or placebo taken as 2 inhalations twice daily. Based on ECG (Holter) monitoring, one patient on Symbicort 160/4.5, no patients on formoterol 4.5 mcg, and three patients in the placebo group experienced atrial fibrillation or flutter that was not present at baseline.

- **HPA-axis effects**: Twenty-four hour urinary cortisol measurements were collected in a pooled subset (n = 616) of patients from two COPD lung function studies. The data indicated approximately 30% lower mean 24-hour urinary free cortisol values following chronic administration (> 6 months) of Symbicort relative to placebo. Symbicort appeared to exhibit comparable cortisol suppression to budesonide 160 mcg alone or coadministration of budesonide 160 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg. For patients treated with Symbicort or placebo for up to 12 months, the percentage of patients who shifted from normal to low for this measure were generally comparable.

### Holter ECG for pacemaker/defibrillator carriers: What is its role in the era of remote monitoring [^1145HqxP]. Heart (2015). High credibility.

Nowadays, several diagnostic tools are available to investigate cardiovascular symptoms like palpitations, dizziness, and syncope: ECG Holter (or ambulatory ECG, AECG), and external and implantable event/loop recorders. Despite this technological burden, many diagnoses are still missed. In the meantime, we are facing an increasing use of implantable devices for cardiac pacing/defibrillation (CIED), which have rapidly evolved from simple pacing/shock boxes to devices including several diagnostic features. However, these functions are not adequately exploited in clinical practice, and several redundant diagnostic tests, like AECG, are still prescribed to CIED carriers, leading to an increase in costs and a delay in final diagnosis.

This review is aimed at identifying the role of AECG in CIED carriers in view of this technological improvement. First, we will briefly present the indications for AECG according to guidelines. We will then provide a direct comparison of the different diagnostic features provided by AECG (and event/loop recorders) versus automatic diagnostic CIEDs to highlight the respective pros and cons. This will serve to carefully discuss these indications in view of the results of recent studies on CIED carriers, highlighting the need for proper implantation and follow-up. Eventually, we will provide useful hints to properly analyze AECG in CIED carriers, considering the different behaviors according to the implemented algorithms. We will conclude by suggesting updated indications for AECG.

### 2021 ISHNE/HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert collaborative statement on mHealth in arrhythmia management: Digital medical tools for heart rhythm professionals: From the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology/Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^112PyViU]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

mHealth flows intuitively to health professionals in the field of arrhythmia management from experience gained through remote monitoring (RM) of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). A wealth of data garnered from many studies over the last 10 to 15 years has confirmed the benefits of remote technology-assisted follow-up and established it as a standard of care. However, results of RM of CIEDs may not be immediately generalizable to mHealth.

- **Differences from CIED RM**: For instance, the former is restricted to those with cardiac disease (largely arrhythmias and heart failure [HF]), that is, a group already defined as patients. The care pathways for CIED RM are also well-defined, with billing and reimbursement in place in the United States and many other parts of the world.

- **Characteristics of mHealth**: In comparison, mHealth differs as it is widely available in the form of consumer products that penetrate most sectors of society, including individuals without formal medical diagnoses. It may be applied to a wider group of medical conditions, and data can be self-monitored rather than assessed by health care professionals (HCPs). Reimbursement models are not mature.

Indeed, some heart rhythm tracking capabilities may be indirectly acquired in products purchased for different goals and then subsequently used for self-monitoring. Conversely, in the medical space, applications are largely not prescribed by HCPs, often lack validation for disease management use cases, and care pathways remain varied or poorly defined.

### Holter monitor rhythm parameters in healthy infants, children, and adolescents: Defining reference limits with meta-analysis [^117A7Wpr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography is used to evaluate symptoms, such as palpitations or syncope, that suggest a possible arrhythmia, to screen for an asymptomatic rhythm abnormality in patients with heart disease, and to reevaluate the cardiac rhythm after the initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy. Ambulatory electrocardiography, also known as Holter monitoring in honor of Norman Jefferis Holter, has been in clinical use since the 1960s. The day-to-day repeatability of atrial and ventricular ectopic complex frequency with 24-hour Holter monitoring is excellent, with variations of only 4% to 6%.

Holter monitoring has a relatively high yield for arrhythmia detection in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy, but not in those presenting with palpitations or syncope without an abnormal 12-lead ECG or echocardiogram. Longer-term 1- to 4-week transtelephonic intermittent event recorder electrocardiographic monitoring, available since the 1980s, reveals more symptomatic arrhythmias. However, continuous Holter monitoring detects more asymptomatic rhythm abnormalities. Newer 14-day continuous electrocardiographic monitoring devices, developed in the 2000s, have a higher yield than cardiac event or Holter monitoring for arrhythmia detection.

However, when longer-term ambulatory continuous monitors capture significant rhythm findings, these are first noted during the initial 24 hours in 44% of children and adolescents, and in 82% of young infants. Therefore, in some clinical situations, Holter monitoring followed by event monitoring is essential.

Reducing costs

Use of this technology may serve as an effective means for early diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and associated comorbidities. This could lead to benefits such as improved screening, prevention, and early treatment, thereby reducing adverse effects related to delayed therapy and the utilization of costly healthcare resources, for example, emergency room visits or hospitalizations. mHealth could assist individuals in adhering to health recommendations and empower active participation in lifestyle changes to modify cardiovascular risk profiles and promote adherence to medical therapy. Together, these factors may reduce the burden of chronic disease and associated long-term disability. Nonetheless, assessing these longer-term cost advantages is challenging, and their value will vary according to country and healthcare system.

Increased costs

Conversely, costs are associated with administering mHealth programs. The widespread availability of smartphones and other commercially available mobile devices generates a significant amount of inconclusive or false-positive findings. This issue, in turn, could lead to additional testing for validation, thereby increasing the utilization of healthcare resources. Implementing widespread screening programs would entail additional consideration of costs related to detecting arrhythmias in currently unscreened populations. Healthcare providers may also need to spend time reviewing and interpreting potentially voluminous results, including associated phone calls, before making additional evaluation and management decisions.

### Update to practice standards for electrocardiographic monitoring in hospital settings: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1178XPsp]. Circulation (2017). High credibility.

This scientific statement provides an interprofessional, comprehensive review of evidence and recommendations for indications, duration, and implementation of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring of hospitalized patients. Since the original practice standards were published in 2004, new issues have emerged that need to be addressed: overuse of arrhythmia monitoring among various patient populations, appropriate use of ischemia and QT-interval monitoring among select populations, alarm management, and documentation in electronic health records.

- **Methods**: Authors were commissioned by the American Heart Association and included experts from general cardiology, electrophysiology (adult and pediatric), and interventional cardiology, as well as a hospitalist and experts in alarm management. Strict adherence to the American Heart Association conflict of interest policy was maintained throughout the consensus process. Authors were assigned topics relevant to their areas of expertise, reviewed the literature with an emphasis on publications since the prior practice standards, and drafted recommendations on indications and duration for electrocardiographic monitoring in accordance with the American Heart Association Level of Evidence grading algorithm that was in place at the time of commissioning.

- **Results**: The comprehensive document is grouped into 5 sections:
	1. Overview of Arrhythmia, Ischemia, and QTc Monitoring
	2. Recommendations for Indication and Duration of Electrocardiographic Monitoring presented by patient population
	3. Organization

### Real-time ambulatory ECG does not expedite care [^114Qyj58]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Ambulatory ECG (AECG) monitoring is pivotal to the diagnosis of arrhythmias and can be performed with near "real-time" notification of abnormalities. There is limited data on the relative benefit of real-time monitoring compared with traditional Holter monitoring.

- **Methods and results**: This is a retrospective observational analysis of University of Utah Health patients who underwent ambulatory ECG studies from 2010 to 2022. The study cohort was stratified by patients with an ambulatory ECG that provides real-time event notification (non-Holter) versus those who do not (Holter). The outcomes were cardiac implantable electronic device procedure, ablation procedure, emergency department/hospitalization visit, and initiation of anticoagulation out to 6 months. We identified 20,259 patients, 16,650 with non-Holter studies and 3,609 with Holter studies. Holter patients were younger (mean 52 versus 55, P < 0.001), more often women (60.2% versus 57%, P < 0.001), and had lower mean CHADS2-VASc scores (1.7 versus 2.1, P < 0.001). The median time to ablation procedure was 74 versus 72 (P = 0.5), for Holter versus non-Holter, respectively. Median days to new cardiac implantable electronic device implantation was 54 days versus 52 (P = 0.6); initiation of anticoagulation among patients not already treated was 42 versus 31 days (P = 0.03). Time to the first emergency department visit or hospitalization was 63 versus 57 (P = 0.6). In multivariable models, there were no significant differences in time to intervention between Holter and non-Holter for each outcome.

### Long-term outcome of additional superior vena cava to septal linear ablation in catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation [^11126Bm9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The heart rate variability (HRV) was analyzed by 24-hour Holter monitor recordings taken in each patient during the pre- and post-ablation periods at 3, 12, and 24 months, using a GE Marquette MARS 8000 Holter analyzer (GE Medical Systems). After identifying each QRS complex, the numerical series of RR intervals were calculated. Only high-quality recordings were considered for analysis. All recordings were digitized and reviewed by an experienced operator. Premature ventricular beats, premature atrial beats, and electrical artifacts were excluded from the analysis. The HRV parameters were used as indicators of autonomic activity according to previously published guidelines.

The mean heart rate and the following time-domain HRV parameters were analyzed: mean RR interval (mean NN interval), standard deviation of the NN intervals, standard deviation of the 5-minute means of the NN intervals, and root mean square of successive differences between NN intervals. The following parameters were calculated: very low-frequency components (0.040 Hz), low-frequency components (LF; 0.040–0.150 Hz), high-frequency components (HF; 0.150–0.400 Hz), and the LF/HF ratio. HF and root mean square of successive differences were indicators of the parasympathetic nervous activity, while LF and LF/HF ratio reflected the sympathetic nervous activity and sympathovagal balance, respectively.

### Electrocardiographic monitoring in the hospitalized patient: A diagnostic intervention of uncertain clinical impact [^115GfNcS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic monitoring, also known as telemetry or cardiac monitoring, focuses on the detection of clinically significant dysrhythmia. Although electrocardiographic monitoring has advantages and is undoubtedly invaluable in certain patients, significant overuse of cardiac telemetry monitoring does occur. The impact of this inappropriate use increases the cost of healthcare and can delay the admission process, an unpleasant burden that the hospital and its patients must bear. In addition, the liberal use of monitoring in unnecessary situations may give the hospital staff a false sense of security and/or desensitize them to alarms. In many instances, electrocardiographic monitoring may not be necessary. This article will review the literature regarding inpatient telemetry and its impact; furthermore, we will suggest high-yield criteria for its application among the inpatient population.

### The clinical significance of continuous ECG (ambulatory ECG or Holter) monitoring of the ST-segment to evaluate ischemia: a review [^116dp8zo]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Silent ischemia is a common manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Continuous ECG (cECG) monitoring is an effective tool for assessing the frequency and duration of silent ischemic episodes in patients with CAD and for risk stratifying asymptomatic patients or those after an acute coronary syndrome by identifying those at increased risk for future cardiovascular events or death. cECG also allows monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy in patients with CAD. Treatment strategies targeted toward the elimination of silent ischemia have shown that revascularization is better than medical therapy in eliminating silent ischemia, but large-scale prospective studies targeting silent ischemia as a treatment endpoint are still lacking. Future research is warranted to study the effects of newer medical agents or the selected use of revascularization in those patients with persistent silent ischemia despite medical regimens.

### Recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram. Part I: The electrocardiogram and its technology. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee, Council on Clinical Cardiology; the American College of Cardiology Foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115M3BxX]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

This statement examines the relation of the resting ECG to its technology. Its purpose is to foster understanding of how the modern ECG is derived and displayed and to establish standards that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the ECG in practice. Derivation of representative waveforms and measurements based on global intervals are described. Special emphasis is placed on digital signal acquisition and computer-based signal processing, which provide automated measurements that lead to computer-generated diagnostic statements. Lead placement, recording methods, and waveform presentation are reviewed. Throughout the statement, recommendations for ECG standards are placed in the context of the clinical implications of evolving ECG technology.

### Prevalence of and risk factors for perioperative arrhythmias in neonates and children after cardiopulmonary bypass: Continuous Holter monitoring before and for three days after surgery [^116qG1S1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Previous studies of postoperative arrhythmias after surgery for congenital heart disease focused either on specific types of arrhythmias, such as JET, following a variety of operations, or on the arrhythmias associated with a limited number of distinct cardiac lesions or surgical procedures, such as early and late SVT following Fontan operations. We report the hitherto largest cohort of consecutive patients that were assessed for the occurrence of all types of arrhythmias following CPB. During the immediate postoperative period, which tends to be a time of heightened vulnerability after cardiac surgery, we were able to conduct Holter studies in almost all infants and children. Previous studies used overhead bedside monitoring, either for one day or for an extended period of time.

Up to now, no study has provided comprehensive information derived from beat-to-beat dual lead continuous Holter monitoring on the prevalence and type of arrhythmias in this patient population. In a study of 100 patients after cardiac surgery, Valsangiacomo et al. identified arrhythmias in 48% within one day of cardiac surgery. Pfammatter and colleagues found an arrhythmia prevalence of 27% in 310 patients after CPB. Delaney et al. reported only on those arrhythmias in their patients that necessitated intervention, which made up 15% of their cohort. In the patients we studied, the peak prevalence of arrhythmias of 73.4% and 79.1% in the two groups was higher than those previously reported, which may reflect a more sensitive method of detection, especially of extrasystoles, using Holter monitoring.

### HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS/ACC/AHA worldwide practice update for telehealth and arrhythmia monitoring during and following a pandemic [^111Mu97G]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Low credibility.

In light of the pandemic, monitoring strategies should focus on selecting high-risk patients who need close surveillance and using alternative remote recording devices to preserve personal protective equipment and protect healthcare workers from potential contagious harm.

- **Inpatient monitoring**: For inpatient monitoring, telemetry is reasonable when there is concern for clinical deterioration, as may be indicated by acute illness, vital signs, or sinus tachycardia, or in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and/or receiving essential QT-prolonging medications. Telemetry is generally not necessary for persons under investigation without a concern for arrhythmias or clinical deterioration and in those not receiving QT-prolonging drug therapy. In situations where a hospital's existing telemetry capacity has been exceeded by patient numbers, or when conventional telemetry monitoring is not feasible, such as off-site or nontraditional hospital units, mobile devices may be used; for example, mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry as an adjunctive approach to support inpatient care.

Most mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry devices can provide continuous arrhythmia monitoring using a single-lead ECG and allow for real-time and offline analysis of long-term ECG data. Telemetry can be extended using patch monitoring. Smartphone ECG monitors are wireless and have also been utilized during the pandemic. Information is limited, however, on how parameters such as QTc are measured on a single (or limited number) lead.

### The diagnostic efficiency of artificial intelligence based 2 hours Holter monitoring in premature ventricular and supraventricular contractions detection [^114fLiyF]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Arrhythmias have serious implications for patients' health. Timely and accurate diagnosis of arrhythmias is crucial for their effective treatment and management. The use of electrocardiography (ECG) and 24-hour Holter monitoring (24 h‐Holter) has become increasingly important in the diagnosis of arrhythmias; however, both are limited to hospital settings. In recent years, community arrhythmia screening programs have been widely performed in Chinese primary medical institutions, including ECG, ambulatory monitoring, and smartphone-based technologies. The effectiveness of these methods in detecting arrhythmias varies, and considerations such as cost, accessibility, and scalability should be considered when selecting a screening approach. Despite this, most medical institutions still choose ECG and Holter tests as the primary tools for arrhythmia screening. Although valuable information can be captured, this limitation has become apparent.

ECG provides valuable information about heart rhythm and structure. However, ECG has limitations in detecting arrhythmias that occur infrequently or unpredictably. Because ECG is typically performed for a short duration, it cannot capture intermittent arrhythmias that may be critical for an accurate diagnosis. As an arrhythmia diagnostic hallmark, Holter monitoring provides a continuous ECG recording over a 24–48 hour period. This allows for the detection of arrhythmias that occur intermittently. However, Holter monitoring has limitations in terms of patient compliance and discomfort due to wearing the device for an extended period.

### Holter in monitoring of cardiac pacing [^115X4jJb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The Holter function of implanted devices records events that meet criteria determined by the manufacturer or programmed by the physician. Although it does not show a continuous ECG, it is reliable provided the basic functions of the device are operating correctly. This tool is ideal for assessing the electrophysiologic profile of heart disease patients with implants and evaluating the efficacy of various treatments, such as anti-arrhythmic drugs and ablation procedures.

- **Telemedicine integration**: Combined with telemedicine technology, it can provide early alerts to the physician about deterioration in the rhythmic or hemodynamic status of their patients, thus preventing complications that would otherwise lead to costly hospitalizations.
- **Reliability and advancements**: It is a very reliable tool to assess ICD function, including the diagnostic capabilities via discrimination algorithms and the efficacy of delivered therapies. The technology is expected to evolve, offering extended data in the future, such as sensor information or repolarization data (ST segment, QT duration, variability, etc).

### 2021 ISHNE/HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert collaborative statement on mHealth in arrhythmia management: Digital medical tools for heart rhythm professionals: From the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology/Heart Rhythm Society/European Heart Rhythm Association/Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^113RBLX3]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Low credibility.

The key to making atrial fibrillation (AF) identification feasible, efficient, and clinically valuable is the selection of patients with an increased likelihood of harboring undiagnosed AF, rather than general screening in unselected populations. mHealth ECG recorders can facilitate frequent brief (e.g. 30 seconds) recordings over prolonged periods by leveraging the ubiquity of devices, including smartphone-based apps or watches. These devices are particularly well-suited for capturing intermittent or nonpersistent arrhythmias. However, it is likely that frequent sampling would be necessary to capture infrequent paroxysmal AF, and even daily snapshot ECG monitoring may miss half of AF episodes. AF burden is increasingly recognized as a powerful independent predictor of stroke. Though accurately measured by implanted devices, it cannot be readily calculated from intermittent ECG data. The use of smartwatches with passive intermittent surveillance using photoplethysmography monitoring plus ECG confirmation may be a more effective screening tool and is currently being evaluated (Heartline Study).

Formal screening with mHealth ECG recordings has yielded meaningful incidences of newly diagnosed AF, statistically greater than if diagnosis relied only on the office ECG. The yield generally is enhanced by the presence of risk factors such as older age and higher CHA₂DS₂-VASc scores. Several studies screened untargeted populations and all yielded new AF diagnoses at a rate under 1%.

### A prospective randomized comparison of loop recorders versus Holter monitors in patients with syncope or presyncope [^113okYTd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The initial management of syncope or presyncope typically involves short-term cardiac monitoring using a Holter monitor. A loop recorder is used to extend the period of monitoring to increase the probability of obtaining a symptom-rhythm correlation. Loop recorders and Holter monitors are both used commonly, but their utility has not been compared prospectively.

- **Methods**: Patients with syncope or presyncope referred for a Holter monitor or a loop recorder were assigned randomly to receive either a 48-hour Holter monitor or a loop recorder for 1 month as an initial diagnostic strategy. If the initial strategy was unsuccessful, patients were offered crossover to the alternate strategy.

- **Results**: One hundred patients (mean [± SD] age, 56 ± 20 years; 44 women) with syncope (n = 21), presyncope (n = 29), or both (n = 50) were enrolled. Of the 49 patients assigned randomly to an external loop recorder first, 31 (63%) had an arrhythmia identified or excluded, versus 12 (24%) of 51 patients assigned to a Holter monitor initially (P < 0.0001). Arrhythmia was identified as a cause of syncope in 1 patient with a loop recorder, compared with no patients with a Holter monitor (P = 0.31). Of the 29 patients with negative results with Holter monitoring who went on to receive a loop recorder, 13 (45%) had arrhythmia excluded, compared with none of the 4 patients who crossed over to receive a Holter monitor. The overall probability of obtaining a symptom-rhythm correlation was 56% (44/78) for loop recorders versus 22% (12/55) for Holter monitors (P < 0.0001).
