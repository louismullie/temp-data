## Question

Hydrocodone while breastfeeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydrocodone is safe to use while breastfeeding and, if so, under what conditions it can be used safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone transfer into breast milk and the relative infant dose. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence for infant adverse effects and how dose and duration influence risk. Next, I will review professional guidelines and FDA labeling to reconcile any differences. After that, I need to consider infant-specific risk factors and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note special situations like extended-release formulations and combination products with anticholinergics.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacokinetic basics. Hydrocodone is present in human milk, and the relative infant dose (RID) from immediate-release hydrocodone in early postpartum studies ranges roughly from about 1.4% to 3.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose, with one larger inpatient cohort showing a median around 1.6% and a wide range up to about 9% in some individuals, underscoring interpatient variability [^114wECWP] [^115qeFry]. Wait, let me verify the active metabolite contribution; hydromorphone is a minor but active metabolite, and when combined with hydrocodone, the total opiate exposure can still remain low relative to therapeutic infant doses, though accumulation with higher maternal dosing is plausible [^115qeFry].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety just because the RID is low. I need to check the clinical evidence for infant effects. Observational data suggest that short-term maternal opioid use is usually safe, but isolated case reports describe infant sedation and respiratory depression with maternal opioids, and some reports have been questioned for plausibility, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation and attention to dosing and infant vulnerability [^113CnT6s] [^1144V1TY]. Let me reconsider the dose-response signal; in a cohort comparing postpartum analgesics, maternal oxycodone exposure was associated with about a 20% rate of neonatal CNS depression, with higher maternal opioid doses correlating with more infant sedation, supporting a dose-dependent risk even when RIDs are low [^112csFVC].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine advises that if hydrocodone is used, it should be with caution, limited to a maximum of 30 mg per day, and infants should be monitored for sedation and respiratory depression, especially if use extends beyond 4–5 days, which aligns with a risk-mitigation approach rather than a blanket prohibition [^114H6ntr] [^112md926]. I should double-check FDA positions; multiple hydrocodone product labels emphasize that hydrocodone is present in milk and advise infant monitoring for excess sedation and respiratory depression, and some extended-release hydrocodone formulations specifically advise that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment due to potential for serious adverse reactions, even though the absolute RID data are from immediate-release products [^117J9HEN] [^115x9vMz] [^112J4FLE].

> I will now examine infant-specific risk modifiers. Neonates and preterm infants are more susceptible to opioid effects due to immature metabolism and lower clearance, so the same maternal dose may produce relatively higher infant exposure and clinical effects in the first month of life, warranting tighter dose limits and closer observation if opioids are unavoidable [^114wECWP]. But wait, what if maternal metabolism is altered? Genetic variability in CYP2D6 and other pathways can increase opioid metabolite formation, and while hydrocodone is less dependent on CYP2D6 than codeine, interindividual differences still matter and reinforce the principle of using the lowest effective dose and monitoring the infant [^113CnT6s].

> Let me think about formulation and co-medications because these can change risk. Extended-release hydrocodone products carry label cautions against breastfeeding due to sustained exposure and higher cumulative milk levels over time, so they should generally be avoided in lactation when alternatives exist [^115x9vMz] [^112J4FLE]. I should confirm combination products; hydrocodone paired with anticholinergics such as homatropine or first-generation antihistamines can reduce milk supply and add infant sedation risk, so these combinations are not recommended during breastfeeding, which strengthens the case for choosing simpler, immediate-release hydrocodone-acetaminophen combinations if an opioid is truly necessary [^114CEWwK] [^116KqX8r] [^1135TVVB].

> Next, I should review practical prescribing and monitoring steps. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, ideally 3–5 days, and avoid exceeding about 30 mg of hydrocodone per day. Time doses after breastfeeding to reduce peak infant exposure. And ensure someone other than the sedated mother is primarily caring for the infant, with explicit counseling to avoid maternal sedation and unsafe bed-sharing [^114H6ntr] [^1178L96A]. I need to ensure we specify infant monitoring for sleepiness, poor feeding, respiratory slowing, and unusual floppiness, with urgent evaluation if symptoms occur, and to plan for tapering to avoid maternal–infant withdrawal if therapy is stopped after more than several days of use [^117J9HEN] [^112G4tmg].

> But wait, what about alternatives and risk–benefit framing? Non-opioid multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen and NSAIDs should be maximized first-line in postpartum pain, and if an opioid is required, morphine or hydromorphone may be preferred in some contexts due to poor oral bioavailability, though hydromorphone has case reports of neonatal sedation with high maternal dosing, so no opioid is risk-free and selection should be individualized with caution [^112G4tmg] [^112JQeDs] [^111zAQGu]. Hold on, I should verify codeine and tramadol; both are specifically discouraged in breastfeeding because of variable metabolism and reports of infant toxicity, so hydrocodone, when necessary and dosed conservatively, is generally considered a safer alternative than codeine or tramadol in this setting [^115zAkNv] [^116ZJxbZ].

> Let me synthesize a bottom line. For short-term use at or below 30 mg per day of immediate-release hydrocodone, with infant monitoring and maternal precautions, the risk to a healthy, term breastfed infant is low but not zero, given the typical RID of about 1–4% and the dose-dependent signal for sedation seen with maternal opioids. Prolonged use, higher doses, extended-release formulations, or use in combination with sedating anticholinergics increase risk and should be avoided [^115qeFry] [^114wECWP] [^114H6ntr] [^117J9HEN]. I should confirm that shared decision-making includes a plan for non-opioid strategies, clear infant monitoring instructions, and a taper if therapy extends beyond several days, balancing the substantial benefits of continued breastfeeding against manageable, low-level opioid exposure when guidelines are followed [^112G4tmg] [^113brBi4].

Hydrocodone is **present in breast milk** [^117J9HEN] and can cause infant sedation and respiratory depression [^111iqtKY]; therefore, use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration [^114H6ntr] and monitor the infant closely [^114H6ntr]. The ABM recommends a **maximum of 30 mg/day** [^114H6ntr] and advises avoiding extended-release formulations [^notfound]. If possible, prefer non-opioid analgesics [^112G4tmg]; if hydrocodone is needed, dose after breastfeeding and watch for excess sedation, poor feeding, or respiratory changes [^1118AZum]. Stop breastfeeding or the drug if adverse effects occur [^notfound].

## Pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone in breastfeeding

Hydrocodone is **excreted into breast milk** [^114wECWP], with a relative infant dose (RID) of 1.4–3.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose [^116KqX8r]. Hydromorphone, an active metabolite, is also detected in variable concentrations [^117J9HEN]. Transfer depends on maternal dose, timing, and infant factors such as age and metabolism [^111d1gZD].

---

## Clinical evidence of infant effects

Infant effects include **sedation and respiratory depression** [^111iqtKY]; case reports describe excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydrocodone [^116KqX8r]. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when maternal hydrocodone is stopped or breastfeeding is discontinued [^117J9HEN].

---

## Professional guidelines and recommendations

- **ABM Clinical Protocol #15**: Limit hydrocodone to 30 mg/day; use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration; monitor infants for sedation and respiratory depression [^114H6ntr].

- **ABM Clinical Protocol #28**: Reiterates the 30 mg/day limit and advises caution with hydrocodone in breastfeeding mothers [^112md926].

- **FDA warnings**: Advise against breastfeeding during treatment with extended-release hydrocodone due to risks of sedation and respiratory depression [^115x9vMz].

---

## Factors influencing risk

- **Maternal dose and duration**: Higher doses and prolonged use increase infant exposure and risk of adverse effects [^115qeFry].

- **Infant age and metabolism**: Neonates and preterm infants are more susceptible due to immature metabolism [^114wECWP].

- **Genetic variability**: CYP2D6 polymorphisms can increase hydrocodone metabolism and infant exposure [^113CnT6s].

---

## Alternative pain management strategies

Non-opioid analgesics such as **acetaminophen and ibuprofen** are preferred for postpartum pain [^112G4tmg] because they have minimal infant risk [^112G4tmg]. Non-pharmacological measures — including physical therapy, relaxation techniques, and acupuncture — can reduce opioid needs [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

- **Infant monitoring**: Watch for excess sedation, poor feeding, respiratory depression, and withdrawal symptoms [^116B1Bvm].

- **Maternal precautions**: Use the lowest effective dose, avoid extended-release formulations, and dose after breastfeeding when possible [^114H6ntr].

- **Discontinuation**: Stop hydrocodone or breastfeeding if adverse effects occur [^notfound].

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^112h8qxn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Professional entities including SMFM, ACOG, and AAP strongly advocate that women breast-feed their infants because of its numerous maternal and neonatal health benefits. Breast-feeding rates have increased approximately 2% per year between 1996 and 2001. Stultz et al studied 46 women who provided medication history during their pregnancy and while they breast-fed their infants. In this cohort, there was a significant increase in both prescription and OTC medication use during lactation compared with when they were pregnant. More than 70% of women were taking medications that were potentially unsafe, or had unknown safety profiles. Anderson et al evaluated 100 articles between 1966 and 2002 to examine possible adverse outcomes in neonates due to their exposure to maternal medication(s) during breast-feeding. These authors reported that 47% of adverse outcomes in the neonates as "possibly" linked to medication exposure during breast-feeding; 53% as "probably" linked and no infant-related deaths were associated with medications. However, there is little research focusing on understanding the quantity of medication and their chemical effects on neonates during breast-feeding.

Only 5% of the 213 new pharmaceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2012 contained human data in their pregnancy section; almost one-half did not have any safety information concerning the medication use for lactating women. Because of the lack of studies on specific drugs in pregnancy and lactation, the efficacy and dosing data are generally extrapolated from studies from adult subjects (men and nonpregnant women) and safety data are collated from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance. Such data often come from the use of pregnancy-exposure registries that, while useful, are greatly limited by inherent design biases.

During the workshop, the expert panel focused on the "current" state of practice and reviewed available data on select drugs in pregnancy. The group discussed what providers optimally should know about the pharmacokinetics of drugs particularly given the physiologic changes that occur in the course of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the time of greatest vulnerability in terms of drug effects on the fetus and newborn. There was evidence presented about the interaction of drugs and breast milk, indicating that some assumptions could be made about the efficiency with which certain drugs may cross into breast milk and potentially pose further exposure risks to the neonate. Potential lessons learned from the pediatric experience with enrolling children in drug trials to enhance knowledge in this unique population and the robust safety systems in place to monitor vaccines were reviewed. The presentations and discussions from the 2-day workshop are summarized here.

Peripartum analgesia — hydromorphone in breastfeeding mothers includes limited pharmacokinetic data and a safety signal: "There are no data available regarding intravenous hydromorphone use, although one report of its use through intranasal administration noted a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.67% after a single maternal dose of 2 mg". "Oral availability of this medication is low, with the equianalgesic oral dose approximately five times greater than the intravenous dose". A case report states "there has been one case report of a 6-day-old infant exposed to hydromorphone through her mother's milk who presented to the emergency room with respiratory depression that required naloxone", and "The mother had been taking oral hydromorphone, 4 mg, every 4 hours around the clock since birth".

Transfer of Drug in Human Breast Milk

There is limited information on most drugs used by breast-feeding women, which poses challenges for women and their providers. Consequently, many providers will recommend stopping a medication based on theoretical concerns about its safety for the neonate, and this may lead to inadequately treated maternal disease. Information needed to make decisions about medications and breast-feeding includes knowledge of the need for the drug, the excretion of the drug into breast milk, the extent of oral absorption of the drug by the neonate, the potential adverse effects on the neonate, and the potential effect of the drug on lactation. In addition, the infant's age is relevant and should be considered as adverse events are rarer in infants older than 6 months. As in pregnancy, the biochemical properties of a given drug are important elements such as drug ionization, molecular weight, volume of distribution, lipid solubility, and protein binding, and they may influence how much of the drug is excreted into breast milk. Furthermore, the half-life of the drug and its oral bioavailability will influence how much is absorbed by the neonate. One example of these complexities include emerging data demonstrating that there are specific patient genotypes that influence the toxicity of given drugs. Stover and Davis suggest that this area of pharmacogenomics holds promise in understanding how neonates with in utero exposure to opioids may have different withdrawal patterns based on specific polymorphisms.

The main recommendations from the workshop were focused in the following areas: clinical care recommendations, research gaps, and policy-related considerations.

### Adverse effects following the inadvertent administration of opioids to infants and children [^115WSkR6]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Regardless of the clinical scenario in which they are administered, opioids can have adverse effects in infants and children. These adverse effects may be particularly problematic when opioids are inadvertently administered since the clinical signs and symptoms may not be readily attributed to opioids without an appropriate history. The authors present 3 clinical scenarios in which adverse effects occurred related to the inadvertent administration of opioids when: (1) acetaminophen with codeine were administered instead of acetaminophen, (2) a mother was breastfeeding while taking opioids, and (3) a fentanyl patch was placed on a superficial injury. A thorough history and physical examination combined with urine/plasma drug screening resulted in the identification of the problem and its effective therapy.

### Maternal opioid treatment after delivery and risk of adverse infant outcomes: population based cohort study [^1144V1TY]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Most mothers in North America initiate breastfeeding in the immediate postpartum period. All opioids pass into breast milk in small amounts, although not in quantities expected to cause respiratory or central nervous system depression in nursing infants. Isolated reports describe opioid toxicity in breastfed infants, which some authors have hypothesised reflects the ingestion of large quantities of opioids in breast milk. However, the plausibility of these reports — and one high profile case in particular — has been repeatedly questioned, and two related articles were recently retracted by the editors of the journals in which they were published.

Owing in part to ongoing regulatory warnings arising from case reports, concerns remain about the possibility of breastfeeding related opioid toxicity in infants. This uncertainty might undermine postpartum analgesia and generate unnecessary anxiety for parents. Whether maternal opioid use while breastfeeding truly presents a risk to newborn infants remains the subject of debate. Using eight years of comprehensive population based healthcare data, we examined whether there was an association between maternal opioid prescription after delivery and short term increased risks of adverse outcomes in infants.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxycontin) [^112E9thm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Oxycodone is present in breast milk. Published lactation studies report variable concentrations of oxycodone in breast milk with administration of immediate-release oxycodone to nursing mothers in the early postpartum period. The lactation studies did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with extended–release oxycodone, including OXYCONTIN, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with OXYCONTIN.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to OXYCONTIN through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breast-fed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of OXYCONTIN have been established in pediatric patients ages 11 to 16 years. Use of OXYCONTIN is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials with OXYCONTIN in adults as well as an open-label study in pediatric patients ages 6 to 16 years. However, there were insufficient numbers of patients less than 11 years of age enrolled in this study to establish the safety of the product in this age group.

The safety of OXYCONTIN in pediatric patients was evaluated in 155 patients previously receiving and tolerating opioids for at least 5 consecutive days with a minimum of 20 mg per day of oxycodone or its equivalent on the two days immediately preceding dosing with OXYCONTIN. Patients were started on a total daily dose ranging between 20 mg and 100 mg depending on prior opioid dose.

The most frequent adverse events observed in pediatric patients were vomiting, nausea, headache, pyrexia, and constipation [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Clinical Studies (14)].

Including lactating women in clinical trials is imperative to generate relevant drug exposure and safety data needed to advise on clinical use of drugs in this understudied population. Recent changes in perspectives, regulatory guidance, and international networks which outline pragmatic approaches for advancing the conduct of clinical lactation studies are discussed.

### Breastfeeding on injectable opioid agonist therapy: a case report [^117RWhyA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) is the highest-intensity treatment currently available in Canada for individuals with severe opioid use disorder. However, there is limited data on iOAT administration in the perinatal period, with no research, practice guidelines, or known reports of breastfeeding on iOAT. This article presents the first known case of an individual breastfeeding on iOAT.

Case summary

We present a case of a pregnant 32-year-old woman from Canada with severe opioid use disorder, who stabilized with iOAT and chose to breastfeed her infant. She presented to hospital at 38 + 6 gestation in labor, unstable in her substance use disorder despite multiple interventions and was initiated on iOAT (intravenous hydromorphone) shortly after delivery. Before initiation of breastfeeding the infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. On day 9 of life the infant received breastmilk for the first time, and was discharged from neonatal intensive care unit on day 12 of life with no clinical evidence of sedation or respiratory depression. The infant maintained mixed feeding and at 58 days of life was discharged in the mother and father's care, a healthy infant with stable vitals.

Discussion

This case suggests positive infant and maternal health and social outcomes for breastfeeding on iOAT. Further research on perinatal iOAT use and the pharmacokinetics of high-dose hydromorphone in breastmilk is required to inform clinical practice guidelines to safely support individuals and their infants who are impacted by substance use.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide oral solution (hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide) [^1135TVVB]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide.

There are no data on the presence of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide in human milk, the effects of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide on the breastfed infant, or the effects of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide on milk production; however, data are available with hydrocodone and homatropine.

Hydrocodone

Hydrocodone is present in breast milk. Published cases report variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period with relative infant doses of hydrocodone ranging between 1.4 and 3.7%. There are case reports of excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydrocodone. No information is available on the effects of hydrocodone on milk production.

Homatropine

No information is available on the levels of homatropine in breast milk or on milk production. The published literature suggests that homatropine may decrease milk production based on its anticholinergic effects (see Clinical Considerations).

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Chronic use of opioids, such as hydrocodone, a component of hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide, may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Homatropine

No information is available on the levels of homatropine in breast milk or on milk production. The published literature suggests that homatropine may decrease milk production based on its anticholinergic effects (see Clinical Considerations).

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

### Breast milk hydrocodone and hydromorphone levels in mothers using hydrocodone for postpartum pain [^115qeFry]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the extent of passage of hydrocodone and its active metabolite, hydromorphone, into breast milk.

Methods

This is a pharmacokinetic study of 30 postpartum women receiving hydrocodone bitartrate for postpartum pain in the inpatient setting. Mothers donated timed breast milk samples for the analysis of hydrocodone and hydromorphone.

Results

Fully breastfed neonates received 1.6% (range 0.2%-9%) of the maternal weight-adjusted hydrocodone bitartrate dosage. When combined with hydromorphone, the total median opiate dosage from breast milk is 0.7% of a therapeutic dosage for older infants. Most mothers excreted little to no hydromorphone into breast milk.

Conclusion

Standard postpartum dosages of hydrocodone bitartrate appear to be acceptable to use in women nursing newborns. Prolonged use of high dosages is not advisable.

### Is maternal opioid use hazardous to breast-fed infants? [^113CnT6s]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades, the rate of breastfeeding has increased steadily in the developed countries of the world. During this time, opioid use in the general population has steadily increased as well. Despite this, clinicians remain unclear whether opioid use is safe during breastfeeding. While the vast majority of medications used during breastfeeding occur without incident, case reports and studies have reported possible opioid toxicity in breast-fed infants. Multiple enzymes are involved in the metabolism of opioids. CYP2D6 catabolizes O-demethylation of codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone to more potent metabolites. CYP3A4 inactivates methadone, meperidine, and buprenorphine. Glucoronide conjugation by the UGT enzyme family inactivates morphine and hydromorphone. Genetic polymorphisms and interfering medications affect the maternal metabolism, which in turn determines the exposure and risk to the breast-fed neonate. We review the production of breast milk, the transfer of xenobiotics from blood to milk, the characteristics that alter xenobiotic breast-milk concentrations, and we review the evidence of specific common opioids and infant toxicity. The short-term maternal use of prescription opioids is usually safe and infrequently presents a hazard to the newborn.

### Medication safety in breastfeeding… [^1118AZum]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

The amount of medication that enters the infant through breast milk is determined by the medication concentration in the milk, volume consumed, and gastrointestinal absorption. Opioid Replacement Therapy. The benefits of breastfeeding while on opioid replacement therapy, including methadone and buprenorphine, outweigh the risks, especially during the current opioid epidemic. Potential adverse effects of opioid replacement therapy on breastfed infants include lethargy, respiratory difficulty, and poor weight gain. Transfer of medications for opioid replacement therapy to the infant through breastfeeding is insufficient to prevent neonatal abstinence syndrome after opioid use during pregnancy, but opioid replacement therapy received through breastfeeding reduces the severity and duration.

10 Initiating methadone postpartum or increasing the dosage to more than 100 mg daily while breastfeeding poses a risk of sedation and respiratory depression in the breastfed infant, especially if the infant was not exposed in utero. 4 If opioids are taken while breastfeeding, symptoms of withdrawal can occur in the infant after abrupt discontinuation of breastfeeding that would be less likely with slower weaning. HYPERTENSION Medications for hypertension are generally acceptable to use during lactation. Calcium channel blockers pass poorly into breast milk. 4 Second-generation anti-histamines such as loratadine are less sedating and unlikely to harm the breastfed infant because of low absorption, but they may decrease milk supply. 4 First-generation antihistamines are less favored because they cause greater reduction in milk supply and maternal and infant sedation. If an oral opioid is required for pain control, hydrocodone or morphine is preferred.

When possible, patients should breastfeed their infants before taking opioids. Low doses should be used for short durations, and they should be avoided while using other sedating medications. The recommended daily dosage of hydrocodone is 30 mg or less. 10 Because of its longer half-life, hydromorphone should be avoided. 12 Oxycodone should be avoided during breastfeeding because of central nervous system depression in 20% of exposed infants. 13 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration recommends avoiding codeine and tramadol during breastfeeding because patients who are ultra-rapid metabolizers risk exposing infants to excessively high amounts of active metabolites, sedation, and respiratory depression. 10, 14 Meperidine should be avoided during breastfeeding because of its long-acting metabolite that is more sedating in infants than adults. 4.

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen [^111iqtKY]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions. There is potential for sedation and respiratory depression resulting from infant exposure to hydrocodone and its metabolites in breast milk.

Acetaminophen is present in human milk in small quantities after oral administration. Based on data from more than 15 nursing mothers, the calculated infant daily dose of acetaminophen is approximately 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. There is one well-documented report of a rash in a breastfed infant that resolved when the mother stopped acetaminophen use and recurred when she resumed acetaminophen use.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to Benzhydrocodone and Acetaminophen tablets through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Published animal studies report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface area comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. Additional published animal studies indicate that acetaminophen exposure in utero adversely impacts reproductive capacity of both male and female offspring at clinically relevant exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.

### Safety issues of maternal drug therapy during breastfeeding [^113nEPic]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Two goals when counseling breastfeeding mothers taking medication are protecting the infant from adverse events and permitting necessary maternal therapy. Madadi et al. report a case-control study of neonatal and maternal opioid toxicity after codeine administration. Therapeutic considerations in counseling breastfeeding mothers include susceptibility to drug toxicity of the very young and/or premature infant, significant interindividual variations in drug response, the dose-response relationship with respect to drug toxicity, and the role of pharmacogenetics in both the mother and the infant. These host factors may combine in a particular patient to act synergistically to produce an adverse reaction.

### Trends in postpartum opioid prescribing: a time series analysis [^1176B7ZV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Opioids are commonly prescribed following childbirth, but data are lacking on trends in postpartum opioid prescribing over time. We examined whether a highly publicized 2006 case report questioning the safety of codeine during lactation was associated with changes in postpartum opioid prescribing. We conducted a cross-sectional time series analysis of all publicly funded prescriptions for opioids to postpartum women in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2000, to March 31, 2017. The intervention was the publication of a case report in 2006 attributing the death of a breastfeeding neonate to maternal codeine use. The primary outcome was the rate of opioid prescribing to postpartum women. Among postpartum women eligible for prescription drug coverage, 17.5% filled an opioid prescription in the third quarter of 2006 (immediately prior to the intervention), with codeine representing 89.8% of all prescriptions. By the fourth quarter of 2010, only 12.2% of postpartum women filled an opioid prescription, representing a decline of 30% (P < 0.01), with codeine representing 71.9% of all prescriptions. During this period, we observed sizeable relative increases in the proportion of opioid prescriptions filled for morphine, hydromorphone, and oxycodone. By 2017, among women prescribed opioids post partum, 39.0% filled a prescription for codeine, while the remainder filled prescriptions for oxycodone (18.6%), morphine (25.5%), and hydromorphone (16.9%). A highly publicized case report questioning the safety of maternal codeine use during breastfeeding was associated with significant changes in opioid prescribing to postpartum women, including a decline in overall opioid prescribing and a shift from codeine to stronger opioids.

### Oncolactation for patients with breast cancer: executive summary from the American Society of Breast Surgeons [^111tSYQE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Perioperative Considerations

Avoid narcotics, as all opioids transfer to breastmilk. If necessary, morphine and hydromorphone are preferred owing to poor oral bioavailability. Codeine, tramadol, and meperidine are not recommended in lactation.
Use intravenous fluids judiciously to minimize breast edema, which can interfere with latching and effective pumping.
Advise patients to pump the unaffected breast prior to surgery to maintain milk production. However, patients should not pump the affected breast as milk removal stimulates increased milk production.
Minimize separation of mother and child.
Breastfeeding is safe after anesthesia when the patient is alert enough to hold and latch her baby or utilize a breast pump.
Local anesthetics are safe and do not require interruption of breastfeeding.

Radiation Therapy

Patients should not breastfeed from or pump the affected breast while undergoing partial or whole breast radiation due to risks of wounds and abscess, interference with radiation volumetric plans, and apoptosis of functional cells. Patients can breastfeed without interruption from the unaffected breast while undergoing radiation therapy.

Systemic Therapy

Endocrine therapy is contraindicated during lactation as agents readily transfer to breastmilk and may inhibit milk production and impact estrogen metabolism in infants.–
Cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are excreted in breastmilk, which is not safe for infant consumption and should be discarded. Cabergoline, an indirect prolactin antagonist, can be used off-label to halt milk production when chemotherapy begins. Most commonly, 0.25–0.5 mg by mouth every 72 hours is used; most patients require one to three doses for reduction of engorgement and milk flow.

Women who desire to express breastmilk to maintain production should be advised about the high rate of complications, including mastitis, nipple injury, decreased milk volume, change in breastmilk microbiome, and infant disinterest in return to nursing at the breast after completion of chemotherapy. If women still desire to pump milk, they should follow recommendations from an oncologic pharmacist regarding the safety of feeding any milk to their child.
Targeted anti-HER2 agents and immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab, likely are minimally excreted in breastmilk owing to their large molecular weight; however, no safety data exist and breastfeeding is not recommended for women receiving these drugs. –
Breastfeeding is not recommended for women taking cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors owing to the lack of safety data. –

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^117Lcgww]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

This is the first clinical practice guideline (CPG) from the American Academy of Pediatrics outlining evidence-based approaches to safely prescribing opioids for acute pain in outpatient settings. The central goal is to aid clinicians in understanding when opioids may be indicated to treat acute pain in children and adolescents and how to minimize risks (including opioid use disorder, poisoning, and overdose). The document also seeks to alleviate disparate pain treatment of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native children and adolescents, who receive pain management that is less adequate and less timely than that provided to white individuals. There may also be disparities in pain treatment based on language, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and other factors, which are discussed. The document recommends that clinicians treat acute pain using a multimodal approach that includes the appropriate use of nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid medications, and, when needed, opioid medications. Opioids should not be prescribed as monotherapy for children or adolescents who have acute pain. When using opioids for acute pain management, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioid formulations, start with the lowest age- and weight-appropriate doses, and provide an initial supply of 5 or fewer days, unless the pain is related to trauma or surgery with expected duration of pain longer than 5 days. Clinicians should not prescribe codeine or tramadol for patients younger than 12 years; adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, or severe lung disease; to treat postsurgical pain after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy in patients younger than 18 years; or for any breastfeeding patient. The CPG recommends providing opioids when appropriate for treating acutely worsened pain in children and adolescents who have a history of chronic pain; clinicians should partner with other opioid-prescribing clinicians involved in the patient's care and/or a specialist in chronic pain or palliative care to determine an appropriate treatment plan. Caution should be used when treating acute pain in those who are taking sedating medications. The CPG describes potential harms of discontinuing or rapidly tapering opioids in individuals who have been on stable, long-term opioids to treat chronic pain. The guideline also recommends providing naloxone and information on naloxone, safe storage and disposal of opioids, and direct observation of medication administration. Clinicians are encouraged to help caregivers develop a plan for safe disposal. The CPG contains 12 key action statements based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-quality observational studies, and, when studies are lacking or could not feasibly or ethically be conducted, from expert opinion. Each key action statement includes a level of evidence, the benefit-harm relationship, and the strength of recommendation.

### Prescription medication use | Breastfeeding special circumstances… [^113brBi4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Although many medications pass into breast milk, most have little or no effect on milk supply or infant well-being. A few medications should be avoided while breastfeeding. Mothers should talk with their health care provider about medications or supplements they take and medications to avoid. Prescription medications while breastfeeding It is usually safe for mothers to use prescription medications while breastfeeding. A 2013 clinical report by the American Academy of Pediatrics indicates that most medications and immunizations are safe to use while breastfeeding. According to the AAP, health care providers should weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing medications to breastfeeding mothers. Consider the following:

- Need for the drug by the mother.
- Potential effects of the drug on milk production.
- Amount of the drug excreted into human milk.
- Extent of oral absorption by the breastfeeding infant.
- Possible adverse effects on the breastfeeding infant.
- Age of the infant.
- Proportion of feedings that are breast milk. More information The U. S. National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health maintains LactMed®. LactMed® is a database of information on drugs and other chemicals to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. LactMed® includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the nursing infant. The database also provides alternatives to those drugs where appropriate. All data come from scientific literature and are referenced. A peer review panel reviews the data for scientific validity and whether it is the most current information. The Organization of Teratology Information Specialists provides information on the risks and safety of taking medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and guaifenesin (Obredon) [^1158LzE2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Guaifenesin

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rats dosed throughout the period of organogenesis, guaifenesin resulted in fetal death at doses approximately 1 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with maternal oral doses of 350 mg/kg/day and higher). Guaifenesin also induced hemorrhagic spots and decreases in fetal weight and lengths of full body, skull, fore- and hind-limbs, and tail at doses 1 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with maternal oral doses of 250 mg/kg/day and higher). Limb and tail defects, increased intercostal space, and improper development of limbs were observed at doses 2 times the MRHD (on a mg/m2basis with maternal oral doses of 500 mg/kg/day and higher).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with OBREDON.

There are no data on the presence of OBREDON in human milk, the effects of OBREDON on the breastfed infant, or the effects of OBREDON on milk production; however, data are available with hydrocodone.

Hydrocodone

Hydrocodone is present in breast milk. Published cases report variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period with relative infant doses of hydrocodone ranging between 1.4 and 3.7%. There are case reports of excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydrocodone. No information is available on the effects of hydrocodone on milk production.

Guaifenesin

No information is available on the levels of guaifenesin in breast milk or on milk production.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to OBREDON through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Chronic use of opioids, such as hydrocodone, a component of OBREDON, may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (roxicodone) [^114DmdC5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Available data from lactation studies indicate that oxycodone is present in breastmilk and that doses of less than 60 mg/day of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants. A pharmacokinetics study utilizing opportunistic sampling of 76 lactating women receiving oxycodone immediate-release products for postpartum pain management showed that oxycodone concentrates in breastmilk with an average milk to plasma ratio of 3.2. The relative infant dose was low, approximately 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose (see Data).

In the same study, among the 70 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk, no adverse events were attributed to oxycodone. However, based on known adverse effects in adults, infants should be monitored for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of the oxycodone on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ROXICODONE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ROXICODONE or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to ROXICODONE through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped or when breastfeeding is stopped.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen (Xodol) [^113EJuJA]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Pregnancy Category C

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Xodol®should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nonteratogenic Effects

Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting and fever. The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal.

Labor and Delivery

As with all narcotics, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.

Nursing Mothers

Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known. It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney. Thus the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function due to the accumulation of the parent compound and/or metabolites in the plasma. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Hydrocodone may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets and observed closely.

### Characteristics of prescription opioid analgesics in pregnancy and risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome in newborns [^11372fRC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Assessing opioids as a class may mask important differences between medications that are relevant to clinical decision-making. In this cohort study, we observed higher risks of NOWS and severe NOWS in neonates born to mothers for whom oxycodone, methadone, morphine, and hydromorphone prescriptions were dispensed compared with neonates born to mothers who had similar cumulative exposure to hydrocodone. Although pain management needs vary substantially across patients, information on opioid-specific risks of NOWS may help prescribers select an opioid to treat pain in late stages of pregnancy.

### Hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex [^116KqX8r]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex.

There are no data on the presence of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex in human milk, the effects of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex on the breastfed infant, or the effects of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex on milk production; however, data are available with hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine.

Hydrocodone

Hydrocodone is present in breast milk. Published cases report variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period with relative infant doses of hydrocodone ranging between 1.4 and 3.7%. There are case reports of excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydrocodone. No information is available on the effects of hydrocodone on milk production.

Chlorpheniramine

Chlorpheniramine is present in human milk. Chlorpheniramine has not been reported to cause effects on the breastfed infant. The published literature suggests that chlorpheniramine may decrease milk production based on its anticholinergic effects. (see Clinical Considerations)

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of
Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Chronic use of opioids, such as hydrocodone, a component of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex, may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Breastfeeding on injectable opioid agonist therapy: a case report [^111CftaD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Injectable opioid agonist therapy is an evidence-based treatment for severe OUD. – Published case studies of iOAT during pregnancy are promising. There is no published literature on the use of iOAT during breastfeeding, and there is limited literature on hydromorphone in general during breastfeeding. A pharmacokinetic study that collected breastmilk samples after a single 2-mg intranasal dose of hydromorphone reported a milk/plasma (M/P) ratio of 2.56, peak milk levels occurred 2 hours after the dose, and half-life of elimination from milk was 10.5 hours. Calculated infant dose was 0.67%. Despite what appears to be low levels of hydromorphone transfer into breastmilk, a published report of a newborn being breastfed by a mother on 4 mg oral hydromorphone q4 required resuscitation and naloxone administration for drowsiness, apnea and bradycardia.

There is a gap in data on the safety and pharmacokinetics of high-dose hydromorphone during breastfeeding and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. The current case presented high doses of iOAT up to 120 mg IV TID, approximately equal to 1000 to 1800 mg oral hydromorphone. Infants exposed to high-dose opioids in utero are likely to have much different tolerance for breastmilk containing maternal prescribed opioids than an opioid naive infant. The 48-hour minimum time period for observation of the infant was based on the 10.5 hours half-life of hydromorphone reported in milk and the unknown pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in neonates. Interesting in this case was the infant's rapid ability to titrate off oral morphine upon breastfeeding. Further research is required to understand the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone in breastmilk and in infants.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen (Percocet) [^111gLhAm]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Available data from lactation studies indicate that oxycodone is present in breastmilk and that doses of less than 60 mg/day of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants. A pharmacokinetics study utilizing opportunistic sampling of 76 lactating women receiving oxycodone immediate-release products for postpartum pain management showed that oxycodone concentrates in breastmilk with an average milk to plasma ratio of 3.2. The relative infant dose was low, approximately 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose (see Data).

In the same study, among the 70 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk, no adverse events were attributed to oxycodone. However, based on known adverse effects in adults, infants should be monitored for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of the oxycodone on milk production.

Acetaminophen is also excreted in breast milk in low concentrations.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PERCOCET and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PERCOCET or from the underlying maternal condition.

Infants exposed to PERCOCET through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112SRG2M]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder — pregnancy and breastfeeding management includes guidance that if a woman becomes pregnant while receiving naltrexone, it may be appropriate to discontinue the medication when relapse risk is agreed to be low, and remaining on naltrexone should be carefully considered with discussion of insufficient risk data; if discontinuing and relapse risk exists, treatment with methadone or buprenorphine should be considered. Use of a naloxone challenge to test for opioid dependence and risk of precipitated withdrawal is not recommended for pregnant women with opioid use disorder. Mothers receiving methadone or buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders should be encouraged to breastfeed. Additional pragmatic dosing notes state that twice-daily methadone dosing may be more effective with fewer side effects than single dosing but may be impractical in OTP settings, and after childbirth doses may need adjustment (typically reduction) based on weight and metabolism changes.

### The implausibility of neonatal opioid toxicity from breastfeeding [^112ETQpv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

The belief that newborns can develop opioid toxicity from breastfeeding is widely held but supported by very little data. Based largely on a single, highly publicized case report (the "Toronto case"), major health agencies worldwide now caution against codeine use by nursing mothers. As a result, "stronger" opioids with greater abuse liability are increasingly prescribed in its place, potentially to the detriment of maternal health. We re-examine aspects of this case report to demonstrate why such an occurrence is highly implausible. The Toronto case involved the death of a 13-day-old infant from opioid toxicity. The child's mother, who took codeine while breastfeeding, was found to have a duplication of CYP2D6*2, consistent with ultrarapid metabolizer status. This led to the conclusion that the child died from opioid toxicity due to enhanced maternal conversion of codeine to morphine, with the subsequent passage of large amounts of morphine into breast milk. We argue that this explanation is implausible based upon several factors: (1) the exceedingly small amount of opioids passed into breastmilk irrespective of maternal CYP genotype, (2) the observation that significant neonatal opioid accumulation can only occur in the setting of severely impaired renal function, and (3) the previously unreported finding of a markedly elevated codeine concentration in postmortem blood. Finally, a review of the literature identifies a paucity of convincing reports of neonatal opioid toxicity during breastfeeding, with no other confirmed cases of neonatal death despite the use of these drugs by millions of nursing mothers over the past 2 decades.

### Oxycodone and acetaminophen (nalocet) [^117L2CZZ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Infants exposed to oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

Data

Oxycodone concentration data from 76 lactating women receiving immediate-release oxycodone products for postpartum pain management, and 28 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk showed that following a median (range) dose of oxycodone in mothers of 9.2 (5–10) mg/dose or 33.0 (5.4–59.3) mg/day, oxycodone concentrated in breastmilk with a median (range) milk to plasma ratio of 3.2 (1.2–5.3). However, when using maternal breastmilk data to estimate the daily and relative infant dose, the infant dose was 0.006 mg/kg/day, which is 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose of 10 mg every 6 hours. These estimates based on maternal breastmilk concentrations were corroborated by the observed infant concentrations, of which over 75% (19/25) were below the limit of quantification. Among the 6 infants with quantifiable concentration, the median (range) concentration was 0.2 ng/mL (0.1–0.7). These concentrations are 100 to 1000 times lower than concentrations observed in other studies after infants received oxycodone at 0.1 mg/kg/dose (~20–200 ng/mL).

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide (hycodan) [^116kq5nG]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation, respiratory depression, and death in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with HYCODAN.

There are no data on the presence of HYCODAN in human milk, the effects of HYCODAN on the breastfed infant, or the effects of HYCODAN on milk production; however, data are available with hydrocodone and homatropine.

Hydrocodone

Hydrocodone is present in breast milk. Published cases report variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period with relative infant doses of hydrocodone ranging between 1.4% and 3.7%. There are case reports of excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydrocodone. No information is available on the effects of hydrocodone on milk production.

Homatropine

No information is available on the levels of homatropine in breast milk or on milk production. The published literature suggests that homatropine may decrease milk production based on its anticholinergic effects (see Clinical Considerations).

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to HYCODAN through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

### Hydrocodone bitartrate, acetaminophen (Hydrocodone / apap) [^113zdnQ2]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

As with all opioids, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of

respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.

Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known. It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Clinical studies of hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65

and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience

has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an

elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitanidisease or other drug therapy.

Hydrocodone and the major metabolites of acetaminophen are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney.

Thus the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function due to the accumulation of

the parent compound and/or metabolites in the plasma. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased

renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Hydrocodone may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on

low doses ofhydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets and observed closely.

ABM Protocol #21 — opioid exposure during breastfeeding — notes that while there is a moderate amount of data on prescribed opioids, little is known about nonprescribed synthetic opioids; fentanyl may adulterate up to 90% of illicit supply. In individuals taking short-term prescribed opioids (3–5 days), relative infant doses (RID) are usually low (1–5%) and breastfeeding is typically safe, whereas longer-term use (> 5 days) raises concern for drug accumulation. Tramadol carries a US Food and Drug Administration warning for potentially higher RID, though there are no reports of infant effects with parental tramadol use. The document also highlights increasing impacts of opioid use disorder (OUD) and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) over 2000–2016.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 21: breastfeeding in the setting of substance use and substance use disorder (revised 2023) [^113hk4dC]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #21 — timing of nonprescribed use during pregnancy and breastfeeding initiation explains that previous ABM guidelines recommended that women who had nonprescribed substance use in the 30–90 days before delivery be discouraged from breastfeeding. A single-site 2020 retrospective cohort study of 500 women receiving opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment found that the predictive value of postpartum substance use based on urine drug testing from the third trimester was only 36% and that urine drug testing at delivery had the strongest association with ongoing nonprescribed postpartum. In light of these findings and evidence that most substances are eliminated in hours to days rather than days to weeks, women who discontinue nonprescribed substance use by or during the delivery hospitalization can be supported in breastfeeding initiation. Mothers motivated to breastfeed who report recent nonprescribed substance use and/or have positive toxicology testing at delivery should be supported in expressing milk to establish milk production, and ideally, before breastfeeding, sufficient time should pass to allow for substance clearance from breast milk; a similar approach of expressing milk with discarding milk and consultation with a multidisciplinary team should take place to inform breastfeeding decisions.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^114SErNW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions.

Limited published literature reports that, following oral administration, ibuprofen is present in human milk at relative infant doses of 0.06% to 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose.

Lactation studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydrocodone is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen tablets in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.

### Breastfeeding on injectable opioid agonist therapy: a case report [^1163fi41]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Injectable opioid agonist therapy (iOAT) is the highest-intensity treatment for individuals with severe opioid use disorder (OUD). Despite growth in iOAT administration, there remains a gap in the literature regarding iOAT in the peripartum. Three cases on iOAT in pregnancy have been published, each demonstrating positive pregnancy outcomes. – Currently, there are no known published reports of breastfeeding while on iOAT. The extensive benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and infants are well established, including enhancing maternal-infant bonding, maternal confidence, and decreasing symptoms and need for pharmacological therapy in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). A clinical protocol was implemented in 2019 for perinatal iOAT administration at the Families in Recovery (FIR) unit at BC Women's Hospital, an in-patient unit that practices rooming in. Outcomes of breastfeeding while on iOAT remain unknown.

We present the first known case of an individual breastfeeding on iOAT. The participant consented to an observational research study on perinatal iOAT, approved by the University of British Columbia's Children's and Women's research ethics board, and funded by the Women's Health Research Institute. Additional written informed consent was obtained to publish this report.

Data

Animal Data

No evidence of embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed after oral administration of hydrocodone throughout the period of organogenesis in rats and rabbits at doses up to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the human hydrocodone dose of 120 mg/day based on AUC exposure comparisons). However, in these studies, reduced fetal body weights and delayed ossification were observed in rat at 30 mg/kg/day and reduced fetal body weights were observed in rabbits at 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 and 0.3 times, respectively, the human hydrocodone dose of 120 mg/day based on AUC exposure comparisons). In a pre- and post-natal development study pregnant rats were administered oral hydrocodone throughout the period of gestation and lactation. At a dose of 30 mg/kg/day decreased pup viability, pup survival indices, litter size and pup body weight were observed. This dose is approximately 0.1 times the human hydrocodone dose of 120 mg/day based on AUC exposure comparisons.

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with HYSINGLA, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with HYSINGLA ER.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to HYSINGLA ER through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life- threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients, Pregnancy].

Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS- compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:

- Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.

### ABM clinical protocol # 28, peripartum analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother [^112ng6cc]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Postcesarean delivery analgesia — neuraxial strategies and opioid safety: Most women will have received neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, allowing single or repeated neuraxial opioid dosing and/or maintenance of epidural local anesthetic infusion; this forms the basis of multimodal analgesia, should provide some pain relief for 18–24 hours, and will reduce systemic opioid consumption. Continuous postcesarean epidural infusion may minimize systemic maternal use and hence opioid exposure, and a randomized study found the continuous group had lower pain scores and a higher volume of milk fed to their infants; this option may be considered when early movement must be limited. Local anesthetics transfer to breast milk is low and they can be safely administered during breastfeeding. Single-dose, long-acting neuraxial opioids (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone) have minimal effects on breastfed infants due to negligible maternal plasma levels, and extremely low doses are effective and may be repeated if epidural or intrathecal catheters remain in place. When systemic opioids are needed, their use should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration and a multimodal approach is suggested with acetaminophen/paracetamol and NSAIDs maximized; all opioids are present in human milk, it is recommended that patients be counseled about the risk of sedation for both the mother and the breastfed infant, and if the mother has central nervous system (CNS) depression symptoms, the infant should be evaluated for CNS depression as well.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen [^116B1Bvm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Labor or Delivery

Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates. An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets are not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate. Opioid analgesics, including Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions. However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor. Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.

Nursing Mothers

Hydrocodone is present in human milk.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Infants exposed to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Acetaminophen Tablets through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 742 summary: postpartum pain management [^112w21SL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Pain and fatigue are the most common problems reported by women in the early postpartum period. Pain can interfere with a woman's ability to care for herself and her infant. Untreated pain is associated with a risk of greater opioid use, postpartum depression, and development of persistent pain. Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies are important components of postpartum pain management. Because 81% of women in the United States initiate breastfeeding during the postpartum period, it is important to consider the drug effects of all prescribed medications on the mother-infant dyad. Multimodal analgesia uses drugs that have different mechanisms of action, which potentiates the analgesic effect. If opioids are included, a multimodal regimen used in a stepwise approach allows for administration of lower doses of opioids. Given interindividual variation in metabolism of opioids, as well as the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse effects in women who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine, monitoring for excessive sedation and other adverse effects in infants is prudent for women who are prescribed opiates. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommendations underscore the need for anticipatory guidance regarding opioid effects in all patients, obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should ensure that the application of this guidance does not interfere with pain control or disrupt breastfeeding during the postpartum period. Women with opioid use disorder, women who have chronic pain, and women who are using other medications or substances that may increase sedation need additional support in managing postpartum pain.

We investigated the 90 most administered medications to female patients between the ages of 15 to 50 for common ED chief complaints at a tertiary care academic medical center from January 2018 to December 2022. A total of 145,960 doses were analyzed. We subsequently searched LactMed®, InfantRisk Application, and Pubmed® for all safety information on these medications and divided them by categories. Ultimately, we proposed a treatment algorithm for breastfeeding patients in the ED.

Results

Analgesics were the most commonly ordered medications in the ED, and importantly analgesics ranging from ibuprofen to morphine are safe in limited doses in the ED setting. Antibiotics and antifungals pose limited restrictions. All systems-based medications have a variety of safe options available. Lastly, supplements and electrolytes are safe.

Conclusion

The majority of medications utilized in the acute setting are compatible with breastfeeding. There should be limited circumstances to advise pumping and dumping in the ED.

### Medication safety in breastfeeding [^112G4tmg]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding is universally recognized as the preferred method of infant nutrition, but is sometimes abbreviated because of fear of harm to the infant from maternal medication. The amount of medication that enters breast milk varies based on the maternal serum concentration and the pharmacologic properties of the medication. When prescribing medications for a breastfeeding patient, those with the lowest risk to the infant should be selected, and dosing should be before the infant's longest sleep interval. Prescribers should use current, accurate resources. LactMed is a convenient, government-sponsored, authoritative resource that lists safety information for many medications and is available free online. When mental health conditions occur during lactation, priority should be given to effectively treating the mother, often with medications that were effective during pregnancy. Most antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding. Stimulant medications may decrease milk supply. Insulin, metformin, and second-generation sulfonylureas are generally preferred to treat diabetes mellitus during breastfeeding, but newer agents require caution because they have not been studied in lactation. Inhaled and nasal treatments for asthma and allergic rhinitis are unlikely to affect breastfed infants. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are preferred analgesics during lactation. Maternal opioid use can cause infant sedation. Herbal supplements are concerning for risk of impurities and lack of study of effects on breastfed infants. Nonhormonal and progestin-only contraceptives are preferred over combination oral contraceptives. Contrast for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is not concerning during lactation, but use of radiopharmaceuticals, such as iodine 131, can accumulate in the lactating breast and increase risk to the infant.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^115C8HRr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Available data from lactation studies indicate that oxycodone is present in breastmilk and that doses of less than 60 mg/day of the immediate-release formulation are unlikely to result in clinically relevant exposures in breastfed infants. A pharmacokinetics study utilizing opportunistic sampling of 76 lactating women receiving oxycodone immediate-release products for postpartum pain management showed that oxycodone concentrates in breastmilk with an average milk to plasma ratio of 3.2. The relative infant dose was low, approximately 1.3% of a weight-adjusted maternal dose (see Data).

In the same study, among the 70 infants exposed to oxycodone in breastmilk, no adverse events were attributed to oxycodone. However, based on known adverse effects in adults, infants should be monitored for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of the oxycodone on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for OXAYDO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OXAYDO or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to OXAYDO through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped or when breastfeeding is stopped.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and aspirin [^117RH6k7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk.

Salicylic acid has been detected in breast milk. Adverse effects on platelet function in the nursing infant exposed to aspirin in breast milk may be a potential risk. Furthermore, the risk of Reye's Syndrome caused by salicylate in breast milk is unknown.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Use of opioids for extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see ADVERSE REACTIONS].

Females

Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including aspirin, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including aspirin, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

Pediatric Use

Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Aspirin Tablets should not be administered to pediatric patients. Reye's Syndrome is a rare but serious disease which can follow flu or chicken pox in children and teenagers. While the cause of Reye's Syndrome is unknown, some reports claim aspirin (or salicylates) may increase the risk of developing this disease.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 21: breastfeeding in the setting of substance use and substance use disorder (revised 2023) [^111WshiR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Breastfeeding in substance-exposed mother–infant dyads notes that clinicians will commonly be tasked with making recommendations regarding breastfeeding in the context of nonprescribed substance use and SUD. Benefits include that breastfeeding is known to reduce the severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), such as decreasing the need for pharmacologic treatment and length of infant hospitalization, while risks among those actively using nonprescribed substances include reduced parental ability to respond to infant feeding cues and infant substance exposure through breast milk with potential acute toxicity, reduced breastfeeding ability, and potential alterations in neonatal brain development.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate (zohydro) [^112J4FLE]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Hydrocodone bitartrate administered orally to female rats at oral doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg/day during gestation and lactation resulted in pups which were noted as cold to touch and caused a reduction in fetal viability (increases in the number of stillborn pups and/or pups dying postpartum). The doses causing these effects were equivalent to approximately 1 and 2.4 times an adult human dose of 100 mg/day, on a mg/m2basis. Nursing was reduced in pups of mothers administered 25 mg/kg/day which correlated with decreased body weight/body weight gain and food consumption in male pups. Minimal maternal toxicity was evident at 25 mg/kg (decreased body weight).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with extended-release hydrocodone, including ZOHYDRO ER, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ZOHYDRO ER.

Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to ZOHYDRO ER through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

8.3 Females
and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility No effects on male fertility were observed with hydrocodone at doses equivalent to 10 times the human dose of 100 mg/day, however, decreases in the weight of male reproductive organs were observed in all treated groups at doses equivalent to 2.4 times the human dose of 100 mg/day and above. Reductions in female fertility indices were observed at doses of hydrocodone equivalent to 2 times the human dose of 100 mg/day and above. These changes are attributed to a hydrocodone-mediated decrease in prolactin levels in the rat. Unique to rodents, prolactin is required for normal estrous cycling and the effects on fertility observed in this study are most likely rodent-specific and not believed to be clinically relevant [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1143ST4p]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medications for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) have been associated with improved maternal outcomes and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 8). Previous recommendations have suggested that transmucosal buprenorphine (without naloxone) is preferred during pregnancy to avoid potential prenatal exposure to naloxone, especially if injected, and evidence on the safety of naloxone in pregnant persons remains limited. However, combination buprenorphine/naloxone products are frequently used, a systematic review did not find reports of serious maternal or neonatal outcomes associated with maternal buprenorphine/naloxone use, and experts have noted that combination products are likely to be safe and effective for pregnant persons when taken as prescribed. ACOG also recommends that if a person is stable on naltrexone before pregnancy, the decision regarding whether to continue naltrexone treatment during pregnancy should involve a careful discussion between the clinician and the patient, weighing the limited safety data on naltrexone with the potential risk for return to drug use with discontinuation of treatment. For persons receiving buprenorphine or methadone for opioid use disorder and considering breastfeeding, AAP recommends breastfeeding be supported if there has been no return to drug use for ≥ 90 days and there are no other contraindications, considered if there has been no return to drug use within 30–90 days, and discouraged if there is active substance use or has been a return to drug use within the last 30 days.

### Hydrocodone excretion into breast milk: the first two reported cases [^114wECWP]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hydrocodone is a narcotic that is widely used, often in nursing mothers. Although case reports suggest that hydrocodone in breast milk sometimes may be problematic for the breastfed infant, no reports exist on the amount of its excretion into breast milk. Two mothers who were taking an acetaminophen and hydrocodone combination product donated pumped milk for analysis of hydrocodone. Their infants received an estimated 3.1% and 3.7% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage, but the absolute hydrocodone dosages were 8.58 microg/kg per day and 3.07 microg/kg per day because of the differences in the dosages ingested by their mothers. Moderate dosages of hydrocodone appear acceptable during breastfeeding, but more data are needed to determine the maximum safe dosage for nursing mothers. Neonates and preterm infants may be more susceptible than older infants to adverse effects of hydrocodone and its metabolites in breast milk.

### Central nervous system depression of neonates breastfed by mothers receiving oxycodone for postpartum analgesia [^112csFVC]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To quantify the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) depression in neonates breastfed by mothers medicated with oxycodone as compared with neonates whose breastfeeding mothers used codeine or acetaminophen only.

Study Design

We retrospectively compared 3 cohorts in 533 breastfeeding mother-infant pairs exposed to oxycodone (n = 139), codeine (n = 210), or acetaminophen only (n = 184). Standardized questionnaires were administered to mothers during the postpartum period to identify maternal and neonatal health outcomes temporally related to analgesia exposure.

Results

Maternal exposure to oxycodone during breastfeeding was associated with a 20.1% rate of infant CNS depression (28/139) compared with 0.5% in the acetaminophen group (1/184; P < .0001; OR, 46.16; 95% CI, 6.2–344.2) and 16.7% in the codeine group (35/210; P > .05; OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.46–1.38). Mothers of neonates with symptoms in the oxycodone and codeine cohorts took significantly higher doses of medication compared with mothers of infants with no symptoms in the same cohorts (P = .0005 oxycodone; median, 0.4 mg/kg/day; range, 0.03–4.06 mg/kg/day versus median, 0.15 mg/kg/day; range, 0.02–2.25 mg/kg/day; codeine P < .001; median, 1.4 mg/kg/day; range, 0.7–10.5 mg/kg/day versus 0.9 mg/kg/day; range, 0.18–5.8 mg/kg/day). Mothers were significantly more likely to experience sedative adverse effects from oxycodone as compared with codeine (P < .0001; OR, 17.62; 95% CI, 9.95–31.21).

Conclusion

Oxycodone is not a safer alternative to codeine in breastfed infants.

### Extent of medication use in breastfeeding women [^113AynmQ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The types of and extent to which medications are used by breastfeeding women have not been thoroughly investigated in the United States. The relationship between medication use during pregnancy and lactation has also been insufficiently investigated.

Methods

A survey was given to a cohort of women who delivered their babies at a single center. The participants were asked to record the medications they had taken during pregnancy and subsequently were contacted each month during lactation to determine what medications they had taken.

Results

Breastfeeding women took significantly more medications per month than pregnant women (p < 0.0001). Women who were breastfeeding also took prescription medications more frequently than women who were pregnant (p < 0.0001). The number of medications taken per month showed no trend throughout the course of breastfeeding. The medications most often used by breastfeeding women were multivitamins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, progestins, antimicrobials, and decongestants. Over a third of the subjects took medications rated possibly or probably unsafe, or had unknown safety.

Conclusion

The women in this study took more prescription and nonprescription medications while breastfeeding than they did during pregnancy. Many of the medications taken have unknown safety for the breastfed infant. The results of this study should direct further research toward determining the safety of medications commonly used during lactation and to promote the labeling of these medications.

### ABM clinical protocol # 15: analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, revised 2017 [^1178L96A]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #15 — postoperative guidance states that mothers with term, healthy children may breastfeed as soon as they are awake in the recovery room, and for mothers who are not allowed in the recovery room, a pump or assistance with hand expression should be available for mothers immediately after surgery. For vulnerable infants who may need a brief interruption from breastfeeding postoperatively, milk should be expressed as soon as the mother is awake; the milk does not necessarily need to be discarded, it can be frozen for use when the child is at lower risk in the future, or used diluted with other breast milk not containing an anesthetic (expressed either before or 1 day after the procedure). The mother should be encouraged to express during the interruption from breastfeeding at least as often as she would normally breastfeed to maintain supply (around every 2–4 hours depending on the child's age). Opioids should be used judiciously, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period of time that provides adequate analgesia, and the breastfed child should be cared for and observed by an adult other than the mother, when opioids are used.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1163nNzW]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Special populations — pregnant and postpartum women with opioid use disorder — postpartum care and breastfeeding: The postpartum period can be a vulnerable time for women with opioid use disorder and research suggests that women are more likely to relapse during this time than during pregnancy. Women should routinely be screened for postpartum depression and providers should regularly evaluate the patient's needs for different or additional psychosocial treatments and support services. Mothers receiving methadone or buprenorphine (including both the monoproduct and combination product) for the treatment of opioid use disorders should be encouraged to breastfeed in the absence of other contraindications. In a study of buprenorphine and breastfeeding, it was shown that the amount of buprenorphine metabolites secreted in breast milk are so low that they pose little risk to breastfeeding infants. Insufficient research exists on the risks (if any) of naltrexone for breastfeeding infants. There is limited data indicating that naltrexone is minimally excreted into breastmilk. Consider monitoring the infant for exposure. Specialty advice should be sought for women with concomitant physical illnesses or other substance use disorders. Contraindications to breastfeeding include HIV-positive mothers. In addition, precautions and tailored advice are necessary for mothers who use alcohol, cocaine or amphetamine-type drugs.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and homatropine methylbromide [^115EJM8m]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid while taking Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup)?

Avoid driving a car or operating machinery during treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup). Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup) can cause you to be drowsy, slow your thinking and motor skills, and affect your vision.
Do not drink alcohol during treatment with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup). Drinking alcohol can increase your chances of having serious side effects.

Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup) if you:

are pregnant. Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup) during pregnancy can cause withdrawal symptoms in your newborn baby that could be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.
are breastfeeding. Use of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup) while breastfeeding can cause severe breathing problems (respiratory depression) in your breastfed infant that could be life-threatening.
take a medicine called a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Avoid taking an MAOI within 14 days after you stop taking Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup). Avoid starting Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Homatropine Methylbromide oral solution (Syrup) if you stopped taking an MAOI in the last 14 days.

Nursing Mothers:

Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance
of its effects on nursing infants is not known. It is not known whether
hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human
milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing
infants from hydrocodone and acetaminophen, a decision should be made whether to
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the
importance of the drug to the mother.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate [^117J9HEN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions. Lactation studies have not been conducted with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets gradually forms a viscous hydrogel (i.e., a gelatinous mass) when exposed to water or other fluids. Pediatric patients may be at increased risk of esophageal obstruction, dysphagia, and choking because of a smaller gastrointestinal lumen if they ingest hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 21: breastfeeding in the setting of substance use and substance use disorder (revised 2023) [^114KA5ah]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #21 — future research priorities for breastfeeding in the setting of substance exposure enumerate targeted needs. The following areas of research are suggested to enhance future evidence for breastfeeding guidance in substance-exposed mother–infant dyads: further studies on the pharmacokinetics and safety of opioids, including long-term lactation data and studies of newer medications used to treat OUD such as extended-release buprenorphine formulations; investigation of the pharmacokinetics and safety of medications used for the treatment of AUD and nicotine use disorder including naltrexone, acamprosate, and nicotine replacement treatments; investigation of the pharmacokinetics and safety of breastfeeding in the setting of nonprescribed sedative-hypnotics and stimulant use; and additional studies of infant safety and outcomes after exposure to various amounts of cannabis via the breast milk. Additional listed priorities are: in vitro studies using human breast milk samples to better understand the properties of nonprescribed substances such as cocaine and methamphetamines in a breast milk medium; studies examining breast milk exposure in the setting of polysubstance use to determine any differences in pharmacokinetics and infant adverse effects; appropriately powered and designed studies that examine the long-term outcomes of infants exposed to nonprescribed substances via breast milk; investigation of the effect of breastfeeding on SUD outcomes and exploration of the possible biochemical and behavioral mechanisms by which breastfeeding may impact recovery; developing and testing of interventions to support breastfeeding dyads with maternal SUD; and development of point of care tests to assess exposures in breast milk.

### Hydromorphone hydrochloride [^114mhyKo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnant rats were treated with hydromorphone hydrochloride from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 21 via oral gavage doses of 1.75, 3.5, or 7 mg/kg/day (0.5, 1.1, or 2.1 times the HDD of 32 mg/day based on body surface area, respectively). Reduced pup weights were noted at 1.1 and 2.1 times the human daily dose of 32 mg/day and increased pup deaths, delayed ear opening, reduced auditory startle reflex, and reduced open-field activity were also noted at 2.1 times the HDD. Maternal toxicity was noted in all treatment groups (reduced food consumption and body weights in all groups) and decreased maternal care in the high dose group.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including excess sedation and respiratory depression in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets. Low concentrations of hydromorphone have been detected in human milk in clinical trials. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfeeding infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped. Nursing should not be undertaken while a patient is receiving hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets since hydromorphone is excreted in the milk.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to hydromorphone hydrochloride extended-release tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

### Benzhydrocodone and acetaminophen (Apadaz) [^1116Lk6n]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions. There is potential for sedation and respiratory depression resulting from infant exposure to hydrocodone and its metabolites in breast milk.

Acetaminophen is present in human milk in small quantities after oral administration. Based on data from more than 15 nursing mothers, the calculated infant daily dose of acetaminophen is approximately 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. There is one well-documented report of a rash in a breastfed infant that resolved when the mother stopped acetaminophen use and recurred when she resumed acetaminophen use.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for APADAZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from APADAZ or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to APADAZ through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Use of opioids for an extended period of time may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Published animal studies report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface area comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, reduced fertility, and reduced implantation sites in females given the same doses. Additional published animal studies indicate that acetaminophen exposure in utero adversely impacts reproductive capacity of both male and female offspring at clinically relevant exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.

### Breastfeeding on injectable opioid agonist therapy: a case report [^111x6G1Y]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Informed choice of infant feeding is supported at FIR, with monitoring of infants exposed to high-dose maternal hydromorphone. It should be noted that this infant required a short amount of time in the NICU (71 hours). Neonatal intensive care unit bed capacity for infants may be a limitation. The feasibility of infant monitoring in the NICU or cardiac monitoring outside of the NICU should be further investigated.

This is the first known case of an individual breastfeeding on iOAT, reporting positive infant and maternal health and social outcomes. This case illustrates the ability to support individuals to effectively stabilize from severe IVDU, while also safely meeting the individual's goals to bond with and breastfeed their infant. Person-centered care can be expanded to meet the goals of individuals and their families. Future research on breastfeeding while on iOAT is required to support clinical decision making and inform clinical practice guidelines.
