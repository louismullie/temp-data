## Question

tubal ligation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of tubal ligation, covering definition, indications, techniques, effectiveness, risks, cancer implications, alternatives, special populations, and counseling points. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining tubal ligation and its core mechanism. Then, I should verify indications and pre-procedure counseling. Next, I will review surgical techniques and anesthesia considerations. After that, I need to check effectiveness and failure rates. I will then examine risks and complications, including ectopic pregnancy and post-tubal ligation syndrome. I should confirm cancer risk implications, especially ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers, and weigh salpingectomy. Then, I will compare alternatives such as vasectomy and LARC. I need to consider special populations, including high-risk genetics, postpartum, and transgender patients. Finally, I will synthesize counseling and consent elements and close with a concise clinical summary anchored to guidelines and key studies [^1155FGV3] [^1118HHog].

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanism. Tubal ligation is a surgical procedure that interrupts the patency of the fallopian tubes to prevent ovum transport and fertilization, thereby providing permanent contraception; it does not directly alter ovarian hormone production, so menstrual cycles and hormone levels are generally unaffected, which I should double-check against guideline statements and large cohort data on menopausal timing and symptoms [^1155FGV3] [^115cr2mc] [^113zGCyj].

> I need to ensure indications and counseling are framed correctly. The primary indication is a request for permanent contraception after shared decision-making that emphasizes permanence, potential regret, and the need for alternative options; counseling should document understanding that reversal is possible but complex, with success declining with age and tubal length, and that ectopic pregnancy risk persists if failure occurs; I should confirm that major guidelines endorse no absolute medical contraindications to permanent contraception, with individualized risk assessment for surgical candidates [^1155FGV3] [^1118HHog] [^115jVz3S] [^115HxeK1].

> Next, I should review techniques and anesthesia. Interval options include laparoscopic tubal interruption (clips, rings, electrocautery), bilateral salpingectomy, and hysteroscopic tubal occlusion; postpartum approaches include mini-laparotomy or salpingectomy at cesarean or via mini-lap within 48 hours; anesthesia is individualized, with neuraxial techniques often preferred postpartum when feasible, and aspiration prophylaxis considered; I should verify that salpingectomy is increasingly favored for ovarian cancer risk reduction where appropriate [^112SmzYz] [^116PUGkZ] [^115e1iG6] [^113Krfn3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about effectiveness without checking real-world data. Historically, perfect-use failure is very low, but typical-use failure in contemporary cohorts is higher than classical trials; in California Medicaid data, 1-year pregnancy rates after tubal ligation were around 2.6%, whereas levonorgestrel IUC was about 2.4% and copper IUC about 3.0%, and long-term CREST data show a 10-year cumulative failure near 1.3%; I should emphasize that when pregnancy occurs, the risk of ectopic is high, reinforcing the need for early evaluation of pregnancy symptoms [^116SGd4o] [^115U2N3H] [^115HxeK1].

> I will now examine risks and complications. Surgical risks include anesthesia reactions, bleeding, infection, and rare organ injury; postpartum tubal ligation carries aspiration risk and neuraxial failure risk that increases with time since delivery; I should confirm that large claims analyses show higher 30-day complication rates with tubal ligation than with IUC, including infection and hemorrhage, and that hysterectomy is sometimes performed concurrently, which may inflate apparent complication rates; regarding post-tubal ligation syndrome, contemporary evidence does not support a biologically coherent syndrome of menstrual abnormalities attributable to tubal ligation itself, though some women report more menopausal symptoms without earlier menopause onset [^1173w3jg] [^116PUGkZ] [^112ia7Sk] [^113Z9RA7] [^115cr2mc] [^113zGCyj].

> Let me consider cancer implications carefully. Multiple large cohorts show tubal ligation is associated with a modest reduction in ovarian cancer risk, with the Million Women Study showing about a 20% reduction and the Nurses' Health Studies showing a similar magnitude, stronger for nonserous histologies and when performed before age 35; importantly, risk reductions extend to peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers, consistent with a shared origin model; in BRCA1 carriers, tubal ligation confers a larger risk reduction, whereas evidence is weaker in BRCA2; salpingectomy likely provides greater risk reduction than tubal interruption, and opportunistic salpingectomy is increasingly recommended when feasible, though prospective outcome data are still maturing [^111mKLhd] [^112n4eUX] [^112ZMxSM] [^113Krfn3] [^117DXsrv].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative role of salpingectomy versus tubal ligation. Systematic reviews and cost-effectiveness analyses suggest salpingectomy is as safe as tubal ligation for sterilization and may be preferred for ovarian cancer risk reduction; at cesarean delivery, opportunistic salpingectomy can be cost-effective compared with tubal ligation, though results are sensitive to assumptions about complication rates and cancer risk reduction; real-world cohorts suggest similar or lower perioperative complications with salpingectomy at cesarean, supporting its safety in experienced hands [^112orB8x] [^115TaAEc] [^113wgtqw].

> I should double-check alternatives and their trade-offs. Vasectomy is less invasive, typically performed under local anesthesia, has lower failure and complication rates than tubal ligation, and is more cost-effective; long-acting reversible contraception, particularly levonorgestrel IUC, has comparable or lower 1-year failure and fewer 30-day complications than tubal ligation in Medicaid cohorts, with less pelvic pain 6–12 months post-procedure; counseling should explicitly compare these options and align with patient preferences and medical comorbidity [^1136a8y3] [^116SGd4o] [^115P6Nfm].

> Next, I should review special populations. For women with BRCA1 mutations, tubal ligation reduces ovarian cancer risk and can be considered after childbearing, though risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy is under study; for postpartum patients, tubal ligation or salpingectomy can be performed safely, but timing and anesthesia must be individualized, and neuraxial techniques are often preferred; for transgender and gender-diverse patients assigned female at birth, tubal sterilization is an effective option and should be integrated with fertility preservation and gender-affirming plans; in congenital heart disease, tubal ligation is generally safe, but complex disease or pulmonary hypertension may elevate surgical risk, necessitating individualized planning and consideration of vasectomy or LARC [^112ZMxSM] [^113Krfn3] [^116PUGkZ] [^113xwWk8] [^112DZWr6].

> I need to ensure counseling and consent are comprehensive. Counseling must confirm understanding of permanence, discuss failure and ectopic risk, review procedural and anesthesia risks, and document alternatives including vasectomy and LARC; informed consent should be explicit, voluntary, and free of coercion, with particular attention to younger patients and those without children given higher regret rates; policies requiring a mandatory IUD trial before sterilization are ethically contested and not universally endorsed; documentation should capture reproductive goals, prior contraceptive use, and any concurrent procedures planned [^1155FGV3] [^112CidW4] [^113kEBaZ] [^1154Lwnz].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a clinical bottom line. Tubal ligation remains a highly effective permanent contraceptive method with a low but real failure rate and nontrivial surgical risks; it confers a modest reduction in ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer risk, with stronger evidence in BRCA1 carriers; salpingectomy is an increasingly attractive alternative when feasible, offering similar or better safety in experienced hands and potentially greater cancer risk reduction; compared with tubal ligation, vasectomy and LARC can achieve comparable or better effectiveness with fewer complications, so shared decision-making should prioritize patient values, comorbidity, and access; counseling must be explicit about permanence, failure, ectopic risk, and alternatives, and systems should minimize barriers to timely postpartum sterilization when requested [^1155FGV3] [^111mKLhd] [^112orB8x] [^116SGd4o] [^1136a8y3] [^1156vzyo].

---

Tubal ligation is a **permanent contraception** method that blocks the Fallopian tubes to prevent fertilization, with a failure rate of about 0.5% in the first year and 0.7–3.1% over 10 years [^115U2N3H]. It does not affect hormone levels or menstrual cycles [^112jkdG3] [^113Z9RA7] and is typically performed via laparoscopy, mini-laparotomy, or hysteroscopy [^112CidW4]. The main risks are ectopic pregnancy, procedural complications, and rare sterilization failure; **salpingectomy is increasingly recommended** for added ovarian cancer risk reduction [^113Krfn3] [^112orB8x]. Counseling should cover permanence, alternatives, and the potential for regret, especially in younger women [^115HxeK1] [^115fdRNE].

---

## Indications and patient selection

Tubal ligation is indicated for women who desire **permanent contraception** after completing their families or for medical reasons such as contraindications to other contraceptive methods [^1155FGV3]. Patient selection should involve **careful counseling** regarding the permanence of the procedure, potential risks, and alternatives, including long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and vasectomy [^1118HHog] [^112SmzYz].

---

## Surgical techniques

Several **surgical techniques** are used for tubal ligation, including:

- **Laparoscopic tubal ligation**: Minimally invasive approach using clips, rings, or electrocautery to occlude the Fallopian tubes [^notfound].
- **Mini-laparotomy**: Small incision approach, often used in resource-limited settings or postpartum settings [^111YGXn8].
- **Hysteroscopic sterilization**: Non-surgical approach using devices such as Essure to occlude the Fallopian tubes transcervically [^115U2N3H].

Each technique has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice depends on patient factors, clinical expertise, and available resources [^112SmzYz].

---

## Effectiveness and failure rates

Tubal ligation is **highly effective**, with a failure rate of approximately 0.5% in the first year following the procedure [^notfound]. The cumulative failure rate over 10 years ranges from 0.7% to 3.1%, depending on the technique used and patient factors such as age at the time of sterilization [^notfound]. Notably, when pregnancy occurs after tubal ligation, the risk of ectopic pregnancy is significantly increased, accounting for approximately one-third of pregnancies following sterilization failure [^notfound].

---

## Risks and complications

While tubal ligation is generally safe, potential **risks and complications** include:

- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Increased risk if sterilization fails [^115HxeK1].
- **Procedural complications**: Bleeding, infection, anesthesia-related risks, and damage to surrounding organs [^1173w3jg].
- **Sterilization failure**: Rare, but possible, necessitating ongoing contraceptive counseling [^115U2N3H].

---

## Impact on menstrual cycle and hormonal balance

Tubal ligation **does not significantly affect** menstrual cycles or hormonal balance, as it does not alter ovarian hormone production [^112jkdG3]. Some women may report changes in menstrual patterns, but these are generally attributed to factors such as age, cessation of hormonal contraception, or underlying gynecological conditions rather than the procedure itself [^notfound].

---

## Reversibility and fertility outcomes

Tubal ligation is intended to be **permanent**, but reversal procedures (tubal reanastomosis) exist. Success rates vary depending on factors such as age, the method of sterilization, and the length of remaining Fallopian tube segments. Overall, pregnancy rates after reversal range from 40% to 85%, with higher success rates observed in younger women and those with longer remaining tubal segments [^115jVz3S].

---

## Psychological and social considerations

Psychological and social factors, including **regret**, are important considerations in tubal ligation. Regret is more common among women sterilized at younger ages, those with fewer children, or those undergoing sterilization during times of personal crisis. Comprehensive counseling and informed consent are essential to minimize regret and ensure patient satisfaction [^112SmzYz] [^115fdRNE].

---

## Comparison with other contraceptive methods

Tubal ligation is often compared with other contraceptive methods, including **LARC** (intrauterine devices and implants) and **vasectomy**. LARC methods have comparable effectiveness to tubal ligation but are **reversible** and associated with fewer procedural risks. Vasectomy, a permanent contraception method for men, is less invasive, associated with fewer complications, and is generally more cost-effective than tubal ligation [^111aizzr] [^1136a8y3].

---

## Recent advancements and controversies

Recent advancements include the increasing use of **salpingectomy** (removal of the Fallopian tubes) instead of traditional tubal ligation, primarily to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that many ovarian cancers originate in the Fallopian tubes, making salpingectomy a potentially more effective cancer-prevention strategy [^113Krfn3] [^113Kuags]. However, this approach requires further research and careful patient counseling regarding its benefits and risks [^113Krfn3] [^115TaAEc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of **informed consent**, thorough counseling, and shared decision-making in tubal ligation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society of Family Planning provide detailed recommendations on patient selection, counseling, and procedural considerations, including the use of salpingectomy in appropriate clinical contexts [^112SmzYz] [^1156vzyo].

---

Tubal ligation is a **highly effective permanent contraception method** with a low failure rate and minimal impact on hormonal balance. It carries risks such as ectopic pregnancy and procedural complications, and counseling should address permanence, alternatives, and potential regret. Recent trends favor salpingectomy for ovarian cancer risk reduction, but further research is needed.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^112i5Hho]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Background:

Tubal ligation is known to be associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer risk. Associations with breast, endometrial and cervical cancers have been suggested. We investigated associations for 26 site-specific cancers in a large UK cohort.

Methods:

Study participants completed a questionnaire on reproductive and lifestyle factors in 1996–2001, and were followed for cancer and death via national registries. Using Cox regression models, we estimated adjusted relative risks (RRs) for 26 site-specific cancers among women with vs without tubal ligation.

Results:

In 1 278 783 women without previous cancer, 167 430 incident cancers accrued during 13.8 years' follow-up. Significantly reduced risks were found in women with tubal ligation for cancers of the ovary (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76–0.85; P < 0.001; n = 8035), peritoneum (RR = 0.81, 0.66–0.98; P = 0.03; n = 730), and fallopian tube (RR = 0.60, 0.37–0.96; P = 0.04; n = 168). No significant associations were found for endometrial, breast, or cervical cancers.

Conclusions:

The reduced risks of ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are consistent with hypotheses of a common origin for many tumours at these sites, and with the suggestion that tubal ligation blocks cells, carcinogens or other agents from reaching the ovary, fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavity.

### Salpingectomy vs tubal ligation for sterilization: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112orB8x]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

After strong evidence and major organizations recommending salpingectomy over tubal ligation, we sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the intraoperative attributes and complication rates associated with these 2 procedures.

Data Sources

We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and clinical trials registries without time or language restrictions. The search was conducted in February 2020. Database searches revealed 74 potential studies, of which 11 were examined at the full-text level. Of these, 6 studies were included in the qualitative analysis and 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials comparing salpingectomy with tubal ligation in women seeking sterilization. We included studies that also had at least 1 outcome listed in the population/patient problem, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time. Articles were excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria or if data were not reported and the authors did not respond to inquiries.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Abstracts and full-text articles were assessed by 2 authors independently using the blinded coding assignment function or EPPI-Reviewer 4. Conflicting selections were resolved by consensus. The quality of included studies was determined using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study; disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Results

There were few differences between the procedures, with no differences in most important clinical outcomes (antimüllerian hormone, blood loss, length of hospital stay, pre- or postoperative complications, or wound infections). A single study reported a reduced rate of pregnancies with salpingectomy (risk ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.02), but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.05).

Conclusion

We conclude from these data that salpingectomy is as safe and efficacious as tubal ligation for sterilization and may be preferred, where appropriate, to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.

Significantly reduced risks were found in women with tubal ligation for cancers of the ovary (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76–0.85; P < 0.001; n = 8035), peritoneum (RR = 0.81, 0.66–0.98; P = 0.03; n = 730), and fallopian tube (RR = 0.60, 0.37–0.96; P = 0.04; n = 168). No significant associations were found for endometrial, breast, or cervical cancers.

Conclusions

The reduced risks of ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are consistent with hypotheses of a common origin for many tumours at these sites, and with the suggestion that tubal ligation blocks cells, carcinogens or other agents from reaching the ovary, fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavity.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^114T9ASj]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

There have been reports on possible relationships between tubal ligation and other cancers, including possible reductions in risk of colorectal and stomach cancer, and increased risks of thyroid cancer and lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies. We did not replicate any of these findings.

The large size of the cohort, the individual information on possible confounding factors, and the complete and long follow-up, provided reliable estimates of risks associated with tubal ligation for 26 specific cancer sites, even relatively uncommon ones. We found no association between tubal ligation and the risk of cancers of the endometrium, breast, or cervix. By contrast, tubal ligation is associated with a clear reduction in risk of ovarian cancer, a reduction of similar magnitude of peritoneal cancer, and a reduction of fallopian tube cancer. That tubal ligation is associated with a reduced risk of cancers of the ovary, peritoneum and fallopian tube, but not of other hormonally-related cancers, is consistent with the hypothesis that many of the cancers at these sites have a shared origin in the fallopian tube, and that tubal ligation reduces cancer risk by acting as a barrier to cells, carcinogens or other agents reaching the ovary and peritoneal cavity, rather than by affecting hormone levels.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^114GReYw]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the largest and most comprehensive analysis so far of the association between tubal ligation and subsequent risk of cancer. We found that tubal ligation was significantly associated with reduced risks of ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancers, and an increased risk of anal cancer, but was not associated with breast, endometrial or cervical cancer, as had been suggested by others.

The reduction in ovarian cancer risk has been reported by others. We previously reported significant heterogeneity by histological type of ovarian cancer, finding that tubal ligation was associated with a modest reduction of serous tumours overall (RR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.92), and about a 20% reduction in risk of high-grade serous carcinoma, and almost a halving of risk of endometrioid and clear cell ovarian tumours. These findings are consistent with hypotheses regarding possible different origins of the ovarian cancer histotypes, and that many cases of high-grade serous ovarian cancer may arise from precursor lesions within the fallopian tubes, while some endometrioid and clear cell tumours may develop from endometriosis. Although the precise mechanism by which tubal ligation reduces the risk of ovarian cancer is unclear, part of the explanation could be that it acts as a physical barrier to pro-cancerous substances passing through the fallopian tubes to the ovaries (whether endometriosis, fallopian tube epithelial cells, infectious agents, or exogenous carcinogens).

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^111mKLhd]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Results

The study population included 1 278 783 women without prior cancer, average age 56.1 (s.d. 4.9) at recruitment, 23% of whom reported a tubal ligation, at an average age of 34.5 (s.d. 5.3). Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the cohort. A total of 167 430 cancers accrued, after a mean follow-up of 13.8 years (s.d. 3.4). The average age at cancer diagnosis was 65.6 years (s.d. 6.5). There was no association between tubal ligation and risk of all cancers combined (RR = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98–1.01).

Figure 1 displays adjusted RRs and 95% CIs of 26 site- or type-specific cancers among women with vs without tubal ligation. There was a 20% reduction for ovarian cancer risk (RR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.76–0.85; P < 0.001) and a reduction of similar magnitude for peritoneal cancers (RR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66–0.98; P = 0.03) (ICD-10 code C48, which includes both peritoneal and retroperitoneal cancers). We found a large reduction in risk of cancers of the fallopian tube, but confidence intervals were wide (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37–0.96, P = 0.04).

We also found increased risk of anal cancer (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11–1.63; P = 0.002), as previously reported.

The small increase in risk of lung cancer (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05–1.13) may well be due to residual confounding from smoking — as women with tubal ligation were much more likely to be current smokers, and to smoke more cigarettes per day, than women without tubal ligation. There was no association between tubal ligation and lung cancer risk among never-smokers (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.91–1.19).

There were no significant associations between tubal ligation and risk of cancers at the other sites, including cancers of the endometrium, cervix, breast and colorectum.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^113zGCyj]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Women who had a tubal ligation were ∼10% more likely to report menopausal symptoms. Tubal ligation did not alter menopausal age or overall breast cancer risk. We observed a decreased risk of ER+/PR+ invasive breast cancer associated with tubal ligation among women who also had a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy.

In controlled studies, the majority report a higher prevalence of hot flashes among women with prior tubal ligation. A study of 3650 postmenopausal women in the United Kingdom reported a 38% increase (95% CI: 1.02–1.87) in the odds of menopause before the age of 49 years among women who reported tubal ligation; we did not observe an association between tubal ligation and menopausal age.

Our analysis is one of few to evaluate breast cancer risk according to ER/PR status or in situ disease. Previous studies were often unable to account for subsequent hysterectomy, which probably contributes to heterogeneity between reports. In our data, decreased breast cancer risk after tubal ligation appeared largely limited to women who also underwent bilateral oophorectomy and to hormonally responsive disease.

Strengths include our large sample and detailed reproductive and lifestyle information. We reconstructed life events from the age of 30 years to interview and used time-varying exposures. Limitations include potential misclassification based on self-reported information. However, in previous studies, hysterectomy and oophorectomy status have been reliably reported. All exposure information was reported before diagnosis and was therefore unlikely to bias our results. Subgroup analyses of incident breast cancers were constrained by small numbers, and diagnoses not reported by participants would not have been captured. Our results were robust to covariate selection; however, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding.

In our study, women who had a tubal ligation were more likely to report menopausal symptoms; however, tubal ligation alone did not influence menopausal age or breast cancer risk.

### Risk of ovarian cancer after salpingectomy and tubal ligation: prospects on histology and time since the procedure [^117DXsrv]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Recent theories propose that most epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), depending on histological type, originate from other gynecological tissues and involve the ovary secondarily. According to these theories, any protective effect of salpingectomy and tubal ligation may vary by histological type. The study aim was to examine the association between salpingectomy and tubal ligation, respectively, and risk of EOC, with a focus on associations specific for histological types.

Methods

We identified EOC cases and matching controls in national registries and gathered information on surgical procedures and potential confounders. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of EOC related to salpingectomy and tubal ligation, respectively, overall and stratified by histological type. Furthermore, we investigated the association according to timing of the procedures.

Results

Our study comprised 16,822 EOC cases. Each case was matched with 40 controls. There was an overall EOC risk reduction after unilateral (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60–0.87) and bilateral salpingectomy (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.31–0.67). A slight risk reduction was seen among women with previous tubal ligation (OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83–0.99). For salpingectomy, the risk reduction increased with increasing time since the surgical procedure and was only present among women younger than 50 years at salpingectomy. Unilateral and bilateral salpingectomy was associated with a risk reduction for most histological types.

Conclusion

The association between previous salpingectomy and reduced risk of several histological subtypes of EOC supports the suggested theories about the site of origin of EOC and may be of clinical importance.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^116cdbV4]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Few other studies have reported on the association between tubal ligation and risk of peritoneal cancer, and they have tended to be limited by small numbers of cases. Our study included 730 cases of peritoneal cancer; two retrospective studies have reported their findings — one study including 62 cases found no association; and another including 22 cases reported a reduced risk.

We believe that this is the first study to report that tubal ligation is associated with a significant reduction in risk of fallopian tube cancer.

Our finding that tubal ligation is associated with a reduction in risk of ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers perhaps reflects their histological and clinical similarity, and possible similar site of origin. The majority of the peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers with specified histology were serous carcinomas, which is also the most common histotype of ovarian cancer. There is increasing evidence from histological, molecular and genetics studies that many high-grade serous carcinomas found in the ovary or peritoneum may have originated from precursor lesions in the fallopian tube (reviewed in).

As the majority of the putative precursor lesions for high-grade serous cancers are found within the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, adjacent to the ovary, it is perhaps surprising that tubal ligation (which normally involves surgery to the mid-portion of the tube) should reduce the risk of such tumours. It may be that, historically, some surgical sterilisation procedures involved cutting and removing a portion of the fallopian tube, rather than simply clipping the tube (as is now more common). Alternatively, it may be that surgery causes local vascular changes with consequent effects on the tubal epithelium. One of the limitations of our study is that we do not have information on the type of surgical procedure performed, and thus are unable to explore possible differences in association between different surgical techniques.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^117Sx3pP]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

For endometrial cancer, a reduced risk associated with tubal ligation was reported in a Danish cohort, but we and others have not replicated this association. One group of investigators reported that tubal ligation was associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer, but again, neither other findings nor ours replicated this.

Reports of the relationship between tubal ligation and breast cancer risk have been varied, including suggestions of either a reduced or increased risk, although the majority of studies reported no significant association, consistent with our findings.

We have previously reported in detail on the risk factors for anal cancer in the Million Women Study; factors associated with an increased risk of anal cancer included tubal ligation, nulliparity, smoking, past use of the oral contraceptive pill, and not living with a partner. The strongest association was with a history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (RR = 4.03, 95% CI: 2.59–6.28), reflecting the importance of high-risk strains of human papilloma virus as causative agents of both cervical and anal cancers. It is unclear why tubal ligation should be associated with an increased risk of anal cancer, and it may be that this apparent association reflects confounding by sexual behaviour and exposure to human papilloma virus. For example, as tubal ligation is usually performed for permanent contraception, it is likely to be more common among women who are sexually active, and who thus may be more likely to be exposed to sexually-transmitted infections, such as human papilloma virus, and the consequent increased risk of anal cancer.

### Tubal ligation and incidence of 26 site-specific cancers in the million women study [^113AEafw]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Tubal ligation (female sterilisation) is known to be associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. Reports of associations with other cancers have varied. In particular, several investigators have described associations with breast, endometrial, cervical and anal cancers. We report here the associations between tubal ligation and risk of 26 site-specific cancers in a large cohort of UK women.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^113XGHa8]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background:

Local inflammation after tubal ligation may affect ovarian function and breast cancer risk.

Methods:

We analysed tubal ligation, menopausal characteristics, and breast cancer risk in the Sister Study cohort (N = 50 884 women).

Results:

Tubal ligation was associated with hot flashes (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06–1.12) but not menopausal age (HR 0.99; 95% CI: 0.96–1.02). Tubal ligation did not have an impact on breast cancer overall (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85–1.06), but had a suggested inverse relation with oestrogen receptor+/progesterone receptor+ invasive tumours (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70–1.01), possibly because of subsequent hysterectomy/bilateral oophorectomy.

Conclusion:

Tubal ligation does not influence overall breast cancer risk.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^115KHyjb]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Breast cancer

During 203 141 person-years (mean = 4.0 years), 1646 incident breast cancers were reported (1079 invasive, 422 in situ, 145 undefined). We observed no overall association between breast cancer and tubal ligation (HR 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85–1.06), or by timing of tubal ligation or subsequent gynaecologic surgery (Table 3).

Oestrogen receptor/PR status was available for 95% of invasive breast tumours. The HR for ER+/PR+ invasive disease after tubal ligation was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70–1.01). Compared with women who reported no tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, those who reported tubal ligation and hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy had a 42% decreased risk of ER+/PR+ invasive breast cancer (HR = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38–0.89). Associations with ER+/PR+ invasive tumours were unchanged by adjustment for postmenopausal hormones (data not shown). Tubal ligation was not associated with ER−/PR− invasive breast cancer.

We observed an increased risk of in situ breast cancer associated with tubal ligation within the past 10 years (HR 2.12; 95% CI: 1.20–3.73). Among women who reported having a screening mammogram within 12 months of enrolment, this association was no longer statistically significant (HR 1.87; 95% CI: 0.96–3.62; Supplementary Table).

### Consent-GPT: is it ethical to delegate procedural consent to conversational AI? [^113nX5ri]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

What is tubal ligation?

Tubal ligation, often referred to as 'getting your tubes tied', is a surgical procedure performed for the purpose of permanent female sterilisation. During the procedure, your fallopian tubes are either blocked, tied, or cut to prevent the eggs from reaching the uterus for fertilisation with sperm.

Why tubal ligation?

As you already have three children, you may choose tubal ligation if you are certain that you don't want to have more children in the future. It is a permanent form of birth control and is quite effective, with a less than 1% failure rate.

What does the procedure involve?

Tubal ligation is usually performed as a laparoscopic surgery. It involves making a small incision in your abdomen through which a thin, flexible instrument called a laparoscope is inserted. Your fallopian tubes are then accessed and blocked, tied or cut.

Risks of the procedure

Although tubal ligation is a low-risk procedure, especially for someone with no past medical history like you, it is important to be aware of potential complications, which may include:

Reaction to anaesthesia.
Infection.
Bleeding.
Damage to surrounding organs.
Failure leading to an unintended pregnancy.
Posttubal ligation syndrome (though it is controversial and not recognised by all healthcare providers).

Effect on menstruation and hormone levels

Tubal ligation won't affect your menstrual cycle or hormone levels. It doesn't induce menopause or alter the production of female hormones.

Alternatives

There are other forms of permanent birth control such as male sterilisation (vasectomy) and non-permanent ones like hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices and barrier methods. It is important to discuss these options with your healthcare provider.

### Consent-GPT: is it ethical to delegate procedural consent to conversational AI? [^114P9GQC]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Consent

It is essential to understand that tubal ligation is a permanent method of birth control and should be considered irreversible. By giving your consent, you acknowledge that you understand the procedure, its risks, benefits and alternatives.

Please discuss with your healthcare provider and take all the time you need before making a decision. Once you're ready, you may proceed with the consent process.

Remember, it's your body and your choice. Make sure you feel comfortable with your decision. Is there anything else you'd like to know about tubal ligation?

Box 2
Proof-of-concept consent conversation for tubal ligation between Jane and Consent-GPT

Jane: I'm not sure if I really want to go through with the operation, it sounds like it's quite invasive and carries lots of risks. But I don't want to upset my partner.

Consent-GPT: Your concerns are perfectly valid, and it's important to remember that any medical decision, including a decision about tubal ligation, should be made with full consideration of your own feelings, comfort, and well-being. This decision should be primarily about you, not about anyone else, including your partner.

You have every right to question the need for any medical procedure, particularly a permanent one like tubal ligation. While it is generally a safe procedure, like all surgeries, it does carry some risks, as we've discussed.

Before making any decision, it might be helpful to have a thorough discussion with your partner about this. Understand each other's perspective, fears, and expectations. If you feel hesitant about the procedure, your partner should understand your concerns. There are many other forms of contraception that are less permanent and less invasive, and these could be options for you.

### Tubal ligation and risk of ovarian cancer in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations: a case-control study [^112ZMxSM]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

In several case-control and prospective studies, tubal ligation has been associated with a decreased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. We aimed to assess the potential of tubal ligation in reducing the risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry predisposing mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Methods

We did a matched case-control study among women from Canada, the United States, and the UK who had undergone genetic testing and who carried a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Cases were 232 women with a history of invasive ovarian cancer, and controls were 232 women without ovarian cancer, and who had both ovaries intact. Cases and controls were matched for year of birth, country of residence, and mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2). The odds ratio for developing ovarian cancer was estimated for tubal ligation, adjusting for oral contraceptive use, parity, history of breast cancer, and ethnic group.

Findings

In an unadjusted analysis among BRCA1 carriers, significantly fewer cases than controls had ever had tubal ligation (30 of 173 [18%] vs 60 of 173 [35%], odds ratio 0.37 [95% CI 0.21–0.63]; p = 0.0003). After adjustment for oral contraceptive use, parity, history of breast cancer and ethnic group, the odds ratio was 0.39 (p = 0.002). Combination of tubal ligation and past use of an oral contraceptive was associated with an odds ratio of 0.28 (0.15–0.52). No protective effect of tubal ligation was seen among carriers of the BRCA2 mutation.

Interpretation

Tubal ligation is a feasible option to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women with BRCA1 mutations who have completed childbearing.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^113Krfn3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

OS: Salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy or as a means of tubal sterilization appears to be safe and does not increase the risk of complications. OS should not alter the intended route of hysterectomy.

OC use: Appropriate for women with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 if indicated. Use for cancer prophylaxis is reasonable.

Although the feasibility of complete salpingectomy compared with standard postpartum tubal ligation at cesarean delivery has been demonstrated, our review did not find any prospective studies of ovarian cancer risk reduction with opportunistic salpingectomy alone among either women at high risk or those at average population risk. Existing retrospective data support that bilateral salpingectomy is at least comparable, if not superior, to bilateral tubal ligation for reducing ovarian cancer risk. A meta-analysis from 2016 reported a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer in women who underwent bilateral salpingectomy compared with those who did not (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35–0.75).

Our review did not identify data to support salpingectomy alone in women at high risk. Anecdotal evidence of an increase in the number of women at high risk being offered salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy indicates that there is a potential false perception of decreased risk in these patients after salpingectomy, which may ultimately decrease the odds of their timely return for ovary removal. Multiple studies are underway to evaluate the risks and benefits of salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy in women at high risk for ovarian cancer.

Epidemiologic evidence for potentially modifiable risk factors is summarized in the Risk Factor section. Our search found no interventional studies addressing these risk factors and no specific guidance from major professional societies. Given the well-accepted health benefits of contraception, physical activity, and lactation, it is reasonable to counsel patients on the potential secondary benefits of these activities on ovarian cancer risk (Appendix 4, provides a complete evidence summary).

### Tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral oophorectomy, and risk of ovarian cancer in the nurses' health studies [^112n4eUX]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To prospectively examine whether the association between tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral oophorectomy, and ovarian cancer varied by patient, tumor, and surgical characteristics.

Design

Two prospective cohort studies (Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II).

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

A cohort of 121,700 married US female nurses, aged 30–55 years at baseline and another cohort of 116,430 US female nurses aged 25–42 years at baseline.

Intervention(S)

We obtained data on gynecologic surgeries and ovarian cancer incidence through biennial questionnaires. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for known and suspected ovarian cancer risk factors.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Confirmed incident epithelial ovarian cancer.

Result(S)

Overall, tubal ligation was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer (HR, 0.76; 95% CI 0.64–0.90). The inverse association was stronger for nonserous tumors (HR, 0.57; 95% CI 0.40–0.82) and among women younger than 35 years at surgery (HR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.49–0.90). Hysterectomy was associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer (HR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.66–0.97) and was somewhat stronger for nonserous tumors (HR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.49–1.02). Unilateral oophorectomy was associated with a 30% lower risk (HR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.53–0.91), which did not differ by histologic subtype.

Conclusion(S)

Our study provides further support that tubal ligation reduces the risk of ovarian cancer, particularly for nonserous tumors and when conducted before the age of 35 years. The inverse association with hysterectomy, along with the stronger associations for nonserous tumors, supports shared biologic mechanisms for tubal ligation and hysterectomy.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^117Qprvk]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The US Collaborative Review of Sterilization reported reduced menstrual bleeding and pain and increased cycle irregularity after tubal ligation. These findings provided evidence against a 'post-tubal ligation syndrome' that included dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia, but could not address long-term outcomes, such as altered menopausal age, symptoms, or breast cancer risk.

A recent meta-analysis reported no association between tubal ligation and breast cancer (RR = 0.97); however, substantial heterogeneity between studies (I² = 82.2%, P < 0.001) was observed. Effect estimates among eight studies ranged from RR = 0.37 (0.19, 0.68) to 1.20 (1.00, 1.30). This variability may be partly due to incomplete information on subsequent gynaecologic surgeries and tumour subtypes. Women who have a tubal ligation are more likely to undergo hysterectomy, which may include bilateral oophorectomy, and thereby decrease breast cancer risk. Few studies have evaluated variation by tumours that express oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) and may therefore be more sensitive to hormonal exposures.

We studied tubal ligation in relation to menopausal age, symptoms, and ER/PR-defined breast cancer in the Sister Study.

### Role of tubal surgery in the era of assisted reproductive technology: a committee opinion [^116STUHS]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Role of tubal surgery in the era of assisted reproductive technology — summary considerations indicate that counseling for tubal infertility regarding corrective surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF) should consider the age of the woman and ovarian reserve, number and quality of sperm in the ejaculate, number of children desired, site and extent of tubal disease, other infertility factors, risks including ectopic pregnancy and other complications, surgeon experience, success rates of the IVF program, cost, and patient preference. Most IVF pregnancies happen within 1 year, whereas many surgical studies have high cumulative numbers but substantially longer time to delivery. There are no adequate trials comparing pregnancy rates of tubal surgery with IVF; IVF has a higher per-cycle pregnancy rate, while tubal anastomosis for reversal of tubal sterilization has a significantly higher cumulative pregnancy rate than IVF. For patients not candidates for corrective tubal surgery, laparoscopic salpingectomy or proximal tubal ligation overcomes the detrimental effect of hydrosalpinges on IVF pregnancy rates, and aspiration of a hydrosalpinx with or without sclerotherapy may be superior to no treatment at all, but further studies are needed.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pain in labor and delivery, more specifically with respect to anesthetic care for postpartum tubal ligation, ASA 2016 guidelines recommend to individualize both the timing of the procedure and the decision to use a particular anesthetic technique (neuraxial versus general anesthesia) based on anesthetic and obstetric risk factors, including blood loss, and patient preferences.

### Hysterectomy with and without oophorectomy, tubal ligation, and risk of cardiovascular disease in the nurses' health study II [^116L4PdR]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and tubal ligation are common surgical procedures. The literature regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk after these surgeries has focused on oophorectomy with limited research on hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Materials and Methods: Participants in the Nurses' Health Study II (n = 116,429) were followed from 1989 to 2017. Self-reported gynecologic surgery was categorized as follows: no surgery, hysterectomy alone, hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy, and hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. We separately investigated tubal ligation alone. The primary outcome was CVD based on medical-record confirmed fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or fatal and nonfatal stroke. Our secondary outcome expanded CVD to include coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft surgery, angioplasty, stent placement). Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and were adjusted a priori for confounding factors. We investigated differences by age at surgery (≤ 50, > 50) and menopausal hormone therapy usage. Results: At baseline, participants were on average, 34 years old. During 2,899,787 person-years, we observed 1,864 cases of CVD. Hysterectomy in combination with any oophorectomy was associated with a greater risk of CVD in multivariable-adjusted models (HR hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy:1.40 [95% CI: 1.08–1.82]; HR hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy:1.27 [1.07–1.51]). Hysterectomy alone, hysterectomy with oophorectomy, and tubal ligation were also associated with an increased risk of combined CVD and coronary revascularization (HR hysterectomy alone: 1.19 [95% CI: 1.02–1.39]; HR hysterectomy with unilateral oophorectomy: 1.29 [1.01–1.64]; HR hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy: 1.22 [1.04–1.43]; HR tubal ligation: 1.16 [1.06–1.28]). The association between hysterectomy/oophorectomy and CVD and coronary revascularization risk varied by age at gynecologic surgery, with the strongest association among women who had surgery before age 50 years. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that hysterectomy, alone or in combination with oophorectomy, as well as tubal ligation, may be associated with an increased risk of CVD and coronary revascularization. These findings extend previous research finding that oophorectomy is associated with CVD.

### Risks and complications of vasectomy [^1136a8y3]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Vasectomy is a safe and effective procedure for permanent contraception. Vasectomy is 30 times less likely to fail and 20 times less likely to have postoperative complications than its gynecologic counterpart. Complications from vasectomy are rare and minor in nature. Immediate risks include infection, hematoma, and pain. Complications seldom lead to hospitalization or aggressive medical management. Technique is surgeon dependent; however, certain techniques, such as fascial interposition, seem to decrease rates of vasectomy failure. Despite myriad vasectomy techniques, failure rates are less than those seen with tubal ligation. Available data suggest that vasectomized men do not seem at increased risk for immune-complex diseases.

### Interventions for intra-operative pain relief during postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal ligation [^111YGXn8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal ligation (PPTL) is a contraceptive method that works by interrupting the patency of the fallopian tubes. Several methods are used for intraoperative pain relief, such as systemic administration of opioids or intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of and adverse effects associated with interventions for pain relief in women undergoing PPTL.

Search Methods

We searched for eligible studies published on or before 31 July 2017 in the CENTRAL Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. We examined review articles and searched registers of ongoing clinical trials, citation lists of included studies, key textbooks, grey literature, and previous systematic reviews for potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared perioperative pain relief measures during PPTL.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles of potentially relevant studies for inclusion. We extracted the data from the included studies, assessed risk of bias, and calculated and compared results. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or by consulting a third review author. We computed the inverse variance risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes, and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous variables.

Main Results

We found only three RCTs, in which a total of 230 postpartum women participated. Most of our analyses were based on relatively small numbers of patients and studies. Overall, the certainty of evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions was low, due to risk of bias and imprecision. We found very low-certainty evidence regarding the safety of interventions because of risk of bias and imprecision. Two studies had unclear risk of selection bias. One study had unclear risk of reporting bias and a high risk of other bias associated with the study protocol. Women who received an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine experienced lower intensity intraperitoneal pain than those given a placebo (pooled MD -3.34, 95% CI -4.19 to -2.49, three studies, 190 participants, low-certainty evidence), or an intramuscular injection of morphine (MD -4.8, 95% CI -6.43 to -3.17, one study, 40 participants, low-certainty evidence). We found no clear difference in intraperitoneal pain between women who had an intramuscular injection of morphine added to an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine and those who had an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine alone (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.52 to 0.72, one study, 40 participants, low-certainty evidence). An intramuscular injection of morphine alone was not effective for intraperitoneal pain relief compared to placebo (MD 0.50, 95% CI -1.33 to 2.33, one study, 40 women, low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported any serious adverse events but the evidence was very low-certainty. Intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine may reduce the number of women requiring additional pain control when compared to placebo (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.44, three studies, 190 women, low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

An intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine during postpartum mini-laparotomy tubal ligation before fallopian tubes were tied may offer better intraperitoneal pain control, although the evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. We found no clear difference in intraperitoneal pain between women who received a combination of an injection of morphine, and intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine and those who received an intraperitoneal instillation of lidocaine alone. These results must be interpreted with caution, since the evidence overall was low to very low-certainty.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^116q98yB]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

The Sister Study is an ongoing prospective cohort of US women who have a sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer. During 2003–2009, 50 884 women aged 35–74 years completed baseline telephone interviews including reproductive and medical history. All participants are asked to return brief annual health updates and comprehensive biennial questionnaires. Incident breast cancers are initially self-reported and later confirmed by medical record review. Response rates have been ⩾94% over follow-up. This research was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIH, and the Copernicus Group. All participants provided informed consent.

Participants reported ever having a tubal ligation and at what age. We excluded 274 women with missing information on tubal ligation or age at tubal ligation, a breast cancer diagnosis preceding enrolment or with unknown date, or who reported tubal ligation after hysterectomy or menopause. Also excluded were 296 women (0.6%) with missing race, education, body mass index, alcohol consumption, oral contraceptive (OC) use, age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, marital status, hysterectomy, or menopausal status. Records from 50 314 women were analysed.

Women reported ever having hot flashes and at what age, and whether they ever had 'any other symptoms of menopause such as poor sleeping, night sweats, irritability, or depression' (yes/no) and at what age. Women were considered menopausal after 12 months of amenorrhoea not due to pregnancy or breastfeeding. Age at menopause was defined as a woman's age at last menstrual period.

Women who reported incident breast cancer were asked to provide diagnosis details and authorise the release of medical records. Approximately 10% declined medical record release or died before providing authorisation. Agreement was high between self-reports and medical records for ER status (95%) and invasiveness (81%). When medical records were unavailable, self-reported data were used. At the time of this analysis, medical records were available for 77% of reported breast cancers.

### Lifestyle and reproductive risk factors associated with anal cancer in women aged over 50 years [^115BYAuT]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The increased risk of anal cancer in women who reported a history of tubal ligation has not, to our knowledge, previously been reported. Tubal ligation is highly correlated with parity; over 97% of the women in our cohort who reported being sterilised had given birth to at least one child. Sterilised women had more children, with 49% reporting three or more children, compared with 33% of women in the cohort overall. Given that in our analysis the risk of anal cancer was decreased in parous women, the relationship between tubal ligation and increased risk was unexpected. Adjusting for parity, age at first birth, or number of children did not affect the association.

HPV infections are sexually transmitted. The risk of anal cancer and its precursor lesions have been shown to be closely related to sexual behaviour in both women and men, including number of partners and sexual practices. A limitation of our study is that we did not collect information on sexual behaviour from our participants. We examined current marital status and co-habitation, and found that women who reported not currently being married or living with a partner had an increased risk of subsequent anal cancer.

Given that HPV is sexually transmitted, this might seem counter-intuitive; however, most women aged over 50 years who are not married or living with a partner are widowed, separated, or divorced. Being separated or divorced has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of anal cancer in both men and women; found a doubling of risk for squamous cell anal cancers in separated or divorced women. Cervical cancer is also more common in separated and divorced than in currently married women, and it seems probable that differences in past sexual behaviour account for the findings related to marital status at older ages.

In a large cohort of over a million women with prospectively collected information on exposures, with an average 13 years of follow-up, we found that prior CIN 3, smoking, past use of the oral contraceptive pill, nulliparity, tubal ligation, and not currently living with a husband or partner were risk factors for incident anal cancer in women over 50 years of age. Anal cancer has the closest relationship to HrHPV after cervical cancer, and it is possible that the risk factors we have identified are also associated with the risk of HPV acquisition, and/or a decreased clearance of existing infection, leading to the increased risk of anal cancer seen in association with certain exposures, or that some of these exposures themselves increase risk of anal cancer.

Postpartum tubal ligation — preoperative fasting, anesthetic selection, and operational considerations state that before postpartum tubal ligation "the patient should have no oral intake of solid foods within 6 to 8 h of the surgery, depending on the type of food ingested (e.g., fat content)", and that "both the timing of the procedure and the decision to use a particular anesthetic technique (i.e., neuraxial vs. general) should be individualized, based on anesthetic and obstetric risk factors (e.g., blood loss), and patient preferences". The guidance adds "Consider aspiration prophylaxis", "Consider selecting neuraxial techniques in preference to GA for most postpartum tubal ligations", "Be aware that gastric emptying will be delayed in patients who have received opioids during labor", "Be aware that an epidural catheter placed for labor may be more likely to fail with longer postdelivery time intervals", and "If a postpartum tubal ligation is to be performed before the patient is discharged from the hospital, do not attempt the procedure at a time when it might compromise other aspects of patient care on the labor and delivery unit".

### Race, class, caste, disability, sterilisation and hysterectomy [^1155v7ic]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Tubal ligation and hysterectomy may also be more entwined than is commonly realised, since gynaecological and epidemiological research throughout the 1980s and 1990s found that having previously had tubal ligation increases a woman's later risk of hysterectomy — but why?. In fact, the first observations about this effect occurred in the United States in the 1950s, where it was one of the reasons why some researchers insisted on hysterectomy as a sterilisation procedure, since so many women who received tubal ligation would end up having hysterectomies anyway. Studies conducted in the 1980s suggesting a 'post-tubal ligation syndrome' affecting some women due to disruptions of ovarian nerve and blood supply were criticised in their own time for failure to exclude pre-existing gynaecological conditions, comorbidities and contraceptive pill use in the study cohorts. The recurring correlation between tubal ligation and later hysterectomy has continued to baffle gynaecology researchers who dismiss consideration of potential iatrogenic problems caused directly by tubal procedures because several long-term studies have indicated there are no statistically significant differences in the menstrual disorders of women who have received tubal ligation compared with those that have not. But a credible explanation for the persistent increased hysterectomy rate among this group of women is wanting. Meanwhile, other studies indicating postligation symptoms in many women, including increased menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain and menopausal symptoms have continued to appear, including the ethnographic reports described by Johanna Schoen which have identified widespread perception among patients of iatrogenic symptoms associated with their tubal ligation (;, 29–42). Some researchers have acknowledged that the variability of results in different populations may be a product of different forms of tubal ligation surgeries used, with some being more problematic than others. The correlation has been found too in the recent scholarship on India's hysterectomy epidemic. Andhra Pradesh has both India's highest rates of female sterilisation and the highest rates of hysterectomy, while national data indicate sterilised women are actually less likely to receive hysterectomy than non-sterilised women (, 74;). Here it seems hysterectomy is not clearly being used as a sterilisation method itself, since many women being prescribed hysterectomies, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, have already been sterilised. Rather, the radical surgery remains still entangled with such practices in a novel private-health-insurance context which incentivises the financial exploitation of socially disadvantaged women.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^112uw8tp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

As desire for reversal of tubal ligation is known to occur, it is important that all patients considering tubal ligation receive thorough counseling regarding the comparative safety and effectiveness of IUC prior to undergoing tubal ligation. As the effectiveness and safety of many clinical procedures vary by patient comorbidity and clinician experience, the millions of US individuals who receive Medicaid-funded healthcare should be specifically informed about the comparative safety and effectiveness of IUC compared to tubal ligation provided to Medicaid clients, because desire for tubal reversal has been reported to be more common among Medicaid clients, and Medicaid coverage of infertility treatment is very limited in most states.

Strengths of this study include the large and diverse population studied with input from both patients and clinician stakeholders. When estimating rates of contraceptive failure, the fact that California covers abortion services for those eligible for Medicaid is an additional strength. Given federal restrictions on abortion funding, ResDAC includes very little abortion data. However, we believe that we were able to identify many pregnancies that were aborted using claims related to pregnancy testing and imaging which are included in ResDAC without subsequent claims for delivery, ectopic pregnancy, or management of early pregnancy loss. Further, undercounting of abortions should not differ with respect to type of contraceptive procedure performed prior to an undesired pregnancy. Additional limitations of this study include the fact that claims data do not allow identification of whether patients had an IUC in their uterus at the time they became pregnant; it is therefore possible that some patients expelled or removed their IUC prior to becoming pregnant. If our data includes a considerable number of patients who self-removed or expelled their IUC and did not start another form of contraception prior to becoming pregnant, then the typical-use failure rate we report here for the levonorgestrel IUC is higher than it should be, and patients may be even less likely to become pregnant in the first year following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC than following laparoscopic tubal ligation. In addition, this claims data does not provide detail on what type of laparoscopic tubal ligation was performed. We recognize that some salpingectomies and oophorectomies performed at the time of tubal ligation may have been planned with the goal of reducing risk of malignancy, while hysterectomies may have been planned due to a history of fibroids and menorrhagia. Although all analyses were adjusted for age and claims related to obesity and pain in the 2 years pre-procedure, our finding of more pelvic pain following tubal ligation than IUC may reflect continuation of conditions that made laparoscopy and tubal ligation a more likely contraceptive choice. Healthcare claims are an imperfect measure of health status as people who chose not to or could not access Medi-Cal-funded healthcare during the study period may have skewed baseline health measures. As such, claims data do not allow for ideal adjustment for baseline differences between groups. Further, observational studies can only identify associations, not causal relationships. Finally, due to the limited number of individuals with continuous enrollment for more than 1 year, we were unable to examine the comparative safety and effectiveness of these methods with extended use. In addition, it is possible that some patients may have had private insurance or received healthcare in another state during a gap in Medi-Cal enrollment.

### Endometrial ablation: is tubal ligation a risk factor for hysterectomy [^116GCSXp]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine whether tubal ligation is a risk factor for future hysterectomy after second-generation endometrial ablation.

Design

Retrospective chart review (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).

Setting

Resident-run clinic and private office in a community setting.

Patients

Five hundred eighty-seven patients who underwent endometrial ablation.

Interventions

Patients underwent endometrial ablation using either radiofrequency or thermal balloon. Data collected included age, body mass index, uterine length, and endometrial stripe, as well as smoking status and presence or absence of hypertension and hypothyroidism. Indication for hysterectomy and pathologic findings at hysterectomy were also examined.

Measurements and Main Results

There was no association between tubal ligation and second-generation endometrial ablation resulting in hysterectomy (p = .09). Statistically significant variables included endometrial stripe (p < .001) and smoking (p < .001). There was no statistical significance between the groups insofar as type of ablation, age, body mass index, uterine length, hypertension, or hypothyroidism. Time from endometrial ablation to hysterectomy between groups was not significant. Indication for hysterectomy and pathologic findings after hysterectomy were also not significant.

Conclusions

Tubal ligation is not a statistically significant risk factor for hysterectomy after endometrial ablation. Tubal ligation does not affect the length of time from endometrial ablation to hysterectomy.

### Tubal ligation in relation to menopausal symptoms and breast cancer risk [^113LDDrL]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Overall, 14 802 women (29.4%) reported having a tubal ligation (mean age = 32.7 years; s.d. = 5.5); prevalence was highest among women who reported lower education, African-American race, overweight to obese BMI, current cigarette smoking, ever OC use, younger age at first birth, and having ⩾2 births. Tubal ligation was also more prevalent among women who reported hysterectomy, postmenopausal hormone use, and mammography screening (Table 1).

Menopause

Women who had a tubal ligation were 9% more likely to report hot flashes (95% CI: 1.06–1.12) and 10% more likely to have other symptoms of menopause (e.g. poor sleeping, night sweats, irritability, depression) (95% CI: 1.07–1.13) compared with women who did not have a tubal ligation (Table 2). Among those reporting symptoms, 71% had both hot flashes and other symptoms. Risk of hot flashes did not vary by age at tubal ligation, although other menopausal symptoms appeared more frequent at older ages (HR 1.15: 95% CI: 1.11–1.20 for tubal ligation ⩾35 years vs HR 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03–1.11 for < 35; Table 2). In analyses among women who never used OCs or additionally adjusted for parity or postmenopausal hormone use, the results were virtually unchanged (data not shown).

### Sterilization [^115HxeK1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Worldwide, sterilization (tubal sterilization and vasectomy) is used by more people than any other method of contraception. All techniques of tubal sterilization in widespread use in the United States have low risks of surgical complications. Although tubal sterilization is highly effective, the risk of pregnancy varies by age and method of occlusion. Pregnancies can occur many years after the procedure, and when they do, the risk of ectopic gestation is high. There is now strong evidence against the existence of a post-tubal ligation syndrome of menstrual abnormalities. Although women who have undergone tubal sterilization are more likely than other women to undergo hysterectomy subsequently, there is no known biologic basis for this relationship. Although sterilization is intended to be permanent, expressions of regret and requests for reversal are not uncommon and are much more likely to occur among women sterilized at young ages. Tubal sterilization has little or no effect on sexual function for most women. Vasectomy is less likely than tubal sterilization to result in serious complications. Minor complications, however, are not uncommon. Vasectomy does not increase the risk of heart disease, and available evidence argues against an increase in the risk of prostate cancer, testicular cancer, or overall mortality. Whether a postvasectomy pain syndrome exists remains controversial. Although the long-term effectiveness of vasectomy is less well-studied than that for tubal sterilization, it seems likely to be at least as effective. Intrauterine devices and progestin implants are long-acting, highly effective alternatives to sterilization.

### Cost-effectiveness of opportunistic salpingectomy vs tubal ligation at the time of cesarean delivery [^115TaAEc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Removal of the fallopian tubes at the time of hysterectomy or interval sterilization has become routine practice to prevent ovarian cancer. While emerging as a strategy, uptake of this procedure at the time of cesarean delivery for pregnant women seeking permanent sterilization has not been widely adopted due to perceptions of increased morbidity and operative difficulty with a lack of available data in this setting.

Objective

We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing strategies for long-term sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction at the time of cesarean delivery, including bilateral tubal ligation, opportunistic salpingectomy, and long-acting reversible contraception.

Study Design

A decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model was constructed for pregnant women undergoing cesarean delivery who desired permanent sterilization in the US population, comparing 3 strategies: (1) bilateral tubal ligation, (2) bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy, and (3) postpartum long-acting reversible contraception. This theoretic cohort consisted of 110,000 pregnant women desiring permanent sterilization at the time of cesarean delivery and ovarian cancer prevention at an average of 35 years who were monitored for an additional 40 years based on an average US female life expectancy of 75 years. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years. Secondary outcomes included: the number of ovarian cancer cases and deaths, procedure-related complications, and unintended and ectopic pregnancies. The 1-, 2-, and 3-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000.

Results

Both bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy with cesarean delivery have favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. In the base case analysis, salpingectomy was more cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $23,189 per quality-adjusted life year compared to tubal ligation. Long-acting reversible contraception after cesarean was not cost-effective (ie, dominated). Although salpingectomy and tubal ligation were both cost-effective over a wide range of cost and risk estimates, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis was highly sensitive to the uncertainty around the estimates of salpingectomy cancer risk reduction, risk of perioperative complications, and cost. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated that tubal ligation had a 49% chance of being the preferred strategy over salpingectomy. If the true salpingectomy risk of perioperative complications is > 2% higher than tubal ligation or if the cancer risk reduction of salpingectomy is < 52%, then tubal ligation is the preferred, more cost-effective strategy.

Conclusion

Bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral opportunistic salpingectomy with cesarean delivery are both cost-effective strategies for permanent sterilization and ovarian cancer risk reduction. Although salpingectomy and tubal ligation are both reasonable strategies for cesarean patients seeking permanent sterilization and cancer risk reduction, threshold analyses indicate that the risks and benefits of salpingectomy with cesarean delivery need to be better defined before a preferred strategy can be determined.

### Informed consent and ethical issues pertaining to female sterilization-scoping review [^112CidW4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background

Female sterilization, often known as tubal ligation, is a permanent contraceptive method involving the blockage of the fallopian tubes to prevent fertilization. It can be performed through various methods, including abdominally via laparoscopy, laparotomy, or mini‐laparotomy; transvaginally (though not recommended) via colpotomy and culdoscopy; or transcervically (experimental) via hysteroscopy. Since its introduction in the 19th century by James Blundell, bilateral tubal ligation has become increasingly popular, with a mid‐20th century complication rate estimated at about 1%. Today, female sterilization is one of the most common contraceptive methods, with approximately 23.7% of contraceptive users worldwide choosing this option, leading to around 219 million women being sterilized annually.

As with all medical procedures, informed consent is essential before performing female sterilization. It is crucial that women receive thorough counseling regarding the procedure, including its risks, benefits, and alternatives, and that this counseling is properly documented, especially as female sterilization is permanent. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), everyone has the right to control their health and body, which includes sexual and reproductive rights, and to be free from interference, such as nonconsensual medical treatment or experimentation. Section 27 of the Constitution of South Africa guarantees the right to access healthcare services, including reproductive health care. The International Criminal Court considers forced or coerced female sterilization a crime against humanity. These human rights protections at high levels emphasize the importance of obtaining informed consent before such procedures to ensure that they are voluntary and not coerced.

The primary purpose of informed consent is to uphold the ethical principle of autonomy in medical practice. Beauchamp and Childress define autonomy as "self‐rule that is free from controlling interferences by others and from limitations, such as inadequate understanding, that prevent meaningful choice". Similarly, Kantian moral philosophy describes autonomy as the capacity to act according to objective morality rather than personal desires. Autonomy grants patients the right to choose, accept, or refuse medical interventions. Securing informed consent also demonstrates respect for patient autonomy and serves as a critical safeguard against claims of coercion or forced medical procedures, as encapsulated by the Latin phrase "volenti non‐fit injuria", meaning "to one who is consenting, no wrong is done".

### Does tubal sterilization influence the subsequent risk of menorrhagia or dysmenorrhea? [^112jkdG3]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relation between tubal ligation, change in menstrual cycle characteristics, and early follicular phase hormones.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of women 36–44 years of age.

Setting

The greater Boston area.

Patient(S)

Nine hundred seventy-six premenopausal women with intact uteri.

Intervention(S)

A comparison of women with and without a history of tubal ligation.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Menstrual and reproductive histories were self-reported. Early follicular phase blood samples were obtained to assess FSH, LH, and E(2). We compared menstrual cycle changes from the first 5 years after menarche with completion of the baseline questionnaire in women with and without a prior history of tubal ligation.

Result(S)

Cycle length, cycle regularity, menses length, flow volume, dysmenorrhea, and hormone levels were similar in women with and without a history of tubal ligation. However, among parous women with a history of cesarean section, those with a tubal ligation > 5 years ago experienced a marginal increase in volume of menstrual flow compared with women with no tubal ligation history.

Conclusion(S)

We found no significant change in menstrual cycle characteristics or hormone levels in women with or without a history of tubal ligation. However, tubal ligation may have a modest effect on the change in menstrual flow volume over time among parous women with a history of cesarean section.

### Vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer: population based matched cohort study [^111aizzr]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this population based study spanning nearly 20 years, we observed no statistically significant association between vasectomy and prostate cancer related risk, grade, stage, or mortality. Our findings have important implications for patients, clinicians, guidelines, policy makers, and family planning support groups.

Previous studies of the association between vasectomy and prostate cancer have produced conflicting results. Most of these studies included fewer than 100 men with prostate cancer among those undergoing vasectomy and had limited follow-up. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about bias, unmeasured confounding, and chance in relation to the small increased risk found by others. Recently published meta-analyses of these studies found that vasectomy was not associated with risk of prostate cancer, and guidelines from the American Urological Association in 2012 recommended that clinicians do not need to routinely discuss prostate cancer during preoperative counselling of men considering vasectomy.

A large prospective cohort study published in 2014, however, found that history of vasectomy was associated with a 10% increased risk of prostate cancer overall and a roughly 20% increased risk of high grade and lethal disease. This study received much media attention, might have caused anxiety among men who were planning or had already undergone a vasectomy, and even prompted a formal response from the American Urological Association. The study relied on data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the history of vasectomy was obtained through questionnaires and might therefore have been prone to selection and recall bias. Additional concerns raised by the American Urological Association included inconsistencies with previous reports on the same cohort of men, and residual confounding. After considering all the evidence to date, the association reaffirmed its 2012 guideline recommendations against routine discussion of prostate cancer during preoperative counselling of men considering vasectomy. Our results strengthen the current evidence and support these recommendations.

Inappropriately decreasing the use of vasectomy as a form of contraception because of concerns related to prostate cancer would be a disservice to both men and women. Compared with its female counterpart, tubal ligation, vasectomy is more cost effective, with average healthcare costs about one third of those for tubal ligation. Furthermore, compared with vasectomy, tubal ligation is 20 times more likely to have associated major complications, such as haemorrhage, infection, ectopic pregnancy, and injury to adjacent organs. Although procedure related mortality is rare, tubal ligation is about 12 times more likely to be associated with death compared with vasectomy. These differences are particularly important in developing countries, where risks associated with sterilisation procedures might be even greater.

### Costs and benefits of opportunistic salpingectomy as an ovarian cancer prevention strategy [^114YyG4z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of opportunistic salpingectomy (elective salpingectomy at hysterectomy or instead of tubal ligation).

Methods

A Markov Monte Carlo simulation model estimated the costs and benefits of opportunistic salpingectomy in a hypothetical cohort of women undergoing hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions or surgical sterilization. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Effectiveness was measured in terms of life expectancy gain. Sensitivity analyses accounted for uncertainty around various parameters. Monte Carlo simulation estimated the number of ovarian cancer cases associated with each strategy in the Canadian population.

Results

Salpingectomy with hysterectomy was less costly ($11,044.32 ± $1.56) than hysterectomy alone ($11,206.52 ± $29.81) or with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ($12,626.84 ± $13.11) but more effective at 21.12 ± 0.02 years compared with 21.10 ± 0.03 and 20.94 ± 0.03 years, representing average gains of 1 week and 2 months, respectively. For surgical sterilization, salpingectomy was more costly ($9,719.52 ± $3.74) than tubal ligation ($9,339.48 ± $26.74) but more effective at 22.45 ± 0.02 years compared with 22.43 ± 0.02 years (average gain of 1 week) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,278 per year of life gained. Our results were stable over a wide range of costs and risk estimates. Monte Carlo simulation predicted that salpingectomy would reduce ovarian cancer risk by 38.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 36.5–41.3%) and 29.2% (95% CI 28.0–31.4%) compared with hysterectomy alone or tubal ligation, respectively.

Conclusion

Salpingectomy with hysterectomy for benign conditions will reduce ovarian cancer risk at acceptable cost and is a cost-effective alternative to tubal ligation for sterilization. Opportunistic salpingectomy should be considered for all women undergoing these surgical procedures.

### Interval female sterilization [^112SmzYz]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Female sterilization is relied on by nearly one in three women aged 35–44 years in the United States. Sterilization procedures are among the most common procedures that obstetrician-gynecologists perform. The most frequent sterilization procedures include postpartum tubal ligation, laparoscopic tubal disruption or salpingectomy, and hysteroscopic tubal occlusion. The informed consent process for sterilization is crucial and requires shared decision-making between the patient and the health care provider. Counseling should include the specific risks and benefits of the specific surgical approaches. Additionally, women should be counseled on the alternatives to sterilization, including intrauterine contraceptives and subdermal contraceptive implants. Complications, including unplanned pregnancy after successful female sterilization, are rare. The objectives of this Clinical Expert Series are to describe the epidemiology of female sterilization, access to postpartum sterilization, advances in interval sterilization techniques, and clinical considerations in caring for women requesting sterilization.

It advises individualized counseling and lists options: "Contraceptive choices include combined hormonal (estrogen/progestin) contraception, progesterone-only agents, intrauterine devices, barrier methods, and permanent sterilization". It adds that "Low-dose combination oral contraceptive (≤ 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol) is an option except in women who are at increased risk of thrombosis", and that "Intrauterine devices are highly effective methods of contraception; however, women may experience vasovagal reactions at the time of implant". Procedural considerations include "Tubal ligation is generally safe with recognized risks associated with anesthesia and abdominal insufflation" and "An efficacious option is a vasectomy for the male partner; however, the long-term prognosis of the female patient with CHD must be considered and discussed openly". For emergency contraception, "the morning-after pill (levonorgestrel) is safe for" women, but "acute fluid retention is a risk to be considered".

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^112ndaJi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Effective family planning involves careful consideration of many aspects of available contraceptive methods. In a prior study, patients have highlighted the importance of clear communication about the relative effectiveness of available contraceptive methods. Unfortunately, misperceptions of contraceptive effectiveness are common.

Historically, "typical use" failure rates have been calculated for short-acting contraceptive methods by analyzing data on rates of pregnancy within the first year of use, as reported to the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG); these "typical use" failure rates are considerably greater than the "perfect use" failure rates reported in clinical trials of short-acting contraceptives. For long-acting contraceptives, "typical use" failure rates have been presumed to be equivalent to those reported in clinical trials. Thus, the US Food and Drug Administration states that after either tubal ligation or intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) placement, "less than 1 pregnancy is expected per 100 women". However, in real-world clinical practice, the effectiveness and safety of many clinical procedures have been found to differ from what was seen in clinical trials. Further, the healthcare experiences of publicly and privately insured individuals in the United States differ in many meaningful ways.

Tubal ligation remains common in the United States, particularly among low-income individualsand those with chronic medical conditions such as diabetes. Compared to privately insured individuals, US patients with public insurance more frequently report a desire for reversal of tubal sterilization. As Medicaid offers only limited coverage of treatment for infertility, it is important that individuals considering permanent contraception are well informed about all of their contraceptive options. To inform such contraceptive counseling, we estimated the real-world effectiveness and safety of placement of a levonorgestrel or copper intrauterine contraceptive (IUC) as compared to laparoscopic tubal ligation among a large and diverse cohort of individuals receiving publicly funded healthcare in California.

### Essure hysteroscopic sterilization versus interval laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation: a comparative effectiveness review [^116XpNBN]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

A comparative effectiveness analysis was performed to examine the risks and benefits of laparoscopic bilateral tubal ligation compared with hysteroscopic sterilization using the Essure Permanent Birth Control System (Bayer HealthCare AG, Whippany, NJ). Existing evidence shows that both LBTL and Essure are safe and effective methods of female sterilization. Both have high rates of efficacy and low rates of complications although when complications do occur, those related to the Essure procedure are more likely to be minor in nature. The analysis was limited by the restricted number of studies involving head-to-head comparisons of the 2 approaches.

### Why-UD? Assessing the requirement to trial an intrauterine device as a condition for elective sterilisation in female patients [^113kEBaZ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Gender norms, regret and frustration

No ICB in the UK requires that male patients seeking vasectomy undergo a 1-year trial of another form of contraceptive. But of course, this is explained rather straightforwardly by the lack of long-lasting reversible contraceptives available to men. It is also important to note that while vasectomy and tubal ligation both bring about sterilisation, the two are different procedures with different kinds of associated risks. In particular, vasectomy is performed under local anaesthetic, while tubal ligation is performed under general anaesthetic. When procedures are not themselves directly comparable, we cannot assume that it is necessarily a matter of discrimination to offer them on different conditions. Whether the IUD requirement is justified depends on the reasons for some ICBs having this specific policy. Why an IUD, and why the requirement of a 1-year trial, rather than merely offering the patient this or other alternatives (as is the case in other ICBs)?

It may be that the reason for approving sterilisation only on condition of a 1-year trial of an IUD is in order to enforce a 'cooling off period' — while still providing adequate birth control — to ensure that the patient gives the matter sufficient thought. Buturovic, for example, argues for such a time period: 'We should not want sterilisation to be available at the press of a button. To the contrary, obstacles to sterilisation for young women are precisely the process needed to weed out the confused and uncommitted'. However, this reasoning would only justify the imposition of a waiting period, and not insistence on a specific method of contraception. Further, counselling regarding alternatives and explaining the ramifications of sterilisation is considered sufficient for male patients, for whom no set time period for 'cooling off' is mandated.

### Oral contraceptive use, reproductive history, and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in women with and without endometriosis [^114qLfdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Women with endometriosis may be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer. It is not known whether reproductive factors that reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in general also reduce risk in women with endometriosis. We investigated whether the odds ratios for ovarian cancer that were associated with oral contraceptive use, childbearing, hysterectomy, and tubal ligation differ among women with and without endometriosis.

Study Design

We pooled information on the self-reported history of endometriosis from 4 population-based case-controlled studies of incident epithelial ovarian cancer, comprising 2098 cases and 2953 control subjects. We obtained data on oral contraceptive use, childbearing, breastfeeding, gynecologic surgical procedures, and other reproductive factors on each woman. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% CI for ovarian cancer among women with endometriosis compared with women without endometriosis. Similar methods were used to assess the frequencies of risk factors among women with and without endometriosis. Adjustments were made for age, parity, oral contraceptive use, tubal ligation, family history of ovarian cancer, and study site.

Results

Women with endometriosis were at an increased risk of ovarian cancer (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06–1.65). Using oral contraceptives, bearing children, and having a tubal ligation or hysterectomy were associated with a similar reduction in the odds ratios for ovarian cancer among women with and without endometriosis. In particular, the use of oral contraceptives for > 10 years was associated with a substantial reduction in risk among women with endometriosis (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08–0.58).

Conclusion

Women with endometriosis are at an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Long-term oral contraceptive use may provide substantial protection against the disease in this high-risk population.

### Risk factors for failed reactivation of a labor epidural for postpartum tubal ligation: a prospective, observational study [^112ia7Sk]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To determine specific risk factors that increase the failure rate of labor epidurals reactivated for use as a surgical block for postpartum tubal ligation.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

Labor and delivery suite and operating rooms at the Women and Infants Center.

Patients

One hundred patients undergoing postpartum tubal ligation with an existing labor epidural that is documented to be within 2 cm of initial placement.

Measurements

Body mass index, patient satisfaction with her epidural during labor and delivery, time from delivery to reactivation for tubal ligation, depth to loss of resistance, and the need for top-ups during labor were recorded preoperatively. Failure to reactivate was recorded and defined as any patient that (1) did not achieve a T₆ level to pinprick, (2) had perceived pain (pain score > 3) that required administration of an intravenous opioid or local anesthetic infiltration, or (3) required conversion to general anesthesia.

Main Results

The overall success rate of reactivation was 78%. Significant risk factors for failure to reactivate were (1) poor patient satisfaction (P = 0.016), (2) increased time from delivery to reactivation (P = 0.044), and (3) the need for top-ups during labor and delivery (P = 0.032).

Conclusion

Poor satisfaction score of the epidural during labor and delivery, increasing time from delivery to epidural reactivation for tubal ligation, and the need for top-ups during labor and delivery increase the incidence of reactivation failure. No correlation was found with body mass index or loss of resistance and failure to reactivate.

Female sterilization is the number one contraceptive choice among women in the United States. Counseling issues include ensuring that the woman understands the permanence of the procedure and knowing the factors that correlate with future regret. The clinician should be aware of the cumulative failure rate of the procedure, which is reported to be about 1.85 percent during a 10-year period. Complications of tubal sterilization include problems with anesthesia, hemorrhage, organ damage, and mortality. Some women who undergo tubal ligation may experience increased sexual satisfaction. While the procedure is commonly performed postpartum, it can be done readily, without relation to recent pregnancy, by laparoscopy or, when available, by minilaparotomy. Surgery should be timed immediately postpartum, or coincide with the first half of the woman's menstrual cycle or during a time period when the woman is using a reliable form of contraception.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive care in the context of pandemic response [^1156vzyo]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning — Permanent contraception during COVID-19 (postpartum and interval): Many pregnant persons who desire postpartum tubal ligation or salpingectomy do not actually undergo the procedure during their hospital admission for childbirth, and repeat pregnancy rates among those with unfulfilled requests are as high as 50%. In this context, the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists states that postpartum tubal ligation or salpingectomy is an urgent surgical procedure, and that hospitals should establish policies and procedures to reduce cancellations; therefore, we recommend prioritizing access to postpartum permanent contraception regardless of COVID-19 community transmission rates. When patients are tested for COVID-19 on admission to labor and delivery, provide permanent contraception after vaginal or cesarean delivery regardless of the patient's COVID-19 status as long as appropriate PPE is available for all clinical staff. For non-postpartum care, interval tubal ligation or salpingectomy is an elective procedure and clinicians should schedule these cases according to hospital guidelines for elective procedures, which should consider local COVID-19 community transmission rates, staffing limitations, and availability of PPE. Hospitals should implement routine COVID-19 testing for patients scheduled for surgical procedures and postpone elective procedures if patients test positive to reduce exposure and preserve PPE; surgeries that require intubation and extubation pose a higher risk of exposure and surgical smoke may also be aerosolized during laparoscopy. Offer alternate contraceptive methods to patients when elective procedures cannot be scheduled or surgery is postponed due to COVID-19 infection.

Ovarian cancer — the incessant menstruation hypothesis links retrograde menstruation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to carcinogenesis, and epidemiology notes that the number of lifetime menstruations, pelvic endometriosis and IUD use are risk factors, whereas hormonal contraception and tubal ligation are protective; while bilateral salpingoophorectomy reduces ovarian cancer risk, it is associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease. At the present time, a preventative strategy should be the use of hormonal contraception for prolonged periods of time, especially in women with endometriosis, and bilateral salpingectomy may be considered in women not desirous of future pregnancies.

Contraception in congenital heart disease (CHD) — counseling and method selection must be individualized, with options and thrombosis risk explicitly addressed. The individualized benefits and risks of each contraceptive therapy must be determined based on the patient's anatomy and physiology in consultation with a gynecologist, and contraceptive choices include combined hormonal (estrogen/progesterone) contraception, progesterone-only agents, intrauterine devices, barrier methods, and permanent sterilization; a low-dose combination oral contraceptive (≤ 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol) is an option except in women who are at increased risk of thrombosis, medroxyprogesterone acetate is a less effective method of contraception, intrauterine devices are highly effective methods of contraception, and tubal ligation is generally safe; women with CHD who are at high risk of thrombosis include those with cyanosis, Fontan physiology, mechanical valves, prior thrombotic events, and PAH.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Contraception in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) — method selection and cautions: It is the duty of the ACHD specialist to provide or otherwise make available informed advice on contraception, including discussion of risks. The estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pill is generally not recommended in ACHD patients at risk of thromboembolism, such as those with cyanosis, prior Fontan procedure, atrial fibrillation, or PAH. Medroxyprogesterone, the progesterone-only pills, and levonorgestrel may also cause fluid retention and should be used with caution in patients with heart failure, and depression and breakthrough bleeding may prevent the use of the progesterone-only pills, with a higher failure rate than with combined oral contraceptives. Levonorgestrel, barrier methods, or tubal ligation are the recommended contraceptive methods for women with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) and PAH; however, tubal ligation can be a high-risk procedure in patients with complex CHD or those with PAH. The potential complications of the "morning after pill" (levonorgestrel "plan B") should be explained to those at risk of acute fluid retention, hysteroscopic sterilization (Essure) may be reasonable for high-risk patients, and the risk of endocarditis with intra-uterine devices in women with CHD is controversial with recommendations individualized.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^116SGd4o]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Tubal ligation remains common in the United States, especially among low-income patients.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraceptives (IUC) to laparoscopic tubal ligation for Medicaid clients.

Design

We partnered with patient and clinician stakeholders to conduct a retrospective cohort study using California Medicaid claims for patients who had an IUC placed or laparoscopic tubal ligation performed in 2008–2014, excluding procedures performed within 42 days of a birth. We applied log-linear (Poisson) event-history regression models for clustered person-period data to adjust for sociodemographic variables and pre-procedure health status when examining associations between these contraceptive procedures and claims related to contraceptive failure, complications, and pain in the first year post-procedure.

Key Results

We identified 35,705 patients who had a levonorgestrel IUC placed, 23,628 patients who had a copper IUC placed, and 23,965 patients who underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation. In unadjusted analyses, rates of pregnancy within 1 year were similar following levonorgestrel IUC (2.40%) or copper IUC placement (2.99%) or tubal ligation (2.64%). In adjusted analyses, compared to tubal ligation, pregnancy was less common following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64–0.82) and similar with placement of a copper IUC (adj IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82–1.05). Procedural complications such as infection (0.35% vs. 2.91%) were significantly less common with IUC placement than tubal ligation. Claims for pelvic and abdominal pain decreased in frequency with time since all procedures; 6 to 12 months post-procedure, pelvic pain claims were less common after levonorgestrel IUC (adj IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.65–0.73) or copper IUC placement (adj IRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66–0.75) than tubal ligation.

Conclusions

IUC appears at least as effective as laparoscopic tubal ligation at 1-year post-procedure with lower rates of infection and pelvic pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure.

### Complications after opportunistic salpingectomy compared with tubal ligation at cesarean section: a retrospective cohort study [^113wgtqw]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare perioperative and postoperative complications in patients who underwent opportunistic salpingectomy (OS) (removal of the fallopian tubes for ovarian cancer risk reduction during another surgery) at the time of cesarean section (C-section) with those in patients who underwent tubal ligation.

Design

A population-based, retrospective cohort study.

Setting

British Columbia, Canada.

Patient(S)

A total of 18,184 patients were included in this study, of whom 8,440 and 9,744 underwent OS and tubal ligation, respectively.

Intervention(S)

Patients who underwent OS during a C-section were compared with those who underwent tubal ligation during a C-section.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

We examined the perioperative outcomes, including operating room time, length of hospital stay, surgical complications such as infections, anemia, incision complications, injury to a pelvic organ, or operating room return; postoperative complications, including physician visits for a postoperative infection or visits that resulted in ultrasound or laboratory examinations and hospital readmissions in the 6 weeks after discharge; and likelihood to fill a prescription for antibiotics or analgesics.

Result(S)

The OS group had decreased odds of perioperative complications compared with the tubal ligation group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.99). Patients who underwent OS did not have increased risks of physician visits for surgical complications, such as infection, or hospital readmissions in the 6 weeks after hospital discharge. In addition, these patients had 18% and 23% increased odds of filling prescriptions for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07–1.28) and opioids (aOR, 1.23%; 95% CI, 1.12–1.35), respectively.

Conclusion(S)

In this population-based, real-world study of OS at C-section, we report decreased perioperative complications and no difference in postoperative complications between patients who underwent OS and those who underwent tubal ligation. Patients who underwent OS had an increased likelihood of filling a prescription for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids in the 6 weeks after hospital discharge. This result should be interpreted with caution because we did not have data on over-the-counter medication use and, thus, not all prescription analgesics were captured in our data. Our data suggest that OS after C-section is a safe way to provide effective contraception and ovarian cancer risk reduction.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^115P6Nfm]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis of claims data from over 83,000 Californian patients who received publicly funded contraceptive services, we found that the typical-use contraceptive failure rate, as indicated by claims for pregnancy within 1 year of placement of a levonorgestrel IUC, was lower than that following laparoscopic tubal ligation, while pregnancy rates following copper IUC placement were similar to those following laparoscopic tubal ligation. These findings are important because IUC placement was far less likely to result in procedural complications than laparoscopic tubal ligation. Of note, this was the case even after we excluded from this analysis patients who are at highest risk of procedural complications, such as those with claims indicating congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, or need for home oxygen. Further, patients who underwent IUC placement were significantly less likely to have claims for pelvic, abdominal, or genitourinary pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure, even after adjusting for pain-related claims in the 2 years prior to the index procedure and censoring observation at the time of hysterectomy or oophorectomy. This may be because IUC users avoid the scar tissue and risk of adhesions that follow tubal ligation, and because hormonal IUC reduce menstrual cramping and flow.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^1122dKQB]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Given growing interest in the option of early postpartum IUC placement, information about the comparative safety and effectiveness of postpartum tubal ligation and postpartum IUC placement remains needed, particularly as the majority of Medicaid-funded tubal ligation procedures performed in California are postpartum procedures. In addition, future studies are needed to clarify the comparative effectiveness and safety of long-acting contraceptives after the first year of use. In conclusion, placement of IUC appears at least as effective as laparoscopic tubal ligation for Medicaid clients at 1 year post-procedure with lower rates of procedural complications and pelvic pain 6 to 12 months post-procedure.

### Tubal ligation in catholic hospitals: a qualitative study of ob-gyns' experiences [^11567L44]. Contraception (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tubal sterilization remains one of the most commonly requested contraceptive methods in the United States. Catholic hospital policy prohibits all sterilizations, but this ban is not uniformly enforced. We conducted this study to assess obstetrician-gynecologists' beliefs and experiences with tubal ligation in Catholic hospitals.

Study Design

We interviewed 31 obstetrician-gynecologists geographically dispersed throughout the US who responded to a national survey and agreed to be contacted for a follow-up interview or who were referred by colleagues from the survey sample. Twenty-seven had experienced working in a Catholic hospital. Interviews were open ended and guided by a semistructured instrument. Transcripts were thematically analyzed.

Results

Obstetrician-gynecologists disagreed with strict prohibition of sterilizations, especially when denying a tubal ligation placed the patient at increased medical risk. Cesarean delivery in Catholic hospitals raised frustration for obstetrician-gynecologists when the hospital prohibited a simultaneous tubal ligation and, thus, sent the patient for an unnecessary subsequent surgery. Obstetrician-gynecologists described some hospitals allowing tubal ligations in limited circumstances, but these workarounds were vulnerable to changes in enforcement. Some obstetrician-gynecologists reported that Catholic policy posed greater barriers for low-income patients and those with insurance restrictions.

Conclusion

Obstetrician-gynecologists working in Catholic hospitals in this study did not share the Church's beliefs on sterilization. Research to understand patients' experiences and knowledge of their sterilization options is warranted in order to promote women's autonomy and minimize risk of harm.

Implications Statement

Tubal sterilization, even when medically indicated or in conjunction with cesarean delivery, is severely restricted for women delivering in Catholic hospitals. For women whose only access to hospital care is at a Catholic institution, religious policies can prevent them from receiving a desired sterilization and place them at risk for future undesired pregnancy.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraception after surgical abortion [^112atEHn]. Contraception (2019). High credibility.

Contraception after surgical abortion — permanent contraception timing: Tubal ligation through laparoscopy or minilaparotomy can be safely performed at the same time as first- and second-trimester surgical abortion, whereas hysteroscopic sterilization should be delayed for at least 6 weeks after interruption of pregnancy to allow time for endometrial repair needed to adequately visualize the bilateral tubal ostia.

### Role of tubal surgery in the era of assisted reproductive technology: a committee opinion [^115jVz3S]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Sterilization reversal prognostic factors and risks — In a series of > 5,600 women undergoing tubal anastomosis, women < 30 years at the time of the reversal had a pregnancy rate of 88%, with pregnancy and live-birth rates significantly decreasing with increasing age. Pooling subjects < 40 years, a retrospective single-center study reported cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates of > 90% within 2 years of microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization. In women aged 40–45 years, a multicenter study with 78 women reported a 45% pregnancy rate and a miscarriage rate of 26%. Surgeons may wish to defer reversal procedures when final tubal lengths are predicted to be < 4 cm, and if no pregnancy occurs within 6 months, an assessment of tubal patency is suggested. The rate of ectopic pregnancy after tubal anastomosis was reported as 4%–8% vs. 1.4% for IVF, and women who elect tubal anastomosis require early surveillance with the occurrence of a positive pregnancy test.

Risk-reducing salpingectomy strategies and surgical pathology in RAD51C, RAD51D, and BRIP1 heterozygotes: Several studies have shown that opportunistic salpingectomy alone can reduce the risk of future development of OC, including women undergoing salpingectomy or tubal ligation for sterilization across all levels of OC risk. Researchers are currently investigating whether risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy in premenopausal individuals with inherited predisposition to OC (including RAD51C, RAD51D, and BRIP1 heterozygotes) is safe; results will not be available for a decade and may indicate an additional management option for pre-menopausal women wishing to reduce risk before completion of an oophorectomy at age 50. Surgical risk reduction with RRSO should be performed in conjunction with the Sectioning and Extensively Examining the Fimbria (SEE-FIM) protocol for pathologic analysis in accordance with NCCN guidelines to optimize detection of occult serous carcinoma of the adnexa, and thorough surgical exploration can identify even occult cancerous lesions.

### Previous tubal ligation is a risk factor for hysterectomy after rollerball endometrial ablation [^116Y6Mez]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine risk factors for hysterectomy, pelvic pain, and continued menorrhagia after rollerball endometrial ablation.

Methods

All women having rollerball endometrial ablations between 1990 and 2000 were sent standardized questionnaires on pre- and postablation symptoms, satisfaction with the ablation, and subsequent gynecologic surgery. Pathology reports from surgery after the ablation were reviewed when available.

Results

Two hundred forty women had a rollerball ablation during this period and 174 (72.5%) responded to the questionnaire. The average age of women at the time of the ablation was 43.1 years and the mean follow-up time since the ablation was 49 months. Seventy-four percent of women were satisfied with the ablation and 92% reported decreased or absent menstrual bleeding since the ablation. However, 13% of women reported new or worsening pelvic pain symptoms since the ablation and 21 women (12%) had a hysterectomy after the ablation for continued symptoms. A previous tubal ligation was a risk factor for having a hysterectomy (hazard ratio of 3.3, P = 0.03) and for having worsened pelvic pain (hazard ratio of 3.2, P = 0.05) after an ablation. Women who had a previous tubal ligation were more likely to use pain medications for pelvic pain after an ablation. Age over 35 at the time of the ablation was predictive of less bleeding after the ablation. Pathologic findings consistent with the postablation tubal sterilization syndrome were observed in five surgical specimens for an incidence of 6%.

Conclusion

Having a tubal ligation is a risk factor for the development of pelvic pain and for having a hysterectomy after rollerball endometrial ablation. The incidence of pathologically confirmed postablation tubal sterilization syndrome is 6%, but clinical manifestations of this syndrome may be higher. Relatively older age at the time of the ablation is associated with a higher rate of improved bleeding symptoms after ablation.

### Postpartum permanent sterilization: could bilateral salpingectomy replace bilateral tubal ligation? [^116BURsK]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

There has recently been an expansion in the use of bilateral salpingectomy at the time of sterilization to theoretically decrease ovarian cancer risk. We sought to determine if postpartum salpingectomy is equivalent to postpartum bilateral tubal ligation (BTL) in terms of duration, estimated blood loss (EBL), and complication rate.

Design

A retrospective case series (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2).

Setting

An academic inner-city hospital.

Patients

All patients admitted for delivery of full-term intrauterine pregnancy desiring permanent sterilization between March 2014 and March 2015 were included. Excluded patients included those who had sterilization at the time of the cesarean section or other surgical procedure. Two cohorts were identified, those who had a planned postpartum tubal ligation and those having a postpartum salpingectomy.

Interventions

Postpartum sterilization.

Measurements and Main Results

Researchers of this study recorded demographics, medical histories, and abdominal surgical histories for all patients who met the inclusion criteria. Surgical times, EBL, and complication rates were reviewed. Unpaired t test calculations were used to identify differences between age, body mass index, parity, and surgical time between the 2 cohorts. Chi-square tests were used to determine the statistical significance between complication rates, history of abdominal surgery, and past medical history of tubal disease between the 2 cohorts. Eighty women were identified, 64 in the BTL group and 16 in the salpingectomy cohort. The demographics of each cohort were equivocal. The average surgical time was 59.13 and 71.44 minutes in the BTL and salpingectomy cohorts, respectively. Of the 80 patients, only 1 had an EBL greater than 50 mL; this patient was in the BTL group. Four complications were noted in the BTL cohort, but none were evident in the salpingectomy group. There were no documented sterilization failures in the follow-up period (median = 9 months).

Conclusion

Postpartum salpingectomy is slightly longer in duration but with similar blood loss and complication rates. Salpingectomy could be considered in particularly high-risk patients at risk for ovarian cancer when consenting for a postpartum sterilization procedure.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for pain in labor and delivery, more specifically with respect to anesthetic care for postpartum tubal ligation, ASA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider selecting neuraxial techniques in preference to general anesthesia for most postpartum tubal ligations. Recognize that gastric emptying will be delayed in patients who have received opioids during labor. Recognize that an epidural catheter placed for labor may be more likely to fail with longer postdelivery time intervals.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^113zRghU]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Typical-use rates of pregnancy within the year following both tubal ligation and IUC placement were higher in California's Medicaid program than many would expect, at over 2%. In a clinical trial that followed 58,324 European patients with a newly placed IUC for 1 year, only 118 (0.2%) contraceptive failures were identified (26 levonorgestrel, 92 copper), producing a Pearl index of 0.06 (95% CI: 0.04–0.09) for the levonorgestrel IUC and 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42–0.64) for copper IUCs. Although we found higher rates of pregnancy overall, perhaps due to differences in the sexual activity or fecundability of this population compared to the clinical trial participants, we similarly found that pregnancy rates were lower in the one year following placement of a levonorgestrel IUC than a copper IUC. In the U.S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study on surgical sterilization, the cumulative 10-year probability of pregnancy was less than 0.75%; however, current clinical practice for California Medicaid patients appears to differ from that of the centers that participated in this landmark study more than 40 years ago. Whether this is due to variation in tubal ligation techniques or the populations served, as rates of obesity in the United States have increased dramatically over the last 40 years, deserves further study.

### Practice guidelines for obstetric anesthesia: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on obstetric anesthesia and the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology [^111zVF3x]. Anesthesiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Obstetric anesthesia — aspiration prevention with clear liquids, solids, and elective surgery fasting: The oral intake of moderate amounts of clear liquids may be allowed for uncomplicated laboring patients, and the uncomplicated patient undergoing elective surgery (e.g., scheduled cesarean delivery or postpartum tubal ligation) may have clear liquids up to 2 h before induction of anesthesia. Examples of clear liquids include, but are not limited to, water, fruit juices without pulp, carbonated beverages, clear tea, black coffee, and sports drinks, and the volume of liquid ingested is less important than the presence of particulate matter in the liquid ingested. Laboring patients with additional risk factors for aspiration or patients at increased risk for operative delivery may have further restrictions of oral intake, determined on a case-by-case basis. Solid foods should be avoided in laboring patients, and the patient undergoing elective surgery (e.g., scheduled cesarean delivery or postpartum tubal ligation) should undergo a fasting period for solids of 6 to 8 h depending on the type of food ingested (e.g., fat content).

Diagnosis of fallopian tube pathology has been performed with X-rays, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and even nuclear medicine exams. However, fallopian tube interventions are almost exclusively the domain of fluoroscopy. Fallopian tube interventions can be divided into two categories: embolization and recanalization. The former has only recently been described using imaging guidance while the latter has been accepted as a safe and effective procedure since the early 1990s.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive counseling for transgender and gender diverse people who were female sex assigned at birth [^113xwWk8]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations — Permanent contraception for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people assigned female at birth: Some patients may pursue tubal ligation or tubal removal for the primary benefit of contraception; for others, sterilization may be required as part of gender-affirming therapy, or a secondary and perhaps desired effect from gender-affirming surgery to remove internal organs (i.e., hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy). For patients who have undergone fertility preservation treatments such as oocyte cryopreservation, embryo cryopreservation, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation, tubal sterilization is a highly effective method of contraception until attempting assisted reproductive technologies. However, patients should be counseled about the limited data on fertility treatments in TGD patients with unpredictable success rates [83] [GRADE IC]. Providers should also make sure it is clearly documented in the medical record which of a patient's internal reproductive organs have and have not been removed so appropriate screening and medical care can be provided in the future.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^112yfyTC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Long-acting contraceptive procedures performed for Medicaid clients in California, 2008–2014 *.

To estimate the real-world effectiveness of IUCs and tubal ligation for individuals receiving Medicaid-funded healthcare, we examined incidence rates of claims for pregnancy within 12 months post-procedure, censoring participants upon identification of any claims for hysterectomy, oophorectomy, pregnancy, infertility services or consultation, or the end of available data (12/31/14). We further censored participants at the time of a claim indicating IUC removal or any claims for a new or additional form of contraception. We limited this analysis to the first 12 months after IUC placement to reduce the possibility that subsequent gaps in Medicaid enrollment might result in misclassification of individuals whose IUC had been removed. When estimating rates of contraceptive failure, we excluded the < 1% of patients found to have a very early (i.e. a "luteal phase") pregnancy not detected at the time of the contraceptive procedure (defined by pregnancy claim(s) within 30 days following contraceptive procedure or a delivery claim within 180 days following procedure). We used log-linear (Poisson) regression models for person-periods (nested within clusters) to examine associations between these long-acting contraceptive procedures and post-procedure pregnancy rates, adjusting for age group, race/ethnicity, region, year of procedure, months of Medi-Cal enrollment in the 2 years pre-procedure, and baseline health measures (evidenced by claims in the 2 years prior to the index contraceptive procedure indicating obesity, pregnancy (categorized as none, ectopic pregnancy, non-ectopic pregnancy), endometrial ablation, pelvic inflammatory disease, and any contraceptive claims). We selected this approach to modeling because it allows us to account parsimoniously for risk that varies over distinct and possibly censored follow-up periods. Because pregnancy is a qualifying condition for Medi-Cal, participants were not censored from analyses of contraceptive effectiveness if they had gaps in enrollment.

### Oteseconazole (Vivjoa) [^1165gFKj]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

VIVJOA is contraindicated in lactating women and females of reproductive potential. There are no data on the presence of oteseconazole in human or animal milk or data on the effects of oteseconazole on milk production. There were no reported adverse effects in breastfed infants following maternal exposure to oteseconazole during lactation; however, given the limited duration of follow-up of the oteseconazole-exposed infants during the post-natal period, no conclusions can be drawn from these data [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Ocular abnormalities were observed in a pre and postnatal study in the offspring of rats administered oteseconazole from Gestation Day 6 through Lactation Day 20 at doses approximately 3.5 times the recommended human dose based on AUC comparisons [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. The relationship between the observed animal findings and breastfed infants is unknown.

8.3 Females of Reproductive Potential

VIVJOA is contraindicated in females of reproductive potential based on animal findings. The drug exposure window of approximately 690 days (based on 5 times the half-life of oteseconazole) precludes adequate mitigation of the embryo-fetal toxicity risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Females who are NOT of reproductive potential are defined as: persons who are biological females who are postmenopausal or have another reason for permanent infertility (e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy).

8.4 Pediatric Use

VIVJOA is contraindicated in females of reproductive potential. Based on animal studies, VIVJOA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or potential harm to the breastfed infant. The drug exposure window of approximately 690 days (based on 5 times the half-life of oteseconazole) precludes adequate mitigation of the embryo-fetal toxicity risks associated with VIVJOA use [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The safety and effectiveness of VIVJOA have not been established in pre-menarchal pediatric females.

### The time interval between laparoscopic tubal ligation and frozen-thawed embryo transfer does not affect the reproductive outcomes [^1138294u]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical treatment of tubal disease prior to IVF is beneficial for increasing the pregnancy and live birth rate. The following surgical treatments for tubal disease were considered: salpingectomy, tubal occlusion, salpingostomy and hydrosalpinx ligation. Each treatment has its own merits and drawbacks. Salpingectomy comes with the advantage of having the chronically infected tissue removed totally, thus eliminating the risk of abscess formation or torsion and increasing the accessibility of the ovary during oocyte retrieval in IVF. Drawbacks, however, related to the invasiveness of the procedure itself and the difficult procedure required when there are dense adhesions. Furthermore, it has been suggested that salpingectomy may affect ovarian function by interfering with ovarian blood flow. Proximal tubal occlusion with Essure® devices placed hysteroscopically can be considered for specific cases of distorted pelvic anatomy or pelvic adhesions. However, low clinical pregnancy and live birth rates have been reported from the use of tubal occlusion devices. Salpingostomy was thought to have the advantage of being less invasive and safer than salpingectomy while allowing the woman to attempt natural conception. The disadvantages mentioned include a possibility of hydrosalpinx recurrence and a high risk of ectopic pregnancy rate (10%).

Chu et al. reported a high risk of ectopic pregnancy at 10% after hydrosalpinx salpingostomy. Salpingectomy also carries an increased risk of interstitial pregnancy. Wang et al. identified 43 cases of interstitial pregnancy, of which 71% had undergone bilateral salpingectomy before IVF. In our present study, the ectopic pregnancy rate after hydrosalpinx ligation was 0–4.1% in cleavage-stage embryo FET cycles, with a decrease in ectopic pregnancy incidence over time. In our blastocyst-stage embryo FET cycles, none of the patients suffered ectopic pregnancy. This suggests that ectopic pregnancy rate may be decreased by delaying cleavage-stage embryo FET or by transferring blastocyst-stage embryos.

The advantage of proximal tubal ligation over salpingectomy is that this surgery can easily be performed and it does not damage ovarian reserve as compared to salpingectomy. In our center, we combined laparoscopic proximal tubal ligation with salpingostomy to reduce the damage of hydrosalpinx on adjacent organs and tissues.

### A novel machine learning model for predicting clinical pregnancy after laparoscopic tubal anastomosis [^117BoGSs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although there are several options for postpartum contraception, tubal ligation remains one of the conventional methods among women who have already given birth to two children. Many reasons, such as the loss of children or divorce followed by remarriage, may provide women who have undergone tubal ligation the desire to have additional children. For these patients, an alternate therapeutic option is either surgery or in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer(IVF-ET). However, IVF-ET has some potential complications or risks, including multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Tubal anastomosis is regarded as a cost-effective operation to reconstruct the structure and function of the fallopian tubes and is the only way for patients to conceive naturally after tubal ligation. Successful tubal anastomosis allows natural conception in each ovulation cycle. For patients with a history of tubal sterilization, most are of advanced maternal age, and the optimal reproductive age is missed, so there is an urgent need for patients to know the probability of pregnancy after undergoing LTA. For physicians, it is also necessary to know the postoperative pregnancy rate to provide patients with more individualized and effective pregnancy treatment protocols.

Currently, there is no good prediction model for predicting the probability of pregnancy after LTA. Some patients miss the optimal period for IVF and waste considerable time and medical resources. Therefore, an effective prediction model is needed to predict and manage those patients to facilitate more individualized clinical decisions. Machine learning has been increasingly used in medical practice due to its potential to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. The application of machine learning methods has improved artificial intelligence and has been used in clinical prediction. LASSO regression is a machine learning technique for linear regression that employs L1 regularization to build models and select variables. By penalizing the model coefficients, L1 regularization shrinks certain coefficients to zero, thereby facilitating variable selection. The key advantage of Lasso regression is its ability to efficiently choose variables, reduce model complexity, and prevent overfitting. This method is particularly effective in analyzing high-dimensional data and can autonomously determine the best set of features, reducing the need for manual selection. In this study, we propose a LASSO regression model that takes advantage of patients' baseline clinical parameters, preoperative laboratory tests, and intraoperative pelvic conditions to predict postoperative pregnancy rates.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 208 summary: benefits and risks of sterilization [^1155FGV3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Female and male sterilization are both safe and effective methods of permanent contraception used by more than 220 million couples worldwide (1). Approximately 600,000 tubal occlusions and 200,000 vasectomies are performed in the United States annually (2–4). For women seeking permanent contraception, sterilization obviates the need for user-dependent contraception throughout their reproductive years and provides an excellent alternative for those with medical contraindications to reversible methods. The purpose of this document is to review the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of female sterilization in comparison with male sterilization and other forms of contraception.

### Safety and efficacy of hysteroscopic sterilization compared with laparoscopic sterilization: an observational cohort study [^115U2N3H]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The risks of experiencing unintended pregnancy after hysteroscopic and laparoscopic sterilization were higher in our study than those reported in previous studies. The US Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study in the 1990s reported that the cumulative 10 year probability of pregnancy following tubal ligation was 1.3%. The risk of unintended pregnancy following tubal ligation was believed to be lower than 1% during the first year after procedure. Meanwhile, hysteroscopic sterilization was shown to be 99.83% effective based on a five year clinical study. The newly released long term follow-up of a phase III study observed no pregnancy following hysteroscopic sterilization. A retrospective study from France conducted from 2006 to 2010 reported pregnancy rates of 0.36% and 0.46% after hysteroscopic and laparoscopic sterilization procedures respectively.

Several factors may have contributed to the difference between our findings and prior evidence on unintended pregnancies. The published data were mostly based on highly selected clinical investigations or small studies. Clinical trials are conducted in a way different from real world settings and usually include only patients who are the best candidates for the procedure. For example, patients with history of pelvic inflammatory disease were not well represented in prior investigations. We conducted subgroup analyses of pelvic inflammatory disease patients and found significantly higher risk of pregnancy in this subgroup following both procedures. In addition, single or multicenter studies were usually conducted at selected high volume medical facilities, which perform better than most facilities in the entire state or country. The study from France was a population based study, but it captured pregnancy only through discharge records of hospitalization for pregnancy or delivery. This may lead to underestimation of risk of unintended pregnancy following procedures, with the omission of miscarriage or abortion not requiring hospitalization. Our study was able to identify prenatal tests following sterilization and provide more accurate estimates. In addition, sterilization is indicated for women aged over 40 in France, who had lower probability of pregnancy. In our subgroup analyses of women aged over 40 years, pregnancy risk was similar to that reported in the French cohort.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of intrauterine contraception and tubal ligation [^113uyQZP]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To examine the comparative safety of these methods, we tabulated the proportion of patients who had claims that might indicate a procedural complication within 30 days of procedure. For example, we used multiple ICD-9 codes (available from authors) to identify claims related to surgical site infections, fever, and septicemia which we categorized as "infection" and separately examined ICD-9 codes indicating "pelvic inflammatory disease". After noting higher-than-expected rates of hysterectomy at the time of tubal ligation, we used a multivariable logistic model to examine variables associated with hysterectomy at the time of tubal ligation. We then tabulated the proportion of patients who had any claims indicating post-procedural pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, genitourinary pain, abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms, non-abdominal pain, or abnormal uterine bleeding (the ICD-9 and CPT codes used to specify these variables are available from the authors by request). We calculated the number of days with one or more claims indicating each of these conditions per 100 patients days during each of the following time periods: (a) on the day of the procedure, (b) days 2–90, (c) days 91–180, and (d) days 181–365 post-procedure. For each of these time periods, we created separate generalized estimating equation (GEE Poisson) models to examine the significance of differences in the rate at which patients had claims for (a) pelvic pain, (b) pelvic inflammatory disease, (c) abnormal uterine bleeding, (d) abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms, (e) genitourinary pain, and (f) non-abdominal pain in the year following their contraceptive procedure, adjusting all models for age group, race/ethnicity, region, year of procedure, Medi-Cal program funding procedure, Charlson comorbidity index, concomitant endometrial ablation, months of Medi-Cal enrollment in 2 years pre-procedure (log transformed), and claims in the 2 years pre-procedure indicating obesity, fibroids, pregnancy, pelvic pain, abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms, genitourinary pain, non-abdominal pain, menorrhagia, pelvic inflammatory disease, and any contraceptive use, and censoring observation at the time of pregnancy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, IUC removal, switch to another type of IUC, placement of a contraceptive implant or tubal ligation, enrollment gaps of more than 3 months, or end of data availability on December 31, 2014. This study was approved by the UC Davis Institutional Review Board as protocol 1074677–5.

Values shown in bold are statistically significant, at the level of p < 0.05

Complications and additional procedures were significantly more common within 30 days of laparoscopic tubal ligation than IUC placement (Table 4). Acute hemorrhage complicated less than 0.03% of IUC placements but 0.80% of tubal ligations. Similarly, claims related to infections were less common following IUC placement than tubal ligation (0.35% vs 2.91%). Hysterectomy, which may have been planned in advance, was performed at the time of 3.96% of tubal ligations but less than 0.01% of IUC placements. After adjusting for covariates, we found that hysterectomy performed at the time of tubal ligation most commonly involved younger patients, and those who had claims for fibroids and/or menorrhagia in the 2 years prior to their procedure, and/or who had an endometrial ablation on the day of their procedure (data not shown in tables).

Claims for pelvic, abdominal, and genitourinary pain decreased with time following both IUC placement and tubal ligation. However, more than 6 months post-procedure, claims for such pain were significantly more common following tubal ligation than IUC placement, after adjusting for claims related to pain in the 2 years prior to the index procedure and censoring observation at the time of hysterectomy or oophorectomy (Table 5). No significant difference was appreciated in rates of pelvic inflammatory disease more than 6 months post-procedure.

Obstetric anesthesia practice guidelines — scope and objectives — define obstetric anesthesia for these updated guidelines as peripartum anesthetic and analgesic activities performed during labor and vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, removal of retained placenta, and postpartum tubal ligation. The purposes are to enhance the quality of anesthetic care for obstetric patients, improve patient safety by reducing the incidence and severity of anesthesia-related complications, and increase patient satisfaction, and the focus is the anesthetic management of pregnant patients during labor, nonoperative delivery, operative delivery, and selected aspects of postpartum care and analgesia, including neuraxial options for postpartum analgesia after neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery.

### Association of pregnancy with recurrence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among women with prior coronary artery dissection [^112cPfuX]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

It is reassuring that the majority of women tolerated pregnancy and lactation after SCAD without substantial complications. Given the potential severe consequences of a recurrent SCAD for which there are not yet preventive strategies, our findings should be interpreted with caution. This study does not constitute sufficient evidence to revise current recommendations to avoid pregnancy after SCAD (Box) with preferred contraceptive options being partner sterilization, tubal ligation, or intrauterine devices. The pregnant state represents a cardiovascular "stress test" with physiologic increases in blood volume, heart rate, and cardiac output that may especially affect women with residual cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, or those requiring specific medications. Should SCAD recur, pregnancy-associated SCAD has been observed as having a severe presentation.

Box.
Summary of Clinical Considerations

The fundamental desire for biological children can be paramount for some women, and they may proceed with planned or unplanned pregnancy despite these recommendations. Our findings indicate that not all women with pregnancy after a SCAD MI are ultimately destined to have another SCAD. Rather, an unremarkable clinical course was most often observed. If a woman strongly desires pregnancy or continues with an unintended pregnancy after SCAD, counseling is critical with input from a multidisciplinary "pregnancy heart team" comprised of specialists in cardiology, maternal-fetal medicine, and anesthesiology. Recommendations should be guided by current consensus statements and risk stratifications, thereby tailoring advice to the patient's personal cardiac history and medication regimen. Considerations specific to SCAD include knowing the presence of FMD and other arterial abnormalities such as aneurysms in other arteries, understanding the current cardiac function, and reviewing any ongoing symptomology. An important caveat is that the women in this series who presented with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction at the time of SCAD recovered to a normal or near-normal ejection fraction before pregnancy. Outcomes may not be as reassuring among women with persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction or other active concerns, such as chronic angina. For instance, a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30% is associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality and considered a contraindication to pregnancy according to the modified World Health Organization criteria, regardless of origin.

### Why-UD? Assessing the requirement to trial an intrauterine device as a condition for elective sterilisation in female patients [^1154Lwnz]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Other ICBs, however, do not make access to sterilisation contingent on acceptance of the IUD. For example, Gloucestershire ICB's policy requires that, 'The patient has received counselling about all other forms of contraceptives. Long-acting reversible contraception has been discussed, tried, refused or deemed unsuitable'. Likewise, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough ICB require that: '[Patients] have received counselling about the availability of alternative, long-term and highly effective, contraceptive methods and females have been offered a trial of long-acting reversible contraception'.

In the British Pregnancy Advisory Service's report on IVF (mentioned above), local policies on IVF provision were critically evaluated against the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The NICE guidelines recommend that three IVF cycles should be offered to women aged under 40 years, and one cycle to women aged 40–42. We may begin with a similar comparison, and note that the NICE guidelines for considering elective sterilisation requests recommend that — in line with promoting fully informed consent — patients are fully aware of, and understand the risks and benefits of, all possible forms of contraception. However, they do not recommend that trying an alternative method of contraceptive be required as a condition for approving sterilisation.

In examining what I will hereafter refer to as the IUD requirement, I am interested in whether this is a justifiable condition on access to sterilisation. Since this policy pertains to conditional access to sterilisation, rather than denial of sterilisation requests, the question of whether sterilisation is itself medically necessary or justified is not relevant. I am also not interested in justifying access to elective sterilisation per se, or addressing the sexism that particularly underpins denial of sterilisation requests by young and childless women; these discussions have been given detailed consideration elsewhere in recent years. I take it as read that both men and women have an equal right to control of their reproductive autonomy, and that sterilisation and contraception (including long-acting contraception) are not equivalent in their nature or value for the patient. If the NHS offers vasectomy to male patients, it should also offer tubal ligation or other forms of female sterilisation.

### Female tubal sterilization: the time has come to routinely consider removal [^114eTzg6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Female sterilization, one of the most effective forms of pregnancy prevention, can be performed remote from pregnancy (interval sterilization) or around the time of delivery. Modern methods for sterilization include tubal interruption, salpingectomy, and transcervical sterilization. Tubal interruption has been the primary method for interval sterilization for decades, developing as a means of rapid intra-abdominal laparoscopic surgery at a time when instrumentation and operating systems were less sophisticated than today. New evidence that the most common ovarian cancer, serous adenocarcinoma, frequently may start in the Fallopian tube, has increased research and clinical use of salpingectomy as a preferred method for sterilization. With studies showing that the surgical risks with tubal interruption and salpingectomy are likely equivalent, even when performed at cesarean delivery, the rationale seems to be in place to change our clinical practice. However, we should ask why this revelation has not occurred sooner, even though surgical techniques have advanced and salpingectomy, unlike tubal occlusion or hysteroscopic sterilization, does not leave patients at risk for future intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy. We should not have started thinking about salpingectomy for female sterilization only once a decrease in ovarian cancer risk became part of the equation. Providers' failure to offer this option means that women and their true desires were not part of the conversation. If we had included the patient in the discussion, perhaps the higher efficacy of salpingectomy would have been what women desired all along.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^111Ztw8v]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy testing and endoscopy — pregnancy itself does not contraindicate endoscopy, but pregnancy status may guide planning; testing thresholds depend on context. Although pregnancy is not a contraindication to endoscopic procedures and the use of moderate sedation, there are situations when it is important to be aware of pregnancy status because it may affect procedural aspects such as use of fluoroscopy and choice of sedation agents, and when possible it is advisable to avoid or delay elective endoscopic procedures until after delivery or to take appropriate measures to lessen potential risk if delay is not possible. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) states that "the literature is inadequate to inform patients or physicians on whether anesthesia causes harmful effects on early pregnancy", and β-human chorionic gonadotropin testing before surgery is recommended, but not mandated, by the ASA. Pregnancy testing may be considered in women of childbearing age with an uncertain or suggestive history unless they have had a total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or have had absent menses for 1 year (menopause), and the threshold for pregnancy testing should be lower when fluoroscopy use is planned.

### Tubal ligation and age at natural menopause [^115cr2mc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of tubal ligation on age at natural menopause, as a marker of long-term ovarian function.

Methods

Three preexisting population-based cohorts were included in this cross-sectional study. Data from each cohort was analyzed separately. The cohorts were restricted to women who never smoked and had reached natural menopause, without prior hysterectomy or oophorectomy. The following variables were collected: race, age at menarche, age at menopause, history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy, gravidity and parity, tobacco use, and ever use of hormonal contraception. The type of tubal ligation and age at tubal ligation were manually abstracted in cohort 1. For cohorts 2 and 3, history of tubal ligation was obtained from an institutional form, completed by patient report. The primary outcome, age at natural menopause, was compared between the two groups (those with and without a history of tubal ligation).

Results

Inclusion criteria was met by 555 women from cohort 1, 1,816 women from cohort 2, and 1,534 women from cohort 3. Baseline characteristics did not differ between cohorts. The percentage with tubal ligation was the same in all cohorts: 26.0%, 25.5%, and 25.0%, respectively. Women with a tubal ligation were more likely to have had at least one pregnancy and to have used hormonal contraception compared with women without a tubal ligation. There was no significant difference in age at natural menopause in women who underwent tubal ligation (50.1, 49.9, 50.0 years, respectively) compared with those who did not (50.7, 49.6, 50.0 years, respectively). The type of tubal ligation (cohort 1 only) had no effect on age at menopause.

Conclusions

Tubal ligation did not affect age at natural menopause in the three large cohorts included in this study.

### Do menstrual problems increase after tubal ligation? [^113Z9RA7]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Tubal ligation is the most common method of contraception used in the United States. It is considered safe and highly effective. However, since the early 1950s, the existence of a "posttubal ligation syndrome" has been debated. The hallmark of this syndrome is an increased risk of menstrual abnormalities. Moreover, results from one study indicated that women who have this surgery were four to five times more likely to have a subsequent hysterectomy; results from a second study showed that 41 percent of the women who underwent hysterectomy had a previous tubal sterilization. To make further determinations about this issue, Peterson and colleagues reported data from the U. S. Collaborative Review of Sterilization, a large prospective study evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of tubal ligation. The U. S.

Collaborative Review was started in 1978 and included women between 18 and 44 years of age who were undergoing tubal sterilization at one of several institutions throughout the country. A second group of women whose partners had undergone vasectomy was added to the study later. All women were followed by annual telephone interviews for five to 14 years and were asked to describe their three most recent menstrual periods. Six features of periods that were addressed were duration of bleeding, length of cycle, bleeding or spotting between cycles, cycle irregularity, amount of menstrual pain and amount of bleeding. The findings from the tubal sterilization group were compared with findings from the group whose partners had undergone vasectomy. The primary outcomes of interest were changes in various features of the menstrual cycle.

Adjusting for age, race and baseline menstrual characteristics, women in the surgery group were more likely to report persistent decreases in the amount of bleeding and days of bleeding, and in menstrual pain. These women were also more likely to report a persistent increase in cycle irregularity. However, when analysis of the data was limited to women who had their most recent natural cycles immediately before surgery, the differences noted above were no longer statistically significant. The authors also noted no differences in the various aspects of the menstrual periods in relation to one of the six methods used for sterilization. The authors conclude on the basis of this data that tubal sterilization does not result in a post-tubal ligation syndrome. Women who undergo this procedure are actually more likely to experience a decrease in the amount and duration of bleeding.

The authors state that past observations of an association between tubal sterilization and menstrual abnormalities are coincidental and attributable to the fact that both events occur commonly.

### Advances in ovarian cancer research-NCI… [^113Kuags]. NCI (2022). Medium credibility.

Research has shown that the most common type of ovarian cancer begins in the fallopian tubes, not in the ovaries. This discovery has led doctors to reconsider ways of preventing ovarian cancer. Removing fallopian tubes only. An ongoing NCI-supported clinical trial is testing whether removing the fallopian tubes but delaying removal of the ovaries will be as safe and effective to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in women with BRCA1mutations as removing both the ovaries and fallopian tubes at the same time. This would allow women to maintain premenopausal levels of hormones produced by the ovaries and delay many of the complications associated with menopause. Removal of fallopian tubes in people seeking to prevent pregnancy. The discovery that epithelial ovarian cancers most often start in the fallopian tubes has also led to changes in the way some gynecologists approach surgery to prevent pregnancy.

Women seeking tubal ligation to prevent pregnancy may be offered the option of having their tubes removed instead. Doing so might reduce the possibility of ovarian cancer in the future. Removal of fallopian tubes in people undergoing a hysterectomy. Similarly, some gynecologists recommend that their patients who are undergoing a hysterectomy also have their fallopian tubes removed. Platinum-based chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, given in combination with other drugs, such as the targeted therapy bevacizumab, are usually effective in treating epithelial ovarian cancer at any stage. However, in most people with advanced ovarian cancer, the cancer comes back. Treating the cancer again with platinum drugs may work, but eventually the tumors become resistant to these drugs.

Clinical trials have shown that using PARP inhibitors as long-term therapy in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer delayed progression of the cancer. A different targeted therapy, mirvetuximab soravtansine, is now available to treat women with ovarian cancer that is no longer responding to platinum drugs. FDA recently approved the drug to treat people with platinum-resistant ovarian tumors that produce an excess of a protein called FR-α. Results from a large clinical trial showed that people with this type of ovarian cancer treated with mirvetuximab lived longer overall than people treated with standard chemotherapy. Secondary Surgery For women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer that has come back after being in remission, clinical trials have studied the use of secondary surgery or surgery to remove more tumor after the initial surgery with varying results.

### Changes in permanent contraception among young women and men after the dobbs decision… [^115RJUw9]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

eTable. Diagnosis and Billing Codes Used to Identify Tubal Ligation, Vasectomy, and Encounters for Evaluation and Management Data Sharing Statement The dotted vertical line indicates the Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization decision. On June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned the constitutional right to abortion, permitting states to further restrict or ban abortion care. As of January 2024, 21 states have done so. 1 This structural barrier to exercising control over pregnancy and childbearing will indirectly affect contraceptive decision-making. Early research has documented increased demand for permanent contraception in the months following Dobbs, including tubal sterilization and vasectomy. 2, 3 This change may reflect fears of restricted access to abortion and/or contraception.

However, no research, to our knowledge, has evaluated the differential effect of Dobbs on permanent contraception among men relative to women or among younger adults who are more likely to have an abortion and to experience sterilization regret. 4, 5 We therefore evaluated changes in tubal ligation and vasectomy following Dobbs among younger adults. Using monthly aggregate counts of tubal ligations and vasectomies, we calculated rates per 100 000 person-months among female and male patients aged 18 to 30 years. Individuals with an encounter for evaluation and management each month and no permanent contraception documented previously were included in the denominator. Visits for evaluation and management, tubal sterilization, and vasectomy procedures were identified using Current Procedural Terminology and International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes. Two-sided P <. 05 indicated statistical significance.
