## Question

A homeowner resides downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She has sued both the owner of the facility and the supplier of a solvent used at the facility. She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?

Answer Choices:
A. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.
B. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.
C. Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.
D. Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the court should grant the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment in a groundwater contamination case where the facility owner and the solvent supplier allegedly contributed indeterminate amounts to an indivisible injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal framework for joint and several liability in tort law. Then, I should verify whether the injury here is indivisible and whether concerted action is required. Next, I will examine the defendant's argument about unallocatable damages and whether that defeats liability. Finally, I will consider the implications of vicarious liability and choose the best answer among the options provided.

> Let me first confirm the core legal principle. In tort law, when multiple independent actors commit tortious acts that produce a single, indivisible injury, each tortfeasor can be held jointly and severally liable for the entire harm, even if their respective contributions cannot be precisely apportioned. This is the classic concurrent tortfeasor rule and does not require proof that the defendants acted in concert, which distinguishes it from concerted-action theories of liability [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify whether the injury here is indivisible. The homeowner alleges that contaminants from the facility and from the supplier's spills have migrated into soil, groundwater, and her well, creating a single, ongoing contamination that cannot be neatly separated into distinct harms attributable to each defendant. That factual pattern typically constitutes an indivisible injury for tort purposes, which supports joint and several liability rather than a requirement to allocate damages by percentage of fault at the liability stage [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the defendant's allocation argument. The solvent supplier contends that because the contributions are indeterminate, the plaintiff cannot prove how much damage each defendant caused and therefore summary judgment should be granted. But that is exactly the scenario in which joint and several liability applies: when harm is indivisible and causation is established against multiple tortfeasors, each can be held liable for the whole, leaving allocation issues to contribution or indemnity claims among the defendants rather than defeating the plaintiff's recovery [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether concerted action is necessary. The supplier's motion emphasizes there is no evidence the facility owner and supplier acted in concert. That matters for concerted-action liability, but it does not undermine joint and several liability for concurrent tortfeasors who independently cause an indivisible injury. Thus, the absence of concerted action does not warrant summary judgment here [^notfound].

> Let me consider vicarious liability, just to be thorough. Vicarious liability typically requires a special relationship like employer–employee or principal–agent. There is no indication the supplier is vicariously liable for the facility owner's conduct, so option B's rationale is off-base for this fact pattern, even though the outcome it proposes (deny summary judgment) aligns with the correct result [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the correct answer is that the court should deny summary judgment because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury, even when precise allocation of damages is not possible at the liability stage. Therefore, the motion should be denied and the case should proceed to determine damages, with any allocation among defendants handled separately [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury [^notfound].

---

The court should **deny summary judgment** because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury, even when the exact share of harm from each tortfeasor cannot be apportioned [^notfound]. The plaintiff need only prove that each defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the contamination; the burden then shifts to defendants to prove divisibility, which they have not done here [^notfound]. Options B, C, and D are incorrect: there is no vicarious liability without a special relationship, indivisible harm supports joint liability, and concerted action is not required for joint and several liability in this context [^notfound].

---

## Legal framework: joint and several liability

Joint and several liability applies when multiple tortfeasors independently cause an indivisible injury; each is liable for the entire harm, and the plaintiff may recover the full amount from any defendant, who may then seek contribution from the others [^notfound]. This doctrine is well-established in tort law and is particularly relevant in environmental contamination cases where harm is often indivisible [^notfound].

---

## Application to the present case

In this case, the plaintiff alleges that both the facility owner and the solvent supplier independently contributed to the contamination of her property, resulting in an indivisible injury. The solvent supplier's argument — that the plaintiff cannot apportion the exact amount of damage attributable to each defendant — is precisely the scenario in which joint and several liability applies [^notfound]. The plaintiff is not required to prove the exact proportion of harm caused by each defendant; rather, she must demonstrate that each defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the contamination [^notfound].

---

## Burden of proof and apportionment

Under joint and several liability, once the plaintiff establishes that each defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the indivisible injury, the burden shifts to the defendants to prove divisibility of harm. If the defendants cannot apportion the harm, they remain jointly and severally liable for the entire injury [^notfound]. In this case, the solvent supplier has not presented evidence demonstrating that the harm is divisible or that the exact proportion of harm attributable to each defendant can be determined [^notfound].

---

## Rejection of alternative arguments

- **Option B (vicarious liability)**: Vicarious liability requires a special relationship, such as employer-employee or principal-agent. There is no indication of such a relationship between the facility owner and the solvent supplier, making vicarious liability inapplicable [^notfound].

- **Option C (no basis for allocation)**: This argument misunderstands joint and several liability. The inability to allocate damages is precisely why joint and several liability exists, ensuring that the plaintiff can recover full compensation from any responsible party [^notfound].

- **Option D (no concerted action)**: Concerted action is not required for joint and several liability. Independent tortious conduct causing an indivisible injury is sufficient to establish joint and several liability [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The court should **deny the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment** because joint and several liability applies when multiple tortfeasors independently cause an indivisible injury, even if the exact proportion of harm cannot be apportioned [^notfound]. The plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish that both defendants' negligence contributed to the contamination, and the solvent supplier has not demonstrated divisibility of harm [^notfound]. Therefore, the case should proceed to trial, where the defendants may present evidence regarding apportionment and seek contribution from each other if necessary [^notfound].

Private well siting and inspection—distances for certain systems may be listed as no less than 50 feet, 75 feet, or 100 feet, depending on the state, and large agricultural facilities with livestock, termed concentrated animal feeding operations, which are animal feeding operations housing 1000 animal units or more, are especially likely to be potential sources of groundwater contamination. When siting a new well or when there is concern about contamination of an existing well, consultation with the local health department should be sought, and the well should be on relatively high ground (for example, uphill from septic tanks). If a homeowner is in doubt about the safety or integrity of the well, inspection by the state or county health department or a licensed well contractor should be arranged; if there is a flood or if the well housing is damaged, professional inspection is warranted. Inspection of a private well should be triggered by the sale of a residence, if evidence of a recent previous inspection is unavailable.

Source location and contamination separation for water supplies—The location of any source of water under consideration as a potable supply, whether individual or community, should be carefully evaluated for potential sources of contamination, and as a general practice, the maximum distance that economics, land ownership, geology, and topography will allow should separate a water source from potential contamination sources; Table 8.1 details some of the sources of contamination and gives minimum distances recommended by EPA to separate pollution sources from the water source. For wells and springs, test the water for bacteriologic quality with several samples taken over a period of time to establish a history on the source, and with few exceptions, surface water and groundwater sources are always presumed to be bacteriologically unsafe and, as a minimum, must be disinfected; additionally, analyze for chemical quality (both legal and aesthetic standards), determine the quantity needed for the intended purpose (drinking water quality needs to be evaluated under the SDWA), determine the economical and technical restraints, and treat if necessary and feasible. Minimum surface distances from a well include examples such as septic tank—50 feet, petroleum tanks—100 feet, and manure stacks—250 feet.

Transportation of contaminated human remains—release standards and container requirements state that prior to release for transport, medical examiners should meet the same standards as for release to a funeral home – no loose surface contamination or shrapnel, and the carrier should require the medical examiner to certify that he has met this standard prior to accepting contaminated human remains. Decedents are normally transported in sealed containers; the standards imposed by the airlines or by states for transport of uncontaminated remains are more than adequate, and the presence of radioactive material imposes no additional requirements for the shipping container. Internal contamination is not volatile; once a person dies, whatever radioactive material is in the body will stay there until it is eliminated by natural radioactive decay, and dose rates outside a body with internal contamination will be small.

Cisterns—rainwater catchment limitations and safety measures are highlighted: A cistern is a watertight, traditionally underground reservoir that is filled with rainwater draining from the roof of a building. Cisterns will not provide an ample supply of water for any extended period of time, unless the amount of water used is severely restricted. Because the water is coming off the roof, a pipe is generally installed to allow redirection of the first few minutes of rainwater until the water flows clear. Disinfection is, nevertheless, of utmost importance, and diverting the first flow of water does not assure safe, non-polluted water because chemicals and biologic waste from birds and other animals can migrate from catchment surfaces and from windblown sources. In addition, rainwater has a low pH, which can corrode plumbing pipes and fixtures if not treated.

Numerous examples of chemical contamination of food, water, or medication have led to steps by regulatory agencies to maintain the safety of this critical social infrastructure and supply chain. Identification of contaminant site is important. Environmental testing and biomonitoring can define the nature and extent of the event and are useful for providing objective information, but may be unavailable in time for clinical care. Clinical diagnosis should be based on toxidrome recognition and assessment of public health implications. There are several resources available to assist and these can be accessed through regional poison control centers or local/state public health departments.

Zoning and housing inspection—compliance and coordination outlines that zoning inspectors are essential and may also be building or housing inspectors, with compliance determined by comparing actual land use with the zoning map; when a violation is observed owners are notified and have the right to request a hearing before the Zoning Board of Adjustment (also called the Zoning Board of Appeals in some cities), and the board may uphold the enforcement officer or rule in favor of the property owner; if the zoning officer is upheld the owner may appeal to the courts, otherwise the violation must be corrected to conform to the zoning code; effective zoning enforcement helps sustain housing code standards such as occupancy, ventilation, light, and unimpeded egress, and building or housing inspectors can aid zoning inspectors; close collaboration is critical where roles are separate, and illegally converted properties are often the most substandard and contain especially dangerous housing code violations.

Robustness analyses

We did several additional analyses to test the robustness of our results. First, we repeated our primary analyses as robust linear mixed-effects models, using the robustlmm package in R. These models detect outliers or other sources of contamination in the data that may affect model validity, and perform a de-weighting procedure based on the extent of contamination introduced. Next, we performed a bootstrapping procedure intended to probe how frequently the parameter estimate observed in the children from households below poverty alone would be expected to be observed in a larger population of children from households above poverty (Supplement S6). We also performed a permutation procedure to examine the extent to which the model parameters from the children from above-poverty households alone could explain the data in the children from households below-poverty (Supplement S7). Finally, given that the children from households below-poverty had significantly more motion than children living above poverty, we repeated our primary analyses with only those children who met an extremely stringent motion threshold of 0.2 mm (Supplement S8), and those who provided the most frames of usable data (Supplement S9).

Indoor air pollutants and toxic materials—Asbestos management and professional assessment for homes emphasize that “Homeowners who believe material in their home may be asbestos should not disturb the material,” and “Generally, material in good condition will not release asbestos fibers, and there is little danger unless the fibers are released and inhaled into the lungs.” “Suspected asbestos-containing material should be checked regularly for damage from abrasions, tears, or water. If possible, access to the area should be limited.” Certain products “should be discarded if damaged or worn,” and “If asbestos material is more than slightly damaged, or if planned changes in the home might disturb it, repair or removal by a professional is needed.” “Only a trained professional can confirm suspected asbestos materials… This individual will take samples for analysis and submit them to an EPA-approved laboratory.” If in good shape and not disturbed, “the best approach is to take no action and continue to monitor the material,” but if action is needed “there are two approaches to correcting the problem: repair and removal.” “Repair involves sealing or covering the asbestos material,” and “Covering (enclosing) involves placing something over or around the material that contains asbestos to prevent release of fibers… Exposed insulated piping may be covered with a protective wrap or jacket.” “Both major and minor repairs must be done only by a professional trained in methods for safely handling asbestos.” For removal, it “is usually the most expensive and, unless required by state or local regulations, should be the last option considered in most situations,” because it “poses the greatest risk for fiber release,” though “removal may be required when remodeling or making major changes to the home that will disturb asbestos material.” “Removal is complex and must be done only by a contractor with special training. Improper removal of asbestos material may create more of a problem than simply leaving it alone.”

### Testimony by otolaryngologists in defense of tobacco companies 2009-2014 [^4d12de34]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

The tobacco industry strategy is based upon the assumption that juries may be swayed by long lists of theoretical causes, which tend to resonate with the public's belief that a wide variety of environmental, occupational, and dietary exposures cause cancer. An obvious fallacy of this argument lies in the fact that literally billions of nonsmoking people are exposed regularly to gasoline fumes, use cleaning solvents, eat salted fish, or live in urban environments. Were these causative factors for head and neck cancer, with even a minute fraction of the potency of tobacco, the rate of head and neck cancer among nonsmokers would be much greater than what has been observed. Among habitual smokers, it is not credible to opine that rare and hypothetical causes, taken singly or as a lengthy list, are more likely than causative than tobacco to a degree remotely approaching  > 50%.

In another example of bias, witnesses were selective in their claims of expertise willing to opine on subjects such as environmental and industrial toxicology, domains not typically within the expertise of an otolaryngologist. During testimony, multiple witnesses refused to agree that nicotine is addictive, citing lack of expertise, even though it has been widely accepted by the medical profession for decades. A central pillar of tobacco defense legal strategy is to maintain that the smoker has cancer due to personal choice rather than having been ensnared by addiction. Witnesses also denied the validity of widely recognized authoritative sources such as Surgeon General's reports

In summary, the IMF problem in the United States has become more deadly and more diverse. It is critical that data from law enforcement investigations continue to be collected and analyzed, especially with respect to purity and price. However, this will not be enough. Data collection on the illegal drug supply should be enhanced with information from people who use these substances (e.g. more qualitative research, resuscitating the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program) as well as information from new sources (e.g. wastewater testing). Synthesizing information from all these sources will make it easier to monitor changes in IMF consumption and supply, and to evaluate efforts intended to reduce IMF‐involved deaths and other harms.

### Guidance on microbial contamination in previously flooded outdoor areas [^7db66587]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Guidance on microbial contamination in previously flooded outdoor areas—risk assessment scope and directives specify that this guidance was developed for public health authorities, emergency response managers, and government decision makers and defines how to assess the public health risks for using outdoor areas after a flood event where potential exposure to microbial contamination exists. It emphasizes that this guidance is not intended to serve as a conclusive determination on public access and use of previously flooded outdoor areas and that it addresses concerns associated only with microbial contamination after a flood event, noting that chemical contamination issues associated with flood events are not addressed in this document. It states that health authorities should characterize potential health exposure risks posed by flood waters on a case-by-case basis, and describes risk characterization as identifying potential contamination sources, determining factors that may influence microbial concentration and survival, determining the potential effect on exposed populations, and considering the intended use for previously flooded outdoor areas.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)—indoor sources, health effects, and mitigation: Organic chemicals that vaporize and become gases at normal room temperature are collectively known as VOCs, and levels of approximately a dozen common VOCs can be two to five times higher inside the home, as opposed to outside, whether in highly industrialized areas or rural areas. VOCs that frequently pollute indoor air include toluene, styrene, xylenes, and trichloroethylene. Reported health concerns include that trichloroethylene has been linked to childhood leukemia, exposure to toluene can put pregnant women at risk for having babies with neurologic problems, retarded growth, and developmental problems, styrene is a suspected endocrine disruptor, and EPA data reveal that methylene chloride causes cancer in animals and is converted to CO in the body and can cause symptoms associated with CO exposure; perchloroethylene from dry-cleaned clothing can be a pollution source by off-gassing. To lower levels of VOCs in the home, follow these steps: “use all household chemicals according to directions; provide good ventilation when using these products; properly dispose of partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicals; purchase limited quantities of products; and minimize exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chloride, benzene, and perchloroethylene.” A prominent VOC found in household products and construction products is formaldehyde, and according to CPSC these products include the glue or adhesive used in pressed wood products; preservatives in paints, coating, and cosmetics; coatings used for permanent-press quality in fabrics and draperies; and the finish on paper products and certain insulation materials.

### Is contaminated unrecorded alcohol a health problem in the European union? A review of existing and methodological outline for future studies [^b065c6f8]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Some European countries with high levels of unrecorded alcohol consumption have anomalously high rates of death attributable to liver cirrhosis. Hepatotoxic compounds in illegally produced spirits may be partly responsible. Based on a review of the evidence on the chemical composition and potential harm from unrecorded alcohol, the Alcohol Measures for Public Health Research Alliance (AMPHORA) project's methodology for identifying, analysing and toxicologically evaluating such alcohols is provided.

Methods

A computer-assisted literature review concentrated on unrecorded alcohol. Additionally, we refer to our work in the capacity of governmental alcohol control authority and a number of pilot studies.

Results

The risk-oriented identification of substances resulted in the following compounds probably posing a public health risk in unrecorded alcohol: ethanol, methanol, acetaldehyde, higher alcohols, heavy metals, ethyl carbamate, biologically active flavourings (e.g. coumarin) and diethyl phthalate. Suggestions on a sampling strategy for identifying unrecorded alcohol that may be most prone to contamination include using probable distribution points such as local farmers and flea markets for selling surrogate alcohol (including denatured alcohol) to focusing on lower socio-economic status or alcohol-dependent individuals, and selecting home-produced fruit spirits prone to ethyl carbamate contamination.

Conclusions

Standardized guidelines for the chemical and toxicological evaluation of unrecorded alcohol that will be used in a European-wide sampling and are applicable globally are provided. These toxicological guidelines may also be used by alcohol control laboratories for recorded alcohol products, and form a scientific foundation for establishing legislative limits.

### Opportunities for collaboration at the interface of pharmacovigilance and manufacturing [^fd38e2a8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

A case can be made that much common ground exists between pharmacovigilance and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Of the 8 major US statutes that shaped the pharmaceutical industry since early in the 20th Century, 7 followed fatally catastrophic events related to the use of a manufactured product, and 1 followed the discovery of a counterfeit product. To facilitate an understanding of the interplay between pharmacovigilance and manufacturing, it is convenient to divide manufacturing into 3 categories: (1) upstream sourcing of materials: pharmacovigilance plays an important role when adverse event clusters are seen during routine vigilance detection processes and the suspicion turns to possibly contaminated source material, (2) the manufacturing process itself: pharmacovigilance may be called on to conduct a health hazard evaluation if a manufacturing deviation is detected after product release (the assessment can inform the depth of a recall), and (3) downstream distribution and product use: there is only light regulation of the interval between product distribution after manufacturing release and just before administration to patients, a time during which product may be subject to an out-of-specification determination for environmental controls or subject to malfeasant activities, such as counterfeit substitution or product diversion. Recently introduced statutory remedies, including the FDA Safety and Innovation Act and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act in the United States and the Falsified Medicines Directive (directive 2011/62/EC) in the European Union, can provide capabilities to support pharmacovigilance signal management activities that have the potential to reduce the risk to patients of experiencing adverse events caused by counterfeit, diverted, or tampered product.

### Monsanto company | Public assessment&health (...) [^5130b5a6]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2010). Low credibility.

The Monsanto company produced polychlorinated biphenyls at a plant in Anniston, Alabama, from 1935 to the 1970s. Hazardous wastes, including PCB still bottoms, were disposed in two unlined landfill areas located adjacent to the production facility. Investigations conducted by Monsanto under a Consent Order with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management documented the presence of PCB contamination in sediment samples from off-site drainage ditches and in soil samples from private residences east and north of the facility. These findings led to the remediation of off-site contaminated areas and property buyouts for some homeowners. Recent investigations have detected elevated blood levels of PCBs in some residents of the community surrounding the Solutia facility and other neighborhoods in Anniston. The source and exposure pathways by which residents have been exposed to PCBs have not been defined.

Furthermore, it is uncertain whether significant exposures are still occurring. To address these questions, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry conducted this Exposure Investigation. In addition to these methodological limitations, different studies have measured different neurobehavioral endpoints, which impedes comparisons between studies. The concentration of PCBs detected in composite surface soil samples from 19 homes ranged from non-detected to 11. 7 ppm. Soil samples from four homes contained PCB concentrations in excess of 1 ppm. At Superfund sites, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a Recommended Soil Action Level
- Analytical Starting Point of 1 ppm PCBs for residential properties. Higher action levels may be set if warranted by site-specific conditions.

In recent years, the potentially responsible party has purchased, remediated, and restricted access to some off-site, PCB-contaminated properties. However, it is likely that prior to remediation, long-term residents of the area had exposure to environmental contamination by direct contact with contaminated soil, sediment, water, and air, and by indirect contact from eating locally-raised animal or plant foodstuffs. Therefore, the available evidence suggests that past exposures to environmental PCB contamination exceeded current exposures. Nevertheless, this study and others conducted by the EPA have documented that elevated levels of PCBs remain in off-site soils and sediments. Since the future use of these areas cannot be predicted, they should be remediated to prevent further human exposure to environmental contamination.

### Detection and quantification of synthetic cannabinoids in seven illicitly sourced disposable vapes submitted by an individual presenting to a UK drug and alcohol service [^e55c692b]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

These products were initially sold as THC‐based products, although a COA later provided by the supplier reported the contents as a mixture of semi‐synthetic cannabinoids including HHC and THC‐O. Semi‐synthetic cannabinoids are newly emerging products which are reported to produce similar effects to THC and are often sold as legal alternatives to cannabis—especially in the United States, from where these samples were purportedly sourced. However, unlike the legal retail market for THC products in some US states, the sale of semi‐synthetic cannabinoid products remains unregulated and there are no quality or safety controls. There is therefore a risk that semi‐synthetic cannabinoid products may be mis‐sold as SCs more widely throughout the United States and elsewhere, and consumers should be aware that COAs may be falsified and should not be used to guarantee the contents (or safety) of products purchased on the illicit market.

E‐liquids marketed as THC or cannabis have become a common source of drug contamination, not just with SCs but also other illicit drugs, including most recently xylazine. The vapes analyzed here were also sold as cannabis products; however, their appearance closely resembled regulated nicotine‐based disposable vapes and they could conceivably be sold or mistaken as such. It is not possible to determine the content of these products based on their external or internal appearance, and any products sourced illicitly are likely to pose significant risks of unintended drug exposure, regardless of marketing or purchase intent. Furthermore, governments in several different countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, are beginning to introduce bans on the sale of disposable vaping products. Also, the United Kingdom has recently passed a law which will prevent anyone born after the year 2009 from ever legally purchasing tobacco products (although this law does not extend to re‐useable vaping devices or e‐liquids and other products containing nicotine). It is possible that restricting legal access to these products could lead to the expansion of the illicit market as consumers seek alternative sources, and this could further increase potential risks.

Assessment of supporting evidence—boiling and hot-water use: Bringing water to boil (100°C/212°F) will kill pathogenic microorganisms. Strong recommendation, high quality evidence. Bringing water to boil at 5000 m elevation (16,000 ft) to boil (83°C/181°F) will kill pathogenic organisms. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence. Tap water that has been tanked for 30 min or longer and is too hot to touch (60°C) significantly reduces the number of pathogenic microorganisms but should be used for short periods only when other methods are unavailable. Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence. Additionally, boiling is the only easily recognizable endpoint without using a thermometer, and if fuel is scarce, heat water until first sign of simmering (small bubbles rising from the bottom), reduce or remove heat, and leave container covered for 30 min; as a rule of thumb, water too hot to touch falls within the pasteurization range, and tap water kept hot in a tank for at least 30 min and too hot to keep a hand immersed for 5 s (estimated 55–65°C; 131–149°F) has been suggested for short periods of need, while in the long-term drinking from water heaters is not advised because of higher levels of metals and chemical contaminants at elevated temperatures.

### Methylnaltrexone bromide (Relistor) [^882f8686]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Slowly withdraw the needle from the vial. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch anything. Safely throw away the vial with any unused medicine.

Step 4: Inject RELISTOR

Use one hand to pinch the skin around the injection site (See Figure Q).

Use your other hand to hold the syringe. Insert the full length of the needle into the skin at a 45-degree angle with a quick “dart-like” motion (See Figure R).

Let go of the skin and slowly push in on the plunger past the resistance point, until the syringe is empty and you hear a click (See Figure S).

The click sound means that the needle (See Figure T) has been pulled back (retracted) into the syringe barrel (See Figure U). You can now remove the syringe from your skin.

Hold a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site (See Figure V). Do not rub the injection site. Apply an adhesive bandage to the injection site if needed.

Step 5: Dispose of used syringes and needles

Do not re-use syringes or needles.
To avoid needle-stick injuries, do not recap used needles.
Put your used needles and syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash.
If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:
made of a heavy-duty plastic,
can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,
upright and stable during use,
leak-resistant, and
properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.
When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA’s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.
Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.
If you have any questions, talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

### The impact of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control in defending legal challenges to tobacco control measures [^523466dd]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control's (FCTC) entry into force, the tobacco industry has initiated litigation challenging tobacco control measures implemented by governments around the world, or supported others to initiate such litigation on its behalf. In defending their tobacco control measures against such litigation, governments have invoked their obligations and rights under the WHO FCTC. We assess the extent to which the WHO FCTC has provided legal weight to governments' defences against legal challenge.

Methods

We reviewed 96 court decisions concerning legal challenges to tobacco control measures, determining whether or not they cited the WHO FCTC and their outcomes. We then reviewed the cases where the WHO FCTC was cited, analysing how the WHO FCTC contributed to the resolution of the case.

Results

The WHO FCTC was cited in 45 decisions. Decisions both citing and not citing the WHO FCTC were largely decided in favour of governments, with 80% of WHO-FCTC-citing and 67% of non-WHO-FCTC-citing cases upholding the measure in its entirety and on every ground of challenge. In cases where it was cited, the WHO FCTC contributed to the resolution of the case in favour of governments by providing a legal basis for measures, demonstrating the measure's public health purpose, demonstrating the evidence in favour of a measure, demonstrating international consensus, demonstrating that a measure promotes or protects health-related human rights and demonstrating whether or not a measure is reasonable, proportionate or justifiable.

Conclusions

The way the WHO FCTC has been cited in court decisions suggests that it has made a substantial contribution to courts' reasoning in tobacco control legal challenges and has strengthened governments' arguments in defending litigation.

### Reliability of nonlocalizing signs and symptoms as indicators of the presence of infection in nursing-home residents [^70eef902]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Nonlocalizing infection signs in long-term care—purpose and scope state that this document outlines the relationship between nonlocalizing signs and symptoms as a manifestation of an infection in residents of facilities that provide skilled (postacute) nursing services and residential care to adults, is intended to form the foundation for an update to the Loeb Minimum Criteria and to guide clinicians in evaluating signs and symptoms that commonly contribute to inappropriate antibiotic use, and is intended to assist clinicians with evaluation of whether nonlocalizing signs or symptoms are sufficiently reliable to justify initiation of antibiotics; it emphasizes specific patient populations, including residents with advanced dementia, and the primary purpose was to determine the extent to which specific nonlocalizing signs and symptoms, when they are present in isolation, should elevate clinical suspicion of infection, if at all; the guidance assesses the strength of association between bacterial infections and geriatric manifestations and should not be used as the basis for excluding a diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); as such, the systematic grading of the evidence level is not provided for the individual recommendations, and within the document, a summary list of expert guidance recommendations is provided along with the relevant rationale, while noting it is not meant to be a substitute for individual clinical judgment.

### A risk-neutral default for chemical risk management [^29a0c5bd]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In many risk management decisions concerning industrial chemicals, including decisions on classification and labeling, lack of toxicity data is interpreted as (or has the same implications as) absence of toxicity. In other words, if the toxicity of a chemical is unknown, it is treated as having no or low toxicity. This practice is difficult to defend from a decision-theoretical point of view. We apply standard decision theory to toxicity data and investigate an alternative approach in which substances with unknown properties are treated as if they had the average toxicity among tested substances in the group to which they belong. An index of acute toxicity is proposed and then used to define a risk-neutral hazard default that can be applied to industrial chemicals for which no specific information on acute toxicity is available. It is proposed that such a risk-neutral approach is preferable to the current practice of treating substances with unknown acute toxicity in the same manner as substances that can reasonably be assumed to have no such harmful properties. The risk-neutral approach could be generalized to other toxicological endpoints.

### Why does society accept a higher risk for alcohol than for other voluntary or involuntary risks? [^f6b458d7]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Voluntary risks are dealt with by a variety of means. These include total or partial prohibitions on commerce in risky behaviours, such as no tobacco sold to minors, as stipulated by the Tobacco Framework Convention ; heroin production and sale prohibited except for medical and scientific purposes (both of which also remind us that some of the answers to minimizing risk go beyond national governments); or a minimal legal purchasing age for alcohol. Or governments may gently discourage the behaviour with controls on availability or on price, for instance with Pigouvian taxes (taxes applied to a market activity or product that is generating cost for individuals or society - so-called negative externalities), including taxes to channel consumption and behaviour for public health purposes. But in many cases these risks are left to individual choice, and only education or guidelines are provided. However, exceptions will be made if lives of others are concerned. Thus, where behaviour such as drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes results in involuntary risks to others, limits are often imposed, for example, interdiction of smoking in restaurants and public places in reaction to risks from involuntary smoking; per se laws to disallow operating machinery or driving after drinking. Certain risks are between voluntary and involuntary, such as the risk of participating in motor traffic (while some participation is voluntary, other participation is necessary for earning money; and some of the risk is from others’ behaviour), or risks associated with various food groups (for example, exposure to salmonella will be involuntary, but exposure to saturated fats listed on the label is considered voluntary). Such risks are usually regulated by specialized agencies, stipulating rules to limit risks by thresholds for ingredients in food (for example, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives at the international level, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US, and the European Food Safety Authority in Europe), or by specific rules such as speed limits, safety belts or safety requirements for baby walkers or bunk beds - for instance, by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

### The impact of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control in defending legal challenges to tobacco control measures [^2d2dd737]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The above results show the many ways in which the WHO FCTC has strengthened respondent governments’ defences to legal challenges. For the most part, it is difficult to ‘prove’ that the WHO FCTC was directly responsible for the outcomes of any particular case. There is no counterfactual for what would have happened if the WHO FCTC were not in force. Further, many cases are decided on multiple grounds, each of which may be sufficient on its own to dismiss a challenge, and not all of which involve the WHO FCTC. To take one example, the argument in Philip Morris v Uruguay that Uruguay’s tobacco packaging measures expropriated Philip Morris’ investments was dismissed both on the grounds that there was no substantial deprivation of Philip Morris’ investments, where the WHO FCTC was not relevant, and on the grounds that the measures were an exercise of Uruguay’s sovereign right to regulate, where the WHO FCTC was critical to the resolution of the question.It is possible that judgements invoking the WHO FCTC might invoke other arguments to reach the same outcome were the WHO FCTC never concluded.

However, what the results do show is that the WHO FCTC is extensively relied on by parties in defending cases and by courts in reaching their conclusions, and that it contributes to the reasoning of the latter in important ways. In particular, the WHO FCTC plays a major role in translating a large and sometimes complex body of scientific evidence into a format that is comprehensible to legal institutions and assimilable to legal concepts, as indicated by the use of the WHO FCTC to support evidentiary claims, show international consensus in support of a measure, establish a public health purpose and demonstrate reasonableness. In this respect, the role of the WHO FCTC guidelines has been crucial—as a key source of guidance to parties on good practices and the best available scientific evidence, and in showing courts that parties have based their measures on such. In many instances, it is likely that the evidence before the court might have been more contested or complex in the absence of the WHO FCTC and its guidelines—which may not have affected the outcome of the case, but would almost certainly have placed heavier (and costlier) burdens on those defending the measure.

Embalming is required for esthetic reasons if there is to be a viewing; most funeral directors will not allow the general public to view an unembalmed body during viewing or visitation. In the preparation room the embalmer places the body on a tilted metal or plastic preparation table with grooves in the side and a drain hose at the bottom, inserts a canula into an artery (carotid or femoral) and uses a compressor to pump embalming fluid, and drains the blood via another canula onto the table, out the drain, and into the sewage system.

Appendix 1—definitions relevant to foodborne disease outbreak response—provides glossary entries for operational, regulatory, and epidemiologic terms. Food establishment is defined as “An operation that a) stores, prepares, packages, serves, and/ or vends food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food for human consumption …” and also that it “relinquishes possession of food directly, or indirectly through a delivery service.” Food-safety regulatory agency are “Government agencies at the local, state, or federal level that are granted regulatory oversight of some aspect of the food industry,” with the goal “to ensure the public food supply is safe from disease.” Foodborne disease is “Any disease caused by ingestion of contaminated food,” and “multiple modes of transmission can be involved in any one outbreak.” Foodborne disease surveillance is “Surveillance of diseases or conditions that might be foodborne” and can track enteric diseases including “norovirus infection … listeriosis … or botulism.” FoodNet Atlas of Exposures summarizes “periodic population-based surveys undertaken at selected sites in the United States” that “can be used to estimate the background rates of different food exposures in the community.” HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) is “A science-based and systematic approach to prevent potential food-safety problems.” Imminent hazard is “An important threat or danger to health” that “requires immediate correction or cessation of operation to prevent injury” based on specified factors. Impound means “To take possession of or to seize and hold in the custody of the law.” Jurisdiction is “A government entity with the legal authority to interpret and apply the law” and also refers to the limits or territory of that authority. Multijurisdictional refers to “Requiring the resources of more than one local, state, territorial, tribal, or federal public health or food-regulatory agency” and can involve “a foodborne disease outbreak or the distribution or recall of a contaminated food product.”

### The continuing saga of patents and non-invasive prenatal testing [^c06231ac]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to method claims, European cases have focused on whether there is a technical contribution. This technical contribution may be fairly minimal, but provided there is a technical contribution the invention will be patentable and not excluded subject matter “as such.” 43, 44

In Europe, a patent granted by the EPO may be opposed in proceedings at the EPO, where a patent may be struck down in whole or in part. If that opposition is unsuccessful, the patent may also be challenged later in national courts. The European patent in the 540 family (EP 0994963) was opposed, but was upheld in opposition proceedings and on appeal to the Technical Board of Appeal of the EPO. 45 Unlike in the United States, the proceedings did not address the question of subject matter eligibility. Instead, the patent was opposed on the grounds of lack of inventive step and insufficient disclosure. The Board of Appeal found that there was sufficient disclosure of the invention in the patent to enable a person in the same technical field to perform it, and that the claims in question were not obvious and therefore inventive enough to satisfy the patentability requirements.

### Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents: a practice parameter [^aa3f8f57]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Medium credibility.

Environmental assessment and exposure reduction of rodents—scope and professional roles indicate that the parameter “addresses health problems associated with exposure to these animals” and “focuses on involuntary exposure caused by rodent infestation of a home.” “Rodent infestation of a home or building requires the help of professionals trained to identify the problems and take remedial action to eliminate the rodents and their residual debris.” “Environmental assessment professionals are members of a relatively new field” trained “to identify the potential for exposure to indoor contaminants that are known to have potential adverse effects on health, with an emphasis on allergens, irritants, and safety hazards.” The environmental health expert “should work closely with physicians and other health care professionals to determine which exposures are likely to cause health problems in building occupants,” and “In that respect, the 2 fields are complementary, requiring cooperation and collaboration.” “The goal with respect to rodents is to identify evidence of their presence and to recommend methods for elimination and long-term management.” “Reduction of exposure to involuntary agents, such as rodents, requires a deeper understanding of how contaminants, such as allergens, are generated, where they are deposited, and how they are transported from sources and reservoirs to occupants,” and “It is only by addressing all of these issues, in addition to their underlying causal factors, that exposure to contaminants, such as rodent allergens, can be reduced sufficiently to have a beneficial effect on health.”

### Guidance on microbial contamination in previously flooded outdoor areas [^14742a65]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

Guidance on microbial contamination in previously flooded outdoor areas—risk-assessment process is organized into four steps leading to decision-making: Hazard Identification, Dose-Response Assessment, Exposure Assessment, and Risk Characterization, followed by Decision and Actions / Interventions. Hazard identification includes to identify potential sources of contamination (i.e., wastewater treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural operations) and determine likelihood of microorganisms in flood waters. Dose-response assessment includes to estimate concentration of microorganisms and their ability to cause illness. Exposure assessment includes to determine who may be exposed and to what degree, and the route, duration, and frequency of exposure. Risk characterization includes to consider all information gathered in previous steps and determine magnitude of the public health problem. Final decision and actions/interventions determine whether to allow occupancy of flooded areas and if intervention/precautionary actions are necessary.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^7aa71588]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

On-site wastewater treatment—septic tank systems are used “in rural areas where houses are spaced so far apart that a sewer system would be too expensive to install, or in areas around cities where the city government has not yet provided sewers to which the homes can connect,” and “these private disposal systems are typically called septic tank systems.” A septic tank “is a sewage holding device made of concrete, steel, fiberglass, polyethylene, or other approved material cistern, buried in a yard, which may hold 1,000 gallons or more of wastewater,” with wastewater that “flows from the home into the tank at one end and leaves the tank at the other.” “Fully one-fourth to one-third of the homes in the United States use such a system.” Public health concerns are emphasized: “Proper maintenance of septic tanks is a public health necessity,” and “enteric diseases such as cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis, hepatitis A, and shigellosis may be transmitted through human excrement,” with “major epidemics of cholera and typhoid fever” historically “primarily caused by improper disposal of wastewater.” For treatment of human waste, “safe, sanitary, nuisance-free disposal of wastewater is a public health priority in all population groups, small and large, rural or urban,” and “wastewater should be disposed of in a manner that ensures that community or private drinking water supplies are not threatened; direct human exposure is not possible; waste is inaccessible to vectors, insects, rodents, or other possible carriers; all environmental laws and regulations are complied with; and odor or aesthetic nuisances are not created.”

### No association between unintentional head injuries and early-life exposure to tetrachloroethylene (PCE)-contaminated drinking water [^1a008650]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

We do not believe that any epidemiological study has previously investigated the occurrence of head injuries following early-life solvent exposure. Most studies have focused on other neurotoxic effects of solvent mixtures (including PCE) among adults with workplace exposures. Impairments in cognition, motor function, and vision, and mood changes have been observed in these investigations. –,– The small number of studies investigating workplace exposure to PCE alone present conflicting findings. A few studies have reported lower test scores for attention and executive function,while others have reported no harmful neurological consequences, except for impaired visuospatial skills.

Three small studies have previously investigated neurodevelopmental outcomes among young children whose mothers worked with solvent mixtures during their pregnancies. A 1988 study reported no meaningful effect cognition.On the contrary, two subsequent studies reported more behavior problems and poorer language and motor skills among exposed children. Findings from the latter studies are concordant with neuropsychological test results among members of the current cohort that found diminished visuospatial and motor function and attention among subjects with early-life exposure to PCE-contaminated drinking water.

In summary, the findings from the current study do not support the hypothesis that there is an elevated risk of unintentional head injuries following early-life exposure to PCE-contaminated drinking water. However, numerous limitations should be taken into account when interpreting these findings. As PCE remains a widespread pollutant of surface and ground water supplies,documenting the presence of any adverse health effects stemming from early-life exposure is vital for ensuring that U.S. drinking water regulations adequately protect vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and their children.

### Acute ischemic heart disease and interventional cardiology: a time for pause [^ebb9013e]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Summary

In its relatively unselective plunge into technology, we believe contemporary cardiology has taken a turn that is problematic, on scientific, economic, and intellectual grounds. The capital notion that diagnostic procedures and treatments should be adapted to patients–and not patients to treatments–with their unique clinical particularities, differing underlying pathogenic mechanisms, and heterogeneous risk profiles, should not fall victim to a systematic steamroller approach in patients with ACS. We dare hope that the countervailing attitude expressed here may contribute to the salutary debate necessary for an equilibrium in which clinical finesse and discriminating judgment may assume their proper place in the management of patients with acute ischemic heart disease.

### The impact of the WHO framework convention on tobacco control in defending legal challenges to tobacco control measures [^c28be3ec]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control’s (FCTC) entry into force, the tobacco industry has initiated litigation challenging tobacco control measures implemented by governments around the world, or supported others to initiate such litigation on its behalf. In defending their tobacco control measures against such litigation, governments have invoked their obligations and rights under the WHO FCTC. We assess the extent to which the WHO FCTC has provided legal weight to governments’ defences against legal challenge.

Methods

We reviewed 96 court decisions concerning legal challenges to tobacco control measures, determining whether or not they cited the WHO FCTC and their outcomes. We then reviewed the cases where the WHO FCTC was cited, analysing how the WHO FCTC contributed to the resolution of the case.

Results

The WHO FCTC was cited in 45 decisions. Decisions both citing and not citing the WHO FCTC were largely decided in favour of governments, with 80% of WHO-FCTC-citing and 67% of non-WHO-FCTC-citing cases upholding the measure in its entirety and on every ground of challenge. In cases where it was cited, the WHO FCTC contributed to the resolution of the case in favour of governments by providing a legal basis for measures, demonstrating the measure’s public health purpose, demonstrating the evidence in favour of a measure, demonstrating international consensus, demonstrating that a measure promotes or protects health-related human rights and demonstrating whether or not a measure is reasonable, proportionate or justifiable.

Conclusions

The way the WHO FCTC has been cited in court decisions suggests that it has made a substantial contribution to courts’ reasoning in tobacco control legal challenges and has strengthened governments’ arguments in defending litigation.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^1944ab96]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Principles of investigation—preliminary steps, coordination, and hypothesis generation state that after a suspicious foodborne illness complaint associated with a particular event or establishment is received or an unusual cluster of isolates is detected through pathogen-specific surveillance, a preliminary investigation should be conducted to determine whether the reported illnesses may be part of an outbreak; during an investigation, the focus may shift among laboratory and epidemiologic studies, regulatory investigations, environmental health assessments of facilities, and communication of findings; leadership of an investigation should reflect the focus of investigation activities; maintaining close communication and coordination among epidemiologic, environmental health, and laboratory investigators is the best way to ensure that concurrent activities do not interfere and important steps are not forgotten, and a consistent point of contact for each investigation will help to avoid mixed messages and incomplete or misinformation; hypothesis generation should begin early to narrow the focus and use time and resources most effectively, and as more information is obtained, hypotheses can be modified.
