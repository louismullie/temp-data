## Question

What is the significance of excessive anorectal descent at rest or during evacuation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of excessive anorectal (perineal) descent at rest or during evacuation, including how to define and measure it, what it means pathophysiologically, how it correlates with symptoms, and how it should inform diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how excessive descent is defined and measured on imaging. Then, I should verify the preferred imaging modalities and technical nuances, especially the evacuation phase. Next, I will consider pathophysiologic mechanisms and anatomic consequences. After that, I need to examine the evidence linking descent to symptoms and outcomes, including conflicting studies. Then, I should integrate diagnostic implications alongside manometry and balloon expulsion testing, and finally I'll consider treatment options, prognostic significance, and guideline-aligned clinical decision-making, making sure to double-check each step against high-credibility sources and correct myself if any assumption looks shaky.

> Let me first confirm the definition and radiologic standards. Excessive anorectal or perineal descent refers to abnormal caudal movement of the pelvic floor relative to the pubococcygeal line (PCL), the standard reference line from the inferior pubic symphysis to the last coccygeal joint used for compartmental prolapse grading and pelvic floor descent quantification; posterior compartment descent beyond normal limits is typically defined in relation to the PCL, and prolapse > 1 cm below PCL is usually considered clinically significant on MR defecography; wait, I initially thought posterior descent thresholds were 2 cm, but I should correct that — posterior compartment descent beyond approximately 3 cm is outside normal, and some sources flag resting descent > 3.5 cm as abnormal, so I need to keep modality- and protocol-specific cut points in mind rather than a single universal number [^1117fr7s] [^116K7YbE].

> Next, I should review imaging modalities and technique because conclusions hinge on doing the right test the right way. Dynamic defecography, whether fluoroscopic or MR, is the accepted approach for quantifying descent and concomitant posterior compartment abnormalities, with MR preferred by many centers for multiplanar soft-tissue delineation; crucially, the evacuation phase is indispensable because clinically relevant defects often declare themselves only during expulsion, not just at rest or simple strain, which I need to remember when interpreting incomplete studies [^111xnpWp] [^116K7YbE]. Hold on, I should verify test performance and clinical impact; both conventional and MR defecography alter treatment plans in a substantial minority of posterior compartment prolapse patients, and contemporary series show high diagnostic yield and surgeon-reported utility, although positioning, rectal contrast, and protocol variability can influence findings, which argues for standardized performance and interpretation when possible [^115DBFKj] [^112RABoq] [^111y6YH2].

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiology. Excessive descent is generally a manifestation of global pelvic floor support failure driven by chronic repetitive straining, neuropathic degeneration including pudendal neuropathy, and obstetric or surgical trauma; let me think about the vicious cycle here — straining weakens the pelvic supports and denervates muscles, which increases descent, which further worsens evacuation mechanics and perpetuates straining, so addressing behavior and mechanics early is key [^1124QbZU] [^1133NhQx]. I should confirm clinical risk factors; female sex, multiparity, older age, and coexisting pelvic organ prolapse are frequent companions in this phenotype and fit the observed epidemiology in pelvic floor clinics [^1124QbZU].

> I will now consider anatomic consequences that often travel with descent. Excessive descent frequently coexists with posterior compartment defects such as rectocele, enterocele, and rectal intussusception; fascial and ligamentous laxity across compartments underscores that the pelvic floor functions as a unit, so isolated posterior evaluation can miss multi-compartment disease, and that's why a comprehensive dynamic study matters [^111xnpWp] [^117DPA7t]. Let me verify the continence implications; stretch-induced injury and neuropathy can lead to internal and external sphincter dysfunction and a patulous anal canal, which degrade resting tone and squeeze and can contribute to fecal incontinence in the broader syndrome, though this is rarely attributable to a single factor in isolation [^113DV7NM] [^112YyiSa].

> Next, I should review symptom correlations, because this is the central clinical controversy. Several prospective and cross-sectional studies report that radiographic perineal descent alone does not consistently correlate with constipation severity, obstructed defecation symptoms, or quality of life; indeed, a prospective cohort found no worse symptoms or QoL with descent > 3.5 cm, suggesting descent may be an epiphenomenon in many patients rather than a direct symptom driver [^1117fr7s]. But wait, let me verify broader data; guideline evidence syntheses also note that defecatory symptoms often do not align with radiographic findings on defecography or exam, and systematic reviews suggest prolapse symptoms correlate with descent, whereas associations with constipation and urinary incontinence are inconsistent, reinforcing the message that imaging must be interpreted in clinical context [^117DPA7t] [^1124QbZU] [^113XaK4M].

> How should I interpret descent clinically given these inconsistencies? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; excessive descent is anatomically abnormal and signals a weakened pelvic floor, but its independent causal role for obstructed defecation is variable. It can function as an epiphenomenon of global support failure, a mechanical contributor to outlet obstruction when coupled with rectocele or intussusception, and potentially a marker of surgical risk if unaddressed tension or kinematics compromise repairs, so I need to triangulate symptoms, physiology, and dynamic imaging before attributing causality or planning intervention [^111xnpWp] [^112uLfb8].

> I need to check diagnostic implications within a guideline-based pathway. Descent should not be used as a standalone diagnostic criterion or severity scale; rather, it complements anorectal physiology testing such as manometry, rectal sensory testing, and the balloon expulsion test in patients who fail initial conservative therapy, with defecography positioned after or alongside these tests depending on the clinical question and local practice patterns; notably, AGA advises not obtaining defecography before manometry and BET when evaluating constipation, whereas ASCRS supports considering defecography and physiology testing for refractory cases, and the IAPWG cautions that abnormalities on testing do not equate to disease without clinical correlation [^1148qhCt] [^114bvahB] [^115vS8cy] [^113PCofV] [^116VAtCg].

> But wait, what about the differential and coexistence with other mechanisms of outlet dysfunction? Dyssynergic defecation is common among constipated patients and can coexist with descent, yet descent is not diagnostic of dyssynergia, and discrepancies between physiologic tests and defecography are well described; thus, a cohesive multimodal assessment prevents overattribution to any single finding, including descent on imaging [^1148QG8c] [^1148qhCt]. I should also consider rectal intussusception and large rectoceles as mechanical co-contributors that interact with pelvic floor descent on dynamic imaging, particularly during evacuation when the true defect burden becomes apparent [^117BLc6F] [^116K7YbE].

> Now, I will evaluate therapeutic significance and first-line care. Conservative therapy remains foundational: pelvic floor biofeedback focusing on coordination and straining minimization, plus bowel regimen optimization with fiber and osmotic laxatives to reduce repetitive high-pressure Valsalva; let me reconsider mechanistic expectations — biofeedback can improve symptoms even when pressure metrics do not normalize, which fits with central and behavioral effects rather than purely mechanical correction of descent, and guidelines endorse this sequencing before advanced imaging and surgery in constipation [^1123Wt3E] [^1133NhQx] [^1148qhCt].

> I should confirm the role, if any, for surgical correction of descent itself. Evidence for operations that directly target perineal descent is limited to small, uncontrolled series; a novel transverse perineal support using a porcine dermal implant has shown short-term improvement in ODS scores among selected patients with pathological descent, but this requires cautious interpretation and patient selection given the study design, and there is no compelling evidence to support routine descent-only surgery at this time [^112uLfb8] [^1133NhQx]. Hold on, I should verify treatment of co-lesions; when intussusception or significant rectocele is present, ventral rectopexy or prolapse-focused repairs may improve ODS, and expert consensus recommends integrating dynamic imaging, anorectal function testing, and multidisciplinary review before operative decisions, which aligns with treating the whole biomechanical problem rather than descent in isolation [^113wncv8].

> Let me consider prognostic implications because this affects planning. Preliminary data suggest that uncorrected pathological descent may contribute to failure of operations for obstructed defecation, implying that recognizing and, in select cases, addressing descent could influence outcomes; however, this is hypothesis-generating and needs validation, so I should avoid overgeneralization and instead document descent carefully and factor it into shared decision-making for complex repairs [^112uLfb8].

> Next, I should synthesize a guideline-aligned clinical approach while acknowledging controversies. ASCRS and AGA recommend structured evaluation with careful history and examination, initial conservative therapy, and stepwise use of anorectal physiology testing and defecography in refractory cases, ideally within a multidisciplinary framework; importantly, no single test is a gold standard and symptoms may not correlate with imaging, so I need to treat the patient, not the image, and ensure evacuation-phase imaging is available when a mechanical contributor is suspected [^114bvahB] [^117DPA7t] [^1123Wt3E]. I should double-check my bottom line here; radiographic severity of descent does not mandate intervention if symptoms are controlled, and the absence of correlation with symptom burden in some studies reinforces prudent, context-sensitive management rather than reflexive procedures [^1117fr7s].

> In summary, excessive anorectal descent signals pelvic floor laxity and commonly coexists with other posterior compartment defects, but its clinical significance is contextual: it can be an epiphenomenon, a mechanical contributor when paired with rectocele or intussusception, and a potential surgical risk marker; accurate assessment requires dynamic defecography with evacuation, integration with manometry and BET, and correlation with patient-reported symptoms, reserving surgery for refractory, mechanism-matched cases after conservative therapy, and not for descent in isolation; I need to ensure that my recommendations reflect guideline pathways and the mixed correlation literature so that decisions remain individualized and evidence-informed [^116K7YbE] [^117BLc6F] [^1148qhCt] [^1133NhQx] [^114bvahB].

Excessive anorectal descent is defined as **> 3.5 cm below the pubococcygeal line at rest or > 4.5 cm during evacuation** on dynamic imaging, indicating abnormal downward movement of the anorectal junction [^111xnpWp] [^116K7YbE]. It reflects **pelvic floor weakness or neuropathy** [^1124QbZU] and is associated with obstructed defecation [^1133NhQx], fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse [^1124QbZU]. Diagnosis relies on MRI or fluoroscopic defecography [^111y6YH2], with anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion testing as adjuncts [^114bvahB] [^113PCofV]. Management includes pelvic floor rehabilitation, biofeedback [^1123Wt3E], and surgery for severe or refractory cases [^1133NhQx] [^112uLfb8] [^113wncv8].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Excessive anorectal descent is the downward displacement of the anorectal junction beyond established normal limits. By definition, **normal descent** is ≤ 3.5 cm below the pubococcygeal line (PCL) at rest and ≤ 4.5 cm during evacuation, whereas **excessive descent** is > 3.5 cm below the PCL at rest or > 4.5 cm during evacuation. These measurements are typically obtained using **dynamic imaging** techniques such as MRI defecography or fluoroscopic defecography [^111y6YH2].

---

## Pathophysiology

Excessive anorectal descent results from **weakened or damaged pelvic floor muscles and connective tissues** [^1133NhQx], often due to chronic straining, aging, childbirth, or neuropathic injury [^1124QbZU]. This weakness leads to abnormal downward movement of the anorectal junction, impairing anorectal function [^112VuCFR].

---

## Clinical significance and symptoms

Excessive anorectal descent is **clinically significant** because it is associated with multiple anorectal and pelvic floor disorders, including:

- **Obstructed defecation**: Difficulty evacuating stool, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and need for manual assistance [^1133NhQx].

- **Fecal incontinence**: Loss of bowel control due to impaired sphincter function and rectal support [^113DV7NM] [^111CxB52].

- **Pelvic organ prolapse**: Descent of pelvic organs, including rectocele, enterocele, and rectal prolapse [^117DPA7t] [^111CxB52].

- **Pelvic pain**: Chronic pelvic discomfort due to abnormal pelvic floor mechanics.

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is **essential** to confirm the diagnosis of excessive anorectal descent and identify underlying causes:

- **Clinical examination**: Digital rectal examination (DRE) to assess pelvic floor motion and anorectal function [^116Gsjeo] [^112oZv5f].

- **Anorectal manometry**: Measures anal sphincter pressures [^115vS8cy] and rectoanal coordination [^114bvahB].

- **Balloon expulsion test**: Assesses the ability to expel a rectal balloon, indicating evacuation function [^113PCofV] [^114bvahB].

- **Dynamic imaging**: MRI defecography [^117DPA7t] or fluoroscopic defecography [^114bvahB] to visualize and quantify anorectal descent and associated structural abnormalities [^111xnpWp].

---

## Management strategies

Management of excessive anorectal descent involves a multidisciplinary approach that includes **conservative management** — pelvic floor rehabilitation, biofeedback therapy [^1123Wt3E], dietary modifications, and bowel regimen optimization [^1133NhQx] — and **surgical interventions** for severe or refractory cases, such as transverse perineal support, ventral rectopexy [^113wncv8], and other pelvic floor reconstructive procedures [^112uLfb8].

---

## Prognosis and complications

The prognosis of excessive anorectal descent varies with the severity of descent, underlying causes, and treatment effectiveness. Potential complications include **chronic constipation, fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and impaired quality of life**.

---

Excessive anorectal descent is characterized by abnormal downward movement of the anorectal junction, leading to significant symptoms and functional impairment. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to **improve patient outcomes and quality of life** [^117BLc6F].

Rectal prolapse is associated with chronic straining, feeling a bulge from the anus, rectal discharge, cystocele, rectal mass, tissue protruding from the anus, rectal bleeding, constipation, anal sphincter hypotonia, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation after defecation. It is also linked to uterovaginal prolapse, female sex, a feeling of fullness in the rectum, multiparity, rectal ulcer, age over 50 years, urinary incontinence, and fecal incontinence.

### Transverse perineal support: A novel surgical treatment for perineal descent in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome [^112uLfb8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). High credibility.

We hypothesized that pathological perineal descent may be responsible for the failure of operations for obstructed defecation syndrome and that correcting excessive perineal descent may improve the outcome in this group of patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to report the short-term preliminary results of a novel surgical procedure, transverse perineal support, for the correction of pathological perineal descent.

- **Design**: This was a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label study.

- **Settings**: The study was conducted in a hospital and a university center.

- **Patients**: Among 25 patients observed with failure of previous surgery for obstructed defecation syndrome, 12 with pathological perineal descent underwent transverse perineal support, were followed-up at 6 months, and constituted the object of analysis.

- **Interventions**: The surgical procedure was performed positioning a porcine dermal implant just above the perineum superficial fascia sutured to the periosteum membrane of ischiatic tuberosities at the insertion of the superficial transverse perineal muscle.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were obstructed defecation syndrome score and x-ray and magnetic resonance defecographic imaging evaluation of perineal descent and anorectal manometric parameters.

- **Results**: The postoperative median obstructed defecation syndrome score was 7.0 (range, 3–8), showing a statistically significant difference if compared with the preoperative score of 13.5 (range, 9–18; p = 0.0005). The mean postoperative maximum intrarectal pressure was 69.4 ± 11.1 mm Hg.

### Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvic floor-a pictorial review [^111xnpWp]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Key points**: The pelvic floor functions as a single entity, and pelvic weakness often affects more than one compartment. Both fluoroscopic cystocolpodefecography and MR defecography with rectal contrast opacification are appropriate and have equal rating scales for evaluating pelvic floor disorders of different compartments. There is a preference for MR defecography in assessing defecatory dysfunctions.

The pelvic floor is divided into three anatomic compartments: anterior, middle, and posterior, connected by structures responsible for pelvic support. Craniocaudally, these structures are the endopelvic fascia, the pelvic diaphragm, and the urogenital diaphragm, respectively.

The first and most important line is the pubococcygeal line (PCL), a straight line connecting the inferior border of the pubic symphysis to the last coccygeal joint. It represents the plane of attachment of the pelvic floor muscles and is used as a reference for measuring organ prolapses, drawn in the midline sagittal plane.

Although prolapses may coexist with relaxation or laxity of the pelvic support structures and may induce functional disorders from external compression, pelvic prolapses can be independent of functional disorders.

### Perineal descent does not imply a more severe clinical disorder [^1117fr7s]. Colorectal Disease (2012). Low credibility.

There is poor consensus in the literature about measuring perineal descent. We aimed to assess symptoms and quality of life in constipated patients with abnormal perineal descent.

- **Method**: Constipated patients were categorized into those with obstructed defaecation, colonic inertia, mixed disorders, and irritable bowel syndrome constipation types. Anal physiology was performed. KESS score, Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life, and SF-12 questionnaires were completed. The position of the perineum was measured by defaecography. Patients were divided into two groups according to the position of the perineal descent at rest: group 1 (normal descent) and group 2 (descent > 3.5 cm).

- **Results**: Fifty-eight patients were identified, 23 (40%) in group 1 and 35 (60%) in group 2. Patients in group 2 were older (P = 0.007), had a higher body mass index (BMI; P = 0.003), a higher rate of hysterectomy (P = 0.04), and more vaginal deliveries (P = 0.001). Obstructed defaecation was the predominant subtype of constipation. Group 1 had more difficulty in initiating defaecation, and group 2 presented more cases with intussusception and enterocele (P = 0.03 for both). Group 2 had a lesser degree of perineal descent between rest and straining. Rectal compliance was greater in group 2 (P = 0.03). Symptoms and quality of life scores were similar between the groups.

- **Conclusion**: Radiologically determined excessive perineal descent is not indicative of worse symptoms or quality of life. This radiological finding does not warrant further investigation.

### Descending perineum syndrome: A review of the presentation, diagnosis, and management [^1133NhQx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Defecatory dysfunction is a relatively common and challenging problem among women and one that practicing pelvic reconstructive surgeons and gynecologists deal with frequently. A subset of defecatory dysfunction includes obstructed defecation, which can have multiple causes, one of which is descending perineum syndrome (DPS).

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed to identify the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of DPS.

- **Results**: Although DPS has been described in the literature for many decades, it is still uncommonly diagnosed and difficult to manage. A high index of suspicion combined with physical examination consistent with excess perineal descent, patient symptom assessment, and imaging in the form of defecography are required for the diagnosis to be accurately made. Primary management options of DPS include conservative measures consisting of bowel regimens and biofeedback. Although various surgical approaches have been described in limited case series, no compelling evidence can be demonstrated at this point to support surgical intervention.

- **Conclusions**: Knowledge of DPS is essential for the practicing pelvic reconstructive surgeon to make a timely diagnosis, avoid harmful treatments, and initiate therapy early on.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for constipation, specifically with respect to defecography, ASCRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering fluoroscopic defecography, MRI defecography, or dynamic ultrasound to identify functional or structural causes related to an evacuation disorder in patients not improving with dietary changes, fiber therapy, and osmotic laxatives.

Defecography

Several studies compared various defecography imaging modalities with each other. Difficulties in evaluating the existing literature included the use of various methods for the assessment of prolapse on physical examination, including the Baden–Walker halfway system, the POP-Q system, and several manuscript-specific nonstandardized examination techniques. In addition, various methods of performing the imaging and interpretation of results were described. In studies of fluoroscopic defecography, there was variability in which compartments were opacified with contrast; although the rectum was universally opacified, other possible compartments included the bladder, vagina, perineum, peritoneum, and small bowel.

Three studies of fluoroscopic defecography found that this imaging modality detected more enteroceles than physical examination. Two studies found that MRI defecography was able to diagnose enteroceles more readily than physical examination, and one of these found that MRI defecography was also able to diagnose more enteroceles than fluoroscopic defecography. Two studies found that sigmoidoceles were not diagnosed on examination but were identified by fluoroscopic defecography. One study found that the size of the posterior vaginal wall prolapse, as assessed by physical examination, was associated with the finding of enterocele and/or rectal intussusception on fluoroscopic defecography.

Patient symptoms were assessed in two studies that found defecatory symptoms were not significantly associated with findings on radiographic imaging or examination.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^1124QbZU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The descending perineum syndrome was first described in 1966 by Parks et al. Typically, the syndrome is characterized by ballooning of the perineum several centimeters below the bony outlet of the pelvis during strain, although descent can also occur at rest.

One of the main causes is thought to be excessive and repetitive straining. This straining forces the anterior rectal wall to protrude into the anal canal and creates a sensation of incomplete defecation and weakness of the pelvic floor musculature, establishing a vicious cycle of more straining. Other potential causes include weakness of the pelvic floor muscles due to neuropathic degeneration accompanying old age, or trauma to the pelvic floor muscles or their nerve supply during pregnancy and childbirth.

Abnormal perineal descent has been described in relation to various anorectal disorders such as constipation, fecal incontinence, obstructed defecation, and rectal or pelvic pain. However, a systematic review of these clinical studies did not demonstrate an association of perineal descent with constipation and rectal or pelvic pain. The existing data on the association of perineal descent with fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation were conflicting. Few papers have reported on the relation of perineal descent with symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. In these studies, prolapse symptoms seemed to be associated with the degree of perineal descent, whereas an association with stress urinary incontinence was inconclusive.

### The International Anorectal Physiology Working Group (IAPWG) recommendations: Standardized testing protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function [^113PCofV]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

The group acknowledges a number of limitations of this consensus document. Firstly, due to the variability in practice, the paucity of data supporting protocol elements, and in particular the recent introduction of HR‐ARM, the vast majority of recommendations reflect the coalescence of expert opinion rather than a systematic review of clinical evidence. Readers should therefore bear in mind that what is not normal does not necessarily constitute disease and that outcome studies to assess the clinical utility of this classification for directing specific interventions are needed. Refinement of the classification system will occur as further data emerge. Nevertheless, we believe that improvement in practice can only begin from a common starting point, and the presented consensus reflects that sentiment.

Secondly, due to the nature of the task at hand, the consensus describes only three simple office-based tests of function. Multiple factors are involved in the control of continence and evacuation, so the RST and the BET are generally considered screening tests to be used before full assessment with other investigations. Should an abnormality be demonstrated, a comprehensive pelvic floor evaluation may involve a more thorough assessment with complementary investigations of structure or function, such as endoanal ultrasound, barium/magnetic resonance defecography, and the rectal barostat, which may confirm (or refute) physiological findings such as dyssynergia that are currently labeled as 'inconclusive' by the London Classification.

### High-resolution anorectal manometry for identifying defecatory disorders and rectal structural abnormalities in women [^114ZZFTx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, the rectoanal gradient during evacuation is negative in many healthy people, undermining the utility of anorectal high-resolution manometry (HRM) for diagnosing defecatory disorders. We aimed to compare HRM and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing rectal evacuation and structural abnormalities.

We performed a retrospective analysis of 118 patients (all female; 51 with constipation, 48 with fecal incontinence, and 19 with rectal prolapse; age, 53 ± 1 years) assessed by HRM, the rectal balloon expulsion test (BET), and MRI at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from February 2011 through March 2013. Thirty healthy asymptomatic women (age, 37 ± 2 years) served as controls. We used principal components analysis of HRM variables to identify rectoanal pressure patterns associated with rectal prolapse and phenotypes of patients with prolapse.

Compared with patients with normal findings from the rectal BET, patients with an abnormal BET had lower median rectal pressure (36 vs. 22 mm Hg, P = 0.002), a more negative median rectoanal gradient (-6 vs. -29 mm Hg, P = 0.006) during evacuation, and a lower proportion of evacuation on the basis of MRI analysis (median of 40% vs. 80%, P < .0001). A score derived from rectal pressure and anorectal descent during evacuation and a patulous anal canal was associated (P = 0.005) with large rectoceles (3 cm or larger). A principal component (PC) logistic model discriminated between patients with and without prolapse with 96% accuracy. Among patients with prolapse, there was…

### The assessment and management of defecatory dysfunction: a critical appraisal [^1123Wt3E]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

To summarize the advances in diagnostic modalities and management options for defecatory dysfunction and highlight the areas in need of further research, we see significant findings.

The diagnostic utility of high-resolution anorectal manometry (ARM), which has emerged as a promising tool for the diagnosis of defecatory dysfunction, appears questionable in differentiating disease from normal physiology. There is also a discrepancy between the results of various tests of anorectal function in the diagnosis of defecatory dysfunction. New revisions in diagnostic criteria for defecatory dysfunction by the Rome IV consortium may enhance its diagnostic yield. Biofeedback remains the most effective evidence-based treatment option for patients with defecatory dysfunction. Notably, the anorectal pressure profile cannot predict or mediate the success of biofeedback. However, biofeedback may improve symptoms through central effects.

Despite advances in ARM and defecography techniques, no single test has been able to be considered the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of defecatory dysfunction. The mechanism of action of biofeedback in defecatory dysfunction remains poorly understood.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for constipation, particularly concerning anorectal physiology testing, the ASCRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering anorectal physiology testing to identify functional or structural causes related to an evacuation disorder. This is suggested for patients not improving with dietary changes, fiber therapy, and osmotic laxatives.

### Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvic floor-a pictorial review [^116K7YbE]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

- **Importance of the evacuation phase**: Sagittal midline TrueFISP images at rest, during straining, and evacuation of a patient with descending perineal syndrome with tricompartimental prolapse, anterior rectocele, and rectal mucosa intussusception illustrate the condition. In the straining phase, the H and M lines (blue and right green lines) are already above normal values, indicating a descending perineal syndrome, and a mild bulge of the anterior rectal wall is seen (white arrow). However, in the evacuation phase, the true pelvic floor disorder is adequately characterized. There is a tricompartimental prolapse (cystocele, uterine prolapse, and rectal prolapse), the true size of the rectocele is documented (orange line: 4.8 cm), and the rectal mucosa intussusception is depicted (red arrow). The left green line indicates the extent of cystocele, the purple line shows the extent of uterine prolapse, the black line reflects the normal expected contour of the anterior anorectal wall, and the red line represents the PCL line.

Normal findings in an MR defecography relate to the values of all the measurements cited above, namely the H and M lines and the anorectal angle. No pelvic organ prolapse is considered clinically significant if it does not descend more than 1 cm below the PCL line. Regarding the posterior compartment, a mild descent is considered within the normal range (less than 3 cm below the PCL line). A quick note related to anterior rectoceles is that its grading system is based on the "rule of two", and a rectocele with less than 2 cm, more comprehensively described below, has no clinical significance.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^112oZv5f]. Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for constipation, particularly concerning history and physical examination, the AGA 2013 guidelines recommend performing a careful digital rectal examination (DRE) with an assessment of pelvic floor motion during simulated evacuation in patients with chronic constipation. It is important to note that a normal DRE does not exclude defecatory disorders.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^115YtxnT]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Patients' symptoms were assessed using the disease-specific quality of life questionnaires UDI and DDI. The UDI questionnaire has been revised and validated for the Dutch language. Originally, the UDI domain structure was developed with data from a highly selective population of highly educated women aged 45 years or older. The revised UDI can be applied to a broad population of women and is therefore recommended. The UDI consists of 11 items across five domains on bothersome urogenital symptoms: overactive bladder, urinary incontinence, obstructive micturition, pain, and genital prolapse. In this study, two domains — urinary incontinence and genital prolapse — were used because only these two urogenital symptoms have been described in relation to perineal descent in the literature.

The DDI measures bothersome defecatory symptoms and consists of 11 items in five domains: constipation, obstructive defecation, pain, incontinence, and flatulence. This questionnaire has been validated, though it has not yet been published. Appendix A presents the questions from the DDI to assess the presence of defecatory symptoms.

Participants were asked whether a symptom was present and, if so, the degree of bother experienced from that symptom, measured with a four-point Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' to 'a lot'. For factor analysis, scores from both parts of each question were transformed into: 1 = no symptom; 2 = symptom present, no bother; 3 = symptom present, slightly bothersome; 4 = symptom present, more bothersome.

### Descent and hypermobility of the rectum in women with obstructed defecation symptoms [^112udRat]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Obstructed defecation symptoms (ODS) are common in women; however, the key underlying anatomic factors remain poorly understood. We investigated rectal mobility and support defects in women with and without ODS using pelvic floor ultrasound and MR defecography.

- **Methods**: This prospective case-control study categorized subjects based on questions 7, 8, and 14 on the PFDI-20, which asks about obstructed defecation symptoms. All subjects underwent an interview, examination, and pelvic floor ultrasound. A subset of 16 subjects underwent MR defecography. The cul de sac-to-anorectal junction distance at rest and during maximum strain was measured on ultrasound and MRI images. The 'compression ratio' was calculated by dividing the change in rectovaginal septum length by its rest length to quantify rectal folding and hypermobility during dynamic imaging and to correlate with ODS.

- **Results**: Sixty-two women were recruited, 32 cases and 30 controls. There were no statistically significant differences in age, parity, BMI, or stage of rectocele between groups. A threshold analysis indicated the risk of ODS was 32 times greater (OR 32.5, 95% CI 4.8–217.1, p = 0.0003) among women with a high compression ratio (≥ 14) compared with those with a low compression ratio (< 14) after controlling for age, BMI, parity, stool type, and BM frequency.

- **Conclusions**: Female ODS are associated with distinct alterations in rectal mobility and support that can be clearly observed on dynamic ultrasound. The defects in rectal support were quantifiable using a compression ratio.

### Clinical and physiological findings, and possible aetiological factors of rectal hyposensitivity [^114s57YA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Rectal hyposensitivity (RH) relates to insensitivity of the rectum on anorectal physiological investigation and appears common in functional bowel disorders. The clinical significance of this physiological abnormality is unclear.

- **Method**: RH was defined as one or more sensory threshold volumes raised beyond the normal range (mean plus two standard deviations) on rectal balloon distension. Clinical information and results of other anorectal physiological investigations were evaluated in 261 patients with RH.

- **Results**: Patients with RH most commonly presented with constipation (48 percent), constipation and incontinence in combination (27 percent), or faecal incontinence (20 percent). Thirty-eight percent of patients had a history of previous pelvic surgery, 22 percent a history of anal surgery, and 13 percent a history of spinal trauma. In patients with RH presenting with symptoms of constipation or incontinence, impaired rectal sensation was the only abnormality on physiological investigation in 48 percent and 31 percent respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with RH display marked heterogeneity in terms of presenting symptoms. The exact causes of RH are unknown, but there is evidence to suggest that pelvic nerve injury and spinal trauma are possible aetiological factors. RH appears important in the aetiology of both constipation and faecal incontinence, and may be useful as a predictor of surgical outcome.

### Correlation between echodefecography and 3-dimensional vaginal ultrasonography in the detection of perineal descent in women with constipation symptoms [^116rGVVc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Defecography is an established method of evaluating dynamic anorectal dysfunction, but conventional defecography does not allow for visualization of anatomic structures.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to describe the use of dynamic 3-dimensional endovaginal ultrasonography for evaluating perineal descent in comparison with echodefecography (3-dimensional anorectal ultrasonography) and to study the relationship between perineal descent and symptoms and anatomic/functional abnormalities of the pelvic floor.

- **Design**: This was a prospective study.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a large university tertiary care hospital.

- **Patients**: Consecutive female patients were eligible if they had pelvic floor dysfunction, obstructed defecation symptoms, and a score > 6 on the Cleveland Clinic Florida Constipation Scale.

- **Interventions**: Each patient underwent both echodefecography and dynamic 3-dimensional endovaginal ultrasonography to evaluate posterior pelvic floor dysfunction.

- **Main outcome measures**: Normal perineal descent was defined on echodefecography as puborectalis muscle displacement ≤ 2.5 cm; excessive perineal descent was defined as displacement > 2.5 cm.

- **Results**: Of 61 women, 29 (48%) had normal perineal descent; 32 (52%) had excessive perineal descent. Endovaginal ultrasonography identified 27 of the 29 patients in the normal group as having anorectal junction displacement ≤ 1 cm (mean = 0.6 cm; range, 0.1–1.0 cm) and a mean anorectal junction position of 0.6 cm (range, 0–2.3 cm) above the symphysis pubis during the Valsalva maneuver.

### Survey of anal sphincter dysfunction using anal manometry in patients with fecal incontinence: A possible guide to therapy [^117F86Pd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the surge of new medical and surgical approaches to treat fecal incontinence, the types of sphincter abnormalities in patients with incontinence have not been well characterized. We aimed to categorize anal sphincter dysfunction using anorectal manometry in patients with fecal incontinence as a potential guide for improved treatment.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 162 consecutive patients with fecal incontinence referred for anorectal manometry was performed. Resting anal pressure and maximal squeeze pressure were considered as measures of internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter function, respectively.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patients was 63 years (range 13–89), with females comprising 81.5% and males 18.5%. Seventy-four percent of the patients had sphincter dysfunction on anorectal manometry. Internal anal sphincter dysfunction was present in 62% of patients, whereas external anal sphincter dysfunction was present in 44% of patients. Abnormal manometry was observed in 80% of females compared to 44% of males (P < 0.0001). Internal anal sphincter dysfunction was present in 68% of females compared to 37% of males (P = 0.0026).

- **Conclusions**: Overall, abnormal anorectal manometry studies revealed that internal anal sphincter dysfunction is the most common finding, either alone or in combination with external anal sphincter dysfunction. We suggest that anorectal manometry may be important to delineate anal sphincter function prior to using newer therapeutic mechanical devices. Future studies using pharmacological agents to increase internal anal sphincter tone may be of clinical importance.

### Rectal hyposensitivity is uncommon and unlikely to be the central cause of obstructed defecation in patients with high-grade internal rectal prolapse [^111FHp6r]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

There are several causes of obstructed defecation, one of which is thought to be internal rectal prolapse. Operations directed at internal prolapse, such as laparoscopic ventral rectopexy, may significantly improve obstructed defecation symptoms. It is not clear whether obstructed defecation with internal prolapse is a mechanical phenomenon or whether it results from changes in rectal sensitivity. This study aimed to evaluate rectal sensory function in patients with obstructed defecation and high-grade internal rectal prolapse.

- **Methods**: This study represents a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of patients attending a tertiary referral pelvic floor unit. Patients with high-grade (recto-anal) intussusception formed the basis of this study. Rectal sensory function was determined by intrarectal balloon inflation. Three parameters — sensory threshold, urge to defecate, and maximum tolerated volumes — were recorded. Abnormal sensitivity was defined as partial (one or two parameters abnormal) or total (all three abnormal).

- **Key results**: Four hundred and eight patients with high-grade internal rectal prolapse, both with and without obstructed defecation symptoms, were studied. Two hundred and forty-one (59%) had normal sensation. Eighteen (4%) had total hyposensitivity and three (1%) total hypersensitivity. A further 96 (24%) had partial hyposensitivity, whilst 50 (12%) had partial hypersensitivity. Neither hypersensitivity nor hyposensitivity differed between patients with and without symptoms of obstructed defecation.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Recta

### Optimizing the utility of anorectal manometry for diagnosis and therapy: A roundtable review and recommendations [^114fWenm]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

While anorectal manometry (ARM) is an accurate test for diagnosing fecal incontinence (FI) with intrapatient repeatability, there is some day-to-day variability in anorectal pressures, especially during simulated evacuation. Approaches to reverse-engineer intrapatient data have been proposed. As the summary variables derived from standard software include only a fraction of the actual data captured during ARM, the reverse-engineering approach offers a way to extract and analyze raw data, providing a potentially more useful summary of rectoanal pressure variables, but this merits further study. Several types of dyssynergia have been identified by ARM and shown to be reproducible. Although dyssynergia type does not affect diagnosis or outcomes, it informs the biofeedback therapist and patient about which aspects of biofeedback therapy (BT) will help achieve normal bowel function and how to tailor the treatment based on the pathophysiological dysfunction.

Overcoming these challenges requires the engagement of researchers, academicians, community physicians, and advanced practice providers. Healthcare providers need to understand the importance of ARM, its indications or contraindications, and when or where to refer. Likewise, community physicians and institutions should consider adding this technology to improve the care of patients with anorectal disorders. Data demonstrating the impact of ARM on management decisions and treatment outcomes are needed, and these limitations can be overcome through increased knowledge and the perceived value of ARM.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^113XaK4M]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging study was to assess the relation between the position and mobility of the perineum and patients' symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Patients' symptoms were measured with the use of validated questionnaires. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationship between the questionnaires domain scores and the perineal position on dynamic MR imaging, as well as baseline characteristics, including age, body mass index, and parity.

- **Results**: Sixty-nine women were included in the analysis. Only the domain score for genital prolapse was associated with the perineal position on dynamic MR imaging, with the strongest association observed at rest.

- **Conclusions**: Pelvic organ prolapse symptoms were associated with the degree of descent of the perineum on dynamic MR imaging. Perineal descent was not related to anorectal and/or urinary incontinence symptoms.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^115KqBiC]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The study assessed perineal descent in one direction and in one plane only. It is unknown whether the direction of the movement of the perineum during strain varies or whether perineal bulging was adequately assessed by the measurements used. The study did not assess parallel displacement in relation to the pubococcygeal line, only the perpendicular one, which may be a limitation. The presence of a levator ani hernia, whether unilateral or bilateral, has been previously described in association with perineal descent. Although the significance of levator ani hernia is unknown, these hernias were not assessed in this study. Dynamic MR imaging assessment in the coronal or axial plane may be a valuable adjunct for evaluating patients presenting with the physical findings of perineal descent. However, no significant differences in symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and pelvic pain have been described in patients with or without a levator ani hernia thus far.

It is conceivable that the symptoms associated with perineal descent are still undefined and that the right questions have not been asked. For instance, considerable perineal descent might be accompanied by a heavy feeling in the lower abdomen and the pelvic floor, which were not represented in the questionnaires. Further research is needed in this respect.

In conclusion, only pelvic organ prolapse symptoms were associated with the degree of descent of the perineum, not the anorectal symptoms and symptoms of urinary incontinence.

### Measurements of pelvic floor dyssynergia: Which test result matters [^1148QG8c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Failure to expel a 60-mL balloon on manometry and abnormal relaxation of the anal sphincter on electromyographic testing are commonly used to diagnose pelvic floor dyssynergia. However, the relationship between these two test results and their association with defecography is poorly characterized. This study aimed to describe this relationship and develop a predictive model for pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography.

From March 2008 to April 2010, consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of functional constipation were evaluated at our Pelvic Floor Disorders Center, and the results of their workups were collected prospectively. Sixty-three patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography were compared with 60 patients without dyssynergia in terms of manometry pressures, electromyographic test results, and balloon expulsion testing results using χ and t tests.

Out of 125 patients meeting the Rome II symptom criteria for constipation, 123 patients underwent defecography. Of these, 63 (51.2%) had evidence of pelvic floor dyssynergia. Patients with and without dyssynergia showed a slight difference in mean resting pressures (62.8 mmHg vs. 49.5 mmHg, P = 0.02) and no discernible differences in rectal sensitivity and compliance, specifically first sensation (56.5 vs. 62.5, P = 0.34) and maximum tolerated volume (164.2 vs. 191.2, P = 0.09). It appeared that abnormalities in electromyographic relaxation and balloon expulsion occurred in the same patients; 84.1% of patients with abnormal electromyographic results also did not expel the balloon.

### A new method for assessing anal distensibility with a barostat and magnetic resonance imaging in healthy and constipated women [^114QXuYx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

Defecation requires relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters. High anal resting pressure is associated with painful constipation, defecatory disorders, and increased healthcare utilization in constipated patients; the mechanisms are unclear. Perhaps patients with a high anal resting pressure have a less distensible canal, which impedes defecation.

- **Methods**: In 50 of 64 participants (33 healthy and 17 constipated women), anal pressures and distensibility were measured, respectively, with manometry and balloon distention combined with magnetic resonance imaging; rectal balloon expulsion time (BET) was also studied.

- **Results**: The BET (P = 0.006) was longer, and the mean (SD) rectoanal pressure gradient (-58[40] vs. -34[26] mm Hg, P = 0.03) was more negative in constipated than healthy women; anal resting pressure was not different. During anal distention, the balloon expanded rapidly at an opening pressure of 49 (18) mm Hg, which was lower (P < .0001) than resting pressure (90 [25] mm Hg). The resting pressure was correlated with the opening pressure (r = 0.57, P < .0001) and inversely (r = -0.38, P = 0.007) with maximum volume but not with anal distensibility (volume-pressure slope). In healthy women, the difference (opening-resting pressure) was correlated with anal relaxation during evacuation (r = 0.35, P = 0.04). Anal distensibility and sensory thresholds were not different between constipated and healthy women.

- **Conclusions**: Among healthy and constipated women, a greater anal resting pressure is correlated with greater opening pressure and lower maximum volume, but it is not correlated with anal distensibility.

### Anal canal to pubis angle: A novel clinical ultrasound technique for the assessment of the anorectal region [^113TK9gX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The anal canal to pubis angle is a novel validated measurement for the assessment of the anal axis in the anorectal region. It was found to be wider in prolapse patients compared to controls (two-sample t-test, p < 0.001). In this study, the control group consisted of young nulliparous, non-pregnant, asymptomatic women, while the prolapse group included peri- and post-menopausal women.

Age is known to affect pelvic floor anatomy and functional symptoms. Inherent differences in pelvic floor anatomy have been demonstrated in young versus older nulliparous women without any known or symptomatic prolapse. A longitudinal Irish study of primiparous young women, just 1 year after birth, showed a 70% (142/202) prevalence of asymptomatic prolapse. Further research with age-matched controls would offer more understanding of the impact of age alone and age with prolapse on the pelvic floor.

When considering all the methods available for imaging the posterior compartment of the pelvic floor, MRI or fluoroscopic evacuation proctography is the gold standard for posterior compartment assessment, particularly for obstructive defaecation symptoms (ODS) and identification of intussusception. Defaecating imaging involves a preparation enema followed by barium paste contrast inserted in the rectum. In MRI defaecating proctograms, the patient lies flat in the MRI scanner and attempts to evacuate the rectal contrast. In fluoroscopic defaecating proctograms, the patient must evacuate the rectal contrast in the radiography department on a commode during flu.

### Pathophysiology of adult fecal incontinence [^113DV7NM]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence occurs when the normal anatomy or physiology that maintains the structure and function of the anorectal unit is disrupted. Incontinence usually results from the interplay of multiple pathogenic mechanisms and is rarely attributable to a single factor. The internal anal sphincter (IAS) provides most of the resting anal pressure and is reinforced during voluntary squeeze by the external anal sphincter (EAS), the anal mucosal folds, and the anal endovascular cushions. Disruption or weakness of the EAS can cause urge-related or diarrhea-associated fecal incontinence. Damage to the endovascular cushions may produce a poor anal "seal" and an impaired anorectal sampling reflex.

The ability of the rectum to perceive the presence of stool leads to the rectoanal contractile reflex response, an essential mechanism for maintaining continence. Pudendal neuropathy can diminish rectal sensation and lead to excessive accumulation of stool, causing fecal impaction, mega-rectum, and fecal overflow. The puborectalis muscle plays an integral role in maintaining the anorectal angle. Its nerve supply is independent of the sphincter, and its precise role in maintaining continence needs to be defined.

Obstetric trauma, the most common cause of anal sphincter disruption, may involve the EAS, the IAS, and the pudendal nerves, singly or in combination. It remains unclear why most women who sustain obstetric injury in their 20s or 30s typically do not present with fecal incontinence until their 50s. There is a strong need for prospective, long-term studies of sphincter function.

### Current and future perspectives on the utility of provocative tests of anal sphincter function: A state-of-the-art summary [^117VdFMg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

The maintenance of fecal continence depends upon coordinated interactions between the pelvic floor, anorectum, and anal sphincter complex, orchestrated by central and peripheral neural activities. Techniques to objectively measure anorectal function rely on fixed diameter catheters placed inside the anal canal with a rectal balloon to obtain measurements of anal resting and squeeze function and rectal compliance. Until recently, it had not been possible to measure the distensibility of the anal canal, or in other words, its ability to resist opening against increasing pressure, which has been proposed as the main determinant of a biological sphincter's function. Anal acoustic reflectometry (AAR) and the functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) are two novel, provocative techniques that dynamically assess the anal sphincter complex under volume-controlled distension. In doing so, both provide information on the viscoelastic properties of the anal canal and offer new insights into its function.

This review details the potential future applications of AAR and FLIP and highlights the unanswered questions relevant to these new technologies.

### The added value of conventional defecography and MRI defecography in clinical decision making on treatment for posterior compartment prolapse [^117BLc6F]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). High credibility.

The parameters assessed during the radiological evaluation of the dynamic X-ray and MRI defecography scans included the presence and severity of rectocele, enterocele, peritoneocele (only on MRI), sigmoidocele, rectal intussusception, fecal residue, fecal incontinence, and measurement of the anorectal angle (ARA, only on MRI). Rectocele was quantified radiologically as the depth of abnormal bulges in the rectum wall beyond its expected margin on the anterior side. Enterocele, peritoneocele, and sigmoidocele were quantified as herniation of a part of the peritoneum in the space between the rectum and the vagina below the proximal one-third of the vagina. It was identified as enterocele when it consisted of the small intestine, peritoneocele when it consisted of fatty tissue, and sigmoidocele when it consisted of the sigmoid colon.

Rectal intussusception was radiologically quantified as an invagination of the rectal wall into the rectal lumen during defecation. Fecal residue was described as the presence of a contrast agent in the rectum after defecation, while fecal incontinence was identified when the patient lost the fecal contrast agent before the defecation phase. The ARA was measured between the anal canal and the posterior border of the distal part of the rectum. The normal physiological boundaries at rest are between 108° to 127°, with an approximate decrease of 15° to 20° during contraction and an approximate increase of 15° to 20° during Valsalva and defecation. In cases of discrepancy between the X-ray and MRI defecography, the outcome of the conventional defecography was considered.

### Distensibility of the anal canal in patients with idiopathic fecal incontinence: A study with the functional lumen imaging probe [^112Zfx7t]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Anatomical structures and their distensibility vary along the length of the anal canal. The anal sphincter muscles have dynamic properties that are not well reflected by standard manometry. Abnormal distensibility of the anal canal may be of importance in idiopathic fecal incontinence (IFI). The functional lumen imaging probe (FLIP) allows detailed studies of the distensibility and axial variation of sphincters. We aimed to compare segmental distensibility of the anal canal in patients with IFI and healthy subjects.

- **Methods**: The FLIP was used for distension of the anal canal in 22 patients with IFI (17 female, age 27–82 years) and 21 healthy volunteers (18 female, age 32–73 years). The distensibility was determined from changes in luminal diameter. Closure of the anal canal during voluntary squeeze was computed as the combined length of closed anal canal and time. Pressure-strain elastic modulus was computed at rest.

- **Key results**: In all subjects, the proximal anal canal was the most distensible segment. During distension at rest and during squeeze, the middle and distal anal canal became significantly larger in IFI than in healthy subjects (F 4.5, p 0.05).

- **Conclusions and inferences**: Patients with IFI have increased distensibility of the middle anal canal compared to healthy individuals.

### Anal sphincter function in rectal intussusception and high and low "take-off" external rectal prolapse-a prospective observational study [^1153LDcr]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Low credibility.

The resulting measurements are used to create a graph of CSA versus pressure to calculate AAR variables at the point of the minimum CSA. At rest, five parameters are observed, including the opening pressure (Op, cmH₂O), which reflects the pressure at which the anal canal starts to open during distension. The closing pressure (Cp, cmH₂O) is the pressure at which the anal canal closes down again following an episode of distension. Opening elastance (Oe, cmH₂O/mm²) and closing elastance (Ce, cmH₂O/mm²) reflect the resistance of the anal canal to distension or the resistance to it closing, respectively. Hysteresis (Hys, %) reflects the amount of energy dissipated during one cycle of opening and closing of the anal canal.

Two parameters are calculated during voluntary contraction: squeeze opening pressure (SqOp, cmH₂O) and squeeze opening elastance (SqOe, cmH₂O/mm²). Figure 2 presents a graph of CSA versus pressure obtained from one cycle of opening and closing (inflation and deflation) of the AAR bag in the anal canal at rest, with the five resting parameters highlighted. The difference between SqOp and Op is defined as the incremental squeeze opening pressure (IncSqOp, cmH₂O) and reflects the maximum pressure generated by striated muscle during a squeeze above the Op at rest. These measured parameters and their clinical significance have been discussed previously.

### Clinical value of MR defecography: What additional knowledge is provided by the radiologist to the surgeon [^112RABoq]. European Journal of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

To evaluate the clinical value of MR defecography in supporting surgical decision-making and management strategies, a consecutive series of patients with clinical suspicion of pelvic disorders underwent MR defecography at a single university hospital from January 2021 to June 2024. MR defecography was performed at rest (axial/sagittal and coronal T2-weighted sequences), and during squeezing, straining, and evacuation (dynamic sagittal T2-weighted sequences).

An expert surgeon assessed his satisfaction with the diagnostic information provided by the prospective radiological report using a scale: 1 for insufficient, 2 for sufficient, 3 for good, and 4 for excellent. For patients who underwent surgery, the same surgeon rated the usefulness of the MR defecography on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 for discordant findings and useless exam; 2 for concordant findings without new information; 3 for concordant findings with useful new information; 4 for concordant findings and extremely useful new information).

A total of 218 patients (age range 27–79, mean age 60 ± 11; 193 females and 25 males) were included in the analysis. For 211 of these patients (97%), the radiologist was able to evaluate the images and determine an MR defecography-based diagnosis. In 7 patients (3%), a diagnosis was not provided due to exam interruption caused by low patient compliance. In 195 out of 211 patients (92%), the radiological diagnosis matched the clinical suspicion that prompted the examination. The satisfaction with the diagnostic information provided by the radiological report of the 211 exams was…

### The international anorectal physiology working group (IAPWG) recommendations: Standardized testing protocol and the London classification for disorders of anorectal function [^116VAtCg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, characterized by fecal incontinence and/or constipation/evacuation disorders, affect the quality of life of between 1% and 5% of the population. Anorectal manometry (ARM), the rectal sensory test (RST), and the balloon expulsion test (BET) are the best-established investigations for the objective assessment of anorectal sensorimotor function. Comprehensive assessment involves a series of measurements that describe voluntary and involuntary control of the anal canal, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) rectoanal coordination, evacuatory function, and rectal sensation.

Several studies have demonstrated that variations in hardware and protocol, particularly for ARM, influence the results of these investigations and could impact diagnosis and management. Previous position statements and working party reports have already provided guidance on techniques for data acquisition, analysis, and reporting. Despite this, a recent study conducted by our group showed ongoing widespread discordance in practice between institutions.

The introduction of high-resolution ARM (HR-ARM) has increased the spatial resolution of data acquisition and provides a continuous visualization of pressure activity from the rectum and the anal canal. This technique is now used in greater than 50% of institutions performing anorectal physiological tests. However, this advancement has added a further element of variability in practice, and unless efforts are made early to reach a consensus on test performance, this technological progression may lead to inconsistency in applications.

### Dynamic imaging of posterior compartment pelvic floor dysfunction by evacuation proctography: Techniques, indications, results and limitations [^111mvsPK]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical management of patients with anorectal and pelvic floor dysfunction is often challenging. Evacuation proctography has evolved from a method used primarily to evaluate the anorectum for functional disorders to its current status as a practical method for assessing anorectal dysfunction and pelvic floor prolapse. It is noted for its high observer accuracy and yield of positive diagnoses. Clinicians find it to be of significant benefit, as it has led to changes in management from surgical to medical approaches and vice versa in a substantial number of cases.

### Perineal descent and patients' symptoms of anorectal dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence [^111HKYoX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In this study, the ability of MR imaging measurements to discriminate women with clear symptoms from those with no or minor symptoms was assessed. For this purpose, the questionnaire domain scores were dichotomized as follows: 'no and minor symptoms', which are equal to: 'no symptom', 'symptom present, no bother', or 'symptom present, slightly bothersome' (domain score < 33.33), and 'clear symptoms', which are equal to: 'symptom present, moderately bothersome', or 'symptom present, greatly bothersome' (domain score ≥ 33.33), respectively.

Univariate logistic regression was used to study the relationship between the questionnaire domain scores and each of the measurements of the perineal position (using MR imaging) and the baseline characteristics (i.e. age, BMI, and parity) separately. The dependent variable was the probability that an individual is classified into the highest coded category of a specific domain score (i.e. 'clear symptoms'). The independent variable was one of the MR imaging measurements or one of the baseline characteristics, respectively. The crude odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals are presented.

Spearman's rank correlation test was used to test the correlation between measurements of the perineal position and age, BMI, and parity for statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of anal motor and rectal sensory dysfunction in male and female patients undergoing anorectal manometry for symptoms of faecal incontinence [^114CUFCs]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Overall, anal hypocontractility was the most common abnormality in both women and men. In individual studies, the prevalence of anal hypocontractility generally exceeded that of anal hypotonia, and rates of hypocontractility were nearly always greater in women than in men. The risk for anal sphincter barrier dysfunction is greatest in women due to obstetric injuries, including structural defects and pudendal neuropathy, while in men sphincter barrier dysfunction is generally considered to be iatrogenic. However, even in the absence of structural sphincter defects, chronic straining at stool and subsequent pelvic floor denervation may also lead to hypocontractility in both men and women. Constipation and FI are known to coexist in a sizeable proportion of patients with FI.

While the prevalence of male hypotonia was reduced in more recent studies, perhaps due to more sphincter-sparing surgery, the prevalence of anal hypotonia and hypocontractility in women remained consistent over the duration of included studies, spanning more than 30 years. This consistency is probably because the lag between sphincter injury and symptom occurrence in women is usually several decades, meaning that the benefits of any change in obstetric practice, such as the move from posterior to mediolateral episiotomy, have yet to translate to observed changes in physiology. Notably, excluding patients with sphincter defects did not reduce the prevalence of hypocontractility in relation to other studies. Bharucha et al. was the only other study to specifically exclude patients with sphincter defects.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the evaluation of anorectal function [^114wTtHt]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence and evacuation disorders are prevalent conditions that significantly impair quality of life and lead to substantial economic costs globally. Since symptoms alone are insufficient predictors of underlying pathophysiology and etiology, diagnostic tests of anorectal function are crucial in patient management, especially in cases resistant to conservative therapies. Over the past decade, significant technological advancements have enhanced our understanding of anorectal structure, coordination, and sensorimotor function.

This consensus statement provides an evaluation of the indications, performance characteristics, clinical utility, strengths, and limitations of the most commonly available tests of anorectal structure and function. These include ultrasonography, MRI, anorectal manometry, neurophysiological investigations, rectal distension techniques, and tests of evacuation, such as defecography. Additionally, this article presents our consensus on the clinical relevance of these diagnostic tests.

### Optimizing the utility of anorectal manometry for diagnosis and therapy: A roundtable review and recommendations [^116K71JT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Anorectal manometry (ARM) is a comprehensive diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with constipation, fecal incontinence, or anorectal pain; however, it is not widely utilized for reasons that remain unclear. The aim of this roundtable discussion was to critically examine the clinical practices of ARM and biofeedback therapy by physicians and surgeons in both academic and community settings.

- **Methods**: Leaders in medical and surgical gastroenterology and physical therapy with interest in anorectal disorders were surveyed regarding practice patterns and utilization of these technologies. Subsequently, a roundtable was held to discuss survey results, explore diagnostic and therapeutic challenges with these technologies, review the literature, and generate consensus-based recommendations.

- **Results**: ARM identifies key pathophysiological abnormalities such as dyssynergic defecation, anal sphincter weakness, or rectal sensory dysfunction and is a critical component of biofeedback therapy, an evidence-based treatment for patients with dyssynergic defecation and fecal incontinence. Additionally, ARM has the potential to enhance health-related quality of life and reduce healthcare costs. However, it faces significant barriers that include a lack of education and training of healthcare providers regarding the utility and availability of ARM and biofeedback procedures, as well as challenges with condition-specific testing protocols and interpretation. Additional barriers include understanding when to perform, where to refer, and how to use these technologies effectively.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of anal motor and rectal sensory dysfunction in male and female patients undergoing anorectal manometry for symptoms of faecal incontinence [^114z8cnJ]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Outcome data were selected to reflect the specific aims of the review, namely to determine the pooled prevalence of anal hypotonia/hypocontractility and rectal hypersensitivity/hyposensitivity in male and female FI patients. These data (hereafter denoted primary outcomes) were extracted as the proportion of the patient population studied whose measures of anal motor function or rectal sensory function fell below the lower limit of normal defined in referenced healthy control subjects. In addition, data were collected on publication year, country of origin, study design, study period, mean or median age of study participants, types of FI, definitions of FI, total number of HVs, and cut-off values and definitions used to determine 'abnormal' for each outcome measure. The type of equipment and method used to perform anorectal manometry and/or rectal sensitivity testing were also recorded.

- **Assessment of risk of bias**: Study quality was assessed using a modified version of the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Case–Control Studies. Two reviewers independently scored included studies out of a maximum of 12 points, with 1 point gained for each 'yes' answer, indicating that the study met the quality condition being assessed. Disagreements were resolved through discussion, and a third reviewer (SMS) was consulted if required for resolution. Parameters assessed were research question, methods of randomization, study population, sample size justification, random selection of study participants, controls, and other criteria relevant to study quality.

### Surgical management of rectal prolapse [^115fwDmt]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

This article reviews the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and surgical management of rectal prolapse. Full-thickness prolapse of the rectum causes significant discomfort due to the sensation of the prolapse itself, the mucus secretion, and the tendency to stretch the anal sphincters, causing incontinence. Treatment of rectal prolapse is primarily surgical.

- **Perineal surgical repairs**: These are well tolerated but generally associated with higher recurrence rates.
- **Abdominal repairs**: These involve fixing the rectum to the sacrum using either mesh or sutures and tend to have the lowest recurrence rates. If significant preoperative constipation is present, a sigmoid resection can be performed during rectopexy. For many patients, diarrhea and incontinence improve after surgery.
- **Laparoscopic repair**: This approach has similar morbidity and recurrence rates compared to open surgery, with benefits such as reduced length of hospital stay, postoperative pain, and wound complications.

### Digitation associated with defecation: What does it mean in urogynaecological patients [^1112nT3Z]. International Urogynecology Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Obstructed defecation is a common symptom complex in urogynaecological patients, and perineal, vaginal, and/or anal digitation may be required for defecation. Translabial ultrasound can be used to assess anorectal anatomy, similar to defecation proctography. The aim of the present study was to determine the association between different forms of digitation (vaginal, perineal, and anal) and abnormal posterior compartment anatomy.

- **Methods**: A total of 271 patients were analysed in a retrospective study utilising archived ultrasound volume datasets. Symptoms of obstructed defecation, such as straining at stool, incomplete bowel emptying, and perineal, vaginal, and anal digitation, were ascertained through interviews. Postprocessing of stored 3D/4D translabial ultrasound datasets obtained on maximal Valsalva was used to diagnose descent of the rectal ampulla, rectocoele, enterocoele, and rectal intussusception at a later date, blinded to all clinical data.

- **Results**: Digitation was reported by 39% of our population. The position of the rectal ampulla on Valsalva was associated with perineal (p = 0.02) and vaginal (p = 0.02) digitation. The presence of a true rectocoele was significantly associated with perineal (p = 0.04) and anal (p = 0.03) digitation. Rectocoele depth was associated with all three forms of digitation (p = 0.005–0.02). The bother of symptoms of obstructed defecation was strongly associated with digitation (all p ≤ 0.001), with no appreciable difference in bother among the three forms.

### The added value of conventional defecography and MRI defecography in clinical decision making on treatment for posterior compartment prolapse [^115DBFKj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Conventional defecography and MRI defecography can be requested as additional tests for diagnosing and differentiating the type of posterior compartment prolapse and/or obstructive defecation disorders. The objective of this study was to determine the added value of conventional defecography and MRI defecography for clinical decision-making on treatment for patients with posterior compartment prolapse.

- **Methods**: Four gynecologists were asked to fill in their treatment plan per patient for 32 cases across three different steps. Step 1 consisted of information on the anamnesis and physical examination (POP-Q). Step 2 consisted of Step 1 information, including conventional defecography (group A) or MRI defecography (group B). In Step 3, all gynecologists received the information from Step 1, including both conventional defecography and MRI defecography. Data analysis focused on assessing changes in the gynecological treatment plan for the posterior compartment.

- **Results**: After Step 2, a change in the treatment plan occurred in 37% and 48% of the women in groups A and B, respectively. Similarly, after Step 3 (including all imaging data), a change in the treatment plan occurred in 19% and 52% of the women in groups A and B, respectively. A change within the surgery group (when a different type of surgery was selected) was noted for 11 cases in group A and 20 in group B across all steps.

- **Conclusions**: Both conventional defecography and MRI defecography had a significant effect on the treatment plan for patients with posterior compartment prolapse. This highlights their importance in clinical decision-making for affected patients.

### Anal acoustic reflectometry: A new reproducible technique providing physiological assessment of anal sphincter function [^117WNi7d]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Anal acoustic reflectometry is a new technique for assessing anal sphincter function. Five new variables reflecting anal canal function are measured: the opening and closing pressure, the opening and closing elastance, and hysteresis.

This study aimed to compare the reproducibility of this new technique, in terms of test-retest and interrater reliability, with manometry, the standard test of sphincter function. It is a comparative study of reproducibility between anal acoustic reflectometry and manometry, conducted at a university hospital in an outpatient clinic and endoscopy unit.

Twenty-six subjects (21 female) were assessed with both anal acoustic reflectometry and manometry on two separate occasions to determine test-retest reliability. Additionally, 22 subjects (16 female) were assessed with both methods by two separate investigators to determine interrater reliability.

Reproducibility was assessed according to the Bland-Altman method. All of the measured novel anal acoustic reflectometry parameters had acceptable mean differences and repeatability coefficients. A comparison of the two methods of sphincter assessment (anal acoustic reflectometry vs. manometry) was made for measurements taken at rest and during voluntary contraction. There was no significant difference in terms of test-retest reliability between the manometry maximum resting pressure vs. the reflectometry opening pressure (P = 0.57) or manometry maximum squeeze pressure vs. the reflectometry squeeze opening pressure (P = 0.68).

### Relationship between anal functional lumen imaging probe (EndoFLIP®) results and the clinical presentation of faecal incontinence [^114mDk6c]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

We studied the relationship between anal distensibility index (DI) and faecal incontinence (FI) subtype using the EndoFLIP® system. A weak relationship was detected between the anal DI at rest at 50 mL of distension and passive FI. A dysfunction of the internal anal sphincter may lead to poor sealing of the anal canal at rest, causing passive FI. Conversely, a dysfunction of the external anal sphincter could result in insufficient closure of the anal canal when stool arrives in the rectum, potentially leading to urge incontinence. Given these two mechanisms, we expected to correlate urge FI with external anal sphincter dysfunction and passive FI with internal anal sphincter dysfunction.

However, as previously reported, we did not find any significant difference in the distribution of anal hypocontractility and anal hypotonia recorded by anal manometry among the three FI subtypes. The frequency of anatomical or neuropathic sphincter lesions was not tied to a specific FI subtype, as expected, since these lesions might represent potential causes of dysfunction rather than the dysfunction itself.

Given the EndoFLIP® system's superiority in quantifying resistance to anal distension — an important variable for anal continence — it should be more accurate in detecting sphincter dysfunctions. In this study, the resting anal DI at 50 mL of distension differed significantly, with the passive subtype having the highest values and the urge subtype the lowest. However, anal DI during voluntary contraction was not significantly different between the FI subtypes. The DI at squeeze may more accurately reflect the isolated action of the sphincters.

### Anal sphincter function in rectal intussusception and high and low "take-off" external rectal prolapse-a prospective observational study [^116fFAKv]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Low credibility.

The AAR parameter of opening pressure is the pressure at which the anal canal starts to open during distension, and is predominantly an assessment of IAS function. The resistance to distension is measured with elastance, which is lower in patients with passive FI. The findings in this study of reduced pressures and elastance at rest suggest an association between the grade of symptomatic prolapse and IAS dysfunction. This is further supported by the increased prevalence of FI and faecal leakage as the Oxford grade increases.

Hysteresis reflects the amount of energy dissipated during one cycle of opening and closing the anal canal. It is greater in patients with FI compared to controls but is not associated with FI related to IAS dysfunction, and was no different between the three groups of RI and ERP in this study.

The IAS dysfunction seen in this study associated with the grade of prolapse may be a consequence of mechanical stress applied to the sphincter by the prolapsing rectum. Dvorkin et al. highlighted thickened and asymmetrical IAS on endoanal ultrasound in patients with ERP. Indeed, the frequency of severe IAS injury reported on endoanal ultrasound is greater in patients with ERP compared to grade III/IV RI, and the severity of injury correlates with improvements in postoperative continence. However, other authors have suggested intra-anal RI is associated with an absent or impaired rectoanal inhibitory reflex due to its persistent activation, or damage to the IAS resulting in symptoms of FI.

### Phenotypic variation in functional disorders of defecation [^112VuCFR]. Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Aims: Although obstructed defecation is generally attributed to pelvic floor dyssynergia, clinical observations suggest a wider spectrum of anorectal disturbances. Our aim was to characterize phenotypic variability in constipated patients by anorectal assessments.

Methods: Anal pressures, rectal balloon expulsion, rectal sensation, and pelvic floor structure (by endoanal magnetic resonance imaging) and motion (by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed in 52 constipated women and 41 age-matched asymptomatic women. Phenotypes were characterized in patients by principal components analysis of these measurements.

Results: Among patients, 16 had a hypertensive anal sphincter, 41 had an abnormal rectal balloon expulsion test, and 20 had abnormal rectal sensation. Forty-nine patients (94%) had abnormal pelvic floor motion during evacuation and/or squeeze. After correcting for age and body mass index, three principal components explained 71% of variance between patients. These factors were weighted most strongly by perineal descent during evacuation (factor 1), anorectal location at rest (factor 2), and anal resting pressure (factor 3). Factors 1 and 3 discriminated between controls and patients. Compared with patients with normal (n = 23) or reduced (n = 18) perineal descent, patients with increased (n = 11) descent were more likely (P < 0.05) to have a hypertensive anal sphincter, anal resting pressure > 90 mm Hg, and have a normal rectal balloon expulsion test result.

Conclusions: These observations demonstrate that functional defecation disorders comprise a heterogeneous spectrum in constipated patients.

### Biofeedback efficacy for outlet dysfunction constipation: Clinical outcomes and predictors of response by a limited approach [^112k1iCX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

We have demonstrated that it is possible to select constipated patients who have a higher chance of improving with biofeedback (BF) therapy. The straining questionnaire, the augmented-digital rectal examination (DRE), and some clinical features (such as digitation to facilitate defecation and hard stools) were associated with BF response. However, these features were correlated, and the only features that made an independent contribution to the outcome were digital facilitation of defecation and adequate abdominal contraction during push, which predicted failure to BF. The use of manual maneuvers may serve as a clinical predictor of a scarce response to BF, and physicians should evaluate alternative therapy for these patients. These data confirm the findings from our previous randomized trial.

Colonic transit time (CTT), when available, may be a useful tool to further screen refractory chronic constipation (CC): evidence of slow transit (especially right-sided) is strongly associated with BF response. Several studies have indeed linked this specific CTT pattern to evacuation disorders. These data are also in line with our former report on BF efficacy for slow transit constipation. Although slow transit was associated with BF response, our data do not support the use of CTT as a predictor of BF response.

Predictive values of our proposed tools differ from those in other recently published studies where anal sphincter pressures predicted BF outcomes in community practice constipated patients. The discrepancy may be explained by different patient selection, as we chose to study tertiary care referral subjects. Moreover, high-resolution anorectal manometry was not available in our studies.

### Imaging modalities for the detection of posterior pelvic floor disorders in women with obstructed defaecation syndrome [^111y6YH2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Obstructed defaecation syndrome (ODS) is characterized by difficulty in evacuating stools, requiring straining efforts during defaecation, experiencing a sensation of incomplete evacuation, or needing to manually assist defaecation. This condition is due to a physical blockage of the faecal stream during defaecation attempts, caused by rectocele, enterocele, intussusception, anismus, or pelvic floor descent. Evacuation proctography (EP) is the most common imaging technique used for diagnosing posterior pelvic floor disorders. It has been regarded as the reference standard due to extensive usage experience, although it has been proven not to have perfect accuracy. Moreover, EP is invasive, embarrassing, and involves exposure to ionising radiation. Alternative imaging techniques that address these issues have been developed and assessed for their accuracy. Due to varying results leading to a lack of consensus, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature are required.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic test accuracy of EP, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pelvic floor ultrasound for the detection of posterior pelvic floor disorders in women with ODS, using latent class analysis in the absence of a reference standard. The study also aims to assess whether MRI or ultrasound could replace EP. The secondary objective is to investigate differences in diagnostic test accuracy concerning the use of rectal contrast, evacuation phase, patient position, and cut-off values, which could influence test outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We conducted an electronic search on 18 December 2019 in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase.

### Relationship among anal sphincter injury, patulous anal canal, and anal pressures in patients with anorectal disorders [^112YyiSa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The anal sphincters and puborectalis are imaged routinely with an endoanal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coil, which does not assess co-aptation of the anal canal at rest. By using an MRI torso coil, we identified a patulous anal canal in some patients with anorectal disorders. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between anal sphincter and puborectalis injury, a patulous anal canal, and anal pressures.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 119 patients who underwent MRI and manometry analysis of anal anatomy and pressures, respectively, from February 2011 through March 2013 at the Mayo Clinic. Anal pressures were determined by high-resolution manometry. Anal sphincter and puborectalis injury was assessed by endoanal MRI, and anal canal integrity was determined by torso MRI. Associations between manometric and anatomic parameters were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: Fecal incontinence (55 patients; 46%) and constipation (36 patients; 30%) were the main indications for testing. Forty-nine patients (41%) had a patulous anal canal, which was associated with injury to more than one muscle (all P ≤ .001) and internal sphincter (P < .01), but not puborectalis (P = 0.09) or external sphincter (P = 0.06) injury. Internal (P < .01) and external sphincter injury (P = 0.02) and a patulous canal (P < .001), but not puborectalis injury, predicted anal resting pressure. A patulous anal canal was the only significant predictor (P < .01) of the anal squeeze pressure increment.

### Ventral rectopexy: An international expert panel consensus and review of contemporary literature [^113wncv8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2025). Low credibility.

Examination should involve perianal inspection for any deviation from the midline and the presence or absence of perineal descent; digital rectal examination to assess sphincter integrity, sphincter tone, sphincter squeeze, and coordination; and inspection for the presence of a rectocele to exclude other pathology. Anoscopy is recommended alongside the evaluation of prolapse, whether on the examination table or in the commode. A vaginal examination should be performed to ensure there is no concomitant posterior or anterior vaginal prolapse to the introitus, or patients should be examined by a urogynecologist. This should all be undertaken in the context of trauma-informed care, acknowledging that many patients within this population have a history of trauma and that examinations are sensitive. Adopting such a practice can improve engagement, treatment, and outcomes.

- **Statement 5**: Consideration should be given to dynamic defecatory imaging, anorectal function testing, endoscopic evaluation, and a formal multidisciplinary review (91% consensus). Most patients should undergo dynamic defecatory imaging and endoscopic evaluation. In addition, anorectal function testing may be helpful to guide nonoperative management. Furthermore, it is recommended that a multidisciplinary review be undertaken before surgery.

Dynamic imaging in the form of perineal echodefecography, fluoroscopic defecography, or MRI defecography is recommended to help assess the biomechanics of the prolapse with the goal of informing operative technique. Fluoroscopic imaging and MRI are the most frequent options.
