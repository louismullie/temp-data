## Question

A 35-year-old man is admitted to the burn unit with partial-thickness burns covering 18% of his total body surface area after a workplace accident. He is alert, hemodynamically stable, and reports severe pain (8/10) at rest and with dressing changes. The resident prescribes a fixed high-dose morphine regimen for the next 48 hours, with no mention of non-opioid analgesics or nonpharmacological interventions. The patient is not given any information about his pain management plan. On review, you are asked to assess the appropriateness of this pain management approach.

Based on current burn pain management guidelines, identify and explain at least three key deficiencies in the resident's pain management plan for this patient.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to identify and explain at least three key deficiencies in the resident's pain management plan for a 35-year-old man with 18% partial-thickness burns who is receiving only a fixed high-dose morphine regimen, with no non-opioid analgesics, no nonpharmacologic interventions, and no patient education. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity of burn pain. Then, I should verify guideline-based principles for burn pain management. Next, I will examine the specific deficiencies in the resident's plan. After that, I should consider the risks of these omissions. Finally, I will synthesize a corrected, multimodal approach and state the three most critical deficiencies with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Partial-thickness burns are intensely painful because nociceptors in the dermis remain viable, and 18% TBSA represents a substantial injury that will require repeated painful procedures such as dressing changes and debridement; undertreatment is common and consequential in this population, so I need to ensure my critique aligns with the pathophysiology and typical pain trajectories in burns [^490751b4] [^7bb7eb56].

> Next, I should review the overarching principles from high-credibility guidelines. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify that both the American Burn Association (ABA) and International Society for Burn Injuries (ISBI) consistently endorse multimodal analgesia, routine pain assessment, and integration of nonpharmacologic strategies. Yes, the ABA explicitly recommends opioids not be used in isolation and that pain control be individualized and continuously adjusted, while ISBI emphasizes routine pain scoring and the complexity of burn pain including emotional and situational factors, reinforcing the need for a multimodal, patient-centered plan [^509d6cbd] [^c8f78431] [^893000d8].

> Now, I will examine the first deficiency: monotherapy with opioids alone. Wait, let me verify the strength of this recommendation. The ABA states opioids should not be used in isolation and should be combined with nonopioid and nonpharmacologic measures; this is a consistent theme across iterations of the guideline and reflects both limited high-quality opioid-only evidence and the risks of adverse effects and tolerance with monotherapy [^509d6cbd] [^92f5c730].

> I need to check the second deficiency: lack of routine, structured pain assessment. ISBI recommends using scoring systems routinely to monitor adequacy of pain control, preferring patient self-report when possible; without serial assessments, titration is blind and undertreatment or overtreatment is likely, especially given the dynamic nature of burn pain with procedures and evolving wounds [^c8f78431].

> Let me consider the third deficiency: absence of nonpharmacologic interventions. ISBI advises incorporating nonpharmacologic techniques as important elements of comprehensive post-burn pain management; modalities such as virtual reality, distraction, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral strategies can reduce pain scores and opioid requirements during procedures, and should be integrated rather than omitted [^75413c29].

> But wait, what if the resident assumed fixed dosing would suffice because the patient is stable now? I should double-check the principle of individualized, continuously adjusted dosing. The ABA emphasizes that opioid therapy must be individualized and titrated continuously due to heterogeneous responses, adverse effects, and a narrow therapeutic window; a fixed regimen for 48 hours ignores the fluctuating pain of background, breakthrough, and procedural pain in burns [^509d6cbd].

> Next, I should review the risks of these omissions to ensure clinical relevance. Inadequate pain control in burns is associated with worse rehabilitation engagement, emotional distress, and even increased suicide risk; conversely, opioid monotherapy increases risks of respiratory depression, sedation, tolerance, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, particularly with higher or fixed dosing without multimodal strategies [^fb5b4b9e] [^85ee9968].

> I will now synthesize a corrected approach, but hold on, I should verify that each element is guideline-concordant. A multimodal regimen would include acetaminophen and NSAIDs as foundational nonopioids, opioids titrated to effect with attention to procedure-related spikes, and adjuncts such as ketamine or gabapentin for neuropathic and opioid-sparing effects; regional anesthesia should be considered for focal procedural pain when feasible; and routine pain scoring at rest and during procedures should guide titration, with patient education about goals, expectations, and tapering plans [^509d6cbd] [^e755b837] [^c8f78431].

> Let me reconsider the three most critical deficiencies to ensure I am precise. First, opioid monotherapy without nonopioid or nonpharmacologic adjuncts violates multimodal principles and increases adverse effect burden. Second, absence of routine, documented pain assessment precludes evidence-based titration and quality assurance. Third, failure to incorporate nonpharmacologic strategies misses a low-risk, opioid-sparing component that improves procedural pain control and patient experience [^509d6cbd] [^c8f78431] [^75413c29].

---

The resident's plan has three major deficiencies: **opioid monotherapy without multimodal analgesia** [^509d6cbd], which increases risks and undertreats burn pain; **lack of individualized, assessment-driven dosing** [^c8f78431], with no routine pain scoring or titration; and **absence of patient education and shared decision-making** [^notfound], leaving the patient unaware of the plan and unable to participate in care. Current guidelines recommend multimodal analgesia, routine pain assessment, and patient education to optimize control and safety [^509d6cbd] [^c8f78431].

---

## Deficiency 1: opioid monotherapy without multimodal analgesia

- **Guideline recommendation**: The ABA advises that opioids should not be used in isolation; combine with nonopioid and nonpharmacologic measures to improve analgesia and reduce opioid-related harms [^509d6cbd].

- **Risks of monotherapy**: Fixed high-dose morphine alone increases risks of respiratory depression, sedation, tolerance, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and fails to address the multifaceted nature of burn pain [^8dca58f6] [^85ee9968].

- **Recommended multimodal approach**: Add acetaminophen, NSAIDs, gabapentin, ketamine, or regional anesthesia to target different pain pathways and reduce opioid requirements [^8dca58f6] [^e755b837].

---

## Deficiency 2: lack of individualized, assessment-driven dosing

- **Guideline recommendation**: Pain assessment should be routine, using validated scales and individualized titration to maintain adequate control [^c8f78431].

- **Current plan flaw**: A fixed morphine regimen without scheduled reassessment ignores the dynamic nature of burn pain and patient variability [^509d6cbd].

- **Recommended approach**: Assess pain at rest and during procedures, titrate opioids to effect, and adjust the multimodal regimen based on response and adverse effects [^c8f78431].

---

## Deficiency 3: absence of patient education and shared decision-making

- **Guideline recommendation**: Patients should be educated about the pain plan, medication roles, and expectations to improve adherence and satisfaction [^509d6cbd].

- **Current plan flaw**: No education was provided, leaving the patient uninformed and unable to participate in decisions [^notfound].

- **Recommended approach**: Explain the multimodal plan, discuss risks and benefits, and incorporate patient preferences into ongoing adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Summary of deficiencies and recommended corrections

| **Deficiency** | **Current plan** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Opioid monotherapy | Fixed high-dose morphine only | - Multimodal analgesia <br/> - Nonopioid adjuncts <br/> - Regional anesthesia [^509d6cbd] [^e755b837] |
| Lack of individualized dosing | No routine assessment or titration | - Routine pain scoring <br/> - Individualized titration <br/> - Dynamic adjustments [^c8f78431] |
| No patient education | No information provided | - Educate on plan <br/> - Shared decision-making <br/> - Ongoing communication [^509d6cbd] |

---

The resident's plan is inadequate because it relies on opioid monotherapy, lacks individualized assessment, and omits patient education. Adopting a **multimodal, assessment-driven, and patient-centered approach** will improve pain control, reduce opioid-related risks, and align with current burn care standards [^509d6cbd] [^c8f78431].

### Guidelines for the management of partial-thickness burns in a general hospital or community setting – recommendations of a European working party [^a121a96d]. Burns (2007). Low credibility.

Most partial-thickness burns in Europe and the United States are managed by non-burns specialists who do not treat burns on a regular basis. To achieve better patient outcomes, partial-thickness burns should be properly managed in non-specialist centres and referred to burn units when appropriate. Although some guidelines have been published to assist non-specialists, few have attempted to provide a comprehensive step-by-step guidance emphasising wound-healing principles. A working party of European burn specialists devised a new treatment algorithm to provide clear and current guidance on the management of partial-thickness burns in the general hospital and community setting. Four areas were identified for improvement: diagnosis and referral, wound preparation, wound covering and post-wound care. The guidelines take into account the role of wound dressings, infection and general patient well-being, bearing in mind the different working environments that occur across Europe. They are aimed at improving the overall outcome for community-treated patients within the expanding European Union and reducing the number of preventable late referrals to specialists.

### Outpatient burn care: prevention and treatment [^130c41bd]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Most patients with burn injuries are treated as outpatients. Two key determinants of the need for referral to a burn center are burn depth and percentage of total body surface area involved. All burn injuries are considered trauma, prompting immediate evaluation for concomitant injuries. Initial treatment is directed at stopping the burn process. Superficial (first-degree) burns involve only the epidermal layer and require simple first-aid techniques with over-the-counter pain relievers. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns are subdivided into two categories: superficial and deep. Superficial partial-thickness burns extend into the dermis, may take up to three weeks to heal, and require advanced dressings to protect the wound and promote a moist environment. Deep partial-thickness burns require immediate referral to a burn surgeon for possible early tangential excision. Full-thickness (third-degree) burns involve the entire dermal layer, and patients with these burns should automatically be referred to a burn center. Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for outpatient management and may increase bacterial resistance. People with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of complications and infection, and early referral to a burn center should be considered. Pruritus, hypertrophic scarring, and permanent hyperpigmentation are long-term complications of partial-thickness burns. Burn injuries are more likely to occur in children and older people. Patient education during primary care visits may be an effective prevention strategy.

### The management of pain in the burns unit [^8dca58f6]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

The adverse sequalae of inadequate pain control in the burn population have been long recognised, yet control of pain remains inadequate globally. The dynamic evolution of burn pain both centrally and peripherally, and the many factors which influence pain perception illustrate the need for a therapeutic plan which is similarly dynamic and flexible enough to cope with the facets of background, breakthrough, procedural and post-operative pain. Regular, ongoing and documented pain assessment is key in directing this process. The family of opioid analgesics provide the backbone of analgesia to burn patients. Together, they provide an excellent range of potencies, duration of actions and routes of administration. However, they must be used judiciously as side-effects may be clinically relevant and furthermore, recent data has implicated them as being capable of inducing pain. NMDA receptor antagonist such as ketamine and gabapentin are increasingly recognised as useful adjuncts, capable of marked opiate sparing effects in this population. The simple analgesic paracetamol (acetaminophen) has both anti-pyretic and opioid-sparing properties and justly deserves its place in the pharmacological treatment of every burn patient. Non-pharmacological methods of pain control can play an important role in suitable patients but resources vary widely between units. With this review article, we have set out to give practical guidance to all healthcare professionals with examples from our practice. We have found the addition of pain specialists as an integral part of the burns multi-disciplinary team, and an environment where pain is given a high clinical priority to be invaluable in our approach to pain control.

The following constitutes key background information on burn injury:

- **Definition**: Burn injuries are defined as damage to the skin or other body tissues caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of burn injuries involves the destruction of skin layers, which triggers an immune and inflammatory response, metabolic changes, and potentially distributive shock.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of burn injury in the US is estimated at 140 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: The risk factors for burn injuries include self-inflicted injuries or abuse/neglect, lack of social support resources, inadequate housing and food resources, and substance use disorders, including alcohol.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, burn injuries present with redness, blistering, and skin damage. The severity of these symptoms can vary depending on the depth and extent of the burn. Superficial burns may only cause redness and pain, while deeper burns can lead to blistering, skin necrosis, and even systemic symptoms such as shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of burn injuries can vary widely, depending on factors such as the severity and extent of the burn, the patient's overall health, and the presence of complications. Burns involving a large percentage of the body surface area or those that result in inhalation injury can have a poor prognosis.

Burn depth classification — definitions and healing expectations describe superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness, and full-thickness burns. The shallowest burns are classified as superficial, involving only the top layers of the epidermis with no blister formation and dry skin; healing of superficial burns is expected within 1 wk of injury and scarring is absent. Superficial partial-thickness burns form blisters between the dermis and epidermis within the first 12 to 24 h after the burn occurs, are intensely painful, and are expected to heal in 7 to 21 d and rarely cause significant scarring. Deep partial-thickness burns involve the deeper dermis with a much higher infection risk; spontaneous healing is expected to take 3 to 9 wk, hypertrophic scarring is common, and these wounds benefit from specialized burn center management. Full-thickness burns involve all layers of the epidermis and dermis and extend into the subcutaneous tissues, resulting in damage to the neurovascular structures; areas of full-thickness burn are often insensate and the burn eschar is often still intact, presenting as a blackened or leathery covering.

### Guidelines for burn care under austere conditions: introduction to burn disaster, airway and ventilator management, and fluid resuscitation [^e872ce34]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Burn patient initial assessment and burn size estimation — Initial assessment of a burn patient begins with primary stabilization; maintaining a patent airway, ensuring adequate breathing and circulation, providing analgesia to manage pain and anxiety, assessing level of consciousness, and minimizing the risk of hypothermia. A common method to calculate extent of burn is "Rule of Nines," which must be adjusted in infants and small children for differences in head-to-body surface ratio; extent may also be estimated by Palmar method, where the size of the patient's palm, including fingers, represents approximately 1%. Regardless of method, only partial thickness or full thickness burns should be included in TBSA calculations.

### American Burn Association guidelines on the management of acute pain in the adult burn patient: a review of the literature, a compilation of expert opinion, and next steps [^1abe00e7]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The ABA pain guidelines were developed 14 years ago and have not been revised despite evolution in the practice of burn care. A sub-committee of the American Burn Association's Committee on the Organization and Delivery of Burn Care was created to revise the adult pain guidelines. A MEDLINE search of English-language publications from 1968 to 2018 was conducted using the keywords "burn pain", "treatment", and "assessment". Selected references were also used from the greater pain literature. Studies were graded by two members of the committee using Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine-Levels of Evidence. We then met as a group to determine expert consensus on a variety of topics related to treating pain in burn patients. Finally, we assessed gaps in the current knowledge and determined research questions that would aid in providing better recommendations for optimal pain management of the burn patient. The literature search produced 189 papers, 95 were found to be relevant to the assessment and treatment of burn pain. From the greater pain literature 151 references were included, totaling 246 papers being analyzed. Following this literature review, a meeting to establish expert consensus was held and 20 guidelines established in the areas of pain assessment, opioid medications, nonopioid medications, regional anesthesia, and nonpharmacologic treatments. There is increasing research on pain management modalities, but available studies are inadequate to create a true standard of care. We call for more burn specific research into modalities for burn pain control as well as research on multimodal pain control.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^5a3cc280]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Burns: Cooling thermal burns — Background and referral context: Thermal burns are caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, hot surfaces, and hot gases. Burns can lead to damaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychosocial consequences. Superficial (first-degree) burns are characterized by skin redness and pain without blistering or other loosening or destruction of the skin surface, and the intact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree burns generally heal without scarring, and the risk of infection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve destruction of the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and often require treatment beyond what can be provided in the first aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, and reduce scarring. Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalation injury (sore throat around the nose or mouth, difficulty breathing) require hospital treatment. Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied, the majority of studies involve immediate application of cool running water.

### Application and management of cultured epidermal autografts on posterior burns – A 5-year, multicenter, retrospective review of outcomes [^857f7e82]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe burns on the posterior trunk present a treatment challenge in that these surfaces bear the major portion of body weight, with shearing forces exerted when changing the patient from supine to prone position. In their high-volume center at Burn and Reconstructive Centers of America, the authors developed protocols for use of cultured epidermal autografts (CEAs) for coverage of large burns, including those specific to posterior burns. This paper describes techniques and approaches, including milestone timelines, to treat and manage these patients. Key factors for successful treatment begin with early development of a detailed surgical plan. Members of the trained team participate in the plan and understand standard procedures and any deviation. Patients are identified early for treatment with CEA so that a full thickness skin biopsy can be sent to the manufacturer for processing. Patients with > 30% total body surface area (TBSA) burns are considered for CEA burn wound coverage due to the potential for conversion of superficial partial thickness to deep partial thickness or full thickness burns over hospitalization time. We also present the outcomes in patients with posterior trunk burns treated with CEA from 2016 to 2019 in three participating centers within our network. Data in 40 patients with mean TBSA of 56% demonstrated a high rate of successful CEA engraftment (83%), and overall survival rate (90%) following one or two applications with CEA and/or CEA + split thickness skin graft (STSG). Development of standard treatment protocols and surgical plans has enabled positive outcomes with CEA in severe burns including posterior burns.

Recommendations 10b

At first receiving hospital: on arrival the following burn wound care is recommended:

- Cool burn wound if less than 3 h since injury with (running) potable/drinking water if available (avoid hypothermia).
- Provide analgesia to patient.
- Re-triage patient (on-arrival triage).
- Clean wound /scrub.
- Re-estimate TBSA.
- Determine burn depth.
- Confirm site of burn.
- Re-assess for other injuries including inhalational injury.
- Re-triage after wound clean/scrub (definitive triage).
- Confirm tetanus status (and give booster and/or Immunoglobulin if indicated).
- Determine appropriate dressing.

At the first receiving hospital: recommendations for:

the early management of inhalational injury include:

- Sit patient up if no suspicion of other trauma injuries (i.e. burn injuries only);
- Avoid excess fluid;
- Consider early intubation and ventilation.

Patients with < 20% TBSA and no 'special area' burns
- Consider early discharge with out-patient follow up if < 20% TBSA and superficial /partial thickness or non-special area burns.
- Ensure adequate out-patient support for those discharged (e.g. wound care, social and community support and clear care pathway communicated).

Patients with > 20% TBSA and/or deep dermal or 'special area' burns
- Patients should be reviewed by an experienced burn clinician.
- Such patients are likely to benefit from on-going in-patient care.
- Ensure comprehensive documentation of TBSA estimation, burn depth and burn site in addition to standard clinical history and examination.
- Patients with burns in 'special areas' such as across/near joints, hands, face or feet, and those with large burns to benefit from grafting and subsequent scar management, should be reviewed by a rehabilitation specialist.

Immediate first aid for burn injury influences the clinical course and severity of the burn. Basic first aid should include cooling, pain relief, cleaning and application of a simple clean dressing to the burn wound. Cooling of the burn wound should occur up to three hours after the injury was sustained and thus can be continued from scene into the first receiving hospital. Evidence has demonstrated benefit in burn care, and a reduction in future complications, from both good effective basic first aid delivered by first responders and in the cooling of a burn within this 3 hour time period.

First aid treatment should continue from scene to first receiving health facility.

Background

Description of the condition

Burn injuries are the fourth most frequent type of traumatic injury, accounting for approximately 180,000 deaths annually worldwide. In 2004, an estimated 11 million people sought medical care due to burn‐related injuries. Burn injuries remain a major public health challenge, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), where over 90% of burn cases occur. Although burn incidence has declined in high‐income countries, it increased in LMICs between 1990 and 2019, exacerbating existing disparities in prevention and treatment. This trend underscores the urgent need for improved burn prevention and management strategies in resource‐limited settings.

Burn incidence, severity, and mortality also vary across demographic groups. In 2019, younger and middle‐aged men had a higher global incidence of moderate and severe burns, and presented the heaviest burden of serious injury in terms of years lived with disability, whereas older women had higher rates of severe and inhalation injuries. Women in LMICs are particularly vulnerable, facing a greater risk of burn‐related mortality (24% versus 15% in men), primarily due to domestic hazards such as cooking over open flames. Furthermore, women in these countries have less access to essential interventions, such as blood transfusion, nutritional support, and surgical procedures.

Burns can have a profound and lasting impact on survivors' quality of life, particularly in LMICs where access to specialized care is limited. Burns can result from thermal, chemical, electrical, radiation, or friction‐related sources, and can cause coagulative destruction of various layers of the skin. Burn diagnosis is based on the depth of the injury, the percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) affected, and its cause (etiology). These factors determine the severity and long‐term consequences of burns. While partial‐thickness burns (first and second degree) typically heal within weeks, full‐thickness burns (third and fourth degree) often require surgical intervention and may lead to permanent disability, amputation, or death.

Pain management in people with burns is also a challenge due to the presence of multiple types of pain, including background, neuropathic, procedural, and breakthrough pain. Severe pain has been linked to rehabilitation resistance, emotional distress, and even increased suicide risk. While the intensity of pain is the primary concern for immediate management, distinguishing the type of pain is crucial for selecting appropriate interventions. However, current pain assessment tools remain largely unidimensional, emphasizing the need to use diverse instruments that can capture the multifaceted nature of burn pain.

### Meeting the challenge of analgesia in a pregnant woman with burn injury using subanesthetic ketamine: a case report and literature review [^a5fef520]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Pain management guidelines for burn injury in pregnant women are scarce. Maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in pregnant burn patients have been shown to be higher than that of the general population, especially in severe burns. Early intervention and interdisciplinary treatment are critical to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes. Proper pain management is central to wound treatment, as poor control of pain can contribute to delayed healing, re-epithelialization, as well as persistent neuropathic pain. We present this case of a 34-year-old female patient who suffered an 18% total body surface area burn during the third trimester of pregnancy to demonstrate that ketamine can be considered as an adjunct for procedural and background analgesia during the third trimester, as part of a multimodal strategy in a short-term, monitored setting after a thorough and complete analysis of risks and benefits and careful patient selection.

### Intrathecal baclofen pump wean and risk of exposure in a large total body surface area burn wound patient: a case report [^52607d52]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Burn injuries in patients with significant pre-existing medical conditions provide unique challenges in both medical management and surgical planning. Spasticity, if left untreated, can be one of the most disabling consequences of a neurologic injury. Treatment is largely dependent on pharmacologic management with anti-spasmodic agents such as baclofen. Baclofen's effectiveness when taken orally is often limited by its systemic side effects, which mostly affect the central nervous system (CNS). Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) can circumvent these intolerable adverse effects while achieving symptom relief via a more targeted therapeutic route. However, abrupt cessation of chronic baclofen use can precipitate an acute life-threatening withdrawal syndrome. We present a case of a 47-year-old female who sustained 54% total body surface area (TBSA) full-thickness flame burns to the circumferential bilateral lower extremities, left arm, left anterior and posterior trunk, flank, and perineum. She had a pre-morbid C5 spinal cord injury resulting in spastic paraplegia for which she had an ITB pump implanted into her left abdominal wall for symptom management. This pump was directly beneath her operative burn wounds. We discuss the complex issues that were encountered throughout her care related to medication reservoir supply, life-threatening risk of baclofen withdrawal, pain-specialist availability, medical-legal barriers, and the multi-staged surgical plan for coverage, balancing proper wound debridement with risk of device exposure and infection. To our knowledge, this is the only case report detailing the cohort of obstacles that may be associated with these devices, specifically with burn patients.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guideline on care of burns in the wilderness [^e484fbd9]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Burn size estimation — percent total body surface area (TBSA) assessment is emphasized for initial care and evacuation decisions, using validated methods rather than rough field estimates. %TBSA is calculated from partial- and full-thickness areas, and field tools include the rule of 9's, the Lund-Browder chart, and the rule of palms in which the patient's palm is ~1% of body surface area, though this can overestimate when burns are > 10% TBSA; smartphone calculators also exist. Careful estimation is crucial because it guides the initial resuscitation fluid rate and evacuation decisions, and providers often overestimate %TBSA, especially in children. We recommend "%TBSA burn be calculated using a validated method to guide resuscitation and evacuation decisions. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence."

The perioperative analgesic plan begins with preoperative planning. The surgeon should be versed in practical approaches for managing analgesia in patients with chronic pain. The first step includes evaluating the patient and conducting a focused pain history. Confirming, documenting, and understanding current outpatient prescriptions is critical. Patients should be screened for medical conditions that preclude the use of certain analgesics, or place them at higher risk of respiratory depression. Providers should coordinate with the patient's outpatient prescribers and pain specialists to ensure a safe and effective analgesic plan. Multimodal analgesia should be implemented to optimize analgesia and decrease opioid requirements.

### Major burns in adults: a practice review [^0f2eb8f0]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 180000 deaths per year from thermal burn injury worldwide. Most burn injuries can be treated in local hospitals but 6.5% require specialist burn care. The initial ED assessment, resuscitation and critical care of the severely burned patient present significant challenges and require a multidisciplinary approach. The management of these patients in the resuscitation room impacts on the effectiveness of continuing care in the intensive care unit. The scope of the present practice review is the immediate management of the adult patient with severe burns, including inhalation injury and burn shock. The article uses an illustrative case to highlight recent developments including advanced airway management and the contemporary approach to assessment of fluid requirements and the type and volume of fluid resuscitation. There is discussion on new options for pain relief in the ED and the principles governing the early stages of burn intensive care. It does not discuss minor injuries, mass casualty events, chemical or radiation injuries, exfoliative or necrotising conditions or frost bite.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guideline on care of burns in the wilderness [^7eb5aa62]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Evacuation criteria for burn patients — The Wilderness Medical Society wound management guidelines cite Level 1C evidence for evacuation of patients with burns requiring higher levels of care, including airway or inhalational injury; burns to the thorax that impair ventilation; significant burns to hands, feet, genitals, mucous membranes, or face; circumferential partial- or full-thickness burns; full-thickness burns of > 5% TBSA; partial-thickness burns of > 10 to 20% TBSA; infected burns; burns with uncontrolled pain; lightning injuries; electrical burns; and chemical burns. Additionally, we suggest evacuation be expedited if there are burns to the eye that compromise vision; any burn that required advanced airway management in the field; any burn that requires field escharotomy or fasciotomy; signs of impending compartment syndrome; burns associated with significant trauma; other signs of decreased perfusion; burns with associated hypothermia; deep partial- or full-thickness burns of > 5% TBSA; superficial partial-thickness burns of > 10 to 20% TBSA; partial- or full-thickness burns over joints; burns of > 5% TBSA in infants (< 2 y); burns with suspicion of carbon monoxide or cyanide toxicity; and burns that impair the victim's ability to remain active in the field. This means that most burn patients will require evacuation, with only minor burns being appropriate for a trial of field management.

### Analgesic use in contemporary burn practice: applications to burn mass casualty incident planning [^98437f61]. Burns (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Determining the amount of analgesics required will help burn centers improve their ability to plan for a burn mass casualty incident (BMCI). We sought to quantify the amount of analgesics needed in an inpatient burn population. We hoped that assessing the analgesic use in daily burn care practice will potentially help estimate opioid needs in a burn mass casualty incident (BMCI).

Methods

We included patients with burns covering equal to or less than 30% total body surface area (TBSA), admitted from spring 2013 to spring 2015. Patient records were reviewed for analgesics and adjuncts, pain scores, age and TBSA. The doses of the different opioids administered were converted into morphine equivalent doses (MED).

Results

We enrolled 141 acute burn survivors with a mean TBSA of 8.2 ± 0.6%. The lowest daily average MED per person was 24.6 ± 2.0mg MED, recorded on the day of injury. The daily average MED per person increased until it peaked at 52.5 ± 5.6mg MED at day 8 post-burn. Then, it declined to 24.6 ± 3.4mg MED by day 14. Bivariate regression analysis of average MED by TBSA showed a significant positive correlation (p < 0.001). The analysis of average MED by age showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0001).

Conclusion

Our study quantified opioid requirements in an inpatient burn population and identified TBSA (positively) and age (negatively) as significant predictors.

Diagnosis of Burns
- Definition: A burn is the partial or complete destruction of skin caused by some form of energy, usually thermal energy. Burn severity is dictated by: Percent total body surface area involvement
- Burns > 20–25% TBSA require IV fluid resuscitation
- Burns > 30–40% TBSA may be fatal without treatment.
- Burn into muscle, tendon, bone
- Need specialized care
- Deep burns usually need skin grafts to optimize results and lead to hypertrophic scars if not grafted
- Deep second-degree burns
- Superficial burns.
- Second- and third-degree burns greater than 10% TBSA in patients under 10 or over 50 years of age
- Second- and third-degree burns greater than 20% TBSA in other age groups
- Second- and third-degree burns that involve the face, hands, feet, genitalia, perineum, and major joints.
- Third-degree burns greater than 5% TBSA in any age group
- Electrical burns, including lightning injury
- Chemical burns
- Inhalation injury
- Burn injury in patients with pre-existing medical disorders that could complicate management, prolong recovery, or affect mortality.
- Any patients with burns and concomitant trauma where burn injury poses the greatest risk of morbidity or mortality. In such cases, if the trauma poses the greater immediate risk, the patient may be treated initially in a trauma center until stable before being transferred to a burn center. Physician judgment will be necessary in such situations and should be in concert with the regional medical control plan and triage protocols appropriate for the incident.

Treatment General information All burn patients should initially be treated with the principles of Advanced Burn and/or Trauma Life Support
- The ABC's of trauma take precedent over caring for the burn
- Search for other signs of trauma
- All burn patients should initially be treated with the principles of Advanced Burn and/or Trauma Life Support. Verified Burn Centers provide advanced support for complex cases
- Certified by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and the American Burn Association
- Resources will give advice or assist with care
- Burn Unit Referral Criteria Airway
- Extensive burns may lead to massive edema
- Obstruction may result from upper airway swelling.

Risk of upper airway obstruction increases with Massive burns
- All patients with deep burns > 35–40% TBSA should be endotracheally intubated
- Burns to the head
- Burns inside the mouth
- Massive burns Intubate early if massive burn or signs of obstruction
- Intubate if patients require prolonged transport and any concern with potential for obstruction
- If any concerns about the airway, it is safer to intubate earlier than when the patient is decompensating. Treatment
- Remove source
- 100% oxygen until CO levels are < 10% Smoke inhalation injury Pathophysiology
- Smoke particles settle in distal bronchioles
- Mucosal cells are die

### Pain management for pediatric burns in the outpatient setting: a changing paradigm? [^93f47f8e]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Childhood burns are common and distressing for children and their parents. Pain is the most common complaint and often thought to be undertreated, which can negatively influence the child's care and increase the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder. There is limited literature on the role of opioids and multimodal therapy in the treatment of pediatric outpatient burns. We sought to evaluate the current use of opioids (including the use of multimodal therapies), storage, and disposal of opioids in this patient population. Parents of burn-injured children 8 months to 18 years old, who were seen in an outpatient setting within 2 weeks of their burn injury, were queried from April to December 2019 regarding their child's pain control, opioid medication use, over-the-counter pain medication use, opioid storage, and disposal. A total of 142 parents of burn-injured children and their parents were surveyed. The median age of the burn-injured children was 2.7 years old and the majority (54.2%; 77/142) were male. The mean total body surface area (TBSA) was 1.8% and half sustained burn injuries to one or both hands. The most frequently used regimens for constant and/or breakthrough pain control were acetaminophen (62.7%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; 68.3%). Less than one fifth (26/142;18%) of patients were prescribed opioids and 88% filled their prescription. The median number of doses of opioids prescribed was eight doses, with a median of four doses of opioids unused. Only three patients used all of their prescribed opioids and no patient ≥ 12 years old used their entire prescription. Burns greater than 3% TBSA, irrespective of burn injury location, were associated with opioid prescription (P = 0.003). Approximately 40% (10/26) of parents who filled their child's opioid prescription stored the opioid in a locked area. Fewer than one third (7/26) of patients were educated on how to dispose of excess opioid pain medication. Overall, most pediatric outpatient burn injuries can be successfully managed with over-the-counter medications. Providers, who care for burn-injured children ≤ 12 years old with burns that cover ≥ 3% TBSA in the outpatient setting, should consider no more than four opioid doses for initial pain control. This guideline, coupled with family and provider-centered education on multimodal therapy at the time of initial presentation and safe use of opioids, are important first steps to minimizing the use of opioids in the management of small area burns in children.

### Randomized clinical study of hydrofiber dressing with silver or silver sulfadiazine in the management of partial-thickness burns [^a581d815]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2006). Low credibility.

This prospective, randomized study compared protocols of care using either AQUACEL Ag Hydrofiber (ConvaTec, a Bristol-Myers Squibb company, Skillman, NJ) dressing with silver (n = 42) or silver sulfadiazine (n = 42) for up to 21 days in the management of partial-thickness burns covering 5% to 40% body surface area (BSA). AQUACEL Ag dressing was associated with less pain and anxiety during dressing changes, less burning and stinging during wear, fewer dressing changes, less nursing time, and fewer procedural medications. Silver sulfadiazine was associated with greater flexibility and ease of movement. Adverse events, including infection, were comparable between treatment groups. The AQUACEL Ag dressing protocol tended to have lower total treatment costs (Dollars 1040 vs. Dollars 1180) and a greater rate of re-epithelialization (73.8% vs 60.0%), resulting in cost-effectiveness per burn healed of Dollars 1,409.06 for AQUACEL Ag dressing and Dollars 1,967.95 for silver sulfadiazine. A protocol of care with AQUACEL(R) Ag provided clinical and economic benefits compared with silver sulfadiazine in patients with partial-thickness burns.

First aid for burns — cool water therapy parameters and cautions include removal of ongoing heat sources and specific irrigation practices: Clothing may continue to smolder, so any ongoing fire should be extinguished and burned material should be removed from patients, and jewelry and any items that may tighten or constrict over time should be removed from all extremities with a careful vascular exam. Burns of < 10% total body surface area (TBSA) should be irrigated with water that is 12 to 18°C (53–64°F) for 20 to 30 min, starting as soon as possible after the burn occurs, and immersion in cold water is acceptable if no running water is available; cool water therapy remains effective if initiated within 60 min of injury. Potable water is preferred to untreated surface water, ice should not be used, and the authors recommend against direct application of snow to burn wounds, although snow may be used to cool water for treatment. Use of cool water therapy is associated with reduced burn depth, lower TBSA, less need for skin grafting, and shorter time to healing and may aid in pain control, but hypothermia is more common in patients with larger TBSA burns and is associated with increased mortality with risk factors including prolonged scene time, older age, need for airway management, and altered mental status. We recommend that burn wounds of < 10% TBSA be irrigated with cool running water for 20 min. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Management of a man with hydrofluoric acid burns: a case report and review [^f7e20cbb]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

A hydrofluoric acid (HFA) burn is a severe condition with the characteristics of acute onset, rapid progression, and high complication and mortality rates. Emergency and systemic treatments are especially important for major HFA burns. The author presents the case of a 46-year-old man burned by the spillage of HFA at a high concentration (45–50%). He suffered burns over 30% of his total body area (5% deep partial-thickness burns and 25% third-degree burns). Debridement, tangential excision, and electrolyte therapy were quickly performed for urgent treatment. Symptomatic treatment was sustained to address severe complications and recurrent injury. For successful management, the patient was stabilized, and he exhibited complete wound repair after 3 months. The author summarizes severe cases of HFA burns to emphasize the difficulty of treatment. The existing approved therapies and complications are discussed, and the significance of electrolyte disorders, especially hypocalcemia, is highlighted. The pathophysiology of HFA burns and recommendations for the treatment of HFA burns at different sites are presented to provide a relatively complete treatment guideline focused on electrolyte disorders.

Lightning injury — cutaneous burns and contact precautions are characterized by partial-thickness burns from flashover, with punctate "tip-toe" lesions that are small (usually < 1 cm). Full-thickness burns requiring grafting are uncommon, with only 10% of lightning victims requiring skin grafting in a case series of 16 patients, and cranial burns predicted a 3-fold increase in mortality with patients twice as likely to undergo cardiac arrest. In limited case series, superficial burns that involve less than 20% of total body surface area tend to heal quickly and may be treated with routine burn care (Recommendation grade: 1C). If caught in a storm, remove metal objects such as watches, belt buckles, and necklaces to limit contact burns (Recommendation grade: 1C).

Treating severe pain in opioid-experienced patients

If patients with severe pain are opioid experienced, tolerance has likely developed with prolonged opioid exposure. Opioids should be titrated to the effective dosage, which may be high in opioid-experienced patients with severe pain. It is important to consider carefully complaints raised by patients about inadequate analgesia. In some cases, the patients may be experiencing tolerance, in which cases, judicious titration to a higher dose of opioids is appropriate. Tolerance to one opioid may also be addressed by rotating to a different opioid which may be effective at lower doses. In other cases, the patient may ask for higher doses because he or she is seeking to obtain more drugs. It is also important to consider the seemingly paradoxical condition of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in which prolonged exposure to opioids lowers the pain threshold. In the latter case, opioids should be tapered and discontinued in favor of a different analgesic regimen.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advocated against high doses of opioids. However, high doses of opioids for individual patients might be justified, particularly for palliative care cancer patients at the end of life or patients in severe or very severe pain of likely limited duration (e.g. traumatic injury, burn patients, severe postsurgical pain). The use of high-dose opioid therapy may increase the risk of opioid abuse. In addition, high-dose opioid therapy has been associated with other health-related concerns, more severe pain intensities, and greater utilization of health care resources.–

### Suprathel® for severe burns in the elderly: case report and review of the literature [^31fdb017]. Burns (2016). Low credibility.

Large burns in aged patients are common and treatment often reveals challenging. Cardiovascular complications significantly contribute to the unfavorable prognosis in this group of high-risk patients. Pain medication and sedation can negatively influence cardiovascular stability. Suprathel(®) is well-known for its almost pain free application and reduction of dressing change intervals, and thus lowers the demand for potentially harmful analgesics and sedatives. We present the case of an 81-year-old patient with 51% of total burned body surface area (ABSI = 12), who was completely treated with Suprathel(®). Despite a predicted mortality of more than 80%, the patient survived and was discharged home without significant handicaps 69 days after burn. We hypothesize that Suprathel(®) beneficially contributed to the favorable clinical course of this critical patient as less frequent wound-dressing changes did not induce additional pain or sedative medication and thus improved cardiovascular stability.

### Does the dressing matter in pediatric partial-thickness burns: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^be0b869d]. Burns (2025). Medium credibility.

Superficial partial thickness burns typically receive nonoperative treatment, whereas deep partial thickness burns, which are prone to hypertrophic scarring, are usually managed through debridement followed by autologous split-thickness skin grafting. Various therapies have been developed to prevent wound infection and to enhance wound healing in pediatric partial-thickness burns. However, the choice of dressing by the surgeon can be influenced by various factors. It is worth noting that there is no standardized approach across all burn centers, leading to variations in care practices. To optimize pediatric patient care, a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to review existing treatment options for partial thickness burns in children. Outcomes of interest were wound healing time, dressing changes, length of hospital stay, wound infections, need for grafting despite treatment, and hypertrophic scarring. A total of 68 studies with 8199 patients were included. The mean age of the included patients was 3.1 years, and the mean total body surface area of the burns was 15.6%. Treatment groups included topical agents, bandages, skin analogues, or unclassified. Considering all treatment outcomes evaluated in this systematic review of the literature, non-silver dressings and skin analogues may have some benefit over topical agents in terms of wound healing time, length of hospital stay, hypertrophic scarring, pain management, and cost saving. Dressing changes, wound infections, and need for grafting did not significantly change between various treatments.

### Assessment of health-related quality of life in postburn adult survivors: a cross-sectional 4 years of experience study from Cyprus [^b638b138]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Mobility and usual activities were the only domains that showed a statistically significant association between EQ-5D-5L dimensions and subjects' degree of burn (Supplementary Table 5). This finding underscores the profound impact that the depth of burn injuries can have on a person's physical functioning and daily life. Participants with full-thickness burns, for instance, reported more severe mobility issues, ranging from moderate to severe difficulties, compared to those with superficial or partial-thickness burns, who generally reported no problems in these domains. This finding may reflect the physical limitations or complications that tend to increase as the depth and severity of burns increase.

Additionally, the ability to perform daily activities varies significantly with the degree of burn severity. Those with full-thickness or more severe burns were more likely to report moderate to severe problems, while those with superficial burns reported fewer issues. This could be associated with the increased rehabilitation demands, pain, or physical impairments that prevent survivors with severe burns from resuming their everyday activities. However, in the study by Schahid et al.mobility had an insignificant association with the degree of burn. At the same time, usual activities were positively associated with the burn degree, as observed in our study.

The association between deeper burns and greater mobility impairment highlights the need for tailored rehabilitation programs that address the long-term physical challenges faced by these patients. Early physical therapy and interventions to prevent contractures and promote mobility could be critical in improving outcomes. Furthermore, the impact on usual activities underscores how significant burn injuries can disrupt daily living and occupational functioning, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive care plans that support patients' return to normal life activities. Healthcare providers can better assist patients in achieving optimal recovery and functional independence by focusing resources on those with deeper burns.

Median EQ-5D-5L scores for all 5 domains after treatment were calculated at one, reflecting the best possible health state. This suggests that, overall, participants perceived their quality of life as fully restored in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression following treatment. However, when evaluating the mean EQ-VAS score, participants reported an average of 80.98, which, while high, indicates some residual health concerns. This finding aligns closely with the additional study by Spronk et al.which reported a similar mean EQ-VAS score of 81.60, emphasizing a generally positive but not perfect perception of health after recovery from burn injuries.

### Clinical pathways – can they be used in trauma care. An analysis of their ability to fit the patient [^3393602e]. Injury (2001). Low credibility.

This study prospectively evaluated the appropriateness and ability of clinical pathways to fit trauma patients in five key conditions, severe head injury, fractured ribs, fractured pelvis, fractured femur and blunt abdominal trauma, who were admitted to a single Level 1 Trauma Centre, between February and July 1999. Each pathway consisted of 14 elements of care divided into observable outcomes. Failure to achieve an outcome resulted in a variance or deviation from the pathway, which was assessed by the number of non-applicable variances. Appropriateness of clinical pathways was assessed by the applicability index (the number of non-applicable variances divided by the potential variances). Critical mismatches occurred when non-applicable variances exceeded 50% of potential variances. 146 patients, with the mean age 41.9 years (S.D. 20.7), mean ISS 11.1 (S.D. 10.7) were enrolled; 18 with severe head injury, 59 with fractured ribs, 13 with fractured pelvis, 20 with fractured femur and 36 with blunt abdominal trauma. Critical mismatch occurred in seven patients. Applicability indexes were 87 for head, 93 for ribs, 92 for blunt abdominal trauma, 91 for femur and 92 for the pelvic pathway. Patient assessment, pain management, skin integrity and patient education were the most appropriate key elements of care, discharge planning, patient satisfaction, treatment and activity were least applicable. This study identified, for the first time, that clinical pathways are clinically appropriate for major trauma conditions.
