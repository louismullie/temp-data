## Question

Insect bite management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about insect bite management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the bite/sting and the reaction phenotype. Then, I should verify immediate first aid priorities, including stinger removal and when to use epinephrine. Next, I will examine local reaction management, including antihistamines, topical steroids, and when to consider oral steroids. After that, I need to check indications for antibiotics and how to distinguish inflammatory reactions from cellulitis. I will then review large local reactions and venom immunotherapy indications. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like ticks, bed bugs, and prevention, and close with follow-up, education, and a concise algorithm summary, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because management hinges on it. Simple insect bites are those without anaphylaxis or systemic infection, whereas stings from Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, hornets, fire ants) can provoke local, large local, cutaneous-systemic, or anaphylactic reactions; I should also distinguish bites from stings and remember that ticks are managed differently than other arthropod bites, so I need to keep that in mind as I proceed [^e7117736] [^55e18b8f] [^4115fbdb].

> I will now examine immediate first aid, and I should double-check stinger management. For Hymenoptera stings, remove the stinger as quickly as possible by flicking or scraping to avoid compressing the venom sac; avoid tweezers if they pinch the sac, and prioritize speed over method, because delay increases venom delivery; I initially thought tweezers were fine, but wait, let me verify — yes, avoiding pressure on the venom sac is the key, so a scraping motion is preferred when feasible [^9d2c2e09].

> Next, I should review when to treat as anaphylaxis. Any systemic reaction with involvement of two or more organ systems or hypotension warrants intramuscular epinephrine in the anterolateral thigh without delay; dose 0.01 mg/kg up to 0.3 mg in children and 0.3–0.5 mg in adults, repeat every 5–15 minutes if needed, and there is no absolute contraindication in life-threatening reactions; I need to ensure I also plan for observation 4–12 hours for biphasic reactions and arrange allergist referral and autoinjector prescription before discharge [^4d6708e9] [^7f983370] [^f1add226].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about local care; I should confirm symptomatic management. For uncomplicated local reactions, cleanse the site, apply cold compresses, elevate if edematous, and treat pruritus with oral antihistamines; topical corticosteroids can reduce inflammation and itch, and in severe local reactions a short course of oral corticosteroids may be reasonable, though definitive efficacy data are limited; I should also remember that antibiotics are not indicated for simple local reactions without infection [^dc0d7813] [^320fdbe3] [^e7117736].

> Wait, let me verify the antibiotic threshold, because overuse is common. Indications include purulence, spreading erythema, lymphangitis, fever, or immunocompromise; when antibiotics are needed, first-line oral therapy for suspected cellulitis is flucloxacillin or cephalexin, with alternatives for allergy; I should also consider that many "red, hot" bites reflect sterile inflammation rather than infection, and quality-improvement data show frequent unnecessary flucloxacillin prescribing for insect bites, so I need to document objective infection signs and consider delayed prescribing or watchful waiting when appropriate [^c1aad354] [^e6d5425b] [^d5f5e218].

> I will now examine large local reactions, and I should confirm the risk of future systemic reactions. Large local reactions are IgE-mediated, peak at 48–72 hours, and carry about a 4–10% risk of future systemic reactions; most patients need only symptomatic care with antihistamines, analgesics, and cold compresses, and a short oral steroid course can be considered for severe swelling; venom immunotherapy is generally not required but can reduce size and duration of future large local reactions and may be considered with frequent, unavoidable exposures after shared decision-making [^55e18b8f] [^64a7934d] [^5814b3a6].

> Let me consider venom immunotherapy indications carefully. VIT is strongly recommended for patients with a history of anaphylaxis and detectable venom-specific IgE, with efficacy around 90–98% in preventing future sting anaphylaxis; it is generally not recommended for adults with isolated cutaneous systemic reactions, though shared decision-making is advised in special circumstances; I should also check for elevated baseline tryptase and other high-risk features that may modify risk and duration of therapy [^91550e96] [^55e18b8f] [^66437439].

> But wait, what if the "bite" is actually a tick? I need to ensure I pivot to tick-specific guidance. For attached ticks, prompt mechanical removal with fine-tipped tweezers or a commercial device is recommended; do not use home remedies or delay removal, and consider single-dose doxycycline prophylaxis for high-risk Ixodes bites in endemic areas after shared decision-making; if erythema migrans appears, treat with doxycycline 10 days or amoxicillin/cefuroxime 14 days, and avoid prolonged antibiotics for chronic or post-treatment symptoms [^41cf9951] [^4115fbdb] [^053c98a2].

> I should double-check special scenarios like bed bugs. Bed bug bites are intensely pruritic and often linear; management is supportive with antipruritics and topical steroids, but eradication requires integrated pest management with surveillance and targeted treatment of infested environments, not medical therapy for the bites themselves [^e7d19c39] [^2011478d].

> Next, I should review prevention and patient education, because recurrence mitigation matters. For stinging insects, counsel on avoidance, protective clothing, and caution with attractants; for patients with systemic reactions, prescribe epinephrine autoinjectors, provide an action plan, and arrange allergist referral; for ticks, emphasize repellents with DEET or picaridin, permethrin-treated clothing, daily skin checks, and prompt removal; I need to ensure patients know how to use autoinjectors and when to seek emergency care [^957c4f93] [^2270173f] [^4115fbdb].

> I will now examine follow-up and safety netting, and I should confirm red flags. Arrange reassessment if erythema spreads, pain worsens, fever develops, or systemic symptoms emerge; document baseline measurements and draw around erythema to track progression; in children, ensure weight-appropriate epinephrine dosing and caregiver education; consider mast cell disorders or elevated tryptase in severe or unexplained reactions and discuss implications for VIT and risk stratification [^c1aad354] [^f1add226] [^9bfe4689].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Classify the reaction phenotype, provide immediate first aid including stinger removal and epinephrine for anaphylaxis, treat local reactions symptomatically with antihistamines and topical steroids while avoiding unnecessary antibiotics, evaluate large local reactions for VIT only in select cases, and refer for VIT when there is a history of anaphylaxis with detectable venom IgE; tailor tick management to prophylaxis and standard Lyme regimens, and embed prevention and education throughout [^55e18b8f] [^4d6708e9] [^4115fbdb].

---

Insect bites are common and usually self-limited, but management should be **tailored to reaction severity** and patient risk. For local reactions, use **cleansing, cold compresses, topical corticosteroids, and oral antihistamines**; avoid routine antibiotics unless there is clear infection [^320fdbe3] [^e7117736]. For large local reactions, add a short course of oral corticosteroids if severe [^dc0d7813] [^0519cf87]. For systemic reactions, administer **intramuscular epinephrine immediately**, provide supportive care, and refer to allergy for evaluation and consideration of venom immunotherapy [^4d6708e9] [^91550e96]. Educate patients on avoidance, when to seek care, and, if indicated, how to use epinephrine autoinjectors [^957c4f93] [^f1add226].

## General principles of management

### Local reactions

- **Cleansing**: Clean the bite area with soap and water to reduce infection risk [^notfound].
- **Cold compresses**: Apply for 10–15 minutes to reduce swelling and pain.
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Use low-potency creams (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) to reduce inflammation and itching [^d5f5e218].
- **Oral antihistamines**: Use non-sedating agents (e.g. cetirizine, loratadine) for significant itching or multiple bites [^c1aad354].
- **Avoid scratching**: Prevent secondary infection and scarring [^notfound].

---

### Large local reactions

- **Oral corticosteroids**: Consider a short course (e.g. prednisone 40–60 mg/day for 3–5 days) for severe swelling or functional impairment [^dc0d7813] [^0519cf87].
- **Analgesics**: Use acetaminophen or NSAIDs for pain control.
- **Monitor**: Watch for progression to systemic symptoms [^notfound].

---

### Systemic reactions (anaphylaxis)

- **Immediate epinephrine**: Administer intramuscularly (0.3–0.5 mg in adults, 0.01 mg/kg in children) into the anterolateral thigh without delay [^4d6708e9].
- **Supportive care**: Position the patient supine with legs elevated, provide oxygen, and establish IV access [^notfound].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Give antihistamines and corticosteroids after epinephrine to reduce recurrence risk [^7f983370].
- **Observation**: Monitor for biphasic reactions for 4–12 hours [^7f983370].
- **Allergy referral**: Arrange evaluation for venom immunotherapy and epinephrine autoinjector prescription [^4f3ebed6].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Routine antibiotics are **not indicated** for uncomplicated insect bites [^320fdbe3]. Consider antibiotics only when there is **clear evidence of secondary bacterial infection**, such as:

- Purulent discharge or abscess formation
- Rapidly spreading erythema, warmth, or lymphangitis
- Systemic signs (fever, malaise)
- Immunocompromised patients

When indicated, use **first-line oral agents** such as flucloxacillin, cephalexin, or clindamycin for penicillin-allergic patients [^c1aad354].

---

## Special considerations

### Tick bites

- **Removal**: Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick close to the skin and pull steadily upward [^41cf9951].
- **Prophylaxis**: Consider single-dose doxycycline (200 mg) for high-risk bites (Ixodes scapularis, ≥ 36 hours attached, ≥ 20% local Lyme prevalence) [^4115fbdb].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for erythema migrans or systemic symptoms over 30 days [^notfound].

---

### Bed bug infestations

For bed bug infestations, **integrated pest management** — including professional extermination, mattress encasements, and thorough cleaning — is essential [^2011478d]. Treat bites symptomatically with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines [^notfound].

---

## Patient education and prevention

- **Avoidance**: Use protective clothing, insect repellents (DEET, picaridin), and avoid peak activity times [^2270173f].
- **Recognition**: Teach patients to identify signs of infection or systemic reactions and when to seek care [^7f983370].
- **Epinephrine autoinjectors**: Provide training and prescriptions for patients with systemic reactions [^957c4f93].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange follow-up for **large local reactions** or **systemic reactions** to ensure resolution and assess for complications. For patients with systemic reactions, refer to allergy for evaluation and consideration of venom immunotherapy [^4f3ebed6].

---

Effective insect bite management is **reaction-specific**, emphasizing symptomatic care, judicious antibiotic use, and readiness for anaphylaxis. Patient education and prevention are key to reducing recurrence and complications.

### Management of simple insect bites: where's the evidence? [^e7117736]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Many insects bite in order to obtain a blood meal and, in the process, inject the victim with saliva that may contain a number of substances, some of which can be immunogenic. The consequences of insect bites include local reactions, immune (allergic) reactions including anaphylaxis, and secondary bacterial infections (e.g. impetigo, cellulitis). Although insect bites are perceived to be common in the UK, the exact incidence is difficult to estimate since most are likely to go unreported: only those causing the more serious reactions are seen in primary care settings. Simple insect bites are those that are not accompanied or followed by anaphylactic shock or systemic infection. Many preparations for the treatment of insect bites, including antihistamines and topical corticosteroids, are available for purchase over the counter (OTC) in the UK. However, there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of these treatments and, in general, recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion and clinical experience. This article reviews the evidence for the management of simple bites by insects commonly encountered in the UK, but excludes ticks, mites and lice.

Regarding medical management for hymenoptera sting allergy, more specifically with respect to venom immunotherapy, indications, adult patients, AAAAI/ACAAI 2017 guidelines recommend to avoid offering venom immunotherapy in adult patients with a history of only cutaneous systemic reactions without other systemic manifestations after an insect sting, but consider offering it in special circumstances based on a shared decision with consideration of high-risk factors (frequent exposure, cardiovascular or respiratory conditions, or selected medications) and the effects on QoL.

### Shared decision-making in insect sting allergy: to bee or not to bee? [^79bd7ca9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluation and management of insect sting allergy are often not straightforward when there is uncertainty about the history of reaction, the significance of test results, and the risk of severe reaction to future stings. Patients encounter misinformation about the chance of reaction and may have strong beliefs about the need for treatment. Shared decision-making encourages the clinician to listen to the patients' concerns and beliefs, share relevant information and evidence, and partner with patients to incorporate their values and preferences. This review discusses some major decision points in diagnosis and treatment of insect-allergic patients, with attention to the potential burdens or harms that are important to patients and factors that relate to patients' values and preferences concerning the choices they must make. This is especially true in patients with no history of moderate to severe sting anaphylaxis in whom the risk may be overestimated, but it can also be important in patients who underestimate the risk associated with severe sting anaphylaxis. Clinicians should become more knowledgeable about patient-important beliefs and outcomes and engage in shared decision-making to help patients understand and be comfortable with the choices they must make.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^fe1d8419]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

To better understand current practice-based management of insect bites, the IBG opted to use a QI approach that aims to improve patient care through first understanding the problem in context, then using a systematic approach to examine, propose and implement change before assessing impact. Our study aimed to assess and understand the incidence of insect bite presentation, the management (and whether clinicians are following NICE guidelines) and whether insect bite management contributes to the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing. We intend that our findings will inform practice improvement activity to address prescribing practice.

### Negative venom skin test results in patients with histories of systemic reaction to a sting [^c0b2f462]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

For more than 20 years venom immunotherapy has been the preferred treatment for Hymenoptera allergy and venom skin testing the preferred diagnostic test. Most allergists consider venom skin tests to be highly accurate and interpret a negative venom skin test result to indicate the absence of insect allergy. Furthermore, current practice guidelines do not adequately address the question of how best to manage the patient with a convincing history of insect allergy but negative skin test results. Recent case reports and published studies have forced us to reexamine this important management issue and to consider what role in vitro venom testing might have in the management of insect allergy. We reviewed the current status of what is known about the management of individuals with a history of insect allergy but negative venom skin test results and suggested modifications of current working guidelines.

### Anaphylaxis to stinging insect venom [^66437439]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Hymenoptera stinging insects are common culprits for allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis to insect stings can be life threatening and is associated with a significant risk of recurrence. Insect allergy requires referral to an allergist/immunologist for education and for diagnostic evaluation that will direct further management and treatment. Venom immunotherapy is safe and effective; it prevents sting anaphylaxis in up to 98% of patients. Potential risk factors for side effects during testing and treatment should be assessed for every patient to mitigate risk and to guide treatment recommendations and the duration of immunotherapy.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^fff23d32]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data suggests there could be scope to change and improve the management of insect bites, with greater use of non-antibiotic management. To help detect early cellulitis swab of purulent discharge and drawing round the erythema to monitor spread may be helpful. Exploration of antihistamine, topical steroid, and topical antiseptics in insect bite management may reduce antibiotic use. Our findings highlight the next steps needed in a QI approach to generate practice-based evidence on optimal management of insect bites, specifically work on alternatives to antibiotic prescribing.

The James Lind alliancehas worked with patients to identify research questions related to the management of cellulitis, including "What are the early signs and symptoms of cellulitis that can help to ensure speedy treatment?". For insect bites in general practice, we suggest "What early symptoms and signs in insect bite reactions do not require antibiotics?" and "What non-antibiotic treatments reduce inflammation and cellulitis?" as changes to design and implement as the next step in a QI model to develop practice-based evidence.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^55e18b8f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — management of large local reactions and indications for venom immunotherapy (VIT): Treat large local reactions symptomatically, with antihistamines, cold compresses, and analgesics as needed, noting that in severe cases a short course of oral corticosteroids may be useful and that antibiotics are usually not necessary and should be prescribed only if specifically indicated (Recommendation; D evidence). Recommend and initiate VIT in all patients who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction to an insect sting and who have specific IgE to venom allergens (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). Avoid VIT based solely on in vivo and in vitro testing for venom IgE, without a history of systemic reaction to a sting (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). Counsel patients who have experienced only large local reactions to stings that VIT is generally not required but might be considered in those who have frequent unavoidable exposure (Recommendation; B evidence). In a change from previous recommendations, advise both children and adults who have experienced only cutaneous systemic reactions without other systemic manifestations after an insect sting that VIT is generally not required but may be considered when there are special circumstances, with shared decision making that considers high-risk factors and effects on quality of life (Recommendation; C evidence). Discuss with adults with cutaneous systemic reactions who are already receiving VIT the reasons for the change in recommendations, possible special circumstances, and the relative risks and benefits of discontinuing or completing the course of VIT (Recommendation; D evidence).

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^6b22757a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — indications and non-indications for venom immunotherapy (VIT): "Approximately 30% to 60% of patients with a history of systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting who have specific IgE antibodies detectable by means of skin or in vitro testing will experience a systemic reaction when restung. Therefore, VIT should be considered in such patients." "VIT is generally not necessary in children (younger than 17 years) who have experienced isolated cutaneous systemic reactions," and adults with only cutaneous manifestations "are also considered to be at low risk for a severe reaction and do not require VIT." For large local reactions, "VIT is also generally not necessary… most patients who have had a large local reaction do not need to be tested for specific IgE antibodies," though "VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and thus might be useful" when unavoidable and/or frequent. Intentional sting challenges "are not consistently reproducible and are associated with considerable risk," and "The standard management… does not include a sting challenge." In low-risk patients, "the decision regarding initiation of VIT is based on a risk-benefit discussion with the patient."

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^c1aad354]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Evidence shows that general practice flucloxacillin prescribing increases in summer months, peaking in July. A specialist Insect Bite Group (IBG) within the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) were considering whether this seasonal effect might be due to increased presentation with insect bites, and if so whether increased prescribing is appropriate or not. This IBG is within the RCGP overdiagnosis special interest group (OD). The OD group's interest is in inappropriate medicalisation of self-limiting illness and over-use of antibiotics. The group includes general practitioners (GPs), including educators and researchers. We used Quality Improvement (QI) methodologies to undertake an initial analysis/assessment of this problem.

Best practice in the management of insect bites is not as clearly described as it is for other infective conditions such as tonsillitis. Current guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on insect bites and stingsstate that "most will not require antibiotics" and recommends the use of antihistamines. GP clinicians (GPCs) may access allied guidance, for example, NICE guidance on impetigorecommends an antiseptic (hydrogen peroxide1% cream) for well patients with localised non-bullous impetigo, and, if not suitable, topical antibiotics. More widespread or severe non-bullous impetigo, and all bullous impetigo, are recommended a course of oral antibiotics, flucloxacillin, first line. Finally, NICE have guidance on erysipelas and cellulitiswhich recommends taking a swab from broken skin, drawing round the area with a pen, and offering an oral antibiotic, first-line flucloxacillin, it also recommends reassessing if worsening or not improving at 2 or 3 days. However, guidelines drawn from committee consensus and published evidence usually describes case studies of severe infection, and may not translate to this common clinical scenario seen in primary care. Applying guidelines in practice requires key clinical judgements concerning which bites need medical management, or whether self-management is more appropriate. For GPCs, it can be difficult to distinguish clinical features of redness and heat from inflammatory reactions or secondary cellulitis.

### Should patients with a large local reaction Be offered venom immunotherapy? A pro-con debate [^609b3048]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Insect stings can cause large local reactions (LLRs) that are IgE-mediated and associated with considerable morbidity. A risk for systemic reactions including anaphylaxis to subsequent stings has been reported and is often noted by patients and health care providers. Guidelines do not recommend venom immunotherapy (VIT) for LLRs based on the relatively low risk of anaphylaxis, but this is debated in this review. On the pro side: the risk of anaphylaxis may be higher than reported in the limited literature, especially in patients who had only 1 LLR; new species with more potent stings are spreading into new areas; the quality of life can be markedly impaired by LLRs; and VIT is generally safe and highly effective. On the con side: LLRs are benign, stings occur infrequently, VIT has significant cost, systemic reactions occur more often to VIT than to stings in patients with LLRs, and Food and Drug Administration approval and published guidelines do not recommend VIT for LLRs. In practice, shared decision-making is appropriate to incorporate knowledge of the natural history and known high-risk factors in the context of the patient's personal values and preferences.

### Management of facial bite wounds [^9abeb099]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Bite wounds are especially prone to infectious complications, both local and systemic. In bite wounds to the face, such complications can create more difficulties than the initial tissue damage itself for the task of restoring an esthetic appearance. Management should aim to neutralize this potential for infection and provide an infection-free environment for wound healing. Wound cleansing followed by primary closure is the treatment of choice, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics may further decrease the risk of infection. Delay in presentation beyond 24 hours is not necessarily a contraindication to immediate repair, but excessive crushing of the tissues or extensive edema usually dictates a more conservative approach, such as delayed closure.

### Management of anaphylaxis in infants and toddlers [^af22aab4]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction that can be caused by food, drugs, insect bites, or unknown triggers in infants and toddlers. Anaphylaxis rates are increasing. Infants and toddlers may have increased exposure to known and unknown allergens, decreased ability to describe their symptoms, and an expanded differential diagnosis for consideration on presentation. The most common symptoms in these age groups are cutaneous and gastrointestinal. Age-specific language may be helpful for caregivers to identify and describe the symptoms of anaphylaxis in infants and toddlers. Long-term management of anaphylaxis includes allergy evaluation to guide avoidance and assess prognosis and education on allergic reaction management; this incorporates the prescription of epinephrine autoinjector and provision of an allergy emergency plan.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^64a7934d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — management of large local reactions: A large local reaction is described as extreme swelling extending from the sting site, usually peaking at 48 to 72 hours after a sting and lasting 1 week or more, and the risk of a systemic reaction in such patients is 4% to 10%. Because of this relatively low risk, diagnostic testing and VIT are generally not required; Summary Statement 16: Counsel patients who have experienced only large local reactions to stings that VIT is generally not required but might be considered in those who have frequent unavoidable exposure. Providing injectable epinephrine for these patients is usually not necessary but might be considered if it provides reassurance, and most patients will experience similar large local reactions after subsequent stings, with those who have frequent and/or severe reactions potentially benefiting from VIT.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^b9951111]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Adults with cutaneous systemic sting reactions — venom immunotherapy (VIT) management: Summary Statement 18: Discuss with adults with cutaneous systemic reactions who are already receiving VIT the reasons for the change in recommendations, possible special circumstances, and the relative risks and benefits of discontinuing or completing the course of VIT. (Recommendation; D evidence). The risk-benefit ratio for VIT in such patients is uncertain and should be a shared decision considering potential high-risk factors, including concomitant cardiovascular disease, specific medications (ACE inhibitors and β-blockers), elevated basal tryptase, likelihood of future stings, or detrimental effect on quality of life. Deaths from insect stings increase with age, with 1980–1999 US data reported as: 20–29 years old, 41 deaths; 30–39 years old, 112 deaths; 40–49 years old, 196 deaths; 50–59 years old, 217 deaths; 60–69 years old, 207 deaths; older than 70 years, 131 deaths. This new recommendation that VIT is not required for adults with cutaneous systemic reactions will raise questions for those already undergoing VIT, warranting individualized discussion of discontinuation versus completion.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^b224a089]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anaphylaxis, more specifically with respect to management of beta-blockers and ACEis, AAAAI 2024 guidelines recommend to consider continuing β-blockers or ACEis when the medical necessity of the daily medication outweighs the chance of increased severity of anaphylaxis to a sting in patients with a history of insect sting anaphylaxis not receiving venom immunotherapy.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — testing interpretation, tryptase assessment, special populations, and acute reaction management: Physicians and patients should not expect the degree of sensitivity found on skin and serologic tests for venom-specific IgE to reliably predict the severity of a reaction to a sting, but it is a good predictor for the likelihood of any systemic reaction (Recommendation; B evidence). Consider measuring basal serum tryptase in all patients who are candidates for VIT (Recommendation; B evidence). Use skin tests as the preferred test for initial demonstration of venom-specific IgE; in vitro measurement of serum specific IgE should be used as a complementary or alternative test, and test for all 5 venoms, with the possible exception of individual patients in whom a single culprit is definitively known (Recommendation; C evidence). Consider measuring basal serum tryptase in patients with anaphylaxis to a sting, especially in those with severe or hypotensive reactions, and in all those with negative test results for venom IgE (Strong Recommendation; B evidence). Counsel patients with elevated basal serum tryptase about the clinical significance of potential underlying mast cell disorders (Recommendation; B evidence). Consider testing patients with mastocytosis for insect venom sensitivity and identify other high risk factors for severe anaphylaxis to stings (including medications), and discuss with the patient the benefits and risks for testing and for VIT (Recommendation; D evidence). Advise the patient to treat acute systemic reactions to insect stings like any anaphylactic reaction, with timely epinephrine injection (Strong Recommendation; A evidence), supportive therapy (Strong Recommendation; A evidence), and transport to an emergency department (Strong Recommendation; C evidence).

Large local reactions — clinical course and management — are usually IgE mediated, almost always self-limited, and rarely create serious health problems; patients with prior large local reactions often have recurrences, and up to 10% might eventually have a systemic reaction. For patients with large local reactions, it is optional to prescribe injectable epinephrine for use if a systemic reaction occurs in the future, most need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom specific IgE or venom immunotherapy (VIT), although increasing evidence shows VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and might be useful in those with frequent unavoidable reactions and detectable venom specific IgE; the decision to give VIT must be weighed against added cost and potential inconvenience. Supportive care can include cold compresses, oral antihistamines, and oral analgesics; although many physicians use oral corticosteroids for large local reactions, definitive proof of efficacy is lacking, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection (eg, fever, chills, or sweats).

Lyme disease (LD) is most often diagnosed clinically, and the differential diagnosis of erythema migrans may be challenging. Recent advances have raised questions about the efficacy of traditional diagnostic modalities, but may soon facilitate consistent identification of patients with Lyme borreliosis. Therapeutic recommendations vary with the stage of disease, and treatment usually leads to complete resolution. The management of patients with "chronic Lyme disease" is controversial. A number of preventative measures have been evaluated; those involving the avoidance of tick bites with protective clothing and insect repellents remain the simplest and most effective.

"Intramuscular injection in the anterolateral thigh will achieve a more rapid and higher plasma concentration than subcutaneous or intramuscular injection in the arm. Delayed use of epinephrine might be ineffective." Patients and caregivers "should be taught how to administer epinephrine" and "instructed to follow the package insert… including protecting it from excess heat," and "There is no contraindication to the use of epinephrine in a life-threatening situation, such as anaphylaxis." For persistence or recurrence, "more than 1 unit should be prescribed," and "Antihistamines and corticosteroids should not be considered substitutes for epinephrine." For low-risk patients, "the need to carry injectable epinephrine can be determined by the patient and physician," with low risk including "large local reactions… strictly cutaneous systemic reactions," maintenance VIT, or VIT discontinued "after more than 5 years of treatment." Higher-risk features include "extreme or near-fatal reactions," "systemic reactions during VIT," "anaphylaxis to a honeybee sting," "increased basal tryptase levels," "underlying medical conditions or concomitant medications," and "frequent unavoidable exposure."

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^072e46f1]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

For identified eligible consultations, the practice clinician extracted data related to the patient (age, sex), presenting problem (bite site, symptoms, duration), management plan (prescribing), follow-up or sequelae (re-presentation or referral to hospital), and service context (mode of consultation and clinician consulting). Data were collected using a study-specific instrument created by the team (see Appendix 1), drawing on evidence from our previous GP survey in this field, reading of the literature, and clinical expertise. This tool was applied by each of the investigators in their own practice, all data were anonymised and then exported to Microsoft Excel. Results were double checked by a second investigator.

Analysis

Consultation data were converted into categorical (nominal data) where appropriate. The analysis used descriptive statistical analysis of practice-level clinical behaviour to answer research questions 1–4. An analysis plan was applied using descriptive statistics to assess incidence, demographics of patients, proportions of consultations by consultation modality and clinician, prevalence of symptoms/signs, and the proportions of treatment modalities. Results are to one decimal place. Question 5 used a different approach, based on analysis of the nine English practices, as data was not available for the Welsh tenth practice. This analysis sought to describe the proportion of flucloxacillin prescriptions issued at each practice accounted for by insect bite management. Data describing monthly prescribing of flucloxacillin at each of the 9 practices were identified from OpenPrescribingwhich is part of the Bennett Institute for applied data science at the University of Oxford and provides a search interface onto the raw English Prescribing Dataset published by NHS Business Services Authority and explores dispensed prescriptions. These data were compared to our observed flucloxacillin prescribed for insect bites in each practice.

The study, as QI, did not require NHS ethics or Health Research Authority approval, as it examines data on current provision of care. Information governance leads at each practice were consulted to check their agreement with the proposals. We use SQUIREto report our findings. Two patient participation group members read either the initial data tool or draft paper to help improve the study report.

### Management of stinging insect hypersensitivity: a 5-year retrospective medical record review [^422a1bf0]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Allergy and Immunology recommends that patients with a history of a systemic reaction to an insect sting be educated on ways to avoid insect stings, carry injectable epinephrine for emergency self-treatment, undergo specific IgE testing for stinging insect sensitivity, and be considered for immunotherapy.

Objective

To review frontline providers' documented care and recommendations for imported fire ant and flying insect hypersensitivity reactions.

Methods

A retrospective medical record review was performed of emergency department and primary care clinic visits between November 1, 1999, and November 30, 2004. Using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes, medical records were selected for review to identify patients with potential insect hypersensitivity.

Results

A total of 769 medical records from patients who experienced an insect sting were reviewed. Of 120 patients with a systemic reaction, 66 (55.0%) received a prescription for injectable epinephrine, and 14 (11.7%) were given information regarding avoidance of the offending insect. Forty-seven patients with systemic reactions (39.2%) were referred to an allergist. Of 28 patients who kept their appointments and underwent skin testing, 3 had negative results and 25 (89%) had positive results and were advised to start immunotherapy.

Conclusion

Adherence to the stinging insect hypersensitivity practice parameter recommendations is poor. Many patients who have experienced a systemic reaction after an insect sting and have sought medical care are not afforded an opportunity for potentially lifesaving therapy.

Animal and human bites are a common reason for emergency consultation, especially in children. The most common complication of bite wounds is local infection. Systemic infections are much rarer. The key in reducing the risk of infection after a mammalian bite is local wound management with either primary or delayed closure. The benefit of administering prophylactic antibiotics is controversial. In this review, we provide a summary of the current evidence for the management of mammalian bites in children, including recommendations for appropriate investigations, wound management, administration of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics and the prevention of systemic infections.

Toxins and Environmental — Bites and Envenomation (prehospital EMS) notes and quality measures state that vinegar has potential to increase pain associated with jellyfish sting as it can increase nematocyst discharge in certain species, and that clinicians must be familiar with endemic species and how to best address exposure. Pertinent assessment findings include assessing for signs and symptoms of local and systematic impact of the suspected toxin and recognizing that a patient may still have an imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocysts, or barb which may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded. Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) include 9914079 — Injury - Bites and Envenomations-Land and 9914081 — Injury - Bites and Envenomations-Marine. Key documentation elements include accurately describing the suspect bite or sting source without risking patient or emergency medical services (EMS) clinician, only transporting the source animal or insect if it can be done safely in a hard-sided container, repeating evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as patient clinical conditions may deteriorate rapidly, recording time of symptoms onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatments, and documenting therapy and response to therapy. Performance measures include that the offending organism was managed appropriately without secondary exposure, appropriate and timely definitive treatment was provided, and appropriate pain management was achieved.

### Insect bite-induced hypersensitivity and the SCRATCH principles: a new approach to papular urticaria [^d1708367]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Insect bites and the associated hypersensitivity reactions known as papular urticaria account for a significant number of all referrals from pediatricians and dermatologists to our pediatric dermatology clinic. Unfortunately, children affected by these eruptions are frequently misdiagnosed and often subject to expensive evaluations including invasive and unnecessary procedures. Here we review the course of 4 children with the typical physical findings and natural history of these reactions. On the basis of our clinical findings and experience with this patient population, we propose a set of principles (termed "SCRATCH") as clinical features to aid clinicians in making an early and accurate clinical diagnosis. We conclude that a more appropriate term for future study and diagnosis of this entity is insect bite-induced hypersensitivity.

### Tabanidae insect (horsefly and deerfly) allergy in humans: a review of the literature [^365c9056]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Allergy to insects of the family Tabanidae (order Diptera), commonly called horseflies or deerflies, is anecdotally common, although the published literature is limited to case reports and small case series. This review summarizes the available literature, in which there is enormous variability in clinical detail, identification of species or even genus, and means and thoroughness of assessment of sensitization. The clinical utility of in vivo and in vitro assays remains unclear. Investigation and management of patients reporting anaphylaxis to suspected bites must therefore be pragmatic, by considering other insects (eg Hymenoptera), provision of a written action plan and self-injectable adrenaline if appropriate, and advice on avoidance.

### A 4-year review of human bite injuries presenting to emergency medicine and proposed evidence-based guidelines [^c985f76f]. Injury (2009). Low credibility.

Human bite injuries are a common injury, roughly accounting for around 0.1% of attendances to Emergency Medicine departments. Morbidities associated with such injuries are legion. Of paramount importance is the potential for infection of the wound site, both bacterial and viral. A retrospective 4-year review of 3136 case notes was conducted, identifying 421 human bites. This amounts to one every 3 days! The majority of those bitten were young males (male:female ratio = 3:1; 44% comprising the age group 16–25 years). The management of these wounds was found to be poor. 17% of patients did not receive any antibiotic cover; 21% of patients either did not have tetanus prophylaxis administered when required or had a tetanus booster when they were already covered; 34% of patients either did not receive a hepatitis B booster when one was required or received one when they were already covered. This lack of effective documentation, along with errors in addressing prophylaxis of the infective agents, may have profound medico-legal consequences. The author believes that the findings will be reproduced in other centres and in view of the inadequacies highlighted by this work, it is necessary to introduce an evidence-based protocol for the comprehensive management of the human bite. Using United Kingdom Department of Health evidence-based guidelines, the author proposes such a pathway.

### Tick-borne diseases of the USA: ten things clinicians should know [^bd9d1798]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

This article highlights critical aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of tick-borne infections in children. Principles that apply broadly across the continental United States are emphasized, rather than details of each disease. Tick-borne infections are often confused with other, more common childhood illnesses, in part because of their nonspecific initial clinical findings and because patients are usually unaware of their preceding tick exposures. This is a problem, because delays in starting appropriate antibiotic therapy increase the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these infections, especially Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). For patients in whom RMSF is a reasonable diagnostic consideration, therapy should be started presumptively, without awaiting the results of confirmatory diagnostic tests. For both adults and children, doxycycline is the drug of choice for RMSF and other American rickettsial infections. Concerns over the potential toxicity of doxycycline in young children are unfounded. Similarly groundless is the belief in "chronic Lyme disease" as an explanation for persistent nonspecific complaints after completing antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. Prevention of tick-borne infections rests on avoidance of tick-bites and prompt removal of attached ticks. When used appropriately, insect repellents containing DEET are safe and effective for preventing tick exposures.

### Summer buzz: all you need to know about insect sting allergies [^aeb4acba]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Insect stings can generate a range of immune and clinical reactions. Most reactions are local and self-limiting. Allergic reactions to insect stings can occur at all ages, with or without previous stings. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis carry a significant risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis with future stings. Health-care providers are often unaware of the tremendous clinical benefits of venom immunotherapy for these select patients. Scientific knowledge about the natural history, risk factors, and optimal therapy for insect sting allergies has improved considerably in recent years.

### Horsefly (genus tabanus) bite: allergy or infection? [^3cc4dc29]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Summer heatwaves are often associated with increased reports of insect bites as people enjoy spending time outdoors. The horsefly (genus Tabanus), or 'cleg' as it is colloquially known, often receives negative publicity due to peak activity in summer. Following an increase in local hospital presentations due to complications of bites, discussion among colleagues suggested a lack of knowledge regarding best management. We present a case of a woman in her 30s with a large erythematous swelling on her thigh following a suspected horsefly bite. Review revealed no clinical evidence of sepsis but a localised inflammatory response. Inflammatory markers were normal and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics and oral antihistamines to good effect. This case highlights secondary care presentation of a common condition and discusses potential complications, pathogenesis and uncertainties around best practice guidelines for treatment. We highlight strategies to aid antibiotic stewardship, reduce complications and secondary care presentation.

### Multicenter study of emergency department visits for insect sting allergies [^92f83a62]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

An earlier study of food-related anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ED) suggested low concordance with national guidelines for anaphylaxis management.

Objective

To extend these findings, we performed a chart review study to describe current ED management of insect sting allergy.

Methods

The Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration performed a chart review study in 15 North American EDs. Investigators reviewed 617 charts of patients with insect sting allergy. Patients were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes 989.5 (toxic effect of venom), 995.0 (other anaphylactic shock), and 995.3 (allergy, unspecified).

Results

The cohort was 42% female and 61% white, with a mean age of 36 ± 19 years. In this cohort, 58% had local reactions, 11% had mild systemic reactions, and 31% had anaphylactic reactions, as defined by multisystem organ involvement or hypotension. Among patients with systemic reactions (mild or anaphylaxis), most (75%) were stung within 6 hours of ED arrival. While in the ED, 69% of systemic reaction patients received antihistamines, 50% systemic corticosteroids, and 12% epinephrine. Almost all systemic reaction patients (95%) were discharged to home. At ED discharge, 27% (95% CI, 22% to 33%) of systemic reaction patients received a prescription for self-injectable epinephrine. Only 20% (95% CI, 15% to 26%) had documentation of referral to an allergist.

Conclusions

Although guidelines suggest specific approaches for the emergency management of insect sting allergy, concordance with these guidelines appears low in patients with a severe insect sting reaction.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — initial evaluation and patient counseling: Evaluate patients with a history of a systemic reaction to an insect sting for the presence of venom-specific IgE, noting that if venom IgE is present these patients are at increased risk for subsequent sting anaphylaxis, which can be prevented by VIT (Strong Recommendation; A Evidence). Evaluate the patient for details of the history of any reactions to insect stings (Strong Recommendation; B evidence). Recommend to patients who have a history of systemic reactions to insect stings effective measures to avoid insect stings (Recommendation; D evidence), the need to always carry an epinephrine autoinjector, to be familiar with its proper use and when to use it or not use it, and to carry medical identification (Strong Recommendation; C evidence), and referral for evaluation by an allergist/immunologist, the utility of specific IgE testing for stinging insect sensitivity, and the potential advantages of VIT (testing is not necessary for patients in whom VIT is not required) (Strong Recommendation; D evidence). Perform skin tests and/or serum tests for IgE to stinging insect venoms on patients who are candidates for VIT (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). If initial test results are negative in a patient with a clear history of systemic sting reaction, further testing (in vitro testing, repeat skin testing, or both) should be performed, as well as basal serum tryptase measurement (Strong Recommendation; C evidence).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of tick-borne illness in the United States [^4115fbdb]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and management of tick-borne illness (TBI). Recommendations are graded based on quality of supporting evidence according to criteria put forth by the American College of Chest Physicians. The guidelines include a brief review of the clinical presentation, epidemiology, prevention, and management of TBI in the United States, with a primary focus on interventions that are appropriate for resource-limited settings. Strong recommendations are provided for the use of DEET, picaridin, and permethrin; tick checks; washing and drying clothing at high temperatures; mechanical tick removal within 36 h of attachment; single-dose doxycycline for high-risk Lyme disease exposures versus "watchful waiting"; evacuation from backcountry settings for symptomatic tick exposures; and TBI education programs. Weak recommendations are provided for the use of light-colored clothing; insect repellents other than DEET, picaridin, and permethrin; and showering after exposure to tick habitat. Weak recommendations are also provided against passive methods of tick removal, including the use of systemic and local treatments. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of long-sleeved clothing and the avoidance of tick habitat such as long grasses and leaf litter. Although there was sound evidence supporting Lyme disease vaccination, a grade was not offered as the vaccine is not currently available for use in the United States.

### Anaphylaxis: recognition and management [^7f983370]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening systemic reaction, normally occurring within one to two hours of exposure to an allergen. The incidence of anaphylaxis in the United States is 2.1 per 1,000 person-years. Most anaphylactic reactions occur outside the hospital setting. Urticaria, difficulty breathing, and mucosal swelling are the most common symptoms of anaphylaxis. The most common triggers are medications, stinging insect venoms, and foods; however, unidentified triggers occur in up to one-fifth of cases. Coexisting asthma, mast cell disorders, older age, underlying cardiovascular disease, peanut and tree nut allergy, and drug-induced reactions are associated with severe or fatal anaphylactic reactions. Clinicians can obtain serum tryptase levels, reflecting mast cell degranulation, when the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis is not clear. Acute management of anaphylaxis involves removal of the trigger; early administration of intramuscular epinephrine; supportive care for the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation; and a period of observation for potential biphasic reactions. Only after epinephrine administration should adjunct medications be considered; these include histamine H1 and H2 antagonists, corticosteroids, beta2 agonists, and glucagon. Patients should be monitored for a biphasic reaction (i.e., recurrence of anaphylaxis without reexposure to the allergen) for four to 12 hours, depending on risk factors for severe anaphylaxis. Following an anaphylactic reaction, management should focus on developing an emergency action plan, referral to an allergist, and patient education on avoidance of triggers and appropriate use of an epinephrine auto-injector.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^d4e83e07]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Wilderness Medical Society basic wound management — evacuation recommends that patients with the following wounds require care that is not available in a wilderness setting and should be evacuated (Recommendation grade: 1C): all complex wounds not closed primarily; open fractures; wounds with underlying tendon, joint, nerve, or vessel damage; wounds secondary to mammalian bites; any wound showing early signs of infection, if appropriate early antibiotics are not available; wounds with progression of infection after administration of antibiotics; wounds associated with a large foreign body, particularly if organic in nature; wounds with symptoms of systemic toxicity (fever, alterations of consciousness, shock); wounds in the presence of hypothermia; wounds with palpable gas in the soft tissues; wounds with significant associated devitalized tissue; tetanus-prone wounds requiring immunization.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^9d2c2e09]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Treatment — general considerations and decontamination: As with any potentially serious illness or injury in the field, care begins with an assessment of scene safety followed by a primary evaluation of the patient with interventions as needed to support airway, breathing, and circulation, and epinephrine should be given as soon as possible once anaphylaxis has been identified. Removal of the inciting allergen is appropriate in certain circumstances, such as immediately removing an insect stinger from the skin to prevent additional injection of venom (avoiding pressure, if possible, on the venom sac). Exposure to aerosolized, food-based allergens should be stopped by discontinuing on-site cooking of the associated food and, if feasible, distancing of the patient, and inducing vomiting for food-based allergens has not been proven effective and may delay treatment with epinephrine.

### Insect allergy: barriers in training and practice – A work group report of the AAAAI anaphylaxis committee [^fe66a019]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Stinging insect allergy — testing and ancillary assessment practices are characterized by frequent tryptase testing, mastocytosis evaluation, evolving serology cut-offs, and multifaceted management. Additional testing with tryptase levels is done for all patients by most (68.6%), with 23.9% reserving it for severe sting reactions; mastocytosis is considered for all patients by 58.2%. The traditional serologic cut-off is 0.35 kU/L, but laboratories now report as low as 0.1 kU/L, and 18 of 65 respondents (27.7%) use this lower cut-off; only 3 (4.5%) reported ordering component tests. All respondents who conducted 1-step ID completed fellowship training prior to 2017. Management of venom allergy is multifaceted for most (91.7%) and includes prescription for epinephrine autoinjectors, avoidance counseling, and VIT.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^e6d5425b]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Insect bite inflammation may mimic cellulitis and promote unnecessary antibiotic usage, contributing to antimicrobial resistance in primary care. We wondered how general practice clinicians assess and manage insect bites, diagnose cellulitis, and prescribe antibiotics.

Method

This is a Quality Improvement study in which 10 general practices in England and Wales investigated patients attending for the first time with insect bites between April and September 2021 to their practices. Mode of consultation, presentation, management plan, and reattendance or referral were noted. Total practice flucloxacillin prescribing was compared to that for insect bites.

Results

A combined list size of 161,346 yielded 355 insect bite consultations. Nearly two-thirds were female, ages 3–89 years old, with July as the peak month and a mean weekly incidence of 8 per 100,000. GPs still undertook most consultations; most were phone consultations, with photo support for over half. Over 40% presented between days 1 and 3 and common symptoms were redness, itchness, pain, and heat. Vital sign recording was not common, and only 22% of patients were already taking an antihistamine despite 45% complaining of itch. Antibiotics were prescribed to nearly three-quarters of the patients, mainly orally and mostly as flucloxacillin. Reattendance occurred for 12% and referral to hospital for 2%. Flucloxacillin for insect bites contributed a mean of 5.1% of total practice flucloxacillin prescriptions, with a peak of 10.7% in July.

Conclusions

Antibiotics are likely to be overused in our insect bite practice and patients could make more use of antihistamines for itch before consulting.

### Human and other mammalian bite injuries of the hand: evaluation and management [^21056cb6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

The hand is the most common site for bite injuries. Because of specific characteristics of hand anatomy, bite mechanics, and organisms found in human and animal saliva, even small wounds can lead to aggressive infections. Failure to recognize and treat hand bites can result in significant morbidity. Human and animal bites most commonly lead to polymicrobial bacterial infections with a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are commonly found in dog and cat bite wounds, and Eikenella is characteristic of human wounds. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacterial species are common to all mammals. Although public health measures in developed countries have been highly effective at reducing rabies transmission, dog bites remain the most common source of rabies infection worldwide. Human bites can transmit HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, especially when contaminated blood is exposed to an open wound. Appropriate management of any mammal bite requires recognition, early wound cleansing, evaluation of injured structures, and infection prophylaxis. Structural repair is performed as indicated by the severity and contamination of the injury, and wounds may require delayed closure. Wound infections typically require débridement, empiric antibiotics, and delayed repair or reconstruction.

### Venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings [^b1efd3ac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is commonly used for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had a sting reaction. The efficacy and safety of this treatment has not previously been assessed by a high-quality systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immunotherapy using extracted insect venom for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had an allergic reaction to a sting.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to February 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System, and OpenGrey. There were no language or publication status restrictions to our searches. We searched trials databases, abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings, and the references of identified review articles in order to identify further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of venom immunotherapy using standardised venom extract in insect sting allergy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We identified adverse events from included controlled trials and from a separate analysis of observational studies identified as part of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Health Technology Assessment.

Main Results

We identified 6 randomised controlled trials and 1 quasi-randomised controlled trial for inclusion in the review; the total number of participants was 392. The trials had some risk of bias because five of the trials did not blind outcome assessors to treatment allocation. The interventions included ant, bee, and wasp immunotherapy in children or adults with previous systemic or large local reactions to a sting, using sublingual (one trial) or subcutaneous (six trials) VIT. We found that VIT is effective for preventing systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting, which was our primary outcome measure. This applies whether the sting occurs accidentally or is given intentionally as part of a trial procedure. In the trials, 3/113 (2.7%) participants treated with VIT had a subsequent systemic allergic reaction to a sting, compared with 37/93 (39.8%) untreated participants (risk ratio [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.28). The efficacy of VIT was similar across studies; we were unable to identify a patient group or mode of treatment with different efficacy, although these analyses were limited by small numbers. We were unable to confirm whether VIT prevents fatal reactions to insect stings, because of the rarity of this outcome. Venom immunotherapy was also effective for preventing large local reactions to a sting (5 studies; 112 follow-up stings; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69) and for improving quality of life (mean difference [MD] in favour of VIT 1.21 points on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67). We found a significant risk of systemic adverse reaction to VIT treatment: 6 trials reported this outcome, in which 14 of 150 (9.3%) participants treated with VIT and 1 of 135 (0.7%) participants treated with placebo or no treatment suffered a systemic reaction to treatment (RR 8.16, 95% CI 1.53 to 43.46; 2 studies contributed to the effect estimate). Our analysis of 11 observational studies found systemic adverse reactions occurred in 131/921 (14.2%) participants treated with bee venom VIT and 8/289 (2.8%) treated with wasp venom VIT.

Authors' Conclusions

We found venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom to be an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings, which can improve quality of life. The treatment carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reaction.

### Anaphylaxis [^89511122]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis is an acute-onset, potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction. It is usually triggered by an agent such as an insect sting, food, or medication, through a mechanism involving IgE and the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells or basophils. Less commonly, it is triggered through other immunologic mechanisms, or through nonimmunologic mechanisms. It often occurs in community settings. Anaphylaxis episodes range in severity from those that are mild and resolve spontaneously to those that are fatal within minutes. The clinical diagnosis is based on a meticulous history and physical examination, sometimes, but not necessarily, supported by a laboratory test such as an elevated serum total tryptase level. Sensitization to allergen triggers suggested by the history needs to be confirmed by skin testing and measurement of allergen-specific IgE. In some sensitized individuals, additional tests are needed to assess the risk of future anaphylaxis episodes. Prompt injection of epinephrine is life-saving. H1-antihistamines and inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonists cannot be depended on to prevent fatality. Long-term risk reduction is an integral part of management.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^26b08320]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Our novel approach seeks to generate real-world practice-based evidence using QI approaches. The IBG is a professionally led group based within the RCGP using practice-based research to exchange knowledge with colleagues, analyse patient health care use, explore management dilemmas, and define future research activity. This is the first reporting on management of a cohort of primary care insect bite practice to our knowledge. QI approaches create some limitations as insect bites were selected by searching on coded data, some may therefore be missing from the data set. The number of total bites occurring in the population and self-managed, versus the number presenting to all primary care providers versus those presenting to general practices is unknown. Patients may also attend walk-in clinics, out of hours services, community pharmacists, and A&E departments for insect bite concerns. Our practices were not randomised and practice list size varied greatly, introducing possible bias. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a studyreported an overall unchanged prescribing of antibiotics compared to that forecast, but a reduction of flucloxacillin prescribing of 12.7% compared to forecasts for the month of July 2020. We do not know how this may have affected our study. Reduced social contact, and reduced travel abroad but increased exercise in local open spaces will have created some changes to patients' behaviour and also to pandemic prescribing. Our study reflects insect bite issues from England and Wales, rather than travel abroad, which was much more common before the COVID-19 pandemic years. We cannot draw any conclusions about overseas bites, and this is an area for future study. We have assumed that antibiotic prescriptions are prescribed and taken by patients, this may not be the case as some were asked to use as a delayed course, in case of deterioration.

Recommendation statement types and clinician implications — strong recommendation (StrRec) means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec) means benefits exceed harms with not-as-strong evidence and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt) means the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) means a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^5b085e47]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Research questions

The IBG identified the following research questions:

How commonly do insect bites present in general practices?
How do patients present to general practices, that is, what consultation modes are used?
What symptoms and signs of bites are recorded?
What treatment options are used?
How does insect bite-related flucloxacillin prescribing compare to practice-level flucloxacillin prescribing?

Design

Our project adopted QI methodsas these allow us to describe, critique, and potentially change current GPC practice. The first step in this approach is to define what we are trying to accomplish in order to generate ideas for change improvement. Our questions, therefore, focus on describing the size of the problem and the scope of current practice.

Sampling frame

We explored the affected population and current service provision by GPCs in our IBG practices. This was a convenience sample of 10 practices, members of the RCGP OD group in England and Wales.

Sample

Identifying all patients presenting with insect bites between the dates of 1st April to 30th September 2021, inclusive, by searching online all consultations using the words "insect bites" coded in participating practices. To identify consultations, inclusion criteria were: first consultation of any person, of any age, presenting with a presumed insect bite to general practices, even if they had contacted a different health care provider previously. Patients with insect bite reactions due to spiders or ticks (arthropods) were included if not Lyme disease, that is, managed as insect bites. It was accepted that it cannot be known whether some "bite" reactions might include vegetation injuries, for example, hogweed contact, but data were cleaned to exclude known stings and other causes.

Exclusion criteria: not first GPC consultations, stings, and illnesses GPCs diagnosed as not due to insect bites, that is, Lyme disease and a patient with shingles. Presentations to out-of-hours (OOH) or walk-in centres were excluded.

### Epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis [^f1add226]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report on epinephrine for first-aid management of anaphylaxis summarizes key points for recognition and community treatment. Anaphylaxis is a severe, generalized allergic or hypersensitivity reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death, and epinephrine can be life-saving when administered as rapidly as possible once anaphylaxis is recognized. Key points include that validated clinical criteria are available to facilitate prompt diagnosis; that prompt intramuscular epinephrine injection in the mid-outer thigh reduces hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality; and that prescribing epinephrine autoinjectors (EAs) facilitates timely epinephrine injection in community settings for patients with a history of anaphylaxis and, if specific circumstances warrant, for some high-risk patients who have not previously experienced anaphylaxis. For infants and young children weighing < 15 kg, especially those who weigh 7.5 kg and under, prescribing epinephrine currently presents a dilemma because the lowest dose available in EAs, 0.15 mg, is a high dose for many infants and some young children. Effective management in the community requires a comprehensive approach involving children, families, preschools, schools, camps, and sports organizations; prevention of anaphylaxis recurrences involves confirmation of the trigger, discussion of specific allergen avoidance, allergen immunotherapy (eg, with stinging insect venom, if relevant), and a written, personalized anaphylaxis emergency action plan; and management also involves education of children and supervising adults about anaphylaxis recognition and first-aid treatment.

Reports of bed bug infestations in major cities in the United States and abroad have been in the public press. Physicians and other clinicians who care for children need to be able to recognize bed bug bites and understand the social, psychological, and medical implications that this diagnosis will have on patients and their families. In this article, a case presentation serves to guide discussion regarding establishing the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and the management of bed bug bites and their complications.

### Pediatric first aid knowledge among parents [^9ad6bc4c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published simple guidelines for the first aid management of ill or injured children. We determined knowledge of these first aid practices in parents.

Methods

Design-Descriptive survey.

Participants

A convenience sample of adult parents presenting to the emergency department.

Survey Instrument

Standardized collection of demographics was performed and adults were given a multiple-choice questionnaire concerning the proper management of stings and bites, burns and scalds, eye injuries, fractures and sprains, fever, head injuries, fainting, poisoning, dental emergencies, nosebleeds, seizures, and skin wounds.

Outcomes

Percentage of adults responding to questions appropriately based on AAP guidelines.

Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics and chi2 tests.

Results

Six hundred fifty-four adults were surveyed. Mean age (SD) was 38.5 (13.8), 56% were female, 69% were white, 56% had at least a high school education. None of those surveyed answered all questions correctly with roughly half being familiar with 60% of the questions. Knowledge of specific guidelines ranged from 21% to 92%. Subjects especially lacked knowledge regarding the need to rapidly remove all bee stingers (only 36% aware); keep wounds moist and covered (79% felt that drying wounds was beneficial); the need to cover victims of large burns (only 43% aware); and the need to seek medical attention after tick bites (only 47% aware). Knowledge was unaffected by age, gender, and education.

Conclusions

Many adults are unfamiliar with AAP first aid measures according to the AAP guidelines and most believe that wounds should be allowed to dry. Further education is required to improve knowledge of first aid practices.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^06036561]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hymenoptera sting allergy, more specifically with respect to venom immunotherapy, assessment for treatment response, AAAAI/ACAAI 2011 guidelines recommend to recognize that the following factors are associated with a higher chance of relapse:

- history of a very severe reaction to a sting

- increased baseline serum tryptase levels

- systemic reactions during venom immunotherapy (to a sting or a venom injection)

- honeybee venom allergy

- treatment duration of < 5 years.

### Intravenous epinephrine overdose in prehospital management of suspected anaphylaxis [^c81e227c]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 65-year-old woman called paramedics for stridor and neck swelling following an insect bite with a possible anaphylactic reaction. On arrival paramedics administered intramuscular epinephrine without any observed improvement in stridor. Paramedics then prepared 5mg of 1:1000 epinephrine for nebulised administration, which was inadvertently given intravenously. The patient developed tachycardia, anxiety and a severe headache, with biochemical evidence of cardiac necrosis without any haemodynamic compromise. The patient recovered over the next 24hours and no long-term sequelae were identified on CT coronary angiogram, electrocardiography (ECG) echocardiography or invasive angiography. This case highlights the risk of cardiac ischaemia during epinephrine administration and the importance of protocols to ensure appropriate dosing. This case also raises questions regarding appropriate management of epinephrine overdose and shines a light on the absence of guidelines on the prevention of complications from epinephrine administration.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^2011478d]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Integrated pest management (IPM) for bed bugs — surveillance, monitoring, and verification are emphasized, noting that identifying and planning for complicating factors when designing a site-specific IPM plan are important and that bed bug populations vary in their level of resistance to pesticide products. If pesticides are used to control bed bugs, it is critical to select those that will be effective against the infestation, and continuing to monitor for pests at the site being treated is a critical element of any IPM-based management program because monitoring provides an objective measure of progress toward the goal of eliminating the infestation. Bites alone are a very poor indicator of an infestation, so using community-wide surveillance to identify bed bug sources and how they move between residences can help target resources, and communities should use IPM best-management practices and reliable surveillance data to verify the presence of living bed bugs when there is a report of bed bugs. Bed bug sightings at schools can help identify potential infestations in the community; however, this information is very sensitive and should be handled discreetly.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^d5f5e218]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

These results highlight a mean incidence of first presentation to general practices of insect bites of 8 per 100,000 population weekly over the 6 months of the study. A studyof 1999–2003 exploring both insect bites and impetigo reported an incidence of 5.4 per 100,000 population of England and Wales over 12 months and as insect bite incidence reduces in the winter our figure is comparable but does not represent additional consultations by alternative primary care providers.

In contrast to NICE guidance,74% of our patients received an oral or topic antibiotic, most commonly flucloxacillin. This choice adheres to guideline recommendations for cellulitisand some prescribing reflected reported patient adverse reactions or allergies. Flucloxacillin for insect bites is, therefore, a small contributor to the rises in flucloxacillin practice prescribing over the summer months. We found a difference between the previously reported idealisation of practice by surveyed GPsand practice-based clinician activity, for example, vital signs were not prime factors in antibiotic prescribing. Either there is a high incidence of cellulitis or there is overprescribing, with scope to improve antibiotic stewardship by exploring management as the next stage of QI. Although a small effect at the level of ten practices, the potential impact on antibiotic stewardship at the UK level is significant.

In addition, most patients still contact their general practices first but meet an expanded clinical team with nurses over a third of consulters. Almost 70% of consultations start by phone and less than 10% are converted to f2f consultations. Images support consultations in just over half of interactions. Most people present 1–7 days post bite, most commonly days 1–3 with common features of redness, itchness, pain, and swelling, July was the peak month. A review of cellulitisgave key symptoms as pain, swelling, and heat, similar to our study, except we also had itching as a key symptom. Only 22% of patients used oral antihistamine before consultation, despite 45.4% complaining of itch. The use of antihistamines, as recommended by NICE, may be an area for improvement, although there is uncertainty about their efficacy in reducing itch or cellulitis complications and this is a priority area for future research. Topical steroids were not commonly used and when used were mainly hydrocortisone cream. There is a need to establish the efficacy and best strength of local steroid to reduce inflammation, and itch and prevent secondary cellulitis.

### Stemming the rising tide of human-biting ticks and tickborne diseases, United States [^a3251f0c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Moreover, selection of specific tick and pathogen suppression methods to include for either backyard control or area-wide tick management will be challenging because the evidence base for existing approaches is reasonably strong for acarologic outcomes (density of host-seeking ticks and pathogen-infected, host-seeking ticks) but extremely weak for human-based outcomes (human–tick encounters and human illness). Initial evaluations of tick and pathogen suppression schemes in an integrated tick-management program would focus on acarologic outcomes; if these were deemed successful, subsequent evaluations should progress to also include human-based outcomes. One major downstream outcome would be improved guidance for best management practices for tick suppression and reduction of human tick bites based on real-world scenarios, which will need to account for local variation in tick species of public health concern needing to be addressed (e.g. only I. scapularis ticks, only A. americanum ticks, or both species). Cost assessments would be critical to clarify the resources needed to either build ticks into an existing mosquito management program or build an integrated tick-management program from the ground up in settings lacking existing mosquito management programs. Finally, the need for adequate funding for operational tick management cannot be overstated; tick management cannot be incorporated into an existing mosquito management program as an unfunded activity or mandate, and a stand-alone tick-management program equally will require substantial and sustained funding.

### Changes in emergency department concordance with guidelines for the management of stinging insect-induced anaphylaxis: 1999–2001 vs 2013–2015 [^dff0cbb4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Changes in emergency department (ED) concordance with guidelines for the management of stinging insect-induced anaphylaxis (SIIA) are not known.

Objective

To describe temporal changes in ED concordance with guidelines for the management of SIIAs.

Methods

We analyzed data from 2 multicenter retrospective studies of patients with stinging insect-related acute allergic reactions seen in 1 of 14 North American EDs during 2 periods: 1999 through 2001 and 2013 through 2015. Visits were identified similarly across studies (eg, using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 989.5, 995.0, and 995.3). Anaphylaxis was defined as an acute allergic reaction with involvement of at least 2 organ systems or hypotension. We compared concordance between periods with 4 guideline recommendations: (1) treatment with epinephrine, (2) discharge prescription for epinephrine auto-injector, (3) referral to an allergist/immunologist, and (4) instructions to avoid the offending allergen.

Results

We compared 182 patients with SIIA during 1999 to 2001 with 204 during 2013 to 2015. Any treatment with epinephrine (before arrival to the ED or in the ED) increased over time (30% vs 49%; P < .001). Prescriptions for epinephrine auto-injector at discharge increased significantly (34% vs 57%; P < .001), whereas documentation of referral to an allergist/immunologist decreased (28% vs 12%; P = 0.002), and instructions to avoid the offending allergen did not change (23% vs 24%; P = 0.94). Receipt of at least 3 guideline recommendations increased over time; however, the comparison was not statistically significant (10% vs 16%; P = 0.15).

Conclusion

During the nearly 15-year study interval, we observed increased ED concordance with epinephrine-related guideline recommendations for the management of SIIA. Reasons for the decrease in allergy/immunology referrals merit further study.

Systemic sting reaction history — patients who have a history of a systemic reaction to an insect sting should be educated in avoidance, should carry epinephrine for emergency self-administration with instruction on indications and administration, should undergo testing for specific IgE antibodies to stinging insects, should be considered for immunotherapy (with insect venom or fire ant WBE) if test results for specific IgE antibodies are positive, and should consider carrying medical identification for stinging insect hypersensitivity.

### Anaphylaxis: recent advances in assessment and treatment [^46fcf774]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

The incidence rate of anaphylaxis is increasing, particularly during the first 2 decades of life. Common triggers include foods, medications, and insect stings. Clinical diagnosis is based on a meticulous history of an exposure or event preceding characteristic symptoms and signs, sometimes but not always supported by a laboratory test such as an elevated serum total tryptase level. Physician-initiated investigation of patients with anaphylaxis whose symptoms and signs are atypical sometimes leads to important insights into previously unrecognized triggers and mechanisms. In idiopathic anaphylaxis, in which no trigger can be confirmed by means of skin testing or measurement of specific IgE, the possibility of mastocytosis or a clonal mast cell disorder must be considered in addition to the possibility of a previously unrecognized trigger. Long-term risk reduction in patients with anaphylaxis focuses on optimal management of relevant comorbidities such as asthma and other respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, and mastocytosis or a clonal mast cell disorder; avoidance of the relevant confirmed allergen trigger; and relevant immunomodulation such as medication desensitization, venom immunotherapy, and possibly in the future, immunotherapy with food. Emergency preparedness for recurrence of anaphylaxis in community settings includes having epinephrine (adrenaline) autoinjectors available, knowing when and how to use them, and having a written, personalized anaphylaxis emergency action plan and up-to-date medical identification. Randomized controlled trials of the pharmacologic interventions used in an acute anaphylaxis episode are needed.

### The global epidemiology, syndromic classification, management, and prevention of spider bites [^8f27cd09]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2004). Low credibility.

Spiders are carnivorous arthropods that coexist with humans and ambush or ensnare prey. Unlike other arthropods, spiders rarely transmit communicable diseases, and play a critical role in the ecosystem by consuming other arthropods that frequently transmit human diseases, such as mosquitoes and flies. There are more than 30,000 species of spiders, most of which are venomous, but they cannot inflict serious bites due to delicate mouthparts and short fangs. The differential diagnosis of spider bites is extensive and includes other arthropod bites, skin infections, and exposure to chemical or physical agents. However, approximately 200 species from 20 genera of spiders worldwide can cause severe human envenomings, with dermonecrosis, systemic toxicity, and death. Spider bites can usually be prevented by simple personal and domestic measures. Early species identification and specific management may help prevent serious sequelae of spider bites.

### Emergency management of difficult wounds: part I [^dd2dac76]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians treat millions of wounds annually in the United States. In 2004 approximately 6.4 million open wounds were seen in United States emergency departments, representing approximately 5.8% of all visits. This article discusses difficult traumatic wounds that emergency physicians encounter on a daily basis, including mammalian bites, puncture and high-pressure wounds, and crush injuries, with special emphasis given to individuals at high risk for infectious complications. Information is provided on epidemiology, pathophysiology, management, and treatment of various complicated wounds. The authors highlight available guidelines, provide the best evidence available, and provide recommendations when data are limited.
