## Question

Olivia bought two packs of basketball cards at $3 each, and 5 decks of baseball cards at $4 each. If she had one $50 bill, how much change did she receive?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much change Olivia received after buying basketball and baseball cards with a $50 bill. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cost of the basketball cards. Then, I should verify the cost of the baseball cards. Next, I will calculate the total expenditure. After that, I need to subtract the total from $50 to find the change. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the basketball card cost: 2 packs at $3 each equals 2 × 3 = $6. Wait, let me verify that multiplication — yes, 2 times 3 is indeed 6 dollars.

> Next, I should review the baseball card cost: 5 decks at $4 each equals 5 × 4 = $20. Hold on, I should verify — 5 times 4 is 20 dollars, correct.

> Now, I will calculate the total amount spent: $6 for basketball cards plus $20 for baseball cards equals $26. I need to ensure I'm adding correctly — 6 + 20 is 26, so the total expenditure is $26.

> Then, I should subtract the total from the amount Olivia paid: $50 minus $26 equals $24. Let me double-check that subtraction — 50 − 26 is 24, so the change should be $24.

> Final answer: Olivia received $24 in change.

Olivia bought 2 packs of basketball cards at $3 each and 5 decks of baseball cards at $4 each, spending a total of $26. She paid with a $50 bill, so her change is **$24**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Basketball cards**: 2 packs × $3 = $6
- **Baseball cards**: 5 decks × $4 = $20
- **Total cost**: $6 + $20 = $26
- **Change**: $50 − $26 = $24

---

Olivia received **$24** in change.

Moreover, if changes in behaviour result from a learning process of the shooting player, susceptibility should be correlated over time. In order to test this prediction, we screened for players who passed our criteria in two seasons. For these players (n = 92), we compared susceptibility in the first season to the susceptibility in the second season. As predicted, susceptibility of players between seasons was positively correlated (r = 0.43, P < 10⁻⁴, t -test). For comparison, the season-to-season 3pt percentage correlation coefficient for these players was 0.41.

Taken together, these analyses suggest that the change in behaviour is at least partially due to processes taking place in the brains of the shooting players.

### Reinforcement learning in professional basketball players [^15c8975b]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Reinforcement learning in complex natural environments is a challenging task because the agent should generalize from the outcomes of actions taken in one state of the world to future actions in different states of the world. The extent to which human experts find the proper level of generalization is unclear. Here we show, using the sequences of field goal attempts made by professional basketball players, that the outcome of even a single field goal attempt has a considerable effect on the rate of subsequent 3 point shot attempts, in line with standard models of reinforcement learning. However, this change in behaviour is associated with negative correlations between the outcomes of successive field goal attempts. These results indicate that despite years of experience and high motivation, professional players overgeneralize from the outcomes of their most recent actions, which leads to decreased performance.

Procedure

The total duration of the experiment was around 30–35 min. Participants had to perform two different tasks in four blocks of 80 trials each, following 12 practice trials per task with performance feedback. Depending on the stimulus colour, they either had to perform the size task, in which they had to categorize the stimulus into being smaller or bigger than a basketball, or the animacy task, in which they had to categorize the stimulus into being animate or inanimate. Participants were instructed that animate referred to any kind of organism, including plants, vegetables and fruits and they were encouraged to respond as fast and accurately as possible. If they responded correctly and within 3000 ms, the stimulus was followed by probabilistic reward feedback. The group rewarded more on incongruent trials would receive a high reward following 90% of all incongruent correct trials and 10% of all congruent correct trials, while receiving the low reward on all other correct trials. This mapping was reversed in the group rewarded more on congruent trials. If participants responded incorrectly, they saw a blank screen for the same amount of time as the reward screen. Between blocks, participants obtained feedback on how much (potential) money they earned within that block. At the end of the experiment, they saw the total amount of money they won, and were asked to fill in the questionnaires.

Outcomes

We measure two pre-registered behavioural outcomes that collectively allow us to measure how people respond to our information treatments in terms of both voice and exit. After the information treatment, all participants are asked to make their final gift card choice from the same six options they were shown earlier. Our main outcome of interest is whether participants 'exit' or switch their gift card preference — that is, whether they select a different gift card after the information treatment than their top choice indicated before the information treatment. To ensure incentive compatibility, participants are (truthfully) told that those randomly selected to receive a gift card will be offered the gift card of their choice at the end of our study. As mentioned above, the probability of being randomly chosen to receive a gift card is 20%. We choose a high probability of receiving a gift card relative to other online experiments since prior work has shown that consumers process choice-relevant information more carefully as realization probability increases. To make the gift card outcome as realistic as possible, we also had a large value gift card (US$25). The focus of our experiments is on single-shot outcomes. While it would have been interesting to capture longer-term effects, the cost of implementing our gift card outcome for a large sample and expenditure on the other studies made a follow-up study cost-prohibitive.

Theoretical considerations suggest that in stationary environments, the speed of adaptation should decrease with experience. However, such change in speed of adaptation has not been reported even in relatively long (400 trials) two-alternative repeated-choice laboratory experiments using the stationary two-armed bandit reward schedule. To test for a change in the speed of adaptation of the basketball players, we checked whether the average susceptibility changes over time. We found no statistically significant difference in the susceptibilities computed for the first and second halves of the season (on average, χ = 0.16 ± 0.01 versus χ = 0.15 ± 0.01, P = 0.19, Monte Carlo permutation test) or the susceptibilities between the first and second season for the 92 players who passed our criteria in two seasons (on average, χ = 0.17 ± 0.02 versus χ = 0.15 ± 0.02, P = 0.15, Monte Carlo permutation test).

Our analysis revealed that the outcome of a 3pt shot substantially affects the behaviour of the player in subsequent FGAs indicates that the player generalized from the state of the game associated with one shot to the state of the game associated with the subsequent shots. One way of implementing such a generalization is to scale up, by the same factor, the values of all 3pts from all states following a made 3pt, and scale down the values of these actions following a missed 3pts. However, applying algorithms that generalize from one state to other states are not guaranteed to improve performance. Indeed, the decrease in 3pt percentage and return associated with an increase in 3pt probability and 3pt rate indicates that the change in players' behaviour following made and missed 3pts is not justified by the statistics of the game. Thus, we hypothesize that despite their extensive training, players may overgeneralize by means of an oversimplified on-line learning processes.

Results

Most experiments leveraged the "tile game", a computer-based task designed to achieve precise control overand(Fig. 1a). On each trial, a tile appears at the center of the screen for a predetermined amount of time. Participants attempt to activate the tile, making it change color, by pressing their spacebar before it disappears. Whether or not the tile is activated determines the probability of receiving a jackpot on the current trial. If a player receives a jackpot, the next screen displays a pleasant image, and $0.10 are added to a bonus fund, which participants receive at the end of the study. If a jackpot is not received, the next screen displays an unpleasant image, and $0 is added to the bonus fund.

### A fresh look at the costs of non-fatal consumer product injuries [^3f846d47]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Products under the purview of the Consumer Product Safety Commission are involved in a large share of injuries and injury costs in the USA.

Methods

This study analyses incidence data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and cost data based on the Injury Cost Model, integrated with the NEISS. We examined the magnitude of non-fatal consumer product related injury, the distribution of products involved in these injuries and the cost of these injuries. We compared these findings with an earlier identical study from 2000.

Results

In 2008–2010, 43.8% of the annual 30.4 million non-fatal injuries treated in hospital emergency departments involved consumer products. Of these consumer product related injuries, in 2009–2010, just three product groups accounted for 77% of the $909 billion annual cost: sports and recreation; home structures and construction materials; and home furnishings and fixtures. Sports and recreation was a leading cause of injury costs among 5-24-year-olds, particularly football, basketball, bicycling, baseball/softball and soccer. Since 1996, football surpassed basketball in becoming the number one cause of injury costs for children aged 10–19 years and the fifth ranked cause of product related injury costs overall. Among those over age 30 years, stairs and floors were a leading cause of consumer product related injury costs, in particular among those over age 70 years where they were responsible for over one-fifth of costs.

Conclusions

The findings of this study highlight priority areas for intervention and generate questions for future research.

Intuitively, the decision of whether or not to attempt a field goal strongly influences the outcome of the possession. This assertion seems to contradict our empirical findings: despite the fact that on average, the rate of 3pts after a made 3pt was 64% higher than that rate after a missed 3pt, the difference in 3pt percentage and 3pt return between the two conditions was only 6%.

This raises the question of why the outcome of a shot is so weakly dependent on the decision of when to make it. We hypothesize that this results from the strategic nature of the game. Consider a player holding the ball who contemplates taking an FGA or passing the ball. This decision can be made by estimating the expected payoffs from the two actions. For simplicity, we assume that the payoff is the return. At the same time, the players on the opposite team attempt to predict the player's decision in order to obstruct it. As the expected returns of the two actions, attempting a field goal or passing the ball, depend on the defensive manoeuvres, the player holding the ball attempts to predict the defensive manoeuvres. Previous studies have demonstrated that such interactions can lead to behaviours that follow a mixed Nash Equilibrium policy. In a mixed Nash Equilibrium, the players choose their actions from a probability distribution, where the expected payoffs of all actions that are in the support of the Nash equilibrium is equal. In this framework, the expected return from passing the ball and attempting the shot are equal. Let us now assume that as a result of a made 3pt, the player believes that attempting a shot is associated with a higher return than passing the ball. This would result in a significant change in his/her behaviour, shifting the policy from a random choice to attempting a shot. However, if the opposing team continues to play its Nash equilibrium policy (that is, they ignore the effect of the made shot on the shooting player's policy), there will be no change in the return of the shooting player because at the Nash equilibrium, the returns from all chosen alternatives are equal. In other words, in general, the decision to attempt a field goal is fundamental to the success of a player in the game. However, if all players choose their actions according to a mixed Nash equilibrium, the return in a shot will be independent of the chosen action (as long as it is in the support of the Nash equilibrium). We view the relatively weak dependence of the 3pt percentage on the rate of 3pts as indicative that the policies used by players in the game are near the Nash Equilibrium.

Examples of probability calculations for coin tosses, based on Pascal's triangle

Impressively, even today, Blaise Pascal's simple triangle can accurately predict probabilities for the Baseball World Series. The World Series is played between two teams as "best out of 7" games. If the opposing team won the first game, there are six games remaining. Row 6 in the triangle depicts 64 (2⁶) possible outcomes (1-6-15-20-15-6-1). The home team will have to win at least four games to secure the title, whereas the opposing team requires only three more victories. There are 22 (1 + 6 + 15) possibilities for the home team to clinch the title (22/64 or 34.4%), compared to 42 (20-15-6-1) options for the opposing team to win three or more games (42/64 or 65.6%). Thus, by carrying a copy of Pascal's antiquated triangle from 1653 in the pocket, a modern person of the twenty-first century can place a safe bet at the sports bar.

### Reinforcement learning in professional basketball players [^81a07e4e]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

The dynamics of learning

In order to study the combined contribution of several events to choice behaviour, we computed the average probability of attempting a 3pt, conditioned on streaks of made 3pts (blue in Fig. 1c) and missed 3pts (red in Fig. 1c). These results indicate that the contribution of multiple successes and failures to behaviour is cumulative. Yet, players predominantly responded to the outcome of the last 3pt shot. To see this, we compared players' probability of attempting a 3pt shot following two consecutive 3pts with opposite outcomes. Given that the last two FGAs were a missed 3pt followed by a made 3pt, the probability of attempting a 3pt is 0.41 ± 0.01. This number is significantly higher than that probability given that the previous two FGAs were a made 3pt followed by a missed 3pt, 0.33 ± 0.01 (P < 10⁻⁷, Monte Carlo permutation test, 326 players). In order to find how long the outcome of a 3pt shot affects players' choice behaviour, we computed the probability of a 3pt shot, conditioned on a made/missed 3pt, n -FGAs ago, where n = 1,2,.7 (blue/red in Fig. 1d). The difference between the red and blue curves indicate that the effect of a 3pt on behaviour diminishes within several FGAs (the difference between the two curves is significant for each of the first six points; P < 0.05, Monte Carlo permutation test).

### How to measure monetary losses in gambling disorder? An evidence-based refinement [^b12290a0]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

3 Results

The mean and median number of DSM-5 criteria fulfilled by the studied sample were, respectively, 7.2 (± 1.3) and 7.0. The mean/median scores for the GSAS were, respectively, 35.3 (± 13.0) and 34.0. The same data for the PG-YBOCS were 20.8 (± 5.1) and 20.0. In light of these scores, the participants of the current study would be classified as moderate according to the DSM-5 and as severe according to the GSAS and The fact that we investigated subjects mainly in the moderate to severe range may explain the high percentage of income (median 40.0%) spent on gambling in our sample. Table 1 reports the main monetary data on our sample.

In terms of the gambling severity scales, two hundred forty-six subjects answered both the GSAS and the PG-YBOCS; one hundred eighteen participants completed the GSAS and twenty-seven answered only the PG-YBOCS. The rho between GSAS and PG-YBOCS was 0.616 (p < 0.001; n = 246), which is considered large by Cohen's (1988) standards. Concerning gambling frequency, the mean and median number of gambling episodes per week were, respectively, 6.75 (± 10.3) and 2.50. With respect to the primary games played by the studied sample, the most frequent forms of gambling were: 1) electronic gaming machines [slots machines, keno, video bingo] (n = 363; 83.3%); 2) card games [poker, blackjack, other card games] (n = 131; 20.2%); 3) lottery (n = 31; 7.1%); 4) pull tabs/scratch cards (n = 30; 6.9%); 5) Video Poker (n = 18; 4,1%); and 6) Bingo (n = 18; 4.1%).

Increasing the frequency of attempting a 3pt after made 3pts and decreasing it after missed 3pts could also make sense if a made/missed 3pts predicted a higher/lower number of points earned by the team. In principle, it is possible that the decrease in 3pt percentage after a made 3pt is offset by other factors, such as an increased likelihood of getting the offensive rebound. In order to address this possibility, we considered the 3pt return, defined here as the average number of points gained by the offensive team from the time of the 3pt shot until the time that the opposing team got hold of the ball. Similar to the conditional 3pt percentage, the 3pt return immediately after a made 3pt was lower than after a missed 3pt (1.27 ± 0.02 versus 1.34 ± 0.02, P < 0.01, Monte Carlo permutation test, 331 players). As was the case for 3pt percentage, the difference between 3pt returns following a streak of made 3pts and a streak of missed 3pts increased with the length of the streak (Fig. 3b).

A change in the frequency of attempting a 3pt could have been justified if the outcome of 3pt shot was anticorrelated with the outcome of the following 2pt shot. However, there is no such effect: the 2pt percentage, following a made/missed 3pt was 0.460 ± 0.005/0.468 ± 0.004 (P > 0.16, Monte Carlo permutation test) and the 2pt return, following a made/missed 3pt was 1.20 ± 0.01/1.22 ± 0.01 (P > 0.08, Monte Carlo permutation test).

Moreover, the changes in percentage and return that we observed were restricted to the shooting player: the 3pt percentage of other teammates immediately after a made/missed 3pt of a player was 0.366 ± 0.009/0.349 ± 0.006 (P > 0.11, Monte Carlo permutation test); the 3pt return of other teammates immediately after a made/missed 3pt of a player was 1.29 ± 0.03/1.25 ± 0.02 (P > 0.22, Monte Carlo permutation test). These results suggest that players attempt too many 3pt shots after a made 3pt, and too few after a missed 3pt.

### The neural computation of inconsistent choice behavior [^dd0796dd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Behavior

Subjects made choices from linear budgets in the context of risk (following Choi et al.)inside the fMRI scanner. On each trial, subjects were presented with a set of 50/50 lotteries between two accounts, X and Y, and were asked to choose their preferred lottery (bundle). All possible lotteries in a given trial were represented along a budget line. The price ratios (slopes of the budget lines) and endowments were randomized across trials and subjects (Fig. 2, see the Methods section).

Fig. 2
Experimental task (following Choi et al.). a A Trial: Subjects were presented a visualization of a budget line with 50/50 lotteries between two accounts, labeled X and Y. Each point on the budget line represents a different lottery between the X and Y accounts. Subjects used a trackball to choose their preferred lottery (a bundle of the X and Y accounts) out of all possible lotteries along the line. For example, as depicted in Fig. 2a, the bundle (11,72) corresponds to a lottery with a 50% chance to win 11 tokens (account X), and a 50% chance to win 72 tokens (account Y), where 1 token equals 5 NIS (~$1.5). We varied and randomized the budget lines (slopes and endowments) across trials and subjects. At the end of the experiment, one trial was randomly selected as well as one of the accounts. The subject received the tokens she had allocated to the selected account in the selected trial. b Behavioral example: Given this budget line, the subject could choose A (10,35) with a 50% chance of winning 10 tokens (account X) and 50% chance of winning 35 tokens (account Y); or similarly, B (45,10). An extremely risk-seeking subject would choose C, the lottery with the maximal expected payoff, yielding a 50% chance of winning 60 tokens and a 50% chance of winning nothing. By contrast, an extremely risk-averse subject would choose D, the intersection with the 45-degree line. This bundle is a degenerate lottery, which allocates the same number of tokens for both X and Y accounts. c Timeline: Inside the scanner, subjects had a maximum of 12 s time window to make their choice, followed by a 9 s variable ITI. If subjects made a choice before the end of the 12 s time window, the remaining time was added to the ITI. There were 27 trials in each block, 4 blocks, for a total of 108 trials. Subjects completed a pre-scan questionnaire (see Supplementary Note 7 for an English version) and a practice block with a trackball outside the scanner to make sure the instructions and procedures were clear

### Common sports injuries: incidence and average charges-ASPE… [^b60d3f27]. aspe.hhs.gov (2014). Low credibility.

The most common basketball injuries, for example, are leg fractures, and ankle or knee sprains. More than 570, 000 basketball injuries were treated in emergency departments in 2012. The average charges for an adult range from $2, 294 for a sprain to $7, 666 for an arm fracture – amounts that individuals without health insurance, especially those who were not expecting to have any medical expenses, may have trouble paying out of pocket. This issue brief describes the prevalence and cost of selected sports injuries. Direct Medical Charges for Injuries 5 For 25- to 40-year-olds, the estimated average charges for a leg fracture were about $3, 403, while the estimated average charges for an arm fracture were about $7, 666, according to 2009–2011 pooled data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey.

For leg fractures, 5 percent resulted in medical bills about 4 times greater than the per person average, while for arm fractures, 5 percent resulted in medical bills 7 times greater than the average. For those without health insurance, these could be substantial unexpected bills. Among adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 years, the estimated average charge for a leg fracture was about $4, 700, while the estimated average charge for an arm fracture was about $2, 900. For leg fractures, 5 percent resulted in medical bills 8 times greater than the average, while for arm fractures, 5 percent resulted in medical bills 4 times greater than the average. Estimated charges for dislocations among 10- to 19-year-olds averaged $6, 900 and almost $4, 600 for 25 to 40 year olds. 5 The charge estimates are derived using 2009–2011 pooled data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Full Year Consolidated, Events, and Medical Conditions files.

The amounts listed are full established charges for an event before any adjustments or discounts, which a provider could potentially charge an uninsured patient. The amounts were adjusted to 2011 dollars using Consumer Price Index. The incidence and expenses associated with common sports injuries demonstrate that even healthy and active adults can experience unanticipated and unaffordable health care costs. Fortunately, health care coverage is available at https: //www. healthcare. gov/andmanyuninsuredAmericansqualifyforfinancialhelppayingforhealthinsuranceundertheAffordableCareAct. 6.

Task overview

Participants played our novel task, 'The Fisherman Game' shown in Fig. 1. Participants were told that they would be earning money, in fictional yen ¥, by catching fish. To catch fish, participants pressed the down arrow key on a keyboard. This action, 'a tap', required minimal effort and the force of tapping was not relevant to outcome. Every time they pressed down, they 'caught' a fish. The number of yen earned for each fish was displayed on the screen next to a fish icon. This value changed every 12–13 s and was drawn at random from a set of 6 numbers ranging from ¥0.1 to ¥2.5. When the price changed participants also heard a bell to alert them to the change in price to minimise effects of poor attention. As this task was designed to test the timing of self-initiated behaviour, the screen was static and there were no prompts to initiate actions.

Fig. 1.
Overview of task design. (a) Following assessment of maximum tapping speed, instructions and training, participants completed two counterbalanced environments in which they earned ¥ for fish caught with key presses: high OCT and low OCT environment indicated by the monetary value of ¥3000 (£4 or £0.50) and the colour of the water (blue water representing high value and white water representing low value). When not pressing to catch fish, nothing on screen prompted action. To register that a fish was caught, the angle of the fish graphic changed by 45°. A bell sounded each time the price for fish changed. Information regarding environments and range of fish prices was present on screen at all times. The price of the fish changed every 12–13 s and prices were randomly drawn from a set of six prices ranging from ¥0.1–¥2.5 per fish. Each price was seen four times in an environment and the order of prices was the same in both environments but randomly generated for each participant. (b) Six times in each environment, the participant' fishing rod broke. To fix it they were required to repeatedly tap an alternative button, for no immediate reward and for a fixed number of times. While the rod was broken, no price was displayed on screen; instead, participants saw a large red cross which decreased in size with every tap. Time within the task was not stopped while the rod was being fixed and participants were aware of this.

### Bayesian nonparametric models characterize instantaneous strategies in a competitive dynamic game [^6bfb9e98]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Gaussian process models

Observed data for each trial were movement trajectories for the puck and the bar, each spanning approximately 1.5 s (94–96 discrete time points). While it is possible to model these time series directly, we observed that puck trajectories could be reduced to a series of straight-line segments of near-maximal velocity separated by change points (Fig. 2a). That is, we could redefine the decision available to the participant at each moment as whether or not to switch direction. This transforms a time-series modeling problem into a more tractable change point prediction problem, for which our predictors are a small number of game state variables.

### Mitigating a COVID-19 outbreak among major league baseball players-United States, 2020 [^ae13227c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Mass gatherings have been implicated in higher rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and many sporting events have been restricted or canceled to limit disease spread (1). Based on current CDC COVID-19 mitigation recommendations related to events and gatherings (2), Major League Baseball (MLB) developed new health and safety protocols before the July 24 start of the 2020 season. In addition, MLB made the decision that games would be played without spectators. Before a three-game series between teams A and B, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health was notified of a team A player with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19; the player was isolated as recommended (2). During the series and the week after, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was diagnosed among 19 additional team A players and staff members and one team B staff member. Throughout their potentially infectious periods, some asymptomatic team A players and coaches, who subsequently received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, engaged in on-field play with teams B and C. No on-field team B or team C players or staff members subsequently received a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Certain MLB health and safety protocols, which include frequent diagnostic testing for rapid case identification, isolation of persons with positive test results, quarantine for close contacts, mask wearing, and social distancing, might have limited COVID-19 transmission between teams.

Sensitivity to opponent actions

We next sought to quantify how much participants' switching behavior changed as a function of the opponent's actions. Because our change point policy model is based on a smooth Gaussian Process, we can quantify this sensitivity using gradients of the GP f = Φ⁻¹(π) with respect to the opponent's position and velocity (see Methods). We then used these gradients to define a moment-by-moment sensitivity index. Since the gradients of the GP measure the degree to which small changes in the current game state affect the participant's probability of changing course, gradients with respect to the opponent's position and velocity capture the degree to which the participant's current behavior is sensitive to the opponent's actions.

Just as switch probability changes dynamically with game state, sensitivity to opponent action varies throughout the trial. Figure 3a illustrates this for a single subject. In order to quantify this, we asked whether participants' sensitivity differed depending on opponent, and whether this effect changed during the trial. As shown in Fig. 3b, most subjects (71%) were consistently more sensitive to one of the opponents in both phases of the trial. The few subjects who appear in the off-diagonal quadrants exhibited greater sensitivity to one opponent early and the other late. Thus, sensitivity-based metrics not only offer a precise characterization of variability in player strategies, but they also capture differences in play against each opponent.

### Editorial commentary: load management is essential to prevent season-ending injuries in the national basketball association [^11b50d03]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Each season, National Basketball Association (NBA) athletes subject themselves to a physical season including a minimum of 82 games, intense travel, participation during holidays, innumerable training sessions, and for some, playoffs continuing into June. Intensity and fatigue may contribute to a high rate of injuries, and recent literature has suggested that primary risk factors for season-ending injuries are minutes played per game and later season games. Scheduled periods of rest, or load management, reduce the physiological load a player endures during a grueling season. Disadvantages of load management may include decrements in individual skill, team competitiveness, and financial issues, including disappointed fans. Thus, in 2023, the NBA instituted the Player Participation Policy (PPP) placing stipulations on load management by asking teams to balance player rest between home and away games and to refrain from long-term shutdowns of player participation for nonmedical reasons. From a medical standpoint, safeguarding athlete health is of paramount importance. Managing the workload of NBA players may have numerous player benefits and must be achieved while mitigating the disadvantages.

### Reinforcement learning in professional basketball players [^fc42829e]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

The timing of FGAs is exponentially distributed

So far we considered players' behaviour as a sequence of 2pt and 3pt attempts. In this framework, we quantified how past experience changes the probability that the next shot is a 3pt. This is reminiscent of standard two-alternative repeated-choice experiments, in which the course of the experiment is divided into discrete trials and a single binary decision is made on every trial. However in basketball, the identity of the FGA, 2pt or 3pt is determined by the player's physical location. Therefore, at any particular point in time, a player does not choose between taking a 2pt and a 3pt shot. Rather, the player holding the ball chooses between attempting a field goal or not attempting one (for example, the player can move or pass the ball). In that sense, the game of basketball is more similar to free-operant procedures, in which animals choose between freely available alternatives. To better understand the nature of decision making in basketball, we considered the timing of the FGAs of 204 NBA players for whom we could reliably determine this information (Methods). For each player, we computed the distribution of time durations between successive 2pt shots and between successive 3pt shots. We denote these durations as inter-2pt-intervals (I2Is) and inter-3pt-intervals (I3Is), respectively. Histograms of MVP I2Is and I3Is in the 2007–2008 season appear in Figure 4a. The coefficients of variation (CV) of the I2Is and I3Is distributions are CV₂ = 0.94 and CV₃ = 1.08, respectively. These values are suggestive of an exponential distribution (for which CV = 1). Indeed, both histograms are well approximated by an exponential function (red lines in Fig. 4a). To further study the shape of the inter-shot-interval distributions, we considered the histograms of I2Is and I3Is of all players in our dataset. As the rates of FGAs of different players vary, we scaled the histograms of individual players by multiplying them by the rates of 2pt and 3pt shots, respectively, and averaged over all histograms (Methods). The normalized I2I and I3I distributions are depicted in Figure 4b (black lines) as 'survival plots': the fraction of intervals longer than an interval length, as a function of the length of the interval, for I2Is (left) and I3Is (right). In an exponential distribution, the fraction of intervals longer than a given interval decreases exponentially with the interval. Hence, the logarithm of the surviving fraction is a linearly decreasing function of the interval. The almost straight black lines in Figure 4b imply that similar to MVP's histograms, the distribution I2Is and I3Is in the population of players is also well approximated by an exponential function (note the logarithmic scale of the ordinates in 3B). Moreover, the CV for the population I2Is and I3Is distributions, CV₂ = 0.93 and CV₃ = 0.89, are also consistent with our observation that the distributions of I2Is and I3Is are approximately exponential.

### Reinforcement learning in professional basketball players [^ffc2a853]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

In order to demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the learning behaviour, we considered MVP's behaviour in the 2007–2008 season. The parameters that best characterize his behaviour in that season are η₂ = 2.7×10⁻⁷, η₃ = 0.27, β = 1.02 and b = −1.28. Using equation. (2), we computed the trajectories of the values of 2pt and 3pt attempts, and using equation (3), the predicted probability of 3pt attempts. These probabilities are plotted in Figure 2 for 24 games taken from the middle of the season (red). In order to compare this prediction to the actual choices, we estimated the instantaneous probability of a 3pt attempt by convolving a Gaussian filter with the sequence of FGAs (a vector in which '1' indicated a 3pt attempt and '0' indicated a 2pt attempt; blue line).

### Reading the clock: how purkinje cells decode the phase of olivary oscillations [^c8d10bfe]. Neuron (2009). Low credibility.

Climbing fiber responses in cerebellar Purkinje cells are described as being invariant. In this issue of Neuron, Mathy et al. show that the complex spike waveform changes with the number of spikes in a climbing fiber burst, which depends on the phase of olivary oscillations. In turn, different complex spike profiles affect synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. Thus, information on inferior olive oscillation states is reflected in both the complex spike waveform and the parallel fiber input gain.

Computing returns

The return of an FGA was computed by considering all points gained by the team of the shooting player from the time of the FGA until the opposing team got hold of the ball. To compute this number, we took into consideration FGAs, offensive fouls, turnovers and the end of quarters.

Statistical procedures

All statistical analyses were within-player: the numbers were computed separately for each player and then were averaged over the players, giving equal weight to each player in the average; averages reported are accompanied by the s.e.m. In some cases, the number could not be computed for a player and the player was omitted from the analysis. In those cases we report the number of players analysed. For example, only 164 players had at least one streak of three made 3pt shots followed by another FGA and at least one streak of three missed 3pt shots followed by another FGA. Therefore, only those 164 players are reported in Figure 1c.

When computing the statistical significance of results averaged over a population of players, we performed the following Monte Carlo permutation test: independently for each player in each season, we computed the empirical distribution of FGAs and their outcome: number of made and missed 2pt and 3pt shots and the empirical distribution of 2pt and 3pt returns. When considering the effect of an FGA on subsequent behaviour, we replaced, for each player, the subsequent FGAs with FGAs drawn from the player's empirical distribution and averaged over all players. Similarly, when considering the effect of an FGA on the subsequent 2pt and 3pt percentages and return, we replaced the outcome of the subsequent 2pt/3pt with surrogate outcomes drawn from the player's 2pt/3pt percentages and return and averaged over all players. Each reported P -value indicates the number of times out of 10⁷ repetitions of this procedure in which the difference in the averages obtained from surrogate data exceeded the difference in the averages for the original data.

For the analysis of players' teammates, we considered all the teammates as if they were a single player and proceeded using the same procedure described above.

### Use of personal hearing protection devices at loud athletic or entertainment events among adults-United States, 2018 [^3f3b596f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Sound intensity at recreational events can reach hazardous levels and might remain high for the duration of the event, thereby increasing the risk for hearing damage. To protect the public health and welfare, in 1974 the Environmental Protection Agency determined that a 24-hour exposure limit level of 70 decibels (dB) would produce minimal hearing loss in 96% of the population. * In 1999, the World Health Organization Guidelines for Community Noise concluded that a 24-hour equivalent sound level of ≤ 70 dB would avoid hearing impairment in 95% of persons, even over a lifetime of exposure. †

In an assessment of noise exposure at college basketball games, attendees wearing dosimeters at a midsized arena were exposed to average sound levels over 98 dB, with peak levels ranging from 127.5 to 138.3 dB. Other investigators reported sound level measurements at arenas hosting hockey games ranging from 81 to 96 dB, with peak sound levels from 105 to 124 dB. In another investigation, recorded instantaneous peak sound levels of up to 140 dB during college football games were reported. As recommended by the National Hearing Conservation Association, persons exposed to high levels of sounds can limit their risk by using a personal HPD, increasing distance from the source, and by taking quiet breaks to reduce their overall sound exposure.

CDC analyzed data from the 2018 SpringStyles, a cross-sectional, national online marketing survey conducted by Porter Novelli via the KnowledgePanel of the market research firm Growth for Knowledge. § Panel members were randomly recruited by mail using probability-based sampling by address to reach respondents regardless of whether they had landline telephones or Internet access. If needed, households were provided with a laptop or tablet computer and Internet access. During March 21–April 11, 2018, a random sample of 10,904 panelists received an initial SpringStyles survey covering a wide range of personal health-related conditions, knowledge, and attitudes. Panelists who did not answer at least half of the questions or who completed the survey in ≤ 5 minutes were removed, resulting in a response rate of 58.9%. Panelists who completed the survey received a cash-equivalent reward worth approximately $5. To match U.S. population proportions, participant responses were weighted to March 2017 U.S. Census estimates on eight selected demographic variables: age, census region, education, sex, household income, household size, metro status, and race/ethnicity.

### Children strategically decide what to practice [^1ba50d5f]. Child Development (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjusting practice to different goals and characteristics is key to learning, but its development remains unclear. Across 2 preregistered experiments, 190 4-to-8-year-olds (106 female; mostly White; data collection: December 2021-September 2022) and 31 adults played an easy and a difficult game, then chose one to practice before a test on either the easy, difficult, or a randomly chosen game. All children adjusted their active practice choices to condition. When the test game was known, they practiced that game. However, when the test game was randomly chosen, only children 6+ and adults practiced the difficult game, while younger children only showed a trending effect. This suggests that the ability to prepare for uncertainty may develop between ages 4 and 6.

Results

Overall task performance

To characterize overall task performance and differences across cohorts in the Patent Race game (Fig. 1b), we first examined the extent to which participants' likelihood of changing their choices on a round-by-round basis was affected by received and foregone payoff in each round (Fig. 2a). In particular, this analysis captures the idea from previous theoretical and empirical studies showing that whereas behavior of pure reinforcement learners should be sensitive only to received payoffs, belief-based learners will be in addition sensitive to foregone payoffs.

Fig. 2
Overall task performances. a Illustration for the received and forgone payoff. The received payoff reflects the amount of reward obtained through the action chosen by the subject, whereas the maximal forgone payoff reflects the amount of reward one could have received by choosing the best available action given the opponent's decision. For example, if the subject chose 5 and the opponent 0, the maximal forgone payoff was 14, as the optimal action would have been to invest 1, as opposed to the received payoff 10. Had the opponent chosen 3, however, the received payoff would remain to be 10 but the maximal payoff would be 11, as choosing 4 would have been the best strategy. Thus, the maximal forgone payoff reflects the variability in opponents' actions and their effects on possible outcomes. Following previous studies, regret is defined as the distance between the maximal forgone and received payoff, given the opponent's decision on a particular trial. b Stay/switch frequency versus received payoff (left) or regret (right).

C.1 Price increases on SSB

Description of studies contributing data to this comparison

We included three ITS studies on price increases on SSB (Blake 2018; Breeze 2018; Cornelsen 2017).

In Blake 2018, prices of red‐labelled beverages (including SSB and sugar‐sweetened milk, as well as fruit juices larger than 250 mL per unit) sold in a convenience store were raised by 20%, and leaflets explaining the intervention were given to customers inquiring about the price increase. Effects on sales of red‐, amber‐ and green‐labelled beverages, as well as on total beverage revenue were assessed with routinely‐collected sales data during a 122‐week (approx. 28 months) baseline period and a 17‐week intervention phase. The intervention was implemented in one convenience store located on the premises of a public hospital in Melbourne, Australia.

In Breeze 2018, prices of SSB sold in public leisure centres were raised by GBP 0.20 (approximately EUR 0.23 or USD 0.27), equivalent to a price increase of 11% to 25%. Further intervention components included "staff training in order to deliver face to face awareness of the scheme with customers; publicity in local and national media; publicity within venues including posters, billboards and drinks stickers in café and vending areas". Effects on sales of SSB, diet beverages, water and fruit juice, and total cold beverage sales were assessed with routinely‐collected sales data during an 18‐month baseline period and a 12‐month intervention phase. The intervention was implemented in seven public leisure centres in Sheffield, UK.

### Bayesian nonparametric models characterize instantaneous strategies in a competitive dynamic game [^d8af7dcf]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Sensitivity metrics characterize behavior

The sensitivity metric defined above represents a particular moment-by-moment measure of the degree to which one player (the participant) is coupled to the actions of the other (the opponent). Based on our prior expectation, we chose a combination of sensitivities to opponent position and velocity, but other combinations are equally plausible. In fact, one could define a sensitivity metric to each input variable individually. Here, we show that such an approach produces a principled characterization of participants' behavior across multiple timescales. Indeed, when aggregated at the participant level, these indices fully characterize the policy model.

We defined one sensitivity for each input variable equal to the square of the gradient along each input direction (see Methods). This yielded eight new sensitivity indices (seven for state plus one for opponent identity) in addition to the opponent action sensitivity defined above. However, our previous index can be defined in terms of these new indices, so there are only eight unique values in the set. The most important feature of these new indices is that, like the policy, they are defined moment-by-moment, but can be aggregated across multiple levels of granularity, including trial and participant averages. As in classic analysis of variance (ANOVA), we can consider each index value at each data point as the sum of three terms: a participant-level mean, a trial-level offset from this mean, and a residual specific to the data point. Likewise, we can estimate variances within trial (residual), across trials, and across our participant population. As in ANOVA, the sum of these variances, appropriately weighted, equals the total variance in the data. Normalizing by this total variance yields a set of three positive terms that sums to 1:To illustrate this decomposition, we plot the trial- and subject-level variance for each predictor variable in Fig. 4a. We find that the subjects' strategies, as summarized by the baseline probability of switching, exhibit the largest variance across participants, indicating that the differences in change point frequency apparent in Fig. 1c, d are relatively more trait-like than our sensitivity measures. Perhaps surprisingly, while the sensitivities to opponent position and velocity demonstrate relatively little across-subject variance, the aggregated metric defining opponent action sensitivity has more across-subject variability, suggesting a more stable index. To test whether these effects could be the result of chance, we ran a permutation test in which we performed the variance decomposition analysis 1000 times with the trial and subject labels shuffled. These results, plotted in gray, tightly cluster around 0% for every variable. That is, our sensitivity indices in all cases account for significant variance in the data.

### Spending more, doing more, or both? An alternative method for quantifying utilization during hospitalizations [^b04751db]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Because relative value unit (RVU)-based costs vary across hospitals, it is difficult to use them to compare hospital utilization.

Objective

To compare estimates of hospital utilization using RVU-based costs and standardized costs.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting and Patients

Years 2009 to 2010 heart failure hospitalizations in a large, detailed hospital billing database that contains an itemized log of costs incurred during hospitalization.

Intervention

We assigned every item in the database with a standardized cost that was consistent for that item across all hospitals.

Measurements

Standardized costs of hospitalization versus RVU-based costs of hospitalization.

Results

We identified 234 hospitals with 165,647 heart failure hospitalizations. We observed variation in the RVU-based cost for a uniform "basket of goods" (10th percentile cost $1,552; 90th percentile cost of $3,967). The interquartile ratio (Q75/Q25) of the RVU-based costs of a hospitalization was 1.35 but fell to 1.26 after costs were standardized, suggesting that the use of standardized costs can reduce the "noise" due to differences in overhead and other fixed costs. Forty-six (20%) hospitals had reported costs of hospitalizations exceeding standardized costs (indicating that reported costs inflated apparent utilization); 42 hospitals (17%) had reported costs that were less than standardized costs (indicating that reported costs underestimated utilization).

Conclusions

Standardized costs are a novel method for comparing utilization across hospitals and reduce variation observed with RVU-based costs. They have the potential to help hospitals understand how they use resources compared to their peers and will facilitate research comparing the effectiveness of higher and lower utilization.

Results

A total of 144 cases were reviewed with a similar number and type of surgeries in the pre-intervention (n = 74) and post-intervention (n = 70) groups (p = 0.95) (table 1). The intervention resulted in a significant reduction in billing inaccuracies, with a decrease from 67.6% (50/74) pre-intervention to 37.1% (26/70) post-intervention (p < 0.001). There was a higher rate of overcharges in the pre-intervention group as compared with the post-intervention group (54.1% vs 20.0%; p < 0.001). In the inaccurate billing cases, the average mischarge by case was examined. The intervention decreased the average mischarges with a pre-intervention overcharge of $224.30 and a post-intervention undercharge of -$85.92 per case (p = 0.009). There were two notable outliers in recent cases where no instruments were charged at all, both of which involved the same nurse who was relatively new to the practice.

Three experiments examined 3- to 6-year-olds' interference control using a task in which children saw 2 corresponding sets of colored cards, a large set in front of them and a small set behind them. A colored candy (Smartie) was placed on a large card with mismatching color, and children could win the Smartie by selecting the small card that matched the color of the large card. Three-year-olds performed poorly whereas older children performed well. Having children label the correct color before responding improved 3-year-olds' performance (Experiment 2), as did pointing to the large card (Experiment 3); decreasing the affective salience of the stimuli (colored beads vs. Smarties) did not (Experiment 3). Results reveal the role of selective attention in action control.

### Encoding of oscillations by axonal bursts in inferior olive neurons [^8ab30bf3]. Neuron (2009). Low credibility.

Inferior olive neurons regulate plasticity and timing in the cerebellar cortex via the climbing fiber pathway, but direct characterization of the output of this nucleus has remained elusive. We show that single somatic action potentials in olivary neurons are translated into a burst of axonal spikes. The number of spikes in the burst depends on the phase of subthreshold oscillations and, therefore, encodes the state of the olivary network. These bursts can be successfully transmitted to the cerebellar cortex in vivo, having a significant impact on Purkinje cells. They enhance dendritic spikes, modulate the complex spike pattern, and promote short-term and long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses in a manner dependent on the number of spikes in the burst. Our results challenge the view that the climbing fiber conveys an all-or-none signal to the cerebellar cortex and help to link learning and timing theories of olivocerebellar function.

### Patients with basal ganglia damage show preserved learning in an economic game [^c9b2bb0e]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Specifically, in the Patent Race, players of two types, Strong and Weak, are randomly matched at the beginning of each round and compete for a prize by choosing an investment (in integer amounts) from their respective endowments. The player who invests more wins the prize, and the other loses. In the event of a tie, both lose the prize. Regardless of the outcome, players lose the amount that they invested. In the particular payoff structure we use, the prize is worth 10 units, and the Strong (Weak) player is endowed with 5 (4) units (Fig. 1b).

Substantial evidence has shown that learning in economic games including the Patent Race can be parsimoniously explained using two learning rules across a wide-range of strategic contexts and experimental conditions: (i) reinforcement-based learning (RL) through trial and error, and (ii) belief-based learning through anticipating and responding to actions of others. In particular, RL models posit that learning is driven by a prediction error defined as the difference between expected and received rewards and have been highly successful in connecting behavior to the underlying neurobiology. In contrast, belief-based learning posits that players make use of knowledge of the structure of the game to update value estimates of available actions and comes in two computationally equivalent interpretations. One interpretation assumes the existence of latent beliefs and requires players to form and update first-order beliefs regarding the likelihood of future actions of opponents. Specifically, under this interpretation, the model posits that players select actions strategically by best responding to their beliefs about future strategies of opponents and update these beliefs by using some weighted history of opponents' choices. Mathematically, players engaging in belief learning correspond to Bayesian learners who believe opponent's play is drawn from a fixed but unknown distribution and whose prior beliefs take the form of a Dirichlet distribution. Under the alternative interpretation, beliefs and mental models are not assumed and action values are updated directly by reinforcing all actions proportional to their foregone (or fictive) rewards. The equivalence of these two mathematical interpretations thus makes it clear that belief-based learning does not necessarily imply the learning of mental, verbalizable beliefs commonly referred to in the cognitive and social sciences, because specific beliefs about likely strategies of opponents are sufficient but not necessary for this type of learning.

Outcomes of Reaching Out to Billing Offices

For 32 (95% CI, 13.7%-32.8%) respondents (21.8%) who reported that their household reached out about a household bill, their problem was not solved yet (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Among the remaining respondents, nothing changed for 30.6% (95% CI, 19.7%-44.2%) of them. One-third (32.9%; 95% CI, 21.8%-46.4%) had a bill corrected and 23.2% (95% CI, 13.2%-37.6%) reported a better understanding of their bill. Many received financial relief in the forms of bill cancellation (9.3%; 95% CI, 2.7%-27.9%), financial assistance (10.4%; 95% CI, 4.4%-22.5%), price reduction (19.4%; 95% CI, 10.7%-32.7%), and/or setting up a payment plan (19.8%; 95% CI, 11.1%-32.9%). These outcomes are not mutually exclusive; many respondents reported multiple outcomes.

We evaluated resolutions stratified by the bill problem and reasons for reaching out (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Among 34 participants who could not afford their bill and reached out, 14 (49.0%; 95% CI, 26.3%-72.0%) received financial aid, bill cancellation, and/or price reductions. An additional 11 (26.8%; 95% CI, 11.5%-50.8%) received a payment plan. Overall, 75.8% of the respondents who could not afford their bill and reached out received some form of financial relief. Among 37 participants who thought their bill was too high because of a mistake and reached out, 25 (73.7%; 95% CI, 50.2%-88.7%) had their bill corrected. Among 14 participants who reached out wanting to negotiate the price, 10 (61.8%; 95% CI, 10.6%-76.3%) reported that the price was reduced.

### Encoding of oscillations by axonal bursts in inferior olive neurons [^8d77ed91]. Neuron (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

Inferior olive neurons regulate plasticity and timing in the cerebellar cortex via the climbing fiber pathway, but direct characterization of the output of this nucleus has remained elusive. We show that single somatic action potentials in olivary neurons are translated into a burst of axonal spikes. The number of spikes in the burst depends on the phase of subthreshold oscillations and, therefore, encodes the state of the olivary network. These bursts can be successfully transmitted to the cerebellar cortex in vivo, having a significant impact on Purkinje cells. They enhance dendritic spikes, modulate the complex spike pattern, and promote short-term and long-term plasticity at parallel fiber synapses in a manner dependent on the number of spikes in the burst. Our results challenge the view that the climbing fiber conveys an all-or-none signal to the cerebellar cortex and help to link learning and timing theories of olivocerebellar function.

### Impact of 12-s rule on performance and muscle damage of baseball pitchers [^7bcd1514]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

A recent US Major League Baseball (MLB) rule change requires baseball pitchers to deliver pitches within 12 s.

Purposes

To examine the effect of three between-pitch rest intervals on throwing performance during a simulated seven-inning game and muscle damage during postgame recovery.

Design

A randomized counterbalanced study.

Methods

Seven intercollegiate pitchers threw 15 pitches per inning for seven innings with rest interval trials of 8, 12, and 20 s between pitches and 5 min between innings. Pitchers threw aimed fastballs at their best effort. Trials were separated by ≥ 2 wk.

Results

Progressive decreases in pitching speed and accuracy below baseline (first inning of 20-s trial) occurred after fourth inning during the 8-s and 12-s trials, but not the 20-s trial. Plasma creatine kinase elevated 48 h later for the 8-s and 12-s trials (+105% and +75%, P < 0.01), but not the 20-s trial (+26%, no significance). A transient interleukin (IL)-6 surges immediately after the game for the 8- and 12-s trials (+265%, +128%, P < 0.01) above baseline. IL-6 reversed below the level of 20-s trial at 48 h after game, whereas IL-10 increased significantly above the level of 20-s trial.

Conclusions

Under the same pitching load, decreasing rest interval from 20 to 12 s or less results in an early-onset performance loss during a game and increases in muscle damage and inflammation for more than 2 d after a game. Our data do not favor the current rule change in concern of keeping musculoskeletal health of pitchers.

### Bayesian nonparametric models characterize instantaneous strategies in a competitive dynamic game [^2355986f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Participants

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical Center. Data from 82 healthy volunteers (age range: 18–48 years; 45 females; 37 males) were included in the behavioral analyses. All participants gave written informed consent to participate in this experiment and were informed that no deception would be used throughout the experiment. Two long-term participants played the role of the human opponent in the penalty shot task, but each participant played against only one human opponent. The human opponents were not members of the study team and had no stake in the outcome of the study apart from maximizing their own compensation. Participants were told that on each trial they would play against either the human opponent they had met with during the consenting process, or against a computer algorithm. We emphasized to participants that deception would not be used in our task regarding who they were in fact playing against (i.e. when the task indicated they would play against the computer opponent next, they would indeed play against the computer). Our task was incentive-compatible: both the experimental participant and the human opponent were rewarded in monetary bonuses that were dependent on how frequently each player won.

Participants began the experiment with a 4 min practice block followed by three experimental blocks, each ~12 min long. Participants played as many trials as they could within each 12 min block, resulting in roughly 200 trials in total for each participant (~100 trials per opponent condition). At the beginning of each trial, each participant was prompted to center the joystick in order for the next trial to begin. A centered fixation cross was then presented for a jittered amount of time, ranging from 1.0 to 7.5 s. Following the fixation cross, the identity of the opponent on the upcoming trial (either "Computer" or the name of the human opponent) was displayed in centered text for 2 s. Each trial lasted roughly 1.5 s. Following the end of a trial, centered text displaying "WIN" or "LOSS" would appear on-screen, indicating the previous trial's outcome. Following the experiment, participants completed a post-task survey, were debriefed, and compensated.

Current IP practice

Overall, 60 (57.1%) persons announced having their team perform an IP workout or other strategy in the last 24 months, while 25 (23.8%) did no, and 20 (19%) indicated that they did not know whether their team performed an IP workout. The target body areas for the IP workout were mainly the LL: (55 (52.4%) participants performed IP interventions for the ankle, 51 (48.6%) for the knee, 38 (36.2%) for the lower leg, 31 (29.5%) for the thigh and 26 (24.8%) for the hip and trunk. Fifty-three (50.5%) participants indicated that their team implemented exercise-based interventions to decrease the risk of injuries. IP interventions were performed off-season for 29 (27.6%) participants and during the season for 45 (42.9%) participants. More details on when these interventions were performed can be found in online supplemental appendix 2.

Table 2 describes the overall modalities performed in the clubs and their frequencies according to the participants (table 2). Participants reported having training planned for 3.5 (± 1.5) days a week. There were two significant differences in the league level and the frequencies at which some training modalities were performed. More details can be found in online supplemental appendix 3.

### Effect of financial incentives and default options on food choices of adults with low income in online retail settings: a randomized clinical trial [^b4fa42df]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Despite recent growth in online redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, no previous work has tested the impact of economic and behavioral economic strategies on food purchasing behaviors in an online grocery retail setting among adults with low income.

Objective

To examine the extent to which financial incentives and default shopping cart options influence fruit and vegetable purchases.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial used an experimental online grocery store for adults who currently or have ever received SNAP benefits. From October 7 to December 2, 2021, participants were instructed to shop for a week's worth of groceries for their household, with a budget tailored to household size; no payment was taken.

Interventions

Random assignment to 1 of 4 conditions: no intervention, 50% discount on eligible fruits and vegetables, prefilled shopping carts with tailored fruit and vegetable items (ie, default options), or a combination of the discount and default options.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the percentage of nondiscounted dollars spent on eligible fruit and vegetables per basket.

Results

Of 2744 participants, mean (SD) age was 46.7 (16.0) years, and 1447 (52.7%) identified as women. A total of 1842 participants (67.1%) reported currently receiving SNAP benefits and 1492 (54.4%) reported shopping online for groceries in the previous 12 months. Participants spent a mean (SD) 20.5% (23.5%) of total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables. Compared with no intervention, those in the discount condition spent 4.7% (98.3% CI, 1.7%-7.7%) of more total dollars on eligible fruits and vegetables; those in the default condition, 7.8% (98.3% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) more; and those in the combination condition, 13.0% (98.3% CI, 10.0%-16.0%) more (P < .001 for all). There was no difference between the discount and the default conditions (P = 0.06), but the effect in the combination condition was significantly larger than both discount and default conditions (P < .001). Default shopping cart items were purchased by 679 participants (93.4%) in the default condition and 655 (95.5%) in the combination condition, whereas 297 (45.8%) in the control and 361 (52.9%) in the discount conditions purchased those items (P < .001). No variation was observed by age, sex, or race and ethnicity, and results were similar when those who reported never shopping online for groceries were excluded.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, financial incentives for fruits and vegetables and default options, especially in combination, led to meaningful increases in online fruit and vegetable purchases among adults with low income.

### Saving athletes' lives a reason to find common ground? [^3cb6bdcd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although both U.S. and European guidelines recommend screening athletes for suspected heart disease before participation in competitive sport, they disagree on which findings are associated with increased risk as well as those athletes whose activities should be restricted. Recent Italian data suggest that screening programs can save lives, but few countries have fully adopted such practices. It is time to develop an international consensus on who should receive pre-participation screening, who should perform the screening, what tests the screening should consist of, and what criteria should be used to restrict participation.

### Changes in use of types of tobacco products by pack sizes and price segments, prices paid and consumption following the introduction of plain packaging in Australia [^4eefafef]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

Australia is unusual internationally in that excise/customs duty since 1986 has been automatically inflation-adjusted 6-monthly resulting in twice yearly increases in retail prices since that time. Increases in excise/customs duty most commonly have been 'over-shifted' to consumers (ie, increases have been higher than that required merely to pass on the effects of indexation), and Scollo et al have reported in this volume that recommended retail prices increased more steeply among premium than among value brands over the period of introduction of PP. A further aim of this study was to assess whether a similar pattern of increases was observed for prices paid by consumers taking into account not just recommended prices but prices charged, and changes in use of brands within segments.

After a 25% increase in tobacco excise/customs duty in Australia in April 2010 (on top of the earlier 20–25% increase in duty applicable to large packs in November 1999 and continuing increases with twice-yearly indexation since that time), value brands in traditionally large pack sizes in Australia had been becoming increasingly less affordable for price-sensitive smokers. While still cheaper per stick than many other brands, the up-front cost of a pack of Horizon 50s (the leading value brand in 2011) had increased from $15.42 (AUD) in February 2001 to $29.80 in February 2012, just under $30, no doubt a critical 'left-digit price point'. Tobacco companies needed to find a way to provide value smokers with products with lower up-front costs. In the lead up to PP, several new value brands were introduced in small pack sizes early in 2012and several brands of FM cigarettes already sold in 20s were expanded to include packs of 21, 22 and 23. Some changes in pack size offerings effectively provided 'free' cigarettes, with the recommended retail prices for packs of 21s and 22s, for example, being listed at the same or lower price as packs of 20s. In addition, several brands appeared in a pack size of 26, and packs of 35s were replaced with 30s. Several brands traditionally offered in packs of 50 cigarettes introduced 40s or priced existing 40s products more competitively than 50s. Online supplementary table S2 shows the variant–pack size combinations available for John Player Special (JPS) which manufacturer Imperial Tobacco reports was the fastest growing brand over 2013. As indicated in table 1 in Scollo et al in this volume, between November 2011 and November 2013, the number of brands available in new pack sizes increased from 0 to 2 for 21s, from 0 to 1 for 22s, from 0 to 2 for 23s, from 0 to 3 for 26s. The expansion of pack sizes observed across the market was likely intended to retain price sensitive smokers including those wanting to buy value cigarettes, but likely to baulk at the very high up-front purchase cost of a pack of 50s. A further aim of this study therefore was to document any changes in the distribution of use of different pack sizes in Australia.

### Planning and conducting meetings effectively, part III: keeping meetings on track [^37993742]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The attendees at a meeting have different ways in which they get information and make decisions, different personal needs, and different ways in which they participate in groups. Some have counterproductive behaviors in committee meetings, such as attacking others, talking too long but not saying much, talking too little, deliberately trying to undermine the process, bringing up unrelated issues, engaging in private conversations with others, or silencing others. The chairperson must meet all of these challenges to have a productive meeting. This article gives some tips on how to run meetings well.

### Bayesian nonparametric models characterize instantaneous strategies in a competitive dynamic game [^d5dddfd3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Penalty shot task

We adapted a zero-sum dynamic control task, inspired by a penalty shot in hockey. The task was viewed on a computer screen and played by two players: an experimental participant (N = 82) who controlled an on-screen circle, or puck, and another long-term participant who controlled an on-screen bar, acting as the goalie. Hereafter, we will refer to these players as the participant and the opponent, respectively. The puck began each trial at the left of the screen and moved rightward at a constant horizontal speed. The participant's objective was to score by crossing a goal line located at the right end of the screen behind the opponent. The opponent's task was to block the puck from reaching the goal line. Each player moved his or her avatar using a joystick. Both players were only able to control the vertical velocities of their respective avatars, though the puck and bar had distinct game physics (see Methods and Supplementary Methods). See Fig. 1a, b for task progression and sample trajectories, as well as the Supplementary Movie 1 for a movie demonstrating real game play.

### Context of injury prevention strategies in Swiss basketball: survey of athletes, medical staff and coaches [^bf25aa22]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Results

Participant characteristics

We received a completed questionnaire from 105 people out of a potential of approximately 600 (17.5% response rate). The anthropometric data are presented in table 1.

Table 1
Demographics of participants (n (% of responders per question))

Athletes' mean overall career length was 10.4 (± 6.2) years, while the mean number of years spent in their actual league was 3.9 (± 3.2) years.

All the coaches had previous experience as basketball athletes with a mean career of 20.4 (± 8.3) years. Their mean coaching experience was 17.6 (± 11.0) years.

Five (100%) conditioning trainers reported having a sports specialisation, while one (20%) physiologist and one (50%) medical doctor reported being specialised in sports. Seven (58.3%) participants of the medical staff indicated having previous experience as players, with a mean career length of 16 (± 11.9) years. The mean experience as a medical professional in basketball was 5.7 (± 4.8) years.

Knowledge

The participants were asked about their risk of injury as basketball players. Sixty-eight (64.8%) participants considered the risk to be either high or very high. Of the 105 participants, 12 (11.4%) considered the risk to be the highest before the season started and 93 (88.6%) considered it to be the highest during the season; 103 (98.1%) considered that it is possible to reduce the risk of injury in basketball, while 2 (1.9%) disagreed.

When asked to classify the body region that they considered to be the most at risk for injuries, participants identified the ankle, knee and hand as being the most injury-prone. Recovery (sleep and nutrition), training load and warm-up quality were the main risk factors reported by participants (figure 1).

### Belief updating, childhood maltreatment, and paranoia in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [^c3b14ce2]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Behavioral Task (3PRL)

Belief updating was measured using a nonsocial 3-option probabilistic reversal learning (3PRL) task (supplementary figure S1A). Participants were presented with 3 decks of cards on a computer screen and were told that each deck contained a mix of winning (+100 points) and losing (−50 points) cards in differing amounts. They were instructed to find the best deck (the deck with the most winning cards, or the highest probability for reward) to win as many points as possible. Participants were informed that the best deck might change at any time and that, if they believed it had, they were to find the new, best deck. Unknown to the participant, the task was designed such that the best deck changed every time the participant selected it in 9 out of 10 consecutive trials (reversal events). This reversal learning task creates an expectation of environmental volatility, as the participant is aware that the best deck might change but is unaware of when or how frequently that change might occur. Participants completed 160 trials divided into 4 blocks, with a break between each block.

Additionally, unbeknownst to the participant, and to increase the experience of volatility, the contingencies of the 3-deck choices changed halfway through the task, while the probability of a reversal event occurring remained the same. During blocks 1 and 2, the win contingencies of the 3 decks were 90% reward, 50% reward, and 10% reward; in blocks 3 and 4, these contingencies changed to 80% reward, 40% reward, and 20% reward. This transition halfway through the task introduced additional volatility to the task environment and made it more difficult for participants to distinguish between probabilistic errors and errors that signify a reversal event.

### Neural changes when actions change: adaptation of strong and weak expectations [^69c22830]. Human Brain Mapping (2013). Low credibility.

Repeated experiences with an event create the expectation that subsequent events will expose an analog structure. These spontaneous expectations rely on an internal model of the event that results from learning. But what happens when events change? Do experience-based internal models get adapted instantaneously, or is model adaptation a function of the solidity of, i.e., familiarity with, the corresponding internal model? The present fMRI study investigated the effects of model solidity on model adaptation in an action observation paradigm. Subjects were made acquainted with a set of action movies that displayed an altered script when encountered again in the scanning session. We found model adaptation to result in an attenuation of the premotor-parietal network for action observation. Model solidity was found to modulate activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior cerebellar lobules, where increased solidity correlated with activity increase. Finally, the comparison between early and late stages of learning indicated an effect of model solidity on adaptation rate. This contrast revealed the involvement of a fronto-mesial network of Brodmann area 10 and the ACC in those states of learning that were signified by high model solidity, no matter if the memorized original or the altered action model was the more solid component. Findings suggest that the revision of an internal model is dependent on its familiarity. Unwarranted adaptations, but also perseverations may thus be prevented.

### Oculopalatal tremor explained by a model of inferior olivary hypertrophy and cerebellar plasticity [^5f3183f5]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 10
Progressively reducing the inferior olive coupling strength (green) or cerebellar modulation (blue) (gain is per cent of full strength) reduces amplitude but not frequency in simulated oscillations. (A) Increasing either cerebellar or inferior olive gain increases the amplitude of the oscillations (represented here by the standard deviation of the eye position traces). Note that when the inferior olive gain is below 30%, there are no oscillations. However, when the cerebellar gain is below 30%, oscillations persist. This is expected, because in the model the source of the oscillations is the train of random pulses from the inferior olive. (B) Changing the gain of either the cerebellum or inferior olive has little effect on the dominant frequency component of the oscillations. This is expected, because the frequency is determined by the repolarization currents in the inferior olive neurons, not by feedback circuits among the cells. Mean and SD come from averaging over 10 runs of one eye around three axes of rotation (n = 30).

### Athletes perceive weighted baseballs to carry a notable injury risk, yet still use them frequently: a multicenter survey study [^c1da6f82]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 376 players were surveyed, 323 (86%) of whom reported familiarity with weighted baseball training programs. The mean ± SD participant age was 20 ± 2 years, comprising players in college (342) and professional leagues (34). Players reported a mean throwing arm pain intensity of 17 ± 22 (median = 10) on a 0 to 100 scale (Table 1). Most of the participants (n = 239/376, 64%) were pitchers (Table 1). Additional demographic information is presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Participant Demographics

Of all participants, 267 (71%) had engaged in a weighted baseball training program, with 89% of the participants (238/267) using both overweight and underweight baseballs. Each player used a mean of 4.2 ± 1.9 different overweight baseballs in their training programs. The most commonly used overweight baseballs were 6oz and 7oz, representing 17% and 15% of overweight baseball responses, respectively. Each player used a mean of 1.7 ± 0.7 different underweight baseballs in their programs, with 4oz (44%) and 3oz (38%) being the most commonly used.

Among users of weighted baseballs, the most frequently reported usage was 3 to 5 times per week (n = 144/266, 38%), with < 2 times per week being the least frequently reported (n = 54/266, 14%). For underweight baseballs, most players reported (n = 110/239, 29% of the players) using them less than two times per week, with 8% of the players (n = 29/239) using them daily.

Overall, players perceive the greatest benefit of weighted baseball use to be improved or increased pitch velocity, with the least being improved or increased control/accuracy (Table 2). Of the players who actually used a weighted baseball program, 75% (199/267) reported that their use helped make them a better player, with perceived improvement in a mean of 2.2 ± 1.0 of the listed domains — ball velocity, accuracy/location, ball movement, arm strength, and others. The most common improvements were in velocity (86%) and arm strength (79%). Accuracy/location (26%) and pitch movement (21%) were also noted as improved domains (Table 3).

### Evaluation of a state-level incentive program to improve diet [^f996224d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

The EWBW program launched in January 2024, automatically delivering a fruit and vegetable incentive to all SNAP households via EBT cards, without the need to take any action or receive formal notification. The EWBW program provides a $0.50 credit for every $1 spent on fresh fruits and vegetables (excluding canned or frozen fruits and vegetables or legumes) up to $25 per month at eligible retailers: Stop & Shop and Walmart. Stop & Shop represents 43% of the market share in Rhode Island and 40% in Connecticut. An initial marketing campaign was launched to publicize the program at rollout. The What's On Your Plate study was developed to independently evaluate the EWBW program. The study is assessing both short-term (5–8 months) and longer-term (17–20 months after implementation) changes in fruit and vegetable intake. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Rhode Island and Brown University. All participants provided written informed consent. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Population

The What's On Your Plate study uses a convenience sample and a longitudinal pre-post study design, using Connecticut as a comparison site given its proximity and comparable sociodemographic profile to Rhode Island. SNAP participants were recruited before implementation (May 15-September 30, 2023). We determined that a target sample size of 1250 (625 per state) was needed to detect a 0.25-cup difference in fruit and vegetable intake between the sites, accounting for 20% attrition after 6 months.

### The effect of food price changes on consumer purchases: a randomised experiment [^6ce16099]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Most evidence on health-related food taxes and subsidies relies on observational data and effects on single nutrients or foods instead of total diet. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of randomly assigned food price variations on consumer purchasing, where sets of prices emulated commonly discussed food tax and subsidy policies, including a subsidy on fruit and vegetables, a sweetened beverage tax, and taxes on foods according to sugar, sodium, and saturated fat content.

Methods

In this study, adult participants (≥ 18 years) in New Zealand completed up to five weekly shops in a virtual supermarket. Each shopping occasion was randomly allocated to control (no change in prices) or one or more pricing options simulating the following: a fruit and vegetable subsidy (20%), a sweetened beverage tax (20% or 40%), a saturated fat tax (NZ$2 per 100 g or $4 per 100 g saturated fat), a salt tax ($0.02 per 100 mg or $0.04 per 100 mg sodium), or sugar tax ($0.40 per 100 g or $0.80 per 100 g sugar). The primary outcome was the healthiness of the total shopping basket for each weekly shop (% of total unit food items defined as healthy). Low and high price change options were combined in analyses (eg, results for a saturated fat tax are an average of $2 per 100 g or $4 per 100 g).

Findings

Between Feb 1, and Dec 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 1132 shoppers, of whom 1038 (91.7%) completed at least one shop and 743 (71.6%) completed all five shops. Overall, data from 4258 shops were included in the analysis, including 645 control shops, 2545 shops where one policy was activated, and 1068 shops with two (or more) policies activated. In the control condition, 67.90% (SD 13.01) of food purchases were classified as healthy. Three of the five policies increased this proportion by a small, but significant amount (saturated fat tax mean absolute difference 1.77%, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.52, p < 0.0001; sugar tax 1.09%, 0.26 to 1.91, p = 0.0099; and salt tax 1.31%, 0.50 to 2.13, p = 0.0016). The sweetened beverage tax and fruit and vegetable subsidy resulted in non-significant increases of 0.18% (95% CI -0.49 to 0.85, p = 0.60) and 0.41% (-0.26 to 1.07, p = 0.23), respectively. Both the saturated fat tax and salt tax resulted in the following important substitution effects: an increase in fruit and vegetable purchases as a percentage by weight of all food purchases (saturated fat tax 4.0%, 0.9 to 7.1; salt tax 4.3%, 0.9 to 7.7); but also an increase in sugar as a percentage of total energy (saturated fat tax 5.0%, 2.1 to 7.9; salt tax 3.2%, 0.0 to 6.5). Interaction terms for combined policies were mostly non-significant, consistent with additive effects of policy combinations.

Interpretation

Price changes representing saturated fat, sugar, and salt taxes increased total healthy food purchases. As we observed important substitution effects, a combination of different tax and subsidy policies might be the most effective way to improve diets and decrease diet-related chronic diseases.

Children's health behaviours

Children's diet, physical activity, and screen time were measured by means of a parent report consistent with the previous assessments using the Eating and Physical Activity Questionnaire (EPAQ). Regarding diet, parents responded to their child's dietary intake during the previous weekday. Items included fruits and vegetables, snacks, sweets/chocolate, ice-cream, cakes/buns/cookies, soft drink, flavoured milk and fruit juice in order to capture indicators corresponding to healthy and unhealthy dietary intake, respectively. The response scale included whole servings in the categories: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or more servings for food items, and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more servings for drink items. Servings were defined as: drinks = 1.5 dl, vegetables = e.g. 2 dL grated carrots/cabbage or a large tomato or 2–3 broccoli heads, fruit = e.g. a small apple or about 10 grapes, snacks = 1.5 dL crisps or cheese doodles, sweets = about 1.5 dL of sweets or 4 pieces from a chocolate bar, cakes = a small bun or 5 small biscuits, ice-cream = a small ice cream bar or 1 dL of ice-cream. Aggregated dietary indicator variables were created as the sum of either healthy foods (fruit and vegetables), unhealthy foods (snacks, sweets/chocolate, ice-cream, cakes/buns/cookies), or unhealthy drinks (soft drink, flavoured milk and fruit juice above one serving). Dietary items of EPAQ have been validated against 24-h recall in an Australian context with significant correlations between the two methods for different items ranging from r = 0.57 to r = 0.88.

In addition, the questionnaire measured whether the child was active in organised activity, i.e. a member of, and active participant in an organisation delivering organised activity such as swimming, basketball, or capoeira, for children, (yes or no), and minutes of screen time in front of the television or computer during the previous weekday. The questionnaire was available in Swedish and distributed via a web-link.

### Synaptically induced long-term modulation of electrical coupling in the inferior olive [^09bfae54]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

Functional Implications

There is a growing awareness that plasticity in cerebellar circuits related to motor learning can take place at many sites, involving changes in both synaptic strength and/or intrinsic membrane currents. Our study provides an additional site for long-term changes in cerebellar circuits that involves changes in electrical coupling between a defined cell type.

How might this plasticity be functionally useful? Synchronous activity among groups of neighboring olivary neurons defines functional microzones that via climbing fiber input in turn drive synchronous activity of Purkinje cells. This microzonal organization is thought to act as a population code that represents distinct forms of sensory information. Synchrony in the olivocerebellar system is driven both by shared synchronous excitatory input to olivary neurons and electrical coupling. Our demonstration of plasticity of this coupling could provide the olivocerebellar system with a flexible way to remodel its microzonal architecture. While there is evidence that short-term modulation of olivary coupling can be driven by both glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs, which could provide dynamic regulation of microzone structure on the millisecond-to-second timescale, a long-term mechanism such as that shown here is required to sustain changes involved in cerebellar motor learning. In support of this model, there is evidence that long-term alterations in electrical coupling in the olive can impair cerebellar motor learning. Since chemical synapses were not altered by our induction paradigm, glutamatergic synapses in the inferior olive may represent independent loci for shaping the patterns of synchrony underlying motor coordination. The long-term downregulation of electrical coupling by excitatory input may also represent a homeostatic mechanism for balancing activity during periods of synaptically driven synchrony.

### Hypertrophic olivary degeneration: case series and review of literature [^7d75260b]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic Olivary Degeneration (HOD) is a rare neurological condition caused by trans-synaptic degeneration in the brainstem and cerebellum, resulting in varied clinical symptoms, classical being palatal tremors, along with characteristic imaging presentation. Large number of pathologic lesions can cause this condition, ranging from ischemic stroke to neoplasm. The most common conditions include hemorrhage, vascular malformations and infarct. Magnetic resonance scan (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice which shows signal changes with hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus, as well as the primary underlying pathology. Through this pictorial essay, we present the imaging and clinical findings in a number of patients with HOD secondary to varied causes and explain the mechanism behind the changes.
