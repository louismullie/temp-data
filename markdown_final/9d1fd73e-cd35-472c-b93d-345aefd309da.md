## Question

Skin biopsy for synucleinopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of skin biopsy in synucleinopathies, including diagnostic performance, differentiation among PD, MSA, and DLB, early/prodromal detection, technical methodologies, limitations, and a practical clinical recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathobiologic rationale for using skin as a peripheral window into synucleinopathy. Then, I should verify the highest-quality diagnostic accuracy data across PD, MSA, DLB, and PAF. Next, I will examine whether skin p-α-syn can differentiate among synucleinopathies and from non-synuclein parkinsonism. After that, I should review prodromal detection in iRBD and early parkinsonism cohorts. I will then compare immunofluorescence versus seed amplification assays and appraise technical factors that influence sensitivity/specificity. Finally, I need to weigh limitations, standardization gaps, and equity considerations before proposing a cautious, clinically grounded recommendation with appropriate caveats [^115mhdt6] [^111DgTJW].

> Let me first confirm the biological plausibility. Synucleinopathies are defined by abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein, and phosphorylated α-syn at serine 129 (p-α-syn) is a validated pathologic signature; importantly, p-α-syn pathology is not confined to the CNS but is demonstrable in peripheral autonomic and somatosensory nerves, including skin, providing a minimally invasive biopsy target that mirrors central disease biology [^115mhdt6] [^112QPqx4].

> I should double-check the highest-quality diagnostic performance data. The 2024 JAMA multicenter, blinded, 30-site study of 428 participants reported cutaneous p-α-syn positivity in 92.7% of PD, 98.2% of MSA, 96.0% of DLB, and 100% of PAF, with only 3.3% false positives among controls, establishing very high sensitivity across synucleinopathies and excellent specificity; this is the most robust dataset to date and should anchor estimates of clinical performance [^115mhdt6] [^116JMWjh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about differential diagnosis. Earlier single-center studies suggested that PD shows predominant autonomic fiber involvement while MSA shows more somatosensory fiber involvement, implying a potential anatomical signature to distinguish PD from MSA; however, the JAMA multicenter data show high positivity in both PD and MSA, so while patterns may exist, they are not yet reliable enough for routine differentiation without standardized protocols and larger validation, and I should be cautious about overinterpreting fiber-type distributions at this stage [^114yzQrV] [^111DzkwG] [^115mhdt6].

> Next, I should review prodromal detection. In idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a prodromal synucleinopathy state with ~85% long-term conversion risk, skin p-α-syn has been detected in approximately 75–82% of cases, and in early parkinsonism cohorts (< 18 months), skin p-α-syn achieved 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity against eventual clinical diagnoses, with high temporal stability; this supports the concept that skin biopsy can identify synucleinopathy before full clinical criteria are met, though longitudinal validation is still needed [^114qaukk] [^112kbwar] [^115rVpgY].

> Let me consider the comparative performance of detection methods. Immunofluorescence (IF) for p-α-syn in skin nerves generally shows excellent specificity and good-to-excellent sensitivity in multicenter and comparative studies, with reproducible results across sites; seed amplification assays (RT-QuIC/PMCA) detect aggregation seeding activity and can achieve high accuracy, but skin RT-QuIC may have lower specificity due to occasional positives in non-synucleinopathies, whereas CSF RT-QuIC and IF often show stronger agreement; thus, IF currently has the most consistent clinical performance profile, while SAAs are promising but require tighter standardization [^111g9vM4] [^113wNWtD] [^114nmFHT] [^115krmcD].

> Wait, let me verify technical determinants that influence accuracy. Proximal cervical (C7–C8) sites yield higher sensitivity than distal leg sites due to denser autonomic innervation and a proximal gradient of pathology; antibody clone selection and antigen retrieval, particularly proteinase K, materially affect detection rates, with the D1R1R clone outperforming others when combined with PK retrieval; and standardized fixation, sectioning, and co-staining with neuronal markers (e.g. PGP9.5) are critical to avoid false positives and ensure interpretability; these factors explain historical variability and underscore the need for protocol harmonization [^115CJJUR] [^113BExsn] [^112xKnpH].

> I need to ensure we address specificity in real-world settings. Large control cohorts, including very elderly individuals, show a virtual absence of skin p-α-syn, supporting high specificity; rare false positives may represent incidental Lewy body pathology or preclinical disease, but overall the false-positive rate remains low (~3%), reinforcing the clinical utility of a positive skin p-α-syn result when pretest probability is meaningful [^113TyRiR] [^115mhdt6].

> But wait, what about limitations and readiness for routine care. There is no FDA-cleared skin test yet, although a commercial platform (Syn-One) is under multicenter validation; inter-site variability in biopsy sites, antibodies, and interpretation persists; and while pooled analyses suggest skin anti-p-α-syn has the best diagnostic accuracy among peripheral tissues, heterogeneity and lack of autopsy confirmation in many cohorts temper firm conclusions; equity considerations also matter, as access to movement disorder specialists and advanced testing is uneven, so biomarker deployment must be paired with standardized training and quality assurance [^111Txjkq] [^1168e4fL] [^114FJLeQ] [^111DgTJW].

> Let me synthesize a cautious clinical recommendation. In patients with clinically suspected synucleinopathy (PD, MSA, DLB, PAF), a positive skin p-α-syn by IF substantially increases the likelihood of synucleinopathy and can support diagnostic confidence, particularly when clinical features are atypical or early; in iRBD or early parkinsonism, a positive test may identify disease before full clinical criteria, aiding counseling and trial eligibility; however, a negative test does not exclude synucleinopathy, especially if sampling is limited to distal sites or if early disease burden is below detection thresholds, so results must be integrated with clinical, imaging, and autonomic data rather than used in isolation [^115mhdt6] [^115rVpgY] [^112kbwar] [^111DgTJW].

> Finally, I should confirm the immediate next steps for practice. Centers contemplating skin biopsy should adopt standardized protocols: prefer proximal cervical sites, use validated antibodies with PK antigen retrieval (e.g. D1R1R), co-stain for neuronal markers, and ensure blinded, expert interpretation; where available, participate in or refer to centers with validated workflows and ongoing quality assurance; and consider skin biopsy within a broader biomarker strategy that includes olfactory testing, cardiac MIBG, and, when appropriate, CSF or skin seeding assays, recognizing that SAAs are rapidly evolving but not yet fully standardized for routine clinical use [^113BExsn] [^111g9vM4] [^111TJ4Wn] [^115krmcD] [^111DgTJW].

Skin biopsy for synucleinopathy detection is a **minimally invasive** procedure that identifies phosphorylated α-synuclein in cutaneous autonomic and somatosensory fibers, enabling antemortem diagnosis of synucleinopathies [^115mhdt6]. It offers **high sensitivity and specificity** across PD, DLB, MSA, and PAF, with the best performance when sampling proximal sites (cervical/thigh) and using standardized immunofluorescence or seed amplification assays [^115mhdt6] [^111Jdsoo] [^114nmFHT]. Skin biopsy is most useful for **early or atypical cases** and for differentiating synucleinopathies from tauopathies, but results depend on assay quality, site selection, and operator expertise; it is not yet a standalone diagnostic test and should be interpreted in clinical context [^115rVpgY] [^113vAGCx].

## Pathological basis of synucleinopathy detection in skin

Synucleinopathies are defined by **α-synuclein aggregation** in the CNS and PNS, including skin autonomic and somatosensory fibers [^113Km2pG]. Phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-syn) at serine 129 is a **reliable marker** of pathological aggregates and is detected in skin nerve fibers of patients with synucleinopathies [^113BExsn].

---

## Methods of α-synuclein detection in skin biopsy

Several **methods** are used to detect α-synuclein in skin biopsy:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Immunohistochemistry (IHC) | Detection of p-α-syn using specific antibodies (e.g. EP1536Y, 81A) | High (76–100%) | High (98–100%) |
| Immunofluorescence (IF) | Fluorescent labeling of p-α-syn in nerve fibers | High (90–100%) | High (98–100%) |
| Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) | Detection of α-syn seeding activity | Moderate (80–95%) | Moderate (80–90%) |
| Proximity ligation assay (PLA) | Detection of α-syn oligomers in synaptic terminals | Moderate (82–86%) | Moderate (86–90%) |

---

Among these, **immunofluorescence and IHC** are the most widely used and validated, with high sensitivity and specificity when standardized protocols are applied [^115mhdt6] [^1168e4fL].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of skin biopsy for synucleinopathies

Skin biopsy demonstrates **high diagnostic accuracy** for synucleinopathies:

- **Parkinson's disease (PD)**: Sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 96.7% [^115mhdt6].
- **Multiple system atrophy (MSA)**: Sensitivity 98.2%, specificity 96.7% [^115mhdt6].
- **Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)**: Sensitivity 96.0%, specificity 96.7% [^115mhdt6].
- **Pure autonomic failure (PAF)**: Sensitivity 100%, specificity 96.7% [^115mhdt6].

These figures derive from a large, multicenter, blinded study, underscoring the **reliability of skin biopsy** for synucleinopathy diagnosis [^115mhdt6].

---

## Clinical indications and patient selection

Skin biopsy is **particularly useful** in the following scenarios:

- **Early-stage synucleinopathies**: Detection of α-syn pathology before clinical diagnosis [^115rVpgY].
- **Atypical presentations**: Differentiation from other neurodegenerative disorders [^111DzkwG].
- **Prodromal synucleinopathies**: Identification in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and other prodromal states [^112kbwar] [^114qaukk].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its promise, skin biopsy has **limitations**:

- **Standardization**: Variability in biopsy sites, antibodies, and protocols affects accuracy [^113vAGCx].
- **Operator dependence**: Requires trained personnel and specialized equipment [^114Fy29J].
- **False negatives**: Early or focal pathology may be missed [^111aR7eF].
- **Not standalone**: Results must be integrated with clinical and imaging data [^111aR7eF].

---

## Comparison with other diagnostic methods

Skin biopsy offers several **advantages** over other diagnostic methods:

- **Minimally invasive**: Less invasive than CSF analysis or brain imaging [^114nmFHT].
- **High specificity**: Comparable or superior to other peripheral biomarkers [^1168e4fL].
- **Early detection**: Potential to identify pathology before clinical diagnosis [^115rVpgY].

However, it is **not yet a replacement** for established clinical criteria or imaging and should be used adjunctively [^115Y7eQu].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend skin biopsy as an **adjunctive tool**, particularly for early or atypical cases. It is not yet a standalone diagnostic test but is valuable in research and specialized clinical settings [^114HGAQT].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

Ongoing research aims to **standardize protocols**, improve assay sensitivity, and expand validation cohorts. Efforts include multicenter trials, development of automated assays, and integration with other biomarkers and imaging modalities [^111Txjkq] [^115XgrzV].

---

Skin biopsy for synucleinopathy detection is a **promising, minimally invasive tool** with high diagnostic accuracy. It is most useful in early or atypical cases and for differentiating synucleinopathies from other neurodegenerative disorders. Limitations include standardization and operator dependence, and results should be interpreted in clinical context [^115mhdt6] [^114HGAQT] [^115rVpgY] [^114Fy29J].

### Alpha-synuclein in skin as a high-quality biomarker for Parkinson's disease [^113cjenC]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common neurological motor system disorder, which characterised by the irreversible loss of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and leads to the deficiency of dopamine in the striatum. Deposited Lewy bodies (LBs) in diseased neurones and nerve terminals are the pathological hallmark of PD, and alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is the most prominent protein in LBs. The tight association between α-Syn and the molecular pathology of PD has generatly increaed the interest in using the α-Syn species as biomarkers to diagnose early PD. α-Syn is not confined to the central nervous system, it is also present in the peripheral tissues, such as human skin. The assessment of skin α-Syn has the potential to be a diagnostic method that not only has excellent sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility, but also convenient and acceptable to patients. In this review, we (i) integrate the biochemical, aggregation and structural features of α-Syn; (ii) map the distribution of the α-Syn species present in the brain, biological fluids, and peripheral tissues; and (iii) present a critical and comparative analysis of previous studies that have measured α-Syn in the skin. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future of skin biopsy as a diagnostic approach for PD, and highlight its potential implications for clinical trials, clinical decision-making, treatment strategies as well as the development of new therapies.

### Skin biopsy detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein in patients with synucleinopathies [^115mhdt6]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Finding a reliable diagnostic biomarker for the disorders collectively known as synucleinopathies (Parkinson disease [PD], dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB], multiple system atrophy [MSA], and pure autonomic failure [PAF]) is an urgent unmet need. Immunohistochemical detection of cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein may be a sensitive and specific clinical test for the diagnosis of synucleinopathies.

Objective

To evaluate the positivity rate of cutaneous α-synuclein deposition in patients with PD, DLB, MSA, and PAF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This blinded, 30-site, cross-sectional study of academic and community-based neurology practices conducted from February 2021 through March 2023 included patients aged 40 to 99 years with a clinical diagnosis of PD, DLB, MSA, or PAF based on clinical consensus criteria and confirmed by an expert review panel and control participants aged 40 to 99 years with no history of examination findings or symptoms suggestive of a synucleinopathy or neurodegenerative disease. All participants completed detailed neurologic examinations and disease-specific questionnaires and underwent skin biopsy for detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein. An expert review panel blinded to pathologic data determined the final participant diagnosis.

Exposure

Skin biopsy for detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein.

Main Outcomes

Rates of detection of cutaneous α-synuclein in patients with PD, MSA, DLB, and PAF and controls without synucleinopathy.

Results

Of 428 enrolled participants, 343 were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 69.5 [9.1] years; 175 [51.0%] male); 223 met the consensus criteria for a synucleinopathy and 120 met criteria as controls after expert panel review. The proportions of individuals with cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein detected by skin biopsy were 92.7% (89 of 96) with PD, 98.2% (54 of 55) with MSA, 96.0% (48 of 50) with DLB, and 100% (22 of 22) with PAF; 3.3% (4 of 120) of controls had cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein detected.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, a high proportion of individuals meeting clinical consensus criteria for PD, DLB, MSA, and PAF had phosphorylated α-synuclein detected by skin biopsy. Further research is needed in unselected clinical populations to externally validate the findings and fully characterize the potential role of skin biopsy detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein in clinical care.

### The role of skin biopsy in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other types of parkinsonism [^113A8QJ4]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders with a worldwide distribution. It has variable and complex phenotype with motor and non-motor manifestations, causes considerable psychosocial morbidity and consumes significant health care resources. Changing population demographics, and in particular, an ageing population in western societies is likely to result in gradually increasing prevalence. Despite significant advances in the understanding of disease pathology, the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) remains largely clinical, with discriminatory investigations such as Ioflupane (123 I)-labelled single-photon emission computed tomography (DaTSCAN) being used only in the minority of patients. However, postmortem studies have historically demonstrated the fallibility of relying on clinical phenotype and in differentiating IPD from 'Parkinson's plus' conditions such as multiple system atrophy (MSA). An in vivo accessible peripheral biomarker for IPD and MSA would, therefore, be of great value to direct therapy and more accurate patient counselling.

The three papers discussed below assess the value of one of the most promising of the available candidate biomarkers in this context; phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-α-Syn) which has recently been identified within dermal nerve fibres in IPD. In the first paper, the authors examine the utility of p-α-Syn as a biomarker for diagnosis of IPD, the second looks at p-α-Syn as a biomarker for MSA and the third at using p-α-Syn to differentiate IPD from MSA.

### The skin and lewy body disease [^1144gF11]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

This manuscript reviews the significant skin manifestations of Lewy body disease, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, and the diagnostic utility of skin biopsy. Besides classic motor and cognitive symptoms, non-motor manifestations, particularly dermatologic disorders, can play a crucial role in disease presentation and diagnosis. This review explores the intricate relationship between the skin and Lewy body disease. Seborrheic dermatitis, autoimmune blistering diseases (bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus), rosacea, and melanoma are scrutinized for their unique associations with Parkinson's disease, revealing potential links through shared pathophysiological mechanisms. Advances in diagnostic techniques allow the identification of promising biomarkers such as α-synuclein in samples obtained by skin punch biopsy. Understanding the dermatologic aspects of Lewy body disease not only contributes to its holistic characterization but also holds implications for innovative diagnostic approaches.

### The role of skin biopsy in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other types of parkinsonism [^111KGsHr]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Comment. The use of skin biopsy in the diagnosis of IPD is an intriguing prospect. It is easily performed and minimally invasive with few adverse effects. This study provides some compelling evidence for use of skin biopsy in the diagnosis of IPD, although clearly larger studies would be of value in validating its use in clinical practice. The mean disease duration in the IPD group was 13 years, but it may be interesting to explore this biomarker in early or preclinical disease which may have significant implications for guiding earlier therapeutic interventions. However, the insights provided into pathophysiology remain limited since p-α-Syn deposits did not appear to correlate with disease duration or sub-phenotype.

### The role of skin biopsy in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other types of parkinsonism [^114yzQrV]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

In MSA patients, p-α-Syn was predominantly deposited in somatosensory fibres of the subepidermal plexus, in contrast to IPD where autonomic fibres were predominantly affected. In the IPD group, proximal biopsy sites showed the highest detection rate, raising the possibility of antidromic spreading of p-α-Syn from ganglia to sensory nerve findings. The authors conclude that detection of p-α-Syn in cutaneous nerve fibres may support the diagnosis of a 'synucleinopathy' in contrast to tauopathies. They also suggest that p-α-Syn in somatosensory fibres is associated with MSA-parkinsonism, whereas autonomic fibres are involved in IPD.

Comment. This study advocates the use of skin biopsy in distinguishing IPD from MSA and other forms of parkinsonism. No attempt was made to correlate p-α-Syn deposition to disease severity or duration. Once again, a larger study would be of value in validating these results and developing wider datasets before its use can be supported in clinical practice. Mean disease duration varied considerably between clinical groups (MSA 4.9 years; IPD 12.4 years; tauopathies 3.6 years) and future studies may consider matching for both age and diseased duration.

### Biologically defined neuronal synuclein disease as a tool to advance drug development [^114FJLeQ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the above caveats, there are valuable applications for these frameworks which warrant consideration: while the novel biological definitions can be expected initially to be used in a clinical research context, they could become more broadly utilized by the development of more accessible approaches to identifying pathological alpha-synuclein, e.g. skin biopsy or blood markers. In addition, there are currently great inequities for those suffering from synucleinopathies between and within countriesbecause only a minority has access to specialists who can accurately diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The development of a validated biomarker for neuronal synucleinopathy in an easily accessible fluid, such as blood, could potentially facilitate diagnosis, including for those without access to clinical specialists.

In addition, we believe staging systems are powerful tools that will accelerate drug development in neuronal synucleinopathy by allowing clinical trials that enroll biologically defined populations to be conducted and by enabling the use of stage-dependent outcome measures. During the past decade, clinicians and scientists have emphasized the heterogeneity of PD, regarding both symptomatology and underlying molecular pathogenesis, and the similarities between PD dementia (PDD) and DLB have been stressed. This heterogeneity may have contributed to the failure of several trials of experimental neuronal synuclein-targeted therapies aimed at slowing the progression of symptoms. Consequently, many investigators have called for a precision medicine approach when developing new drugs for PD, PDD, and DLB, and concerns regarding evaluating drugs in populations defined only by clinical symptomatology have been raised. Instead, the solution could be to target the right population (biologically defined) with the right drugs (that match that biology) and to evaluate the right outcomes (stage-specific) that change sufficiently within the duration of the clinical trial to allow detection of a potential slowing of progression. For example, implementing NSD-ISS could be a first step toward increasing the probability of success of future clinical trials in neuronal synucleinopathy. An ideal population to test a drug designed to slow or even stop disease progression is biologically defined by the presence of pathological alpha-synuclein and only early signs of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, with minimal signs or symptoms of disease, and no functional impairment, representing Stage 2 A and 2B of NSD-ISS. As SAA becomes more widely available at research sites, the NSD-ISS framework can be expected to facilitate trials of drugs in the earliest stages of the disease, prior to significant neurodegeneration, which may increase the magnitude and the impact of a therapeutic effect.

### The role of skin biopsy in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other types of parkinsonism [^114dNmQA]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in skin nerve fibres differentiates Parkinson's disease from multiple system atrophy

Zange et al. addressed the hypothesis that p-α-Syn can be detected in skin sympathetic nerve fibres in Parkinson's disease, but not MSA. This study included 10 patients with IPD (according to the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank criteria) and 10 patients with MSA (according to Gilman criteria). Clinical classification was further supported by nuclear imaging and autonomic reflex screening. Six patients with an essential tremor served as controls.

Three-millimetre punch biopsies were taken from the forearm of the clinically more affected side. p-α-Syn deposits were detected in nerve fibres innervating skin autonomic structures in α-Syn-dependent neurodegenerative disorders and p-α-Syn deposition was limited to Parkinson's disease. However, dermal nerve fibres of MSA and control patients were devoid of p-α-Syn. The authors conclude that as their study did not show involvement of postganglionic sympathetic skin nerve fibres in MSA (with a clinical duration up to 7 years), testing sympathetic skin nerve fibres for p-α-Syn deposits is of value in differentiating Parkinson's disease from MSA. However, they suggest that further studies of a variety of disease durations are necessary to verify this. Their data support the finding of dermal denervation in Parkinson's disease, occurring independently of age and correlating with the extent of intra-axonal p-α-Syn deposition.

Comment. This study supports the use of skin biopsy to differentiate IPD from MSA, specifically looking at autonomic skin nerve fibres. However, perhaps the most relevant conclusion that can be drawn is that autonomic skin fibre biopsies can be used to differentiate IPD from 'not IPD'. The Parkinson's disease patients in this study had a mean disease duration of 5.85 years, compared to 4.10 years for the MSA patients which are relatively well matched, although mean age of the cohorts differed by almost 10 years. As in the previous two papers, this study also supports the relationship of dermal denervation to p-α-Syn deposition. It would clearly be of value to obtain longer term follow-up data on these cohorts including pathology if available, to verify diagnosis and pathological conclusions.

### The role of skin biopsy in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other types of parkinsonism [^115CJJUR]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Skin nerve alpha-synuclein deposits: a biomarker for idiopathic Parkinson's disease

This paper focuses on two hypotheses: whether p-α-Syn deposits in skin nerve fibres represent a useful biomarker for IPD and whether there is a link between these deposits and the underlying pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy associated with IPD. The latter is based on experimental data showing that an accumulation of p-α-Syn deposits leads to neuron death. Twenty-one patients with well-characterised IPD (20 of whom had the diagnosis supported by cardiac uptake of [123 I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine), 20 patients with parkinsonism (PAR) of different pathogenesis assumed not to have p-α-Syn deposits (vascular parkinsonism 10, tauopathies 6, parkin mutations 4) and 30 age-matched healthy controls were recruited for the study.

Three-millimetre punch biopsies of skin nerve fibres were taken at a proximal site (cervical C8 paravertebral area) and distal sites (thigh and distal leg). A second biopsy was also taken to assess variability of p-α-Syn expression from all areas in IPD patients, but only at the cervical area in the two other groups. No p-α-Syn deposits were identified in skin samples taken from the control or PAR groups. In contrast, when both skin samples were considered from the cervical area in the IPD group all patients were positive for p-α-Syn deposits. However, samples from thigh and distal leg sites in IPD patients were positive in only 52 and 24%, respectively.

In the IPD group, p-α-Syn deposits showed a significant indirect correlation with leg epidermal innervation. Deposits were not correlated with age, disease duration, or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score. The authors conclude that p-α-Syn deposits in proximal skin nerve fibres are a sensitive biomarker for the diagnosis of IPD and can help differentiate between other forms of parkinsonism. As a result of variable local expression, the highest sensitivity (100%) was achieved by analysing two cervical skin samples. The authors also concluded that neuritic synuclein inclusions were correlated with a small fibre neuropathy, suggesting a possible direct role of p-α-Syn in peripheral nerve damage.

### In vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies: a comparative study of skin biopsy and RT-QuIC [^114sE2DF]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study deals with the important topic of the in vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies by comparing immunofluorescence and RT-QuIC, 2 recently described advanced techniques to disclose pathologic aggregates of α-synuclein. Our data demonstrate that both techniques displayed high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating synucleinopathies from other neurodegenerative and neurologic disorders, although immunofluorescence displayed the better value as well as an optimal reproducibility. In addition, these 2 diagnostic tools showed good agreement in disclosing a synucleinopathy, supporting the use in clinical practice of less invasive tests such as skin immunofluorescence or RT-QuIC instead of CSF as diagnostic tool for synucleinopathies.

### The search for a peripheral biopsy indicator of α-synuclein pathology for parkinson disease [^11793N3J]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD) is abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn). Demonstrating pathological α-syn in live patients would be useful for identifying and monitoring PD patients. To date, however, imaging and biofluid approaches have not permitted premortem assessment of pathological α-syn. α-syn pathology in the peripheral nervous system of patients with PD has been demonstrated in studies dating back more than 40 years. More recent work suggests that colon, submandibular gland and skin biopsies could be useful as expedient biomarkers but histological differentiation of pathological and normal peripheral α-syn has been challenging and multiple research groups have reported variable results. A variety of immunohistochemical methods have been employed but almost all studies to date originated at single centers with no independent, blinded replication. To address these issues, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research sponsored a series of meetings and investigations by several research groups with relevant experience. The major finding reported herein was that biopsies can be used to distinguish PD patients from normal subjects. However, full assessment of the clinical potential of biopsy will only be achieved through large, multicenter trials in which both the initial detection methodology and histology have been assessed by blinded panels of pathologists.

### Skin α-synuclein aggregation seeding activity as a novel biomarker for parkinson disease [^114gpmim]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does the pathological α-synuclein (αSyn P) detected by immunohistochemistry in the skin of individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) have aggregation seeding activity, and is skin αSyn P seeding activity a potential biomarker for diagnosis of PD and other synucleinopathies?

Findings

In this diagnostic study including skin samples from 160 autopsies and 41 biopsies, a statistically significant increase in αSyn P seeding activity was observed in individuals with PD and synucleinopathies compared with controls with tauopathies and nonneurodegenerative diseases.

Meaning

Skin αSyn P has aggregation seeding activity in patients with PD and non-PD synucleinopathies and may be a biomarker for antemortem diagnosis of PD and other synucleinopathies.

### In vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies: a comparative study of skin biopsy and RT-QuIC [^114HGAQT]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of our study are that (1) both immunofluorescence and RT-QuIC showed a high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating synucleinopathies from different neurodegenerative and other neurologic disorders, although immunofluorescence displayed the better value as well as optimal reproducibility; and (2) these techniques presented a good level of agreement, supporting their equivalency for diagnostic purpose, although the agreement with skin RT-QuIC was lower in patients with non-synucleinopathies.

The correct diagnosis of synucleinopathies in living patients is a prominent challenge with several implications. The search for several biomarkers is in progress but a single diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity is not currently available for synucleinopathies, although urgently needed. Because autonomic symptoms may precede the classical symptoms of synucleinopathy, such as motor dysfunction in PD or dementia in DLB, reflecting the early damage of postganglionic sympathetic branches, peripheral tissues with extensive autonomic innervation, such as the skin, could be a useful target site in the search of pathologic forms of α-synuclein aggregates. The use of skin samples to identify biomarkers for synucleinopathies is also promising considering that skin biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure. The morphologic identification of misfolded α-synuclein aggregates as p-syn in skin nerves by means of immunofluorescence has been reported in all variants of synucleinopathies, allowing the distinction of these disorders from diseases of different origins or from healthy controls. Additional data showed that p-syn in skin nerves may also be used to differentiate MSA from PD, or uncomplicated PD from PD associated with orthostatic hypotension. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated by means of a meta-analysis that skin biopsy presented the best diagnostic accuracy in disclosing abnormal α-synuclein deposits in patients with PD. In addition, the reliability of immunofluorescence as a diagnostic tool has been supported by excellent interlaboratory and intralaboratory reproducibility.

Distinctive distribution of phospho-alpha-synuclein in dermal nerves in multiple system atrophy

MSA also remains a largely clinical diagnosis with support from autonomic function tests and neuroradiology. Pathologically MSA is characterised by detection of α-Syn deposits in oligodendrocytes and neurons. In this study, Doppler et al. explore whether p-α-Syn deposits in dermal nerve fibres can be used as a biomarker in MSA and whether this could differentiate MSA from tauopathies and IPD. Twelve patients with probable MSA according to the Gilman criteria (6 where MSA was supported by neuroimaging and a further 6 without MRI support), 15 patients with presumed tauopathies (based on the criteria of Armstrong et al.), 30 patients with IPD (based on the UK Brain Bank criteria) and 39 healthy controls were examined.

Five-millimetre punch skin biopsies were taken from the back (Th12) and distal and proximal leg. Serial sections were undertaken to determine sensitivity and one in ten sections were double stained. p-α-Syn within dermal nerve fibres was detected in 8/12 patients with a clinical diagnosis of MSA. No p-α-Syn immunoreactive nerve fibres were identified in patients with presumed tauopathies or normal controls (p < 0.05). The sensitivity of skin biopsies stained positively for p-α-Syn in MSA was 67% and specificity for a diagnosis of MSA versus tauopathies/controls was 100%. In the IPD group, p-α-Syn was detected in 20 out of 30 patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 67%. Double-staining serial sections of all p-α-Syn-negative patients identified one further patient with MSA and two more patients with IPD, increasing sensitivity to 75 and 73%, respectively.

### The diagnostic discrimination of cutaneous α-synuclein deposition in parkinson disease [^1165N9TV]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic discrimination of cutaneous α-synuclein deposition in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) with and without autonomic dysfunction on autonomic testing, in early and late stages of the disease, and of short and long duration.

Methods

Twenty-eight participants with PD and 23 control participants were studied by skin biopsies at multiple sites, autonomic function testing, and disease-specific scales.

Results

Skin biopsies provide > 90% sensitivity and > 90% specificity to distinguish PD from control participants across all biopsies sites with quantification of either pilomotor or sudomotor α-synuclein deposition. All individuals with PD have significantly higher cutaneous α-synuclein deposition than control participants, even those individuals with PD and no evidence of autonomic dysfunction. Deposition of α-synuclein is most prominent in sympathetic adrenergic nerve fibers innervating the arrector pili muscles, but is also present in sudomotor (sympathetic cholinergic) nerve fibers. α-Synuclein is present even in the early stages of disease and disease of short duration. α-Synuclein ratios were higher in individuals with autonomic failure, with more advanced stages of disease and disease of longer duration.

Conclusions

The α-synuclein ratio provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic biomarker of PD even in patients without autonomic failure.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that cutaneous α-synuclein deposition accurately identifies patients with PD.

### Skin intraneural phosphorylated α-synuclein is a highly specific biomarker for early Parkinson's disease [^115rVpgY]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

An early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a challenge and novel accurate biomarkers are therefore urgently needed. Detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-syn) in skin nerve fibers has shown promise as such a marker. However, its accuracy for the identification of PD among patients with early signs of parkinsonism has not been thoroughly explored. In this blinded, multicenter, prospective and follow-up study, 151 patients diagnosed with early-stage parkinsonism (< 18 months duration) were enrolled at three tertiary movement disorders centers. Clinical scales were performed and initial diagnoses were reassessed at 18 and 46 months follow-up visits. Skin biopsy, with analysis for neuronal and glial p-α-syn deposits, and olfactory testing were performed at the baseline visit and repeated in 44 patients at the 18 months visit. After the follow-up period, a final diagnosis was reached in 140 patients: PD (n = 101; 67% of all screened patients), tauopathies (n = 22; 15%), multiple system atrophy (n = 5; 3%), vascular parkinsonism (n = 4; 3%), essential tremor (n = 3; 2%), dystonic tremor (n = 2; 1%) and no neurological illness (n = 3, 2%). Eleven patients did not fit any clinical criteria and were therefore classified as undefined. Baseline skin intraneural p-α-syn showed a robust diagnostic accuracy (81% sensitivity and 100% specificity) for identifying PD. Importantly, in 30 out of 44 patients not diagnosed with PD until the follow-up intraneural p-α-syn was positive already at baseline. Moreover, the analyses showed a large degree of consistency over time, as the same results at baseline and follow-up were obtained in 42 (96%) of the tested patients. Finally, although olfactory testing at baseline showed a more abnormal score in PD compared to the other groups, its predictive accuracy was more modest (72%). In conclusion, given its high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, skin intraneural p-α-syn could become a valuable tool for diagnosing PD at early stages, potentially years before the diagnostic criteria are met, and for differentiating PD from atypical parkinsonism. In contrast, olfactory function, although more impaired in PD than in non-PD patients, only seems to have a more limited diagnostic accuracy.

### In vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies: a comparative study of skin biopsy and RT-QuIC [^111aR7eF]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

The analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of single tests underlined that RT-QuIC presented high sensitivity and specificity in identifying synucleinopathies, as recently reported. However, in our study, we found that the greater diagnostic accuracy was given by immunofluorescence. In fact, this test provided higher sensitivity, with 90% of patients with synucleinopathies positive for p-syn, and the highest specificity, as p-syn staining was negative in all non-synucleinopathies and control patients. However, it should be underlined that the low number of patients undergoing CSF RT-QuIC may be responsible for the lower sensitivity of this test compared to immunofluorescence.

The current study presents the following limitations: (1) the lack of autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of recruited patients. This is a significant limitation, although we recruited for this study only patients fulfilling accepted clinical criteria in agreement with the results of appropriated diagnostic tools. However, immunofluorescence or CSF RT-QuIC assay found a clear-cut difference among the 3 groups of investigated patients, supporting a correct selection of recruited patients; (2) the diagnostic accuracy in detecting a synucleinopathy in skin samples may be underestimated since the analysis has almost always been done in a single skin site addressed by the specific clinical phenotype, e.g. PD and DLB in proximal skin sitesand MSA in distal sites, to simplify the study protocol and decrease the number of biopsies taken from each patient. However, abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein may not be evenly distributed in skin nerves and a single site may not be sufficient to detect it precisely. A similar situation has been observed in RT-QuIC assay of prion-seeding activity in skin tissues from different body areas of cadavers with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosed neuropathologically; in some cases, positive prion-seeding activity was not always detected in all 3 different skin samples and 1 or 2 skin areas could exhibit no detectable prion-seeding activity; (3) the lack of quantitative MRI analysis to better differentiate tauopathies from synucleinopathies or TDP proteinopathies. However, a high diagnostic accuracy for synucleinopathies was reached by means of characteristic abnormalities on different diagnostic tools such as MRI, nigrostriatal SPECT, cardiac MIBG SPECT, or head-up tilt test.

### In vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies: a comparative study of skin biopsy and RT-QuIC [^111g9vM4]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether (1) immunofluorescence is a reproducible technique in detecting misfolded α-synuclein in skin nerves and subsequently whether (2) immunofluorescence and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) (both in skin and CSF) show a comparable in vivo diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing synucleinopathies from non-synucleinopathies in a large cohort of patients.

Methods

We prospectively recruited 90 patients fulfilling clinical and instrumental diagnostic criteria for all synucleinopathies variants and non-synucleinopathies (mainly including Alzheimer disease, tauopathies, and vascular parkinsonism or dementia). Twenty-four patients with mainly peripheral neuropathies were used as controls. Patients underwent skin biopsy for immunofluorescence and RT-QuIC; CSF was examined in patients who underwent lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes. Immunofluorescence and RT-QuIC analysis were made blinded to the clinical diagnosis.

Results

Immunofluorescence showed reproducible results between 2 pairs of neighboring skin samples. Both immunofluorescence and RT-QuIC showed high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating synucleinopathies from non-synucleinopathies and controls but immunofluorescence presented higher diagnostic accuracy. Immunofluorescence presented a good level of agreement with RT-QuIC in both skin and CSF in synucleinopathies.

Conclusions

Both immunofluorescence and RT-QuIC showed high diagnostic accuracy, although immunofluorescence displayed the better value as well as optimal reproducibility; they presented a good level of agreement in synucleinopathies, supporting the use of less invasive tests such as skin immunofluorescence or RT-QuIC instead of CSF RT-QuIC as a diagnostic tool for synucleinopathies.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that immunofluorescence or RT-QuIC accurately distinguish synucleinopathies from non-synucleinopathies.

### Comparing GBA1-parkinson's disease and idiopathic Parkinson's disease: α-synuclein oligomers and synaptic density as biomarkers in the skin biopsy [^115SoNRB]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

Collectively, our research suggests that the assessment of α‐synuclein oligomers and synaptic density in the skin has the potential to provide a reliable, accessible, and accurate biomarker in iPD and GBA1 ‐PD. Our findings may carry preliminary implications for the understanding of peripheral pathophysiological mechanisms underlying nonmotor burden in GBA1 ‐PD. A deeper understanding of such mechanisms both in the prodromal and manifest phase of GBA1 ‐PD is of paramount importance to address key questions about treatment response in the expanding scenario of pathway‐specific therapeutic options, as well as to inform future strategies for more precise patient stratification. In conclusion, we reported the quantitative analysis of α‐synuclein oligomers and synaptic density in the skin as a biomarker of iPD and GBA1 ‐associated PD.

### Tau seeding activity in skin biopsy differentiates tauopathies from synucleinopathies [^1169zhE2]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Most neurodegenerative diseases lack definitive diagnostic tests, and the identification of easily accessible and reliable biomarkers remains a critical unmet need. Since tau protein is highly expressed in skin of tauopathies patients, we aimed to exploit the ultrasensitive seeding activity assay (SAA) to assess tau seeding activity in skin of patients with tauopathies. In this multicentric, case-control study, patients with tauopathies and synucleinopathies were consecutively recruited and sex-matched to healthy controls (HC). Subjects underwent a double 3 mm skin biopsy in cervical area and ankle. Skin tau-SAA, using TauK18 and TauK19 as reaction substrates for 4R and 3R isoforms, seeding score, clinical scales, biochemical and morphological characterization of SAA end-products were evaluated. We analyzed 58 subjects: 24 tauopathies (18 progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP, and 6 corticobasal degeneration, CBD), 20 synucleinopathies (14 Parkinson's disease, PD, and 6 multiple system atrophy, MSA), and 14 HC. PSP and CBD showed higher tau seeding activity at both anatomical sites. A greater sensitivity of 4R-SAA than 3R-SAA was observed. 4R tau-SAA identified tauopathies with 71% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Accuracy was higher for PSP than CBD: PSP vs HC / PD (AUC 0.825), while CBD vs HC / PD (AUC 0.797), and PSP vs MSA (AU 0.778). SAA end-products showed differences in biochemical and morphological characterization according to the anatomical site. Skin tau-SAA identifies tauopathies with good accuracy and can be used to implement the in-vivo clinical diagnosis of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Further characterization of peripheral tau seed in skin may elucidate the structure of tau deposits in brain.

### Skin nerve α-synuclein deposits: a biomarker for idiopathic parkinson disease [^111Jdsoo]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate (1) whether phosphorylated α-synuclein deposits in skin nerve fibers might represent a useful biomarker for idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD), and (2) the underlying pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy associated with IPD.

Methods

Twenty-one well-characterized patients with IPD were studied together with 20 patients with parkinsonisms assumed not to have α-synuclein deposits (PAR; 10 patients fulfilling clinical criteria for vascular parkinsonism, 6 for tauopathies, and 4 with parkin mutations) and 30 controls. Subjects underwent nerve conduction velocities from the leg to evaluate large nerve fibers and skin biopsy from proximal (i.e., cervical) and distal (i.e., thigh and distal leg) sites to study small nerve fibers and deposits of phosphorylated α-synuclein considered the pathologic form of α-synuclein.

Results

Patients with IPD showed a small nerve fiber neuropathy prevalent in the leg with preserved large nerve fibers. PAR patients showed normal large and small nerve fibers. Phosphorylated α-synuclein was not found in any skin sample in PAR patients and controls, but it was found in all patients with IPD in the cervical skin site. Abnormal deposits were correlated with leg epidermal denervation.

Conclusions

The search for phosphorylated α-synuclein in proximal peripheral nerves is a sensitive biomarker for IPD diagnosis, helping to differentiate IPD from other parkinsonisms. Neuritic inclusions of α-synuclein were correlated with a small-fiber neuropathy, suggesting their direct role in peripheral nerve fiber damage.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that the presence of phosphorylated α-synuclein in skin nerve fibers on skin biopsy accurately distinguishes IPD from other forms of parkinsonism.

### A longitudinal skin biopsy study of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in a patient with parkinson disease and orthostatic hypotension [^115w5ZMz]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The aim of our study was to assess the distribution of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-syn) deposits in a patient affected by early stage Parkinson disease and orthostatic hypotension through a longitudinal skin biopsy study. We found widespread p-syn spatial diffusion from deep autonomic dermis nerve bundles to autonomic terminals, suggesting a centrifugal spread of p-syn from ganglia to the innervation target structures. Furthermore, the case suggests the possibility of discriminating synucleinopathies at an early stage of disease by means of skin biopsy. If confirmed, these data support skin biopsy as a useful and promising tool for the diagnosis, longitudinal evaluation, and pathological understanding of Parkinson disease.

### Α-synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy of idiopathic and monozygotic twin patients with Parkinson's disease [^1148AFpH]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, in this work we report the first evidence of previously undetected α-synuclein oligomers in the autonomic nervous system of the skin and propose their quantitative analysis, which could be a reliable diagnostic biomarker for Parkinson's disease. Indeed, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of this parameter are similar to those of scintigraphy, which is already taken into consideration for diagnostic purposes. In addition, our findings in discordant twins suggest the existence of a genetic predisposition, which increases the probability of developing the pathology. However, our data do not unveil the true pathological meaning of the oligomers, as their presence in pathology could be necessary, but not sufficient, in triggering fibre and neuron degeneration. We believe that further investigation of this cohort could be helpful in uncovering the pathological mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of pathologic alpha-synuclein (αSyn) deposits in specific areas of the brain. In association with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), it is part of a spectrum of disorders, the synucleinopathies, characterized by intraneuronal aggregates of αSyn called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (PD and DLB) and by glial cytoplasmatic inclusions of αSyn (MSA).

PD is a multisystem disorder that involves both the central and peripheral nervous system. Indeed, while the overt phenotype of PD is that of a movement disorder characterized by bradykinesia in combination with at least one of rest tremor, rigidity, or postural instability, several non-motor autonomic symptoms affect PD patients in prodromal phases. Typical examples are urinary and gastrointestinal dysfunction, impaired sudomotor function, and orthostatic hypotension. Accordingly, in the last decade, multiple studies have shown evidence of αSyn deposits in peripheral nerve tissues and organs, opening the possibility to access pathological tissue in a minimally invasive way –. This is of utter relevance, considering that the lack of antemortem biomarkers is a major limiting factor for developing specific and effective disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the clinical heterogeneity of PD and the overlapping clinical spectrum with atypical parkinsonisms (AP), namely MSA and AP with tauopathies (AP-Tau), often prevent a proper diagnosis and management of patients, especially in early phases. In particular, αSyn phosphorylated at Serine 129 (P-αSyn) has been detected in colonic mucosa, submandibular glands, skin –, and heartof patients with PD. More recently 5G4 antibody, a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody with high reactivity for aggregated forms of αSyn, and low reactivity for monomeric αSyn –, has been successfully exploited in the skin, submandibular glands, and colonic mucosa. A systematic meta-analysis on in vivo αSyn detection in peripheral tissues has demonstrated that skin biopsy examination using anti-P-αSyn antibody has the best diagnostic accuracy for PD. Moreover, through intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) measurement, skin biopsy allowed to demonstrate and quantify small fiber neuropathy in PD, which confirms the observation of corneal small nerve fiber reduction in confocal microscopy. However, discrepancies of reported specificity and sensitivity, diverse sites of skin biopsy, and lack of standardized protocols, are major issues in using skin biopsy as a definitive diagnostic tool for PD.

### Aggregation and beyond: α-synuclein-based biomarkers in synucleinopathies [^115Japso]. Brain (2024). Medium credibility.

Parkinson's disease is clinically known for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and accumulation of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions rich in alpha-synuclein called 'Lewy bodies' and 'Lewy neurites'. Together with dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease is part of a group of disorders called synucleinopathies. Currently, diagnosis of synucleinopathies is based on the clinical assessment which often takes place in advanced disease stages. While the causal role of alpha-synuclein aggregates in these disorders is still debatable, measuring the levels, types or seeding properties of different alpha-synuclein species hold great promise as biomarkers. Recent studies indicate significant differences in peptide, protein and RNA levels in blood samples from patients with Parkinson's disease. Seed amplification assays using CSF, blood, skin biopsy, olfactory swab samples show great promise for detecting synucleinopathies and even for discriminating between different synucleinopathies. Interestingly, small extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, display differences in their cargoes in Parkinson's disease patients versus controls. In this update, we focus on alpha-synuclein aggregation and possible sources of disease-related species released in extracellular vesicles, which promise to revolutionize the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease progression.

### Update on α-synuclein-based biomarker approaches in the skin, submandibular gland, gastrointestinal tract, and biofluids [^111qHPLX]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is a need for objective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in Parkinson's disease (PD), partly given the expected increase in clinical trials aimed at demonstrating a disease-modifying effect in early disease. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we review recent publications exploring established and novel methodologies to detect α-syn species in tissues and biofluids.

Recent Findings

Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), recent studies have focused on the detection of phosphorylated α-syn (p-α-syn) in cutaneous nerve fibers, reporting varying sensitivity and high specificity for the diagnosis of PD. A predilection for p-α-syn depositions in cutaneous autonomic nerve fibers has emerged, possibly contrasting with other synucleinopathies. Novel studies utilizing the seeding propensity of pathological α-syn have generated encouraging results with regard to diagnostic performance in both tissues and biofluids including skin, submandibular gland, and cerebrospinal fluid.

Summary

Detection of neuronal p-α-syn in skin punch biopsies remains a promising minimally invasive diagnostic tool in PD. Seeding assays have emerged as a new method with its diagnostic potential warranting replication in further studies from various tissues and biofluids. Longitudinal studies employing both IHC and seeding assays are needed to identify possible biomarkers of disease progression.

### In vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies: a comparative study of skin biopsy and RT-QuIC [^112cEKx1]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study demonstrates that immunofluorescence staining of p-syn in skin nerves showed side-to-side optimal reproducibility in a large number of samples of both synucleinopathies and non-synucleinopathies. We found that immunofluorescence exhibited a good level of agreement with RT-QuIC (mainly CSF), supporting their equivalency as diagnostic tools for synucleinopathies. The exact reasons for the discrepancy between positive skin RT-QuIC and negative immunofluorescence, even in routine analysis, in some non-synucleinopathies and control patients remain to be clarified. Because the 2 approaches determine 2 different aspects of the α-synuclein aggregates as mentioned above, a possibility needs to be excluded in the future that there are unphosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates in the skin of patients with certain conditions and those aggregates may be detectable by only RT-QuIC for their prion-like seeding activity but not by immunofluorescence with antibodies for their phosphorylation. Accordingly, this finding could be the expression of a copathology (mixed pathology) in non-synucleinopathies. Similarly, α-synuclein aggregates in the skin sample of patients with neuropathies could be explained by an incidental synucleinopathy occasionally found on autopsy of decedents without showing clinical phenotypes. In addition, the intraneural p-syn deposits detected by immunofluorescence may not have been found in patients with peripheral neuropathy because of the decrease of the peripheral nerve fibers. However, this hypothesis is denied by the absence of p-syn in these patients even in skin sites with likely preserved skin innervation as cervical and thigh sites in routine analysis. We carefully re-evaluated patients with non-synucleinopathies and control patients found to be positive at the skin by RT-QuIC assay, but no clinical signs attributable to a synucleinopathy could be found, although to exclude this possibility patients should undergo a more extensive clinical follow-up.

### Skin nerve phosphorylated α-synuclein in the elderly [^113TyRiR]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

To determine the incidence of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-syn) in skin nerves in very old subjects who are prone to developing incidental Lewy bodies, we prospectively performed skin biopsies on 33 elderly subjects, including 13 (> 85years old) and 20 patients (> 70years) suspected of having an acquired small fiber neuropathy. All subjects underwent neurological examination prior to the biopsy. Two screened female subjects (ages 102 and 98years) were excluded from the study because they showed evidence of a slight bradykinetic-rigid extrapyramidal disorder on neurological examination and were not considered healthy; both showed p-syn in skin nerves. We did not identify p-syn in skin nerves in the remaining 31 subjects. A PubMed analysis of publications from 2013 to 2023 disclosed 490 healthy subjects tested for skin p-syn; one study reported p-syn in 4 healthy subjects, but the remaining subjects tested negative. Our data underscore the virtual absence of p-syn in skin nerves of healthy controls, including those who are very elderly. These data support skin biopsy as a highly specific tool for identifying an underlying synucleinopathy in patients in vivo.

Immunofluorescence vs RT-QuIC to Detect Pathologic α-Synuclein

The p-syn staining in skin nerves disclosed by immunofluorescence showed good agreement with the CSF RT-QuIC assay (κ = 0.9; p < 0.001) but the agreement was lower with skin RT-QuIC (κ = 0.6; p < 0.001) due to positive detection in skin samples by RT-QuIC in non-synucleinopathies (κ = 0.2; p = 0.08) and control patients (κ = 0.3; p < 0.05). For the same reason, skin RT-QuIC showed low agreement with CSF RT-QuIC considering all recruited patients (κ = 0.6; p < 0.001) but the agreement in synucleinopathies was optimal (κ = 1; p < 0.001).

χ 2 test showed that immunofluorescence better discriminates than RT-QuIC between positive vs negative patients among synucleinopathies, non-synucleinopathies, and control patients (χ 2 = 80.1 for immunofluorescence, χ 2 = 37.8 for skin RT-QuIC, and χ 2 = 36.3 for CSF RT-QuIC; p < 0.0001).

### Cutaneous α-synuclein signatures in patients with multiple system atrophy and parkinson disease [^111DzkwG]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein in the nervous system. Clinical features include autonomic and motor dysfunction, which overlap with those of Parkinson disease (PD), particularly at early disease stages. There is an unmet need for accurate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for MSA and, specifically, a critical need to distinguish MSA from other synucleinopathies, particularly PD. The purpose of the study was to develop a unique cutaneous pathologic signature of phosphorylated α-synuclein that could distinguish patients with MSA from patients with PD and healthy controls.

Methods

We studied 31 patients with MSA and 54 patients with PD diagnosed according to current clinical consensus criteria. We also included 24 matched controls. All participants underwent neurologic examinations, autonomic testing, and skin biopsies at 3 locations. The density of intraepidermal, sudomotor, and pilomotor nerve fibers was measured. The deposition of phosphorylated α-synuclein was quantified. Results were compared with clinical rating assessments and autonomic function test results.

Results

Patients with PD had reduced nerve fiber densities compared with patients with MSA (p < 0.05, all fiber types). All patients with MSA and 51/54 with PD had evidence of phosphorylated α-synuclein in at least one skin biopsy. No phosphorylated α-synuclein was detected in controls. Patients with MSA had greater phosphorylated α-synuclein deposition (p < 0.0001) and more widespread peripheral distribution (p < 0.0001) than patients with PD. These results provided > 90% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between the 2 disorders.

Discussion

α-synuclein is present in the peripheral autonomic nerves of patients with MSA and when combined with synuclein distribution accurately distinguishes MSA from PD.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class II evidence that measurement of phosphorylated α-synuclein in skin biopsies can differentiate patients with MSA from those with PD.

### Skin α-synuclein aggregation seeding activity as a novel biomarker for parkinson disease [^114nmFHT]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Deposition of the pathological α-synuclein (αSynP) in the brain is the hallmark of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Whether real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) assays can sensitively detect skin biomarkers for PD and non-PD synucleinopathies remains unknown.

Objective

To develop sensitive and specific skin biomarkers for antemortem diagnosis of PD and other synucleinopathies.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective and prospective diagnostic study evaluated autopsy and biopsy skin samples from neuropathologically and clinically diagnosed patients with PD and controls without PD. Autopsy skin samples were obtained at 3 medical centers from August 2016 to September 2019, and biopsy samples were collected from 3 institutions from August 2018 to November 2019. Based on neuropathological and clinical diagnoses, 57 cadavers with synucleinopathies and 73 cadavers with nonsynucleinopathies as well as 20 living patients with PD and 21 living controls without PD were included. Specifically, cadavers and participants had PD, LBD, MSA, Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration or were nonneurodegenerative controls (NNCs). A total of 8 approached biopsy participants either refused to participate in or were excluded from this study due to uncertain clinical diagnosis. Data were analyzed from September 2019 to April 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Skin αSynP seeding activity was analyzed by RT-QuIC and PMCA assays.

Results

A total of 160 autopsied skin specimens from 140 cadavers (85 male cadavers [60.7%]; mean [SD] age at death, 76.8 [10.1] years) and 41 antemortem skin biopsies (27 male participants [66%]; mean [SD] age at time of biopsy, 65.3 [9.2] years) were analyzed. RT-QuIC analysis of αSynP seeding activity in autopsy abdominal skin samples from 47 PD cadavers and 43 NNCs revealed 94% sensitivity (95% CI, 85–99) and 98% specificity (95% CI, 89–100). As groups, RT-QuIC also yielded 93% sensitivity (95% CI, 85–97) and 93% specificity (95% CI, 83–97) among 57 cadavers with synucleinopathies (PD, LBD, and MSA) and 73 cadavers without synucleinopathies (Alzheimer disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and NNCs). PMCA showed 82% sensitivity (95% CI, 76–88) and 96% specificity (95% CI, 85–100) with autopsy abdominal skin samples from PD cadavers. From posterior cervical and leg skin biopsy tissues from patients with PD and controls without PD, the sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI, 77–100) and 100% (95% CI, 84–100), respectively, for RT-QuIC and 80% (95% CI, 49–96) and 90% (95% CI, 60–100) for PMCA.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study provides proof-of-concept that skin αSynP seeding activity may serve as a novel biomarker for antemortem diagnoses of PD and other synucleinopathies.

### A skin-specific α-synuclein seeding amplification assay for diagnosing Parkinson's disease [^115fdvix]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The seeding amplification assay (SAA) has recently emerged as a valuable tool for detecting α-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates in various clinically accessible biospecimens. Despite its efficiency and specificity, optimal tissue-specific conditions for distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) from non-PD outside the brain remain underexplored. This study systematically evaluated 150 reaction conditions to identify the one with the highest discriminatory potential between PD and non-synucleinopathy controls using skin samples, resulting in a modified SAA. The streamlined SAA achieved an overall sensitivity of 92.46% and specificity of 93.33% on biopsy skin samples from 332 PD patients and 285 controls within 24 h. Inter-laboratory reproducibility demonstrated a Cohen's kappa value of 0.87 (95% CI 0.69–1.00), indicating nearly perfect agreement. Additionally, αSyn seeds in the skin were stable at −80 °C but were vulnerable to short-term exposure to non-ultra-low temperatures and grinding. This study thoroughly investigated procedures for sample preprocessing, seed amplification, and storage, introducing a well-structured experimental framework for PD diagnosis using skin samples.

Skin biopsy procedure and sample preparation

A total of 617 biopsy skin samples were collected from the Department of Neurology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between 2016 and 2022. In our experimental setup, every participant underwent a thorough clinical research assessment. This included evaluating their cognitive and motor functions by conducting a mental state examination using the Mini-Mental State Exam, carrying out a structured physical neurological examination, particularly focusing on motor assessments using the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III motor assessment. All participants were enrolled in a research protocol that allowed for yearly follow-up assessments, with each participant receiving at least one follow-up assessment after their initial visit. Neuroimaging results (MRI, and occasionally FDG PET scans or DaTscan) were reviewed whenever they were available. The diagnosis for each group was determined by movement disorder specialists at the respective sites and later verified by a central consensus committee. αSyn SAA results were not accessible to investigators or the consensus committee during the diagnosis process and therefore, were not considered in the classification of participants. Diagnostic criteria followed established norms: control subjects exhibited no history of parkinsonism and synucleinopathy signs. These samples included 332 subjects with PD who received a clinical diagnosis of probable PD based on the international diagnostic criteria. 28 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 100 with Essential Tremor (ET), 32 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 42 with epilepsy, 6 with viral encephalitis (VE), and 77 HC employing the most recent recommended criteria for AD, PSP, ET, and VE –. Experienced raters diagnosed rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder using video polysomnography according to established criteria. Ethical acquisition of biopsy tissues from the skin of consenting patients was carried out, with approval from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (MRE. No.155). Written informed consent was obtained from patients or legal representatives. Using a ring drill extractor (USHIO, Tokyo, Japan), we conducted a three-millimeter punch biopsy taken from a proximal location (C7 paravertebral: 5 cm from the midline). Multiple studies have reported a significant proximal-distal gradient of pathological αSyn in patients with PD, demonstrating a spine gradient with the cervical site expressing the highest positivity.

### Cutaneous neuropathy in Parkinson's disease: a window into brain pathology [^112NNmzG]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

Our study has some limitations and further studies are needed to determine the exact sensitivity and specificity of skin biopsy as a diagnostic tool and to potentially improve it using higher numbers of samples or by targeted sampling, which would include hair follicles and sweat glands in each biopsy. The present study provides data of a small but well-characterized cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD. When evaluating the frequency of cutaneous p-alpha-synuclein deposition, we need to take into account that diagnosis of PD in our patients is based on clinical symptoms and sensitivity of clinical diagnosis ranges between 70 and 90%. Detection of alpha-synuclein in skin biopsies very much depends on whether autonomic structures like sweat glands, vessels or erector pili muscles are included in the skin section. Furthermore, the inclusion of patients with atypical Parkinsonism would be of interest.

In summary, our data provide evidence for peripheral neurodegeneration as an intrinsic feature of PD. P-alpha-synuclein deposition was found in about half of all patients and may be of diagnostic value, especially in early stages of disease. We demonstrate a strong analogy between CNS and PNS pathology concerning alpha-synuclein deposition, pattern of nerve fiber loss and evidence of impaired axonal transport, implying that skin biopsy might be an interesting "in vivo" method of studying the pathogenesis of PD. In addition to better accessibility compared to autopsy material, skin biopsies could be taken longitudinally to assess individual disease progression, which is a principal shortcoming of any post-mortem study reflecting the terminal stage of a disease. Based on our findings we speculate that two independent mechanisms lead to peripheral neuropathy in PD, retrograde axonal degeneration due to impaired axonal transport and anterograde degeneration due to sensory neuronal cell death. Detection of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in dermal nerve fibers might be a useful diagnostic test for PD with high specificity but low sensitivity.

### Distinctive distribution of phospho-α-synuclein in dermal nerves in multiple system atrophy [^113Km2pG]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

MSA is characterized by deposition of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) in oligodendrocytes and central nervous system (CNS) neurons. After recently detecting phospho-α-Syn (p-α-Syn) in dermal nerve fibers of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we assessed skin biopsies from patients with MSA to evaluate its potential role as a biomarker.

Methods

Skin biopsies of patients with MSA (n = 12), idiopathic PD (n = 30), tauopathies (n = 15), and normal controls (n = 39) were analyzed. P-α-Syn within dermal nerves was detected by immunofluorescence staining.

Results

p-α-Syn was found in 67% of patients with MSA and Parkinson's disease, but not in patients with tauopathy or controls when analyzing 15 consecutive sections. Sensitivity could be increased to 75% and 73%, respectively, by analyzing serial sections. In contrast to PD, where p-α-Syn clustered in autonomic fibers, deposits were mainly found in unmyelinated somatosensory fibers in MSA.

Conclusion

α-Syn pathology in MSA is not restricted to the CNS, and skin biopsy may be useful for the premortem study of p-α-Syn.

### Can we use peripheral tissue biopsies to diagnose Parkinson's disease? A review of the literature [^115Y7eQu]. European Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Phosphorylated α-synuclein (phosαSYN) containing inclusions in neurons (Lewy bodies, LB) and nerve terminals (Lewy neurites, LN), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), are not confined to the central nervous system, but have also been reported in peripheral tissues. However, the usefulness of αSYN/phosαSYN detection in tissues accessible to biopsies as a reliable biomarker for prodromal PD remains unclear. A systematic review of studies using biopsies of skin, olfactory and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of both αSYN and phosαSYN staining in PD patients. Data analysis was hampered by the diversity of the methods used, e.g. choice of biopsy sites, tissue processing, staining protocols and evaluation of the findings. Tissue obtained from GI tract/salivary glands (13 post-mortem, 13 in vivo studies) yielded the highest overall sensitivity and specificity compared to skin (three post-mortem, eight in vivo studies) and olfactory mucosa/bulb (six post-mortem studies, one in vivo study). In contrast to phosαSYN, αSYN was more consistently detectable in peripheral tissues of healthy controls. GI tract/salivary glands appear to be the most promising candidate tissue for peripheral biopsy-taking. phosαSYN is considered as the marker of choice to delineate pathological aggregates from normal αSYN regularly found in peripheral neural tissues. However, the sensitivity and specificity of phosαSYN are not yet acceptable for using phosαSYN as a reliable peripheral biomarker for PD in clinical routine. Further refinement regarding the interpretation of the peripheral αSYN/phosαSYN burden and the phenotypical definition of peripheral LB/LN is needed to optimize screening methods for prodromal PD.

### Skin α-synuclein aggregation seeding activity as a novel biomarker for parkinson disease [^113TF7pw]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. For instance, compared with PD and non-PD controls, the number of cases with non-PD synucleinopathies, such as MSA and LBD, or tauopathies, such as PSP and CBD, is relatively small. Moreover, the number of skin biopsy samples is also limited. Our findings need to be further validated with a large number of cases. Another limitation of our study is that the sensitivity and specificity of RT-QuIC and PMCA assays for αSyn P seeding activity in the biopsy skin samples from living patients were mainly based on the clinical diagnoses of PD and non-PD synucleinopathies. They could be highly variable, mainly dependent on how accurate the clinical diagnosis of individuals in each cohort evaluated is. A follow-up neuropathological autopsy of each case will be critical to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the biopsy skin samples.

### Skin nerve phosphorylated α-synuclein in the elderly [^116mNqfX]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

To determine the incidence of phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-syn) in skin nerves in very old subjects who are prone to developing incidental Lewy bodies, we prospectively performed skin biopsies on 33 elderly subjects, including 13 (> 85 years old) and 20 patients (> 70 years) suspected of having an acquired small fiber neuropathy. All subjects underwent neurological examination prior to the biopsy. Two screened female subjects (ages 102 and 98 years) were excluded from the study because they showed evidence of a slight bradykinetic-rigid extrapyramidal disorder on neurological examination and were not considered healthy; both showed p-syn in skin nerves. We did not identify p-syn in skin nerves in the remaining 31 subjects. A PubMed analysis of publications from 2013 to 2023 disclosed 490 healthy subjects tested for skin p-syn; one study reported p-syn in 4 healthy subjects, but the remaining subjects tested negative. Our data underscore the virtual absence of p-syn in skin nerves of healthy controls, including those who are very elderly. These data support skin biopsy as a highly specific tool for identifying an underlying synucleinopathy in patients in vivo.

### Α-synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy of idiopathic and monozygotic twin patients with Parkinson's disease [^111GpWvW]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we aimed to (i) test the hypothesis that patients with Parkinson's disease are characterized by increased accumulation of α-synuclein oligomers in the synaptic terminals of the autonomic nerve fibres in skin biopsies; and (ii) disclose the role of putative genetic predisposition in contributing to synucleinopathy by evaluating the differential accumulation of oligomers in twins discordant for disease compared to consecutive unrelated Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. Although recent studies have investigated the distribution of α-synuclein oligomeric pathology in the CNS in Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, proving that α-synuclein oligomers are significantly more abundant in affected brains than in controls, to date no evidence has been reported for the peripheral nervous system. Here, we disclose the significant increase in previously undetected α-synuclein oligomeric species within synaptic terminals of the autonomic nerve fibres in consecutive Parkinson's disease patients, compared to consecutive healthy subjects. This finding makes α-synuclein oligomers a reasonably good candidate for becoming a reliable biomarker, at least for sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease. Although no significant difference was detected between the median PLA score of consecutive healthy controls and of healthy twins, the increased prevalence of PLA-positive subjects among healthy twins enabled us to support the notion that genetic predisposition is an important but non-sufficient factor in the aetiology of the disease, and that additional environmental triggers are needed.

### Overlapping presence of β-amyloid, tau, p-tau, and α-synuclein in skin nerve fibers in Alzheimer's disease [^111Tny17]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

As qualitative methods such as IF for tau detection did not discriminate between different diseases, quantitative methods such as ELISA might be required. Along these lines, novel in vivo methods like seeding amplification assays from skin including Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) are promising new tools, for example, in α-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. These methods might likewise demonstrate aggregation and therefore probable pathogenicity which could help explain peripheral symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. The distribution of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins in sweat glands, MAP, or hair follicles may influence autonomic dysregulations, and the presence of these proteins in keratinocytes could potentially affect intraepidermal nerve fiber loss and therefore the development of peripheral sensory neuropathies.

Taken together, detection of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins is possible using skin biopsies, supporting clinical diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases. With further research, skin biopsies may become helpful tools for understanding disease pathology including the peripheral distribution and the multi-step contribution to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

### Α-synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy of idiopathic and monozygotic twin patients with Parkinson's disease [^113GtM4Q]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

A variety of cellular processes, including vesicle clustering in the presynaptic compartment, are impaired in Parkinson's disease and have been closely associated with α-synuclein oligomerization. Emerging evidence proves the existence of α-synuclein-related pathology in the peripheral nervous system, even though the presence of α-synuclein oligomers in situ in living patients remains poorly investigated. In this case-control study, we show previously undetected α-synuclein oligomers within synaptic terminals of autonomic fibres in skin biopsies by means of the proximity ligation assay and propose a procedure for their quantification (proximity ligation assay score). Our study revealed a significant increase in α-synuclein oligomers in consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease compared to consecutive healthy controls (P < 0.001). Proximity ligation assay score (threshold value > 96 using receiver operating characteristic) was found to have good sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (82%, 86% and 89%, respectively). Furthermore, to disclose the role of putative genetic predisposition in Parkinson's disease aetiology, we evaluated the differential accumulation of oligomers in a unique cohort of 19 monozygotic twins discordant for Parkinson's disease. The significant difference between patients and healthy subjects was confirmed in twins. Intriguingly, although no difference in median values was detected between consecutive healthy controls and healthy twins, the prevalence of healthy subjects positive for proximity ligation assay score was significantly greater in twins than in the consecutive cohort (47% versus 14%, P = 0.019). This suggests that genetic predisposition is important, but not sufficient, in the aetiology of the disease and strengthens the contribution of environmental factors. In conclusion, our data provide evidence that α-synuclein oligomers accumulate within synaptic terminals of autonomic fibres of the skin in Parkinson's disease for the first time. This finding endorses the hypothesis that α-synuclein oligomers could be used as a reliable diagnostic biomarker for Parkinson's disease. It also offers novel insights into the physiological and pathological roles of α-synuclein in the peripheral nervous system.

### Evaluation of 6 monoclonal antibodies against ser129-phosphorylated α-synuclein: critical role of proteinase K antigen retrieval and superior sensitivity of the D1R1R clone in human skin biopsies [^113BExsn]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

α-Synuclein is an essential component of synucleinopathies including Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Misfolded-α-synuclein inclusions that contain high levels of Serine-129 phosphorylated (pS129-α-syn) are key diagnostic markers. Skin biopsies are a promising peripheral tissue for in vivo detection of aggregates using immunofluorescence staining. Several primary antibodies target pS129-α-syn but their diagnostic reliability remains uncertain. Common practice relies on clones EP1536Y and 81A without antigen retrieval; however, recent findings have underscored the need to validate additional methodologies and alternative clones. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of the standard protocol, alongside formic acid and proteinase K (PK) antigen retrieval to evaluate 4 additional monoclonal antibodies (J18, BBF19, pSyn#64, and D1R1R) in a cohort of 43 confirmed synucleinopathy patients (7 with MSA) and 33 healthy controls. The results showed that PK increased the detection rates for EP1536Y, 81A, and D1R1R, with D1R1R outperforming the others in sensitivity. J18, BBF19, and pSyn#64 exhibited insufficient specificity, limiting their clinical applicability. The improved accuracy with PK treatment and the promising performance of D1R1R mark critical advancements for reliable diagnosis, highlighting the importance of optimizing protocols and validating antibodies for dependable detection of pathological aggregates in skin biopsies.

### A comparative blind study between skin biopsy and seed amplification assay to disclose pathological α-synuclein in RBD [^112DgQ96]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, skin IF may also be appropriate for the early identification of a specific variant of synucleinopathy in iRBD patients as previous data showed the possibility to differentiate Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy bodies from Multiple System Atrophy based on a prevalent deposition of misfolded α-syn in autonomic or somatic skin nerves, or skin Schwann cells.

This study presents the following limitations: (1) no data regarding the progression and phenoconversion of our iRBD patients into a specific form of synucleinopathy. However, the predictive value of misfolded synuclein in iRBD as a biomarker of phenoconversion has been established by previous papers for both IFand aSyn-SAA; (2) the lack of autopsy-confirmed diagnosis although the clear-cut differences we have found by IF among the investigated patients may support that the selection was made correctly; (3) the suboptimal aSyn-SAA we obtained in CSF can prevent a reliable comparison between CSF and skin assays. Further studies using fully optimized aSyn-SAA in CSF and skin are needed to make a comparison between the diagnostic accuracy of different samples in disclosing pathological α-synuclein by SAA.

### A new potential biomarker for dementia with lewy bodies: skin nerve α-synuclein deposits [^111n2Q39]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether (1) phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-syn) deposits in skin nerves could be useful in differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from different forms of dementia and (2) small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is associated with DLB.

Methods

We studied 18 well-characterized patients with DLB (11 with autonomic dysfunction), 23 patients with nonsynucleinopathy dementia (NSD; 13 with young-onset Alzheimer disease dementia, 6 frontotemporal dementia, and 4 vascular dementia), and 25 healthy controls. All participants underwent skin biopsies from proximal (i.e., cervical) and distal (i.e., thigh and distal leg) sites to study small nerve fibers and deposits of p-syn, considered the pathologic form of α-synuclein.

Results

No p-syn was detected in any skin sample in patients with NSD and controls but was found in all patients with DLB. SFN was found in patients with DLB and the autonomic denervation of skin was more severe in patients with autonomic dysfunctions.

Conclusions

(1) In autonomic skin nerves, p-syn is a sensitive biomarker for DLB diagnosis, helping to differentiate DLB from other forms of dementia, although this needs to be confirmed in a larger, more representative sample; and (2) skin autonomic neuropathy is part of the DLB pathology and may contribute to autonomic symptoms.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that p-syn in skin nerve fibers on skin biopsy accurately distinguishes DLB from other forms of dementia.

### A comparative blind study between skin biopsy and seed amplification assay to disclose pathological α-synuclein in RBD [^1144vmLp]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the immunofluorescence (IF) technique and aSyn-seed amplification assay (aSyn-SAA) of skin and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in disclosing pathological α-syn in idiopathic idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) as early phase of a synucleinopathy. We prospectively recruited 41 patients with iRBD and 40 matched clinical controls including RBD associated with type 1 Narcolepsy (RBD-NT1, 21 patients), iatrogenic causes (2 pt) or OSAS (6 pt) and 11 patients with peripheral neuropathies. IF from samples taken by skin biopsy and aSyn-SAA from skin and CSF samples were analysed blinded to the clinical diagnosis. IF showed a good diagnostic accuracy (89%) that was lower in the case of skin and CSF-based aSyn-SAA (70% and 69%, respectively) because of a lower sensitivity and specificity. However, IF showed a significant agreement with CSF aSyn-SAA. In conclusion, our data may favor the use of skin biopsy and aSyn-SAA as diagnostic tools for a synucleinopathy in iRBD.

### In vivo distribution of α-synuclein in multiple tissues and biofluids in parkinson disease [^112xKnpH]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

With respect to skin, we found a lower prevalence of positive skin biopsies in the S4 PD cohort as compared to other studies. The high specificity of the S4 immunohistochemical method, the neuropathologist training and blinding, and consensus-based decision-making could have resulted in fewer false-positives. The staining protocol in S4 included pretreatment with a protease prior to 5C12 antibody application. Extensive prestudy testing evidenced this method optimized specificity and reduced false-positive staining for nonpathologic forms of α-synuclein. While the 5C12 protocol chosen for S4 was also the most sensitive among multiple tested protocols, it is possible that some methods used by non-S4 groups may be more sensitive. A double-immunostaining protocol for α-synuclein phosphorylated at serine-129 had a 70%–100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for PD diagnosis in small studies, and preliminary work to replicate across sites has demonstrated high reproducibility though lower sensitivity than in the single-center studies. Application of that and other antibodies with specific affinity for toxic/pathogenic forms of α-synuclein, such as truncated or aggregated forms, should be tested, and S4 provides a robust biorepository for such work in the future. Another area of promise that warrants investigation is the application of seeding assays to tissue.

S4 results suggest that tissue α-synuclein positivity (in SMG and skin) is seen across all PD stages. We also noted a relationship between presence of SMG α-synuclein and lower DAT binding, a measure of striatonigral denervation. However, the small sample sizes across disease stages limits interpretation and studies in a larger number of subjects and longitudinal studies are needed to further explore this observation. The higher prevalence of positivity in the advanced PD group argues against the idea that with long-standing PD, loss of peripheral nerve fibers reduces the chances of detection of α-synuclein, at least in the regions biopsied in S4. Our results do not support the hypothesis that peripheral pathology begins before the affection of the CNS in PD, but our study was not designed to test this hypothesis: we did not include prodromal/at-risk subjects and our early PD cohort was small. It is also possible that the 5C12 monoclonal antibody is less sensitive to the species of pathologic α-synuclein seen in early PD. This needs to be tested in a larger and longitudinal cohort that includes participants along a spectrum of increased risk for PD, and again using assays that more accurately detect pathologic forms of α-synuclein, especially in early PD.

### Α-synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy of idiopathic and monozygotic twin patients with Parkinson's disease [^111TJ4Wn]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

α-Synuclein oligomers have recently been indicated as 'a new hope' in the field of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The oligomeric species of α-synuclein consist in small aggregates of the protein that have not yet acquired a fibrillar conformation, which occur in the early stage of the pathology, preceding and probably triggering the formation of pale bodies and Lewy bodies. In this field, searched for oligomeric α-synuclein species in post-mortem brain from Parkinson's disease patients using the proximity ligation assay (PLA), an innovative and simple approach capable of detecting in situ protein interactions (e.g. protein dimerization). The resulting α-synuclein PLA signal was significantly more abundant in patients than in healthy control subjects, confirming the wide distribution of α-synuclein oligomers in Parkinson's disease-affected brains and suggesting the relevance of this approach for studying pathology progression starting from the early stage.

Recently, Parkinson's disease has been redefined as a multisystem disorder not limited to the CNS (reviewed in;). Several clues led to this statement. First, the prodromic stage of Parkinson's disease is often characterized by autonomic non-motor symptoms including constipation and sweating disturbance. Furthermore, the presence of pathological α-synuclein inclusions was confirmed not only along the enteric nervous system and in the autonomic ganglia, but also in other body regions. Second, pure autonomic failure, a syndrome characterized by autonomic symptoms without motor features and due to neurodegeneration of neurons in sympathetic ganglia with α-synuclein-positive Lewy body-like inclusions, frequently evolves into Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy. Furthermore, 123 I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy is able to distinguish Parkinson's disease both from healthy subjects, with 95% sensitivity and 88.9% specificity, and from atypical parkinsonism, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.5%, as the loss of postganglionic sympathetic fibres occurs exclusively in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies patients, not in those affected by multiple system atrophy. The same denervation was observed in the autonomic structures of the skin, i.e. vessels and sweat glands in patients with Parkinson's disease. This alteration translates into the autonomic dysfunction that may be observed in the prodromal stage of Parkinson's disease, including sweating disturbance.

### In vivo distribution of α-synuclein in multiple tissues and biofluids in parkinson disease [^114J5RSg]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The full S4 protocol is available at.

The primary research questions addressed in this study were as follows:

1. What is the diagnostic accuracy of total α-synuclein in CSF, serum, plasma, whole blood, and saliva as an in vivo PD biomarker?
2. What is the prevalence of positive staining for pathologic α-synuclein in skin, SMG, and colon in patients with PD vs HCs and what is its diagnostic accuracy in each of these tissues as a PD biomarker?
3. What is the intraindividual, i.e. within-subject, relationship between α-synuclein in tissues and biofluids?

The design of this study provides Class III evidence for questions 1 and 2 and Class IV evidence for question 3.

Participants

S4, a cross-sectional observational study, enrolled participants from October 2015 to August 2017 at 6 sites in North America. As previously described, the study aimed to recruit 60 individuals with a diagnosis of idiopathic PD. Enrollment criteria were (1) age ≥ 40 years; (2) clinical diagnosis of PD, requiring presence of bradykinesia plus either rest tremor or rigidity; (3) decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) binding on SPECT (based on age-matched normative data); and (4) classification into 1 of 3 groups of disease severity: early PD (≤ 2 years since diagnosis, not treated with dopaminergic medication), moderate PD (2–5 years since diagnosis treated with dopaminergic medication but without motor fluctuations), and advanced PD (≥ 5 years since diagnosis, with motor fluctuations).

Twenty-one HCs, with normal DAT SPECT, were also recruited. In both groups, exclusion criteria were clinical diagnosis of dementia based on the site investigator's determination and comorbid medical conditions precluding specimen acquisition, as described.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents

The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was provided by all participants. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each study site.

### Blinded RT-QuIC analysis of α-synuclein biomarker in skin tissue from Parkinson's disease patients [^115RE9No]. Movement Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

An unmet clinical need in Parkinson's disease (PD) is to identify biomarkers for diagnosis, preferably in peripherally accessible tissues such as skin. Immunohistochemical studies have detected pathological α-synuclein (αSyn) in skin biopsies from PD patients albeit sensitivity needs to be improved.

Objective

Our study provides the ultrasensitive detection of pathological αSyn present in the skin of PD patients, and thus, pathological αSyn in skin could be a potential biomarker for PD.

Methods

The real-time quaking-induced conversion assay was used to detect pathological αSyn present in human skin tissues. Further, we optimized this ultra-sensitive and specific assay for both frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of skin tissues. We determined the seeding kinetics of the αSyn present in the skin from autopsied subjects consisting of frozen skin tissues from 25 PD and 25 controls and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin sections from 12 PD and 12 controls.

Results

In a blinded study of skin tissues from autopsied subjects, we correctly identified 24/25 PD and 24/25 controls using frozen skin tissues (96% sensitivity and 96% specificity) compared to 9/12 PD and 10/12 controls using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin sections (75% sensitivity and 83% specificity).

Conclusions

Our blinded study results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using skin tissues for clinical diagnosis of PD by detecting pathological αSyn. Moreover, this peripheral biomarker discovery study may have broader translational value in detecting misfolded proteins in skin samples as a longitudinal progression marker. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Skin α-synuclein aggregation seeding activity as a novel biomarker for parkinson disease [^112kfybY]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The aggregation seeding capability of αSyn P led to the development of RT-QuIC and PMCA platforms to sensitively detect αSyn P. These assays have recently been applied to CSF and autopsied submandibular gland tissues. However, because of the invasive nature of lumbar puncture for CSF collection, it is not practical to collect CSF for routine early detection of αSyn P during clinical visits or for serial evaluation during clinical trials. Moreover, lumbar puncture for CSF sampling is not always feasible because of relative contraindications, such as anticoagulation, particularly common in elderly patients. In addition, submandibular gland biopsy revealed significantly higher adverse events than skin biopsy based on a recent study that evaluated feasibility and safety of multicenter tissue and biofluid sampling for detection of αSyn P in patients with PD.

To our knowledge, this study has demonstrated for the first time that skin αSyn P has aggregation seeding activity that was significantly higher in individuals with PD and other synucleinopathies than in those with tauopathies and NNCs. The skin-based analyses provided comparable diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to CSF-based assays. Given that skin punch biopsy is relatively easier to perform and much less invasive, skin αSyn P seeding activity may be a more practical antemortem diagnostic biomarker for PD and synucleinopathies. Further studies will be needed to determine if αSyn P seeding activity can be detected in skin preclinically in these diseases. This possibility is supported by our recent findings that skin prion seeding activity is detectable not only in all patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseasebut also far in advance of neuronal damage and clinical signs of prion disease in rodents.

### Diagnostic value of skin RT-QuIC in Parkinson's disease: a two-laboratory study [^111Nmgpp]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Skin α-synuclein deposition is considered a potential biomarker for Parkinson's disease (PD). Real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) is a novel, ultrasensitive, and efficient seeding assay that enables the detection of minute amounts of α-synuclein aggregates. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of α-synuclein RT-QuIC assay of skin biopsy for diagnosing PD and to explore its correlation with clinical markers of PD in a two-center inter-laboratory comparison study. Patients with clinically diagnosed PD (n = 34), as well as control subjects (n = 30), underwent skin punch biopsy at multiple sites (neck, lower back, thigh, and lower leg). The skin biopsy samples (198 in total) were divided in half to be analyzed by RT-QuIC assay in two independent laboratories. The α-synuclein RT-QuIC assay of multiple skin biopsies supported the clinical diagnosis of PD with a diagnostic accuracy of 88.9% and showed a high degree of inter-rater agreement between the two laboratories (92.2%). Higher α-synuclein seeding activity in RT-QuIC was shown in patients with longer disease duration and more advanced disease stage and correlated with the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder, cognitive impairment, and constipation. The α-synuclein RT-QuIC assay of minimally invasive skin punch biopsy is a reliable and reproducible biomarker for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, α-synuclein RT-QuIC seeding activity in the skin may serve as a potential indicator of progression as it correlates with the disease stage and certain non-motor symptoms.

TABLE 1
Conditions with α‐synuclein pathology with or without SAA examinations of CSF or skin

Novel approaches to diagnosis of α‐synucleinopathy using peripheral tissues have emerged, but important caveats remain. α‐Synuclein pathology is found in peripheral organs, which have been implicated as a site of initiation. Because some studies did not find α‐synuclein pathology in the periphery without brain pathology, in contrast to another study, current autopsy studies do not consistently support this position. Studies on peripheral organs may show variable results depending on the sampling, the processing methods, antibodies used, and type of cohorts evaluated, including whether autopsy confirmation was included. Furthermore, the clinical implications of α‐synuclein detected in nasal swabor postmortem in the retinaneed to be explored.

α‐Synuclein SAA has been established not only in CSF, but also in peripheral tissues such as skin. Meta‐analysis on studies, most of which did not include autopsy confirmation, have shown that the pooled sensitivity and specificity to differentiate α‐synucleinopathies from controls using CSF samples and SAA is high, and that overall the biological samples tested to date, the CSF and skin α‐synuclein SAA have demonstrated the best diagnostic performance. Current CSF SAA show that α‐synuclein aggregates are detectable only after α‐synuclein pathology reaches a threshold in the brain. In particular, SAA CSF is less sensitive to detect α‐synuclein pathology restricted to the brainstem or amygdala. Furthermore, several conditions with α‐synuclein pathology defined by neuropathology are yet to be examined using in vivo α‐synuclein SAA biomarkers and the most reliable method needs to be validated (Table 1).

### Tau protein quantification in skin biopsies differentiates tauopathies from α-synucleinopathies [^115SR8uX]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abnormal accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau (τ) is a characteristic feature of atypical parkinsonisms with tauopathies, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. However, pathological τ has also been observed in α-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Based on the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in several neurodegenerative diseases, we characterized and compared τ expression in skin biopsies of patients clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration and in healthy control subjects. In all groups, τ protein was detected along both somatosensory and autonomic nerve fibres in the epidermis and dermis by immunofluorescence. We found by western blot the presence of mainly two different bands at 55 and 70 kDa, co-migrating with 0N4R/1N3R and 2N4R isoforms, respectively. At the RNA level, the main transcript variants were 2N and 4R, and both were more expressed in progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration by real-time PCR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated significantly higher levels of total τ protein in skin lysates of progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration compared to the other groups. Multivariate regression analysis and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of τ amount at both sites showed a clinical association with tauopathies diagnosis and high diagnostic value for progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration versus Parkinson's disease (sensitivity 90%, specificity 69%) and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration versus multiple system atrophy (sensitivity 90%, specificity 86%). τ protein increase correlated with cognitive impairment in progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration. This study is a comprehensive characterization of τ in the human cutaneous peripheral nervous system in physiological and pathological conditions. The differential expression of τ, both at transcript and protein levels, suggests that skin biopsy, an easily accessible and minimally invasive exam, can help in discriminating among different neurodegenerative diseases.

### Cutaneous nerve fiber pathology and function in Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism-a cohort study [^114kUX8D]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small fiber neuropathy has repeatedly been demonstrated in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), with involvement of both autonomicand somatosensorynerve fibers. Furthermore, cutaneous denervation has been suggested as a biomarker of disease progression in PD. In light of studies detecting pathological alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in skin biopsies, either through immunohistochemistryor seeding amplification assays (SAA), neurodegeneration extending beyond the central nervous system in PD has been proposed. This may be of great importance as disease progression from peripheral to central, in the proposed body first subtypes, may allow detection before central neurodegeneration.

Small fiber neuropathy and pathological α-syn deposits have been demonstrated in skin biopsies from patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). In contrast, studies are scarce with respect to peripheral neurodegenerative changes in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD), the two other main disease entities within atypical parkinsonism. Atypical parkinsonism remains a challenging differential diagnosis in the evaluation of patients presenting with parkinsonism. Moreover, prognosis and symptomatic treatment options differ substantially from PD, why additional diagnostic and prognostic minimally invasive tools are needed.

With the present study, we aimed to evaluate cutaneous small fibers focusing on structural, functional, and pathological features, in a cohort of participants with PD, atypical parkinsonism, and healthy controls (HC). We sought to detect possible cross-sectional discriminative features and associations with measures of disease burden. Using a longitudinal study design, we further aimed to explore potential markers of disease progression over time.

### Comparing GBA1-parkinson's disease and idiopathic Parkinson's disease: α-synuclein oligomers and synaptic density as biomarkers in the skin biopsy [^117Mxh9v]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, the search for a reliable biomarker on peripherally collected material (plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) provided evidence that glucosylceramide levels in plasma could be used as a biomarker for selecting and monitoring patients in clinical trials targeting GBA1 ‐associated PD (GBA1 ‐PD;). Furthermore, the α‐synuclein seed amplification assay for analyzing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was able to classify both iPD and GBA1 ‐PD with high sensitivity and specificity. Besides blood and CSF, the peripheral nervous system could represent an accessible and valuable source for the discovery of novel biomarkers and for better unraveling pathogenic mechanisms involved in PD. We recently identified α‐synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy and demonstrated that these aggregates are a reliable biomarker for distinguishing iPD from healthy controls (HC).

In the present study, we focused on a cohort of GBA1 ‐PD patients aiming to: (i) understand if α‐synuclein oligomer accumulation is a common feature also in PD patients with a strong genetic component, (ii) investigate whether GCase expression changes in synaptic terminals of autonomic structures in skin biopsies, and (iii) unravel indicators that could differentiate patients with specific GBA1 mutations.

### Dermal phospho-α-synuclein deposits confirm REM sleep behaviour disorder as prodromal Parkinson's disease [^114qaukk]. Acta Neuropathologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD), like other neurodegenerative disorders, does not start suddenly, but progresses through early "prodromal" stages, in which the defining motor symptoms have not yet emerged. This poses an important obstacle in clinical research for disease-modifying therapies, as PD only becomes clinically obvious when patients have already lost 80% of dopaminergic nerve terminal function in the posterior putamen and an estimated 30–50% of nigral dopaminergic neurons have died. A definite diagnosis of PD is based on pathologic confirmation of alpha-synuclein containing Lewy bodies and dopamine neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta with a pre-mortem history of Parkinsonism, but this "gold standard" is only established after death.

We and others have recently proposed that histopathological confirmation of PD may be advanced by pre-mortem biopsies demonstrating phosphorylated Ser129-alpha-synuclein (p-alpha-syn) deposition within neurons and neurites of the enteric nervous system, the submandibular gland, or the skin, closely resembling the central nervous system pathology. Skin biopsies are particularly easy to perform. Peripheral p-alpha-syn pathology within dermal nerve fibres has proven to have high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PD from tauopathies or other atypical forms of Parkinsonism.

So far, dermal p-alpha-syn deposition has only been studied in patients with clinically manifest, i.e. motor PD. It is unknown if dermal nerve fibres become involved in the disease process during premotor stages and how they relate to other markers of prodromal PD. In this study, we address the potential value of dermal p-alpha-syn deposition as a premotor histopathological biomarker of PD by evaluating skin biopsies in patients with REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), a well-established clinical non-motor risk marker of PD. Patients with RBD have an approximately 85% risk of conversion into a clinically manifest alpha-synucleinopathy [dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), PD or multiple system atrophy (MSA)] within 15–20 years, among which PD and DLB are the most frequent. Accordingly, neuropathological studies of patients with RBD have revealed the presence of Lewy bodies in the brainstem.

### Skin nerve phosphorylated α-synuclein in the elderly [^111L7UXU]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study showed: (1) absent abnormal aggregates of p-syn in skin nerves of very elderly subjects without signs of synucleinopathy; (2) abnormal skin p-syn in 2 elderly subjects who did not complain of symptoms but showed signs of a slight bradykinesia on neurological examination; and (3) virtually absent skin p-syn deposits in a large number of healthy subjects reported in the recent scientific literature.

These data underscore the virtual absence of p-syn in the skin innervation of controls, including healthy individuals, even those who are elderly, such as centenarians. These findings support the reliability of skin biopsy as a biomarker for PD and other synucleinopathies, as it is a highly specific tool to identify patients with an underlying synucleinopathy in vivo.

ILB refer to the presence of Lewy bodies and/or Lewy neurites in the CNS and PNS of elderly individuals not known to be affected by parkinsonism and/or dementia. The incidence of abnormal α-synuclein aggregates in the brain increases with age; it has been reported as 4.7% in the sixth decade, 9.3% in the seventh decade, and 12.8% in the eighth decade. In an autopsy case study of the elderly African population, the prevalence of ILB was 5.3%. However, the prevalence data of ILB in postmortem series are highly variable, ranging from 0% to 34%. Taken together, the reported mean prevalence of ILB is approximately 10%–15% of the autopsy population. In addition, isolated p-syn deposits in the peripheral autonomic nerves in the heart and adrenal gland without evidence of CNS Lewy bodies have also been reported in autopsies. This suggests the possibility of ILB restricted to the PNS as a prodromal phase of pure autonomic failure.

### Α-synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy of idiopathic and monozygotic twin patients with Parkinson's disease [^112PPSkA]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the increasing body of evidence related to defects of the autonomic nervous system in Parkinson's disease, many studies have investigated the distribution of α-synuclein pathology in the peripheral nervous system looking for an early marker of the pathology and focusing mainly on the presence and accumulation of total and phosphorylated α-synuclein (reviewed in). To date, the only study concerning α-synuclein oligomers in the autonomic nervous system was performed using the PLA technique in gastrointestinal biopsies of patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy control subjects. Despite the positive outcome of peripheral PLA staining, the detection of α-synuclein oligomers in gastrointestinal samples was not considered adequate to diagnose or predict Parkinson's disease.

In this scenario, the aim of the present study was to search for α-synuclein oligomers in the peripheral nervous system by focusing on skin biopsies, which constitute a simple and minimally invasive model to detect α-synuclein-related pathology in living patients. As studies on monozygotic twins offer the opportunity to control for many potential confounders encountered in general population studies [i.e. differences in genetic background, early-life environmental exposure, age and gender], we conducted a comparative analysis in a cohort of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy subjects including a noteworthy subgroup of monozygotic twins discordant for the disease.

### In vivo diagnosis of synucleinopathies: a comparative study of skin biopsy and RT-QuIC [^116akWXg]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Recruited patients and controls were matched for age and disease duration. Males were more prevalent in each group except for patients with non-synucleinopathies used for comparison between immunofluorescence vs RT-QuIC, in which females were more represented (table 1). As expected, RBD incidence was highly prevalent in synucleinopathies, and none of the non-synucleinopathies or control patients presented with this sleep disorder. Also as expected, nigrostriatal DaTscan abnormalities were more prevalent in patients with synucleinopathies than in those with non-synucleinopathies and controls, but cerebral MRI abnormalities were similar among recruited patients (table 1), although the specific type of abnormality differed in each group, as expected.

Immunofluorescence Staining of Pathologic P-Syn in Skin Nerves

P-syn staining in skin nerves was reproducible between 2 pairs of neighboring skin samples in all sites (table 2). In all 29 skin sites analyzed (19 C7, 8 distal leg, and 2 thigh), p-syn showed the same results, supporting the comparison between a pair of skin samples analyzed with immunofluorescence with a neighboring pair analyzed with a different technique.

Table 2
Reproducibility of Phosphorylated α-Synuclein Staining in Close Skin Sample Pairs

Considering samples selected for the comparison study, p-syn positivity was disclosed in all synucleinopathies except 3 patients (2 with MSA and 1 with PAF), but importantly, it was not found in any non-synucleinopathies or control patients. The patient with PAF negative for p-syn in the selected skin sample was instead positive in both additional routinely analyzed skin sites, that is, the C7 and leg, whereas patients with MSA showing no p-syn in selected samples were negative even in routinely analyzed C7 and thigh sites. Routine immunofluorescence analysis (including additional 2 or 4 skin samples and 6 or 12 skin sections) did not reveal any p-syn positivity in non-synucleinopathies and control patients in agreement with the results of skin samples selected for the study. The p-syn positivity differed among patients with synucleinopathies, being mainly detected in autonomic fibers of PD, DLB, and PAF, but detected in somatic fibers of the upper dermis in MSA, confirming previous data. The analysis of sensitivity and specificity showed that p-syn presented a high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating synucleinopathies from non-synucleinopathies and controls with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity (table 3). Logistic regression model showed no influence of age, sex, or disease duration on the results.

### Gastrointestinal biopsy obtained during cancer screening, a biological marker for α-synucleinopathy? [^115oMcjS]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, because there are no diagnostic tests that allow for a conclusive diagnosis of a LBD, at an early stage of the disease, up to 20% of patients in the early stages are misdiagnosed. Since the discovery of altered αS as a constituent of hallmark lesions in LBD, that is Lewy bodies, postmortem (PM) neuropathological examination, and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of this altered protein have become the gold standard in diagnostics.

Numerous studies have addressed the detection of αS pathology in peripheral tissues, particularly in skin, intestine, and submandibular gland that are suitable for in vivo sampling. Regarding the intestine, altered αS has been detected in various gastrointestinal (GI) tissue samples, ranging from the esophagus to the rectum in PD patients. Noteworthy, however, positive αS staining has also been detected in the GI tract in unimpaired subjects, probably representing subjects in a preclinical stage of LBD. As early as 1990, a mass cancer screening applying colonoscopy was suggested to be used for identification of pathology in this location. Thus, the GI tract might be a promising peripheral tissue to assess for αS pathology as the tissue is readily available for biopsy during routine endoscopic procedures, particularly since colonoscopy is a routine screening tool in subjects aged 60 years and above in many countries.

In this study, we assessed whether αS pathology was readily detected in GI biopsies. The subjects that were included had displayed αS pathology in the brain at PM neuropathological assessment. The goal was to identify whether the pathology observed in the GI biopsy was in line with the pathology observed in the brain. In parallel, we conducted a critical assessment of the methods applied.

### Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy: the role of autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy (an evidence-based review) [^114sq6x7]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) — epidemiology and diagnostic basis are outlined with prevalence estimates and the foundational diagnostic approach. The overall prevalence is ~2,400 (2.4%) per 100,000 population, but in individuals older than 55 years the prevalence rises to ~8,000 (8%) per 100,000. This practice parameter provides recommendations for the evaluation of DSP and addresses the role of autonomic testing, nerve biopsy, and skin biopsy for assessment, and the diagnosis of DSP should be based on a combination of clinical symptoms, signs, and electrodiagnostic criteria.

### A skin-specific α-synuclein seeding amplification assay for diagnosing Parkinson's disease [^115Z3qnZ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Definitive diagnosis of PD relies on postmortem identification of disease‐associated α‐synuclein (αSynD), characterized by the presence of misfolded protein aggregates in the central nervous system (CNS), a clinical acquisition that proves exceptionally challenging. Substantial evidence supports the notion that pathological αSyn aggregates exhibit prion-like characteristics in recruiting and converting free monomers and are capable of undergoing cell-to-cell transmission between the central and peripheral regions –. This unveils the opportunity to identify αSynD beyond the central nervous system (CNS). Development of a reliable and sensitive assay for detecting extracranial pathological αSyn aggregates can, to a certain extent, reflect the deposition level of central αSynD. Consequently, SAA was designed to facilitate the exponential replication of pathological αSyn in vitro, allowing for the effective detection of traces of αSyn aggregates in biological samples with high sensitivity and specificity. The utilization of in vitro amplification systems for the detection of αSynD in the skin as an easily accessible extracranial sample, represents an innovative approach for pre-mortem diagnosis. Previous studies have shown the diagnostic potential of SAA by successfully amplifying αSynD from synucleinopathies utilizing skin samples –. Despite the initial findings, establishing SAA as a routine diagnostic test in clinical practice necessitates thorough validation and standardization. Few studies address the complete process to standardize the entire procedure, encompassing sample pretreatment, storage, and tissue-specific αSynD amplification in PD. These factors have the potential to artificially decrease or increase αSyn seeding activity, leading to false positive or negative results. Hence, we systematically evaluated 150 distinct reaction conditions, incorporating various thermal conditions, monomeric species, and different additives seeded with fully characterized skin homogenates from a PD patient and a healthy control(HC). The outcome of this evaluation led to the development of a thermal-dependent (50 °C) amplification assay, ensuring the detection of αSynD with sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

### Value of in vivo α-synuclein deposits in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168e4fL]. Movement Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Previous studies that have investigated the potential of in vivo abnormal α-synuclein deposits as a pathological biomarker for PD included few participants and reported different diagnostic accuracies. Here, we aimed to confirm the diagnostic value of in vivo α-synuclein deposits in PD through a systematic review and meta-analysis, with special emphasis on determining the tissue most suitable for examination and assessing whether anti-native α-synuclein or anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibodies should be used. Databases were searched on December 30, 2018. We finally included 41 case-control studies that examined in vivo tissue samples using anti-native α-synuclein or anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody in PD patients and controls. Using a univariate random-effects model, pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) of anti-native α-synuclein antibody were 0.54 (0.49–0.60) and 0.72 (0.68–0.76) for the gastrointestinal tract and 0.76 (0.60–0.89) and 0.60 (0.43–0.74) for the skin. Pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% confidence interval) of anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody were 0.43 (0.37–0.48) and 0.82 (0.78–0.86) for the gastrointestinal tract, 0.76 (0.69–0.82) and 1.00 (0.98–1.00) for the skin, 0.42 (0.26–0.59) and 0.94 (0.84–0.99) for the minor salivary glands, and 0.66 (0.51–0.79) and 0.96 (0.86–1.00) for the submandibular glands. Although ubiquitous heterogeneity between the included studies should be noted when interpreting our results, our analyses demonstrated the following: (1) in vivo α-synuclein immunoreactivity has the potential as a pathological biomarker for PD; (2) anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody consistently has higher specificity than anti-native α-synuclein antibody; and (3) skin biopsy examination using anti-phosphorylated α-synuclein antibody has the best diagnostic accuracy, although feasibility remains an important issue. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Tau seeding activity in skin biopsy differentiates tauopathies from synucleinopathies [^114TLgbk]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical skin biopsy showed the highest sensitivity for tauopathies, while ankle biopsy results were more specific and did not show any positivity for TauK18 in both synucleinopathies and HC. In analogy, several studies on pathologic alpha-synuclein in skin biopsies showed higher sensitivity of cervical area in differentiating PD. The cervical area bears the advantage of being anatomically closer to the CNS and brainstem. Another explanation may be related to the physiologically higher innervation density in proximal vs distal skin, with consequently higher amount of tau and higher propensity to seed/aggregate. This might also explain the lower aggregation activity in PD in cervical compared to MSA and HC; indeed, several studies have reported a skin denervation in proximal sites in PD.

Differences in anatomical regions were also noted in terms of biochemical characterization of TauK18-SAA end-products in PSP and CBD, where higher PK-resistance and more pronounced differences in banding profiles of aggregates generated in ankles were detected than in cervical. This finding and the absence of false positive reactions in ankle may suggest that skin TauK18-SAA from ankle is more specific, even if less sensitive. Of note, the final aggregates in HC and alpha-synucleinopathies positive to the assay showed no PK-resistance, differently from those generated in PSP and CBD. Thus, although these findings are based on a limited number of cases, we observed different biochemical properties of SAA end-products according to disease group, anatomical area, and within the same subject. In line with these results, the morphological analysis of SAA end-products by TEM confirmed diverse structures of fibrils in ankle vs cervical area and within the same subjects. Albeit it is still debated if SAA end-products can mirror the pathological aggregates in brain, this finding supports the concept that a different cellular environment might dictate a different seed in the same patient.

RT-QuIC Evaluation of Pathologic α-Synuclein Seeding Activity

RT-QuIC Assay of Skin Samples

The pathologic α-synuclein seeding activity of the skin punch biopsy samples from the 3 groups of patients was detected by RT-QuIC assay. The cutoff value for defining the positive seeding activity was 45,414 (attribute unit [au]) based on the mean α-synuclein seeding activity of control plus 3 SDs. The skin RT-QuIC assay yielded 86% sensitivity and 80% specificity (table 3) in disclosing synucleinopathies, lower than immunofluorescence due to 9 out of 38 patients with non-synucleinopathies showing positive α-synuclein ThT fluorescence reaction. In addition, 3 out of 24 control patients showed a positive α-synuclein ThT fluorescence reaction (table 4). Positive patients with non-synucleinopathies and controls did not show any clinical sign of parkinsonism, dysautonomia, or cerebellar dysfunction at the time of recruitment or careful clinical reassessment carried out after 14 ± 3 months (mean ± SE). The mean skin α-synuclein ThT fluorescence reaction from patients with synucleinopathies (n = 31) was significantly higher than that from patients with non-synucleinopathies (n = 38) (125.575 ± 10.525 [SE] vs 41.295 ± 5.674, au, p < 0.001, figure 2) and that from controls (n = 24) (125.575 ± 10.525 vs 29.073 ± 4.064, au, p < 0.001) (figure 3A), respectively. RT-QuIC reaction was higher than in control patients even considering only the 3 positive controls (125.575 ± 10.525 vs 73.744 ± 13.047; p = 0.10). In contrast, there was no significant difference in skin α-synuclein ThT fluorescence intensity between non-synucleinopathies and controls (41.295 ± 5.674 vs 29.073 ± 4.064, au, p = 0.359) (figure 3A). Age, sex, and disease duration did not influence the results by using a logistic regression model.

### Lewy body pathology involves cutaneous nerves [^114Qgs84]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Involvement of the peripheral autonomic nervous system is a core feature of Lewy body (LB) diseases, including Parkinson disease (PD), PD with dementia, and dementia with LBs. To investigate the potential use of skin biopsy for the diagnosis of LB diseases, we assessed anti-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in peripheral nerves in samples of skin from the abdominal wall and flexor surface of the upper arm in 279 prospectively studied consecutively autopsied patients whose data were registered at the Brain Bank for Aging Research between 2002 and 2005. Positive immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the unmyelinated fibers of the dermis in 20 of 85 patients with LB pathology in the CNS and the adrenal glands, the latter representing a substitute for peripheral autonomic nervous system sympathetic ganglia; no reactivity was seen in 194 patients without CNS LB pathology. In 142 retrospectively studied patients autopsied from 1995 onward who had subclinical or clinical LB disease, the sensitivity of the positive skin immunoreactivity was 70% in PD and PD with dementia and 40% in dementia with LBs. Skin immunoreactivity was absent in cases of multiple-system atrophy, progressive nuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. We demonstrate for the first time that the skin is involved and may be a highly specific and useful biopsy site for the pathological diagnosis of LB diseases.

### Α-synuclein oligomers in skin biopsy of idiopathic and monozygotic twin patients with Parkinson's disease [^116zeoux]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, peripheral α-synuclein oligomer pathology in Parkinson's disease has been studied by, who investigated the distribution of oligomeric species of α-synuclein within nerve fibres of gastrointestinal samples from patients and healthy controls using the PLA technique. Surprisingly, they did not find any significant difference between the two cohorts, probably because of a methodology-related misinterpretation of data. The authors selected the number of nuclei as a normalization factor in the quantitative analysis, which does not reflect the quantity of nerve fibres in the tissue and flattens any possible difference. Furthermore, they selected calretinin as neuronal marker, although this calcium-binding protein identifies only a subpopulation of neurons. On the contrary, another investigation on gastrointestinal samples performed using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification technique, proved to be able to distinguish between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy subjects based on the detection of α-synuclein aggregates and similar results were obtained by means of real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) on CSF and olfactory mucosa, thus supporting the presence of α-synuclein pathology both in the peripheral nervous system and in fluids. Here we analysed skin biopsies and showed that 82% of consecutive Parkinson's disease patients displayed an increase in α-synuclein oligomers compared to consecutive healthy subjects, in 86% of whom oligomers were absent or present in low quantities. Previous studies investigated the distribution of α-synuclein in skin biopsy from living patients by immunohistochemical assays, but different and controversial outcomes arose. Although total α-synuclein was detected both in patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects, its amount was greater in patients. In addition, Gibbons and colleagues reported that the biopsy site does not affect the potency of total α-synuclein detection (90% sensitivity and specificity); for this reason we selected the biopsy site that is best-tolerated by the patients according to our clinical experience, namely the volar forearm. Further studies in the field suggested that the accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein in skin biopsy could constitute a high-sensitivity biomarker, which successfully enables the distinction between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy subjects. Study findings on phosphorylated α-synuclein deposits in skin biopsies have provided different ranges of sensitivity and specificity.reported a 100% specificity and a sensitivity that depends on the biopsy site (ranging from 31% in distal leg, to 100% in cervical site), whereas more recently, reported a value of 84% for both parameters, which is consistent with our results. The significance of phosphorylation in the biology and pathophysiology of the protein is controversial. Despite some reports suggesting that phosphorylated α-synuclein promotes inclusion formation in vitro and in cellular models, other studies reported that, in human brain, phosphorylation of α-synuclein appears to take place in more advanced stages of disease. On the other hand, α-synuclein oligomerization was described as an early event in the pathology that occurs independently of the phosphorylation process. Thus, our findings on α-synuclein oligomers reveal an intracellular event that may occur earlier than phosphorylation of α-synuclein aggregates. This is not in contrast to the current state of the art in the field, but rather it provides further information and insight into the mechanisms underlying onset and progression of α-synuclein pathology.

### Skin nerve phosphorylated α-synuclein deposits in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder [^112kbwar]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To test if phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-syn) deposits can be detected by means of skin biopsy in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) as a potential early histopathologic marker of impending synucleinopathy.

Methods

Proximal (cervical) and distal (legs) samples of skin biopsy were obtained from 12 patients with polysomnographically confirmed iRBD and 55 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HC). P-α-syn deposits were assessed with a monoclonal antibody against p-α-syn at serine 129, disclosed by an immunofluorescence method. In addition, patients underwent an extensive workup in order to search for nonmotor symptoms and neuroimaging findings usually associated with impending neurodegeneration and to exclude subtle motor or cognitive signs.

Results

P-α-syn deposits were detected in 9 (75%) out of 12 patients with iRBD and none of the HC. In iRBD, the sensitivity of the test was higher at the cervical site (67%) when compared to the leg site (58%).

Conclusions

Our preliminary findings suggest that skin biopsy in patients with iRBD might be a safe and sensitive procedure to be further tested in order to detect p-α-syn deposits in the premotor stage of synucleinopathies.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class III evidence that p-α-syn skin deposits identify patients with iRBD.

### Tau seeding activity in skin biopsy differentiates tauopathies from synucleinopathies [^1163cGfW]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment

Patients underwent clinical assessment by: H&Yscale, MDS-UPDRS, MMSE, MoCA, Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS-31), RBDSQ. Patients with tauopathies also underwent Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB)scale. LEDDwas calculated for all patients. As part of the diagnostic work-up, 5 patients with tauopathies (4 PSP, 1CBD) underwent CSF β amyloid 42/40 ratio, total, and phospho-tau analysis, which resulted within normal ranges. All patients underwent brain MRI imaging that was rated negative for atrophy patterns suggestive of AD. Further, we performed α-synuclein-SAA in cervical skin biopsy in the group of alpha-synucleinopathies to support their clinical diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 2). It resulted positive in 17/20 patients with synucleinopathies (11/14 PD and 6/6 MSA) and 1/6 HC (sensitivity 85%, specificity 83%) in line with previously published reports,]. However, PD patients who tested negative at α-synuclein-SAA had enough clinical and supportive criteria for the diagnosis of PD, and the results may be related to the limitation of the assay.

Skin biopsy collection and skin homogenate

On the more clinically affected side, a 3-mm-diameter punch skin biopsy was performed in the neck at the C8 dermatomal level (cervical) and the distal leg 10 cm above the lateral malleolus (ankle). The biopsies were stored at −80 °C until use.

Frozen skin samples were washed in ice-cold PBS 1X (Sigma) at least three times to remove blood and homogenized at 1% in lysis buffer in tubes containing zirconia beads (0.7 mm, BioSpec) to facilitate the tissue disruption. Homogenization was performed with TissueLyser LT (Qiagen): 1'lysis/1'ice ×5 times. Lysates were used for SAA analyses.

### In vivo distribution of α-synuclein in multiple tissues and biofluids in parkinson disease [^115qZmsm]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Parkinson disease (PD) accounts for a large proportion of the global burden of disease. Many clinical trials in PD have failed to identify disease-modifying therapies. To have a meaningful impact, intervention likely must occur in the earliest stages of pathology. Accurate PD biomarkers are needed to enable early diagnosis, test for target engagement, and serve as surrogate measures of disease in clinical trials.

α-Synuclein is a lead candidate PD biomarker based on its key role in PD pathophysiology. Studies show tremendous overlap between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) in total α-synuclein values in biofluids, likely due to various factors. There are, in addition, conflicting reports on occurrence of pathologic α-synuclein in peripheral tissue in PD, attributable to methodologic factors including specimen acquisition/processing, α-synuclein staining methods, and neuropathologist expertise and blinding. Studying the distribution of α-synuclein across the central and peripheral nervous system in vivo in patients with PD alongside HCs contributes to our understanding of PD pathophysiology, distribution of α-synuclein pathology, and disease progression.

The Systemic Synuclein Sampling Study (S4) assessed key gaps in knowledge by comparing interindividual and intraindividual total α-synuclein in CSF and peripheral (blood, saliva) fluid compartments, and the occurrence of immunohistochemically defined α-synuclein pathology in 3 peripheral tissues (colon, skin, and submandibular gland [SMG]) at different PD stages compared to HCs. Analyzing biofluids and tissue, we tested 2 main hypotheses: that (1) α-synuclein biomarkers in CSF and SMG have the highest sensitivity and specificity for PD diagnosis and (2) there are significant relationships among within-subject measures of α-synuclein.

### Introduction to the DETeCD-ADRD special issue [^115XgrzV]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

With this comprehensive guideline, we attempt to provide rigorous, evidence‐ and practice‐informed foundational steps that capture the core elements of a high‐quality evaluation and disclosure process formulated into practical recommendations that are applicable to any practice setting, including primary care, along with additional guidance for specialists and subspecialists. In this special issue of Alzheimer's & Dementia, the three executive summaries by the DETeCD‐ADRD workgroup distill these recommendations, briefly summarize the evidence supporting them, and attempt to operationalize them as a series of steps in an evaluation process — starting with patient‐centered goal‐setting and ending with compassionate disclosure of results. A comprehensive report hosted online provides extensive details about the guideline development methodology, evidence review process, peer review process, rationale and recommendations for implementation, and specific narratives with evidence supporting each recommendation. This 2024 CPG provides a comprehensive foundation for a person‐centered diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process within which some details will likely require modification as new clinical tools and biomarkers transition from research settings and become sufficiently validated, approved, accessible, and covered by payors for appropriate clinical use in real‐world practice. For example, we expect that in the next 12–18 months some AD blood‐based biomarkers (BBMs) (e.g. phosphorylated tau‐217 [p‐tau217] and related ratios and multiplex tests) may be sufficiently validated, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, reimbursed, and will have appropriate use recommendations (AURs) available to support their inclusion as part of another DETeCD‐ADRD CPG formal recommendation and to be slotted into the evaluation process pathways in primary, specialty, and subspecialty settings. Other tools and biomarkers that will likely sufficiently mature soon and have AURs to be considered for more formal inclusion as CPG recommendations and in the process pathways include tau positron emission tomography (PET) and alpha‐synuclein assays (e.g. skin biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)–based seed amplification assays), whereas biomarkers of inflammatory pathways (e.g. glial fibrillary acidic protein or GFAP) and TAR DNA‐binding protein 43 (TDP‐43) may be further away from readiness for transitioning from research to clinical practice.

### Skin nerve phosphorylated α-synuclein in the elderly [^114ZSY2C]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study has 2 important novel findings: first, the search for p-syn in the skin nerves of very elderly (included centenarian) subjects has not previously been reported. This is evident in Table 2 that reports the data from recent previous papers in which the average age of the healthy controls analyzed ranged from 57 to 70 years; the second novel finding is that for the first time we reviewed literature to establish the p-syn positivity in skin nerves using an immunofluorescence technique in a large cohort of healthy subjects. This analysis supports the virtual absence of p-syn deposits in skin nerves and supports the data we obtained in our healthy subjects, indicating that they may extend to a larger group of healthy subjects. In fact, by cumulatively considering the reviewed and the original data of the very elderly and centenarian subjects reported in this work, the established specificity of this technique in differentiating healthy controls from patients suffering from a synucleinopathy is very high (99%). This study supports the use in clinical practice of skin biopsy and the search of skin p-syn by immunofluorescence as a highly specific tool to identify a pathological condition related to synucleinopathies.

Our study has the following limitations. First, the lack of an autopsy study in our recruited subjects prevents us from demonstrating ILB in the brain or peripheral nerves. Thus, we cannot exclude that our recruited subjects had ILB in other parts of the body. However, this aspect is irrelevant for the objective of this study, which was to evaluate ILB in skin nerves in very elderly subjects to support the specificity of skin biopsy as a tool for synucleinopathy. In future studies, the evaluation of the relationship between the correspondence of p-syn deposits in brain, peripheral nerves, and skin could be an important goal to clarify the seeding activity of misfolded α-synuclein in the incidental form of synucleinopathies, and to better understand the pathological characteristics of misfolded α-synuclein in ILB. The second limitation of this study is the small sample size of analyzed subjects, mainly due to the difficulty in recruiting very elderly subjects for even a minimally invasive test. Our conclusions are also supported by the reported findings of the virtual absence of p-syn deposits in hundreds of healthy subjects.

### Immunohistochemical detection of synuclein pathology in skin in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and parkinsonism [^112pAcAT]. Movement Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies reported abnormal alpha-synuclein deposition in biopsy-accessible sites of the peripheral nervous system in Parkinson's disease (PD). This has considerable implications for clinical diagnosis. Moreover, if deposition occurs early, it may enable tissue diagnosis of prodromal PD.

Objective

The aim of this study was to develop and test an automated bright-field immunohistochemical assay of cutaneous pathological alpha-synuclein deposition in patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, PD, and atypical parkinsonism and in control subjects.

Methods

For assay development, postmortem skin biopsies were taken from 28 patients with autopsy-confirmed Lewy body disease and 23 control subjects. Biopsies were stained for pathological alpha-synuclein in automated stainers using a novel dual-immunohistochemical assay for serine 129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein and pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5. After validation, single 3-mm punch skin biopsies were taken from the cervical 8 paravertebral area from 79 subjects (28 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, 20 PD, 10 atypical parkinsonism, and 21 control subjects). Raters blinded to clinical diagnosis assessed the biopsies.

Results

The immunohistochemistry assay differentiated alpha-synuclein pathology from nonpathological-appearing alpha-synuclein using combined phosphatase and protease treatments. Among autopsy samples, 26 of 28 Lewy body samples and none of the 23 controls were positive. Among living subjects, punch biopsies were positive in 23 (82%) subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, 14 (70%) subjects with PD, 2 (20%) subjects with atypical parkinsonism, and none (0%) of the control subjects. After a 3-year follow-up, eight idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder subjects phenoconverted to defined neurodegenerative syndromes, in accordance with baseline biopsy results.

Conclusion

Even with a single 3-mm punch biopsy, there is considerable promise for using pathological alpha-synuclein deposition in skin to diagnose both clinical and prodromal PD. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### Cutaneous neuropathy in Parkinson's disease: a window into brain pathology [^112yxtgn]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

The deposition of alpha-synuclein in the brain, the neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), follows a distinct anatomical and temporal sequence. This study aimed to characterize alpha-synuclein deposition in cutaneous nerves from patients with PD. We further strived to explore whether peripheral nerve involvement is intrinsic to PD and reflective of known features of brain pathology, which could render it a useful tool for pathogenetic studies and pre-mortem histological diagnosis of PD. We obtained skin biopsies from the distal and proximal leg, back and finger of 31 PD patients and 35 controls and quantified the colocalization of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in somatosensory and autonomic nerve fibers and the pattern of loss of different subtypes of dermal fibers. Deposits of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein were identified in 16/31 PD patients but in 0/35 controls (p < 0.0001). Quantification of nerve fibers revealed two types of peripheral neurodegeneration in PD: (1) a length-dependent reduction of intraepidermal small nerve fibers (p < 0.05) and (2) a severe non-length-dependent reduction of substance P-immunoreactive intraepidermal nerve fibers (p < 0.0001). The latter coincided with a more pronounced proximal manifestation of alpha-synuclein pathology in the skin. The histological changes did not correlate with markers of levodopa toxicity such as vitamin B12 deficiency. Our findings suggest that loss of peripheral nerve fibers is an intrinsic feature of PD and that peripheral nerve changes may reflect the two types of central alpha-synuclein-related PD pathology, namely neuronal death and axonal degeneration. Detection of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in dermal nerve fibers might be a useful diagnostic test for PD with high specificity but low sensitivity.

### Combining skin and olfactory α-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAA)-towards biomarker-driven phenotyping in synucleinopathies [^114uyUav]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Seed amplification assays (SAA) are becoming commonly used in synucleinopathies to detect α-synuclein aggregates. Studies in Parkinson's disease (PD) and isolated REM-sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) have shown a considerably lower sensitivity in the olfactory epithelium than in CSF or skin. To get an insight into α-synuclein (α-syn) distribution within the nervous system and reasons for low sensitivity, we compared SAA assessment of nasal brushings and skin biopsies in PD (n = 27) and iRBD patients (n = 18) and unaffected controls (n = 30). α-syn misfolding was overall found less commonly in the olfactory epithelium than in the skin, which could be partially explained by the nasal brushing matrix exerting an inhibitory effect on aggregation. Importantly, the α-syn distribution was not uniform: there was a higher deposition of misfolded α-syn across all sampled tissues in the iRBD cohort compared to PD (supporting the notion of RBD as a marker of a more malignant subtype of synucleinopathy) and in a subgroup of PD patients, misfolded α-syn was detectable only in the olfactory epithelium, suggestive of the recently proposed brain-first PD subtype. Assaying α-syn of diverse origins, such as olfactory (part of the central nervous system) and skin (peripheral nervous system), could increase diagnostic accuracy and allow better stratification of patients.

### Α-synuclein seed amplification assays for diagnosing synucleinopathies: the way forward [^115krmcD]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and the most common synucleinopathy, as alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a prion-like protein, plays an important pathophysiologic role in its onset and progression. Although neuropathologic changes begin many years before the onset of motor manifestations, diagnosis still relies on the identification of the motor symptoms, which hinders to formulate an early diagnosis. Because α-syn misfolding and aggregation precede clinical manifestations, the possibility to identify these phenomena in patients with PD would allow us to recognize the disease at the earliest, premotor phases, as a consequence of the transition from a clinical to a molecular diagnosis. Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a group of techniques that currently support the diagnosis of prion subacute encephalopathies, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These techniques enable the detection of minimal amounts of prions in CSF and other matrices of affected patients. Recently, SAAs have been successfully applied to detect misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in CSF, olfactory mucosa, submandibular gland biopsies, skin, and saliva of patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. In these categories, they can differentiate PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs) from control subjects, even in the prodromal stages of the disease. In differential diagnosis, SAAs satisfactorily differentiated PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy (MSA) from nonsynucleinopathy parkinsonisms. The kinetic analysis of the SAA fluorescence profiles allowed the identification of synucleinopathy-dependent α-syn fibrils conformations, commonly referred to as strains, which have demonstrated diagnostic potential in differentiating among synucleinopathies, especially between Lewy body diseases (LBDs) (PD and DLB) and MSA. In front of these highly promising data, which make the α-syn seeding activity detected by SAAs as the most promising diagnostic biomarker for synucleinopathies, there are still preanalytical and analytical issues, mostly related to the assay standardization, which need to be solved. In this review, we discuss the key findings supporting the clinical application of α-syn SAAs to identify PD and other synucleinopathies, the unmet needs, and future perspectives.

### Skin nerve phosphorylated α-synuclein in the elderly [^112XoMHv]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

There were 11 healthy subjects recruited for this study (6 females, mean age of 92 years, range from 86 to 103 years), without symptoms of synucleinopathy. Patients who needed a skin biopsy because of a suspect of an acquired small fiber neuropathy (10 females, mean age of 79 years, from 71 to 88 years) were recruited because of their ages and absent symptoms of synucleinopathy (i.e. cognitive, parkinsonian, cerebellar or autonomic dysfunctions). Predisposing causes for peripheral neuropathy included diabetes (8 patients), autoimmune connective diseases (8), hepatitis C (2), and deficiency of B12 vitamin (2). In all recruited subjects the neurological examination and MoCA, COMPASS-31, and UPDRS-III and H&Y were in the ranges of normality, thereby excluding possible signs associated with a synucleinopathy.

Skin biopsy

Abnormal aggregates of p-syn in skin nerves were not found in any healthy subjects and patients. A small fiber neuropathy was found in 18 out of 20 patients showing predisposing causes for peripheral neuropathy (Table 1).

Review analysis

A total of 490 healthy subjects were analyzed using p-syn staining with a neuronal marker. In these studies, abnormal p-syn deposits were reported in a single paper in 4 subjects of unspecified age (Table 2).

### Towards optimizing the diagnosis of lewy body dementia: lessons from the NACC [^1111o2Lp]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate that although the specificity of the clinical criteria for LBD in the NACC cohort is remarkably high, missed diagnoses are common, especially among women. The recent advent of α‐synuclein biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid and skin, provides a means to improve sensitivity. The integration of such methods into research cohorts and clinical care has great promise to improve the diagnostic accuracy of LBD with and without AD co‐pathology. This approach is likely to prove useful also in clinical trials of disease‐modifying therapies.

### A comparative blind study between skin biopsy and seed amplification assay to disclose pathological α-synuclein in RBD [^113DqpLQ]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data showed that the IF presented higher diagnostic accuracy than aSyn-SAA mainly because absent positivity in the controls. By contrast, aSyn-SAA, mainly skin, exhibited an acceptable sensitivity in disclosing abnormal α-syn in the iRBD while it showed a lower specificity because of some of positive results in the control group. Accordingly, skin aSyn-SAA showed higher diagnostic accuracy than CSF aSyn-SAA. aSyn-SAA in the skin showed a similar diagnostic accuracy than our previous study made in full-blown α-synucleinopathieswhereas it was lower in CSF did not confirming the previous promising diagnostic accuracy in CSF recently reported even in iRBD. The difference could be explained by experimental procedures mainly related to the different recombinant α-synuclein used. We used a commercially available recombinant α-synuclein whereas a home-made protein was used in other studies. The variable result of aSyn-SAA based on different recombinant α-synuclein sources should be addressed in the future with the aim of optimizing the experimental procedures for aSyn-SAA. The use of skin samples by aSyn-SAA is then a helpful option for the future due to a less invasive procedure than CSF, obtained by a lumbar puncture, which has fewer side effects as also confirmed in this study.

The reason of pathological α-synuclein positivity in controls remains to be clarified but it could be due to an incidental synucleinopathy, although this possibility was not found in previous studies in NT1. We carefully re-evaluated control patients found to be positive at the aSyn-SAA, particularly with RBD-NT1, but no clinical signs attributable to a synucleinopathy could be found expect the patient with a young-onset parkinsonism who probably does not present a classic synucleinopathy considering the lack of LDopa response during a 15 years of neurological follow-up. In addition, the slight abnormal nigro-striatal DatScan found in RBD-NT1 was not associated with the α-synuclein seeding positivity as the abnormality was more frequent in negative aSyn-SAA patients.

The current study and a previous study we have made in full-flown variants of synucleinopathiessupported the use of IF and aSyn-SAA as specific tools to disclose in vivo pathological α-synuclein as biomarker for these disorders.

### Alpha and beta synucleins: from pathophysiology to clinical application as biomarkers [^1173NFXo]. Movement Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Investigations of α‐synuclein in peripheral blood have shown conflicting results, and the diagnostic utility of blood α‐synuclein species for synucleinopathies should be further assessed before considering any routine clinical use. The main hampering issues concern data reproducibility and preanalytical confounders, such as the release of α‐synuclein from blood cells. Plasma and serum t‐α‐synuclein levels were reported to be either higher, lower, or not significantly altered in patients with PD compared with controls, whereas more concordant results were provided by assessing pathological forms of α‐synuclein (Table 1). Increased values of p‐α‐synuclein and o‐α‐synuclein were found in the blood and erythrocytes of patients with PD compared with controls, but other posttranslationally modified species of α‐synuclein have also been assessed. Further studies on larger and longitudinally characterized cohorts will be of great help to verify the reliability and reproducibility of these preliminary findings.

As an extremely intriguing possibility, seed amplification assays (SAAs) are novel ultrasensitive protein amplification methods able to detect protein aggregates in biological samples.SAAs are already used with success for prion disease diagnostics and have now been implemented for identification of patients affected by synucleinopathy. In several works, SAAs showed excellent diagnostic performance in discriminating synucleinopathies from controls and from other neurodegenerative diseases since the prodromal disease stages. Recently, pathological aggregates from patients with PD and MSA could be distinguished in CSF by using a combination of biochemical and biophysical methods on the products of α‐synuclein SAAs.SAAs have also been applied successfully in other biological matrices, such as olfactory mucosa and skin biopsies, revealing high diagnostic accuracy in discriminating MSA from tauopathies and PD from controls, respectively. Further improvement in standardization and validation in different biological matrices is, however, required for the routine use of SAAs in clinical practice.

### Combined measure of salivary α-synuclein species as diagnostic biomarker for Parkinson's disease [^114Fy29J]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy of salivary assays

With regard to diagnostic accuracy of αsyn species and their ratio, no study item alone allowed an accurate diagnosis of PD. Nevertheless, combining p-αsyn/tot-αsyn ratio and o-αsyn yielded 80% sensitivity and 78% specificity. This means that the combination of the two items correctly diagnosed PD in 8/10 patients who have the condition, and correctly identified as HS about 8/10 subjects. The combination of p-αsyn/tot-αsyn ratio and o-αsyn may, thus, be considered as a promising diagnostic tool, particularly when we compared our findings to those reached by other methodological approaches that are summarized in Table 3. CSF tot-αsyn distinguished PD and controls with 75% sensitivity and 65% specificity, while CSF o-αsyn yielded 71% sensitivity and 64% specificity. Better results were obtained by skin biopsy. In fact, a recent meta-analysis showed that pooled sensitivity and specificity of anti-p-αsyn antibody in the skin of PD and HS were 76% (0.69–0.82) and 100% (0.98–1.00), respectively. However, skin biopsy has several methodological problems, including the biopsy site choice, section thickness, antibody selection, and the requirement of skilled personnel for specimen collection and processing. Finally, skin biopsy may not be well-tolerated by some patients. With regard to imaging approaches, the diagnostic accuracy of DatScan imaging, one of the most commonly used techniques in clinical practice, is similar to the clinical diagnostic accuracy in terms of sensitivity (84–98%) and specificity (67%). Transcranial sonography (TCS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can visualize the substantia nigra and may detect changes related to PD. A meta-analysis of 31 studies containing 4,386 participants reported a pooled sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.81–0.85) and a pooled specificity of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.88). Despite these encouraging results, the routine use of TCS as a diagnostic tool needs caution because its accuracy may vary according to the expertise of the operator, the equipment used, and the selection of study subjects.

Peripheral biopsy testing for PD is nearing clinical use as there is a commercially available aSyn skin biopsy assay, the Syn-One test (CND Life Sciences). The SynOne test suggests obtaining samples using 3 mm punch biopsy tools, Zamboni fixative and requires double-immunostaining thick cryosection for neuronal elements (PGP 9.5) and phosphorylated aSyn (pSer129) using immunofluorescence. Unpublished data using the Syn-One test has been presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in 2020 and the Lewy Body Disease association Biofluid/Tissue Biomarker symposium in 2021 reporting high sensitivity (74% from one biopsy site and 96% from three biopsy sites) and 99% accuracy of distinguishing synucleinopathies from controls. This test is not FDA approved but is being further validated in a large multicentered clinical trial (NCT04700722) with a plan to enroll over 300 patients with synucleinopathies (PD: 105, MSA: 40, DLB: 90, pure autonomic failure: 65) and 200 healthy controls who will undergo three skin biopsies at the paracervical, distal thigh, and lower leg sites to determine sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of the current test.

### Comparing GBA1-parkinson's disease and idiopathic Parkinson's disease: α-synuclein oligomers and synaptic density as biomarkers in the skin biopsy [^115RsbTA]. Brain Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

2.1 Subjects

The population of the present cross‐sectional study was composed of 91 subjects: 28 HC, 36 iPD patients, and 27 PD carriers of GBA1 gene variants (see Table 1 for details on demographic and clinical data). All subjects were consecutively enrolled from March 2014 to March 2022 at the Parkinson Institute (Milan, Italy) by neurologists experienced in movement disorders and contributing to the Parkinson Institute Biobank. The diagnosis of PD was made according to the UK Brain Bank criteria. As exclusion criteria, we considered a history of diseases or other conditions potentially leading to peripheral neuropathy or general contraindications for performing a skin biopsy. Genetic analysis was performed as previously described: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using a Chemagic Star workstation (Hamilton, ON, Canada), and the genetic analysis on the GBA1 gene was performed with a combination of different technologies, ranging from allele‐specific PCR to exome sequencing. To ensure the homogeneous assessment of skin biomarkers among the most common GBA1 variants, specific subgroups were also identified, that is, p.N409S (n = 7) and p.L483P (n = 12). The remaining 8 patients carried heterogeneous mutations (biallelic mutation p.N409S/p.E365K, n = 1; biallelic mutation p.N409S/p.N409S, n = 1; p.Q401X, n = 1; c.73delC, n = 1; p.S38X, n = 1; RecNcil, n = 1; p.D448H, n = 1; p.E388K, n = 1). In iPD patients, mutations in GBA1 and other PD‐related genes were excluded. Patients and HC were balanced for age and sex. The following clinical data were collected for all patients: age at PD onset, disease duration, and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD, calculated according to). The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was administered, and the severity of motor symptoms and disease staging were assessed in the medication off state by movement disorder specialists using the UPDRS part III and the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) scale. Other relevant data, including the presence of hyposmia according to medical reports, probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) according to a cut‐off score ≥ 6 in the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ), and constipation (following Rome III criteria) were collected. The presence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) was confirmed based on specific prescription patterns and/or the detection during clinical examination of a fall of at least 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (30 mmHg in patients with supine hypertension) and/or 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 min of standing. Autonomic functions were further investigated using the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS‐31), a self‐administered questionnaire addressing several autonomic domains (orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupillomotor). Cognitive functions were examined using the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).

### Cutaneous neuropathy in Parkinson's disease: a window into brain pathology [^116PXniX]. Acta Neuropathologica (2014). Low credibility.

The deposition of alpha-synuclein in the brain, the neuropathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), follows a distinct anatomical and temporal sequence. This study aimed to characterize alpha-synuclein deposition in cutaneous nerves from patients with PD. We further strived to explore whether peripheral nerve involvement is intrinsic to PD and reflective of known features of brain pathology, which could render it a useful tool for pathogenetic studies and pre-mortem histological diagnosis of PD. We obtained skin biopsies from the distal and proximal leg, back and finger of 31 PD patients and 35 controls and quantified the colocalization of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in somatosensory and autonomic nerve fibers and the pattern of loss of different subtypes of dermal fibers. Deposits of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein were identified in 16/31 PD patients but in 0/35 controls (p < 0.0001). Quantification of nerve fibers revealed two types of peripheral neurodegeneration in PD: (1) a length-dependent reduction of intraepidermal small nerve fibers (p < 0.05) and (2) a severe non-length-dependent reduction of substance P-immunoreactive intraepidermal nerve fibers (p < 0.0001). The latter coincided with a more pronounced proximal manifestation of alpha-synuclein pathology in the skin. The histological changes did not correlate with markers of levodopa toxicity such as vitamin B12 deficiency. Our findings suggest that loss of peripheral nerve fibers is an intrinsic feature of PD and that peripheral nerve changes may reflect the two types of central alpha-synuclein-related PD pathology, namely neuronal death and axonal degeneration. Detection of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein in dermal nerve fibers might be a useful diagnostic test for PD with high specificity but low sensitivity.

### Cutaneous nerve fiber pathology and function in Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism-a cohort study [^1125QmgR]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

There is scientific evidence for ongoing neurodegeneration and alpha-synuclein pathology involving the peripheral nervous system in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We explored putative disease-mirroring properties of cutaneous nerve fibers in patients with PD (n = 20), MSA (n = 12), four-repeat tauopathies (n = 11), and controls (n = 20). Assessments included clinical rating scales, blood sampling, sudomotor testing, skin punch biopsies from the neck and leg, and 1-year follow-up. Skin alpha-synuclein seeding amplification assay (SAA) and determination of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) were performed. Reduced electrochemical skin conductance was evident in MSA, associated with clinical rating scores. Cervical skin SAA (PD vs controls) achieved a 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity for detecting PD. We found no difference in baseline IENFD, nor in 1-year changes, in patients relative to controls. Baseline IENFD, plasma neurofilament light, and SAA kinetics associated with 1-year clinical disease progression in MSA. Skin may harbor promising prognostic properties in MSA.

### Skin nerve misfolded α-synuclein in pure autonomic failure and parkinson disease [^1151YE9N]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the expression in skin nerves of native (n-syn) and misfolded phosphorylated (p-syn) α-synucleins in pure autonomic failure (PAF) and idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD). The specific aims were to (1) define the importance of n-syn and p-syn as disease biomarkers and (2) ascertain differences in abnormal synuclein skin nerve deposits.

Methods

We studied 30 patients, including 16 well-characterized IPD patients and 14 patients fulfilling PAF diagnostic criteria, and 15 age-matched controls. Subjects underwent skin biopsy from proximal (ie, cervical) and distal (ie, thigh and leg) sites to study small nerve fiber and intraneural n-syn and p-syn.

Results

PAF and IPD showed length-dependent somatic and autonomic small fiber loss, more severely expressed in patients with higher p-syn load. n-syn was similarly expressed in both groups of patients and controls. By contrast, p-syn was not evident in any skin sample of controls but was found in all PAF and IPD patients, although with different skin innervation. In addition, abnormal α-synuclein deposits were found in all analyzed skin samples in PAF but in only 49% of samples with a higher positivity rate at the proximal site in IPD.

Interpretation

(1) Intraneural p-syn was a reliable in vivo marker of PAF and IPD; (2) neuritic p-syn inclusions differed in PAF and IPD, suggesting a different underlying pathogenesis; (3) when searching for abnormal p-syn deposits in skin nerves, the site of analysis is irrelevant in PAF but it is critical in IPD.

### Involvement of the peripheral nervous system in synucleinopathies, tauopathies and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies of the brain [^112QPqx4]. Acta Neuropathologica (2010). Low credibility.

Involvement of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is relatively common in some neurodegenerative proteinopathies of the brain and may be pathogenetically and diagnostically important. In Parkinson's disease, neuronal alpha-synuclein aggregates are distributed throughout the nervous system, including the central nervous system (CNS), sympathetic ganglia, enteric nervous system, cardiac and pelvic plexuses, submandibular gland, adrenal medulla and skin. The pathological process may target the PNS and CNS at the same time. In multiple system atrophy, numerous glial cytoplasmic inclusions composed of filamentous alpha-synuclein are widely distributed in the CNS, while alpha-synuclein accumulation is minimal in the sympathetic ganglia and is restricted to neurons. Neurofibrillary tangles can occur in the sympathetic and spinal ganglia in tauopathy, although they appear to develop independently of cerebral Alzheimer's disease pathology. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuronal loss with TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the spinal ganglia is more frequent than previously thought. Peripheral ganglia and visceral organs are also involved in polyglutamine diseases. Further elucidation and characterization of PNS lesions will have implications for intravital biopsy diagnosis in neurodegenerative proteinopathy, particularly in Parkinson's disease.

### Skin biopsy detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein in patients with synucleinopathies… [^116JMWjh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In this cross-sectional study of 428 participants, the proportions of individuals with cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein detected by skin biopsy were 92. 7% with PD,
98. 2% with MSA, 96. 0% with DLB, 100% with PAF, and
3. 3% with no history of synucleinopathy. Meaning A high proportion of individuals meeting clinical consensus criteria for PD, DLB, MSA, and PAF had a skin biopsy positive for phosphorylated α-synuclein in this study, although further research is needed to validate the findings in unselected clinical populations. Importance. Finding a reliable diagnostic biomarker for the disorders collectively known as synucleinopathies is an urgent unmet need. Immunohistochemical detection of cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein may be a sensitive and specific clinical test for the diagnosis of synucleinopathies.

All participants completed detailed neurologic examinations and disease-specific questionnaires and underwent skin biopsy for detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein. An expert review panel blinded to pathologic data determined the final participant diagnosis. Exposure Skin biopsy for detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein. Main Outcomes Rates of detection of cutaneous α-synuclein in patients with PD, MSA, DLB, and PAF and controls without synucleinopathy. The proportions of individuals with cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein detected by skin biopsy were 92. 7% with PD,
98. 2% with MSA, 96. 0% with DLB, and 100% with PAF;
3. 3% of controls had cutaneous phosphorylated α-synuclein detected. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, a high proportion of individuals meeting clinical consensus criteria for PD, DLB, MSA, and PAF had phosphorylated α-synuclein detected by skin biopsy.

Further research is needed in unselected clinical populations to externally validate the findings and fully characterize the potential role of skin biopsy detection of phosphorylated α-synuclein in clinical care.

### Evolving perspectives on α-synuclein testing… [^111DgTJW]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Parkinson disease, a common synucleinopathy, is the fastest growing neurological disorder in prevalence, disability, and death. 1 The recent development of sensitive and specific methods for detecting abnormal α-synuclein in living patients using an α-synuclein seed amplification assay, or by measuring phosphorylated α-synuclein and nerve fiber density in skin, adds a biomarker to what has been an imprecise clinical diagnosis. 2, 3 This new opportunity poses new questions. Despite enthusiasm at this breakthrough, many knowledge gaps exist. In which populations and under what circumstances should we be testing for α-synuclein today? The answers may differ when considering clinical care, research, and health equity. Dietiker C, Tanner C. Evolving Perspectives on α-Synuclein Testing. JAMA Neurol.

### Real-time analysis of skin biopsy specimens with 2-photon fluorescence microscopy… [^114zL2sV]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The study results suggest that 2-photon fluorescence microscopy may facilitate real-time diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin cancers and other dermatologic conditions with high accuracy, potentially reducing the delays associated with conventional histologic processing. Importance Nonmelanoma skin cancers are primarily diagnosed through paraffin section histologic analysis of skin biopsy specimens that requires days to weeks before a formal diagnosis is reported. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy has the potential for point-of-care diagnosis of NMSC and other dermatologic conditions, which could enable same-visit diagnosis and treatment. The TPFM images of NMSC biopsies and their corresponding brightfield H&E showed excellent coregistration for BCC and SCC, as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Basal cell carcinoma was recognized by islands of deep blue cells with a peripheral palisade within the dermis.

The cells displayed a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and were often seen coursing in a myxoid, cellular stroma. In some cases, follicular differentiation was seen. Central necrosis was variably present within the epithelial islands. Squamous cell carcinoma was recognized by tongues of eosinophilic epithelial islands present within the dermis. In some cases, these tongues extended down from the overlying epidermis, and in other areas, islands of keratinocytes were not connected. The cells demonstrated varying degrees of pleomorphism and cellular atypia. More poorly differentiated lesions demonstrated smaller islands and single atypical keratinocytes coursing between collagen bundles. Of the 15 biopsies, 5 were diagnosed positive for BCC, 9 were diagnosed positive for SCC, and 1 was diagnosed negative with H&E histology.

With H&E histology as the standard, TPFM had a 93% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 93% accuracy when classifying between positive and negative diagnoses across all samples. The TPFM performed perfectly across all BCC samples while SCC demonstrated an 89% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Results from the statistical analysis are summarized in the Table. Only 1 biopsy was diagnosed positive for SCC through H&E but negative with TPFM.
