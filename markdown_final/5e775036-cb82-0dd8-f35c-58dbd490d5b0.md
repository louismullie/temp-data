## Question

Diagnostic testing to rule out URI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnostic testing to rule out an upper respiratory infection (URI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "ruling out URI" actually means in clinical practice. Then, I should verify the baseline probability and whether testing changes management. Next, I will examine which tests are appropriate for which scenarios, including COVID-19, influenza, and broader viral panels. After that, I need to check the performance characteristics and limitations of each test modality. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach and state when testing is and is not indicated, anchoring to guidelines and evidence quality.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: most URIs are viral and self-limited, and "ruling out URI" is rarely the right question; instead, we usually want to confirm a specific pathogen when results will change management or infection control decisions, or to differentiate URI from bacterial complications that warrant antibiotics, such as acute bacterial sinusitis or streptococcal pharyngitis [^4e835e1e] [^bf3247ca] [^fe5b6f95].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline probability and stewardship context. URIs are extremely common, and in immunocompetent patients with typical viral symptoms, the pretest probability of a viral etiology is high; moreover, routine viral testing does not reliably reduce antibiotic use or improve outcomes in primary care or ED settings, so indiscriminate testing can add cost without benefit [^91a0b49d] [^2bba5ae6] [^8b630d77].

> I will now examine COVID-19 testing, because this is the most frequent scenario where "ruling out" is meaningful for isolation, treatment, or public health. The IDSA recommends nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for symptomatic individuals suspected of COVID-19, and suggests testing selected asymptomatic individuals when results will change isolation or PPE decisions; a single NAAT is generally sufficient, with repeat testing reserved for high suspicion and suboptimal initial testing, ideally with a lower respiratory specimen if upper tract testing is negative and suspicion remains [^ba6725ab] [^453f20bb] [^30e730f2].

> Hold on, I should verify antigen test performance and when to use them. Antigen tests are less sensitive than NAAT, so a negative antigen result in a symptomatic patient should be confirmed with NAAT if clinical suspicion persists; antigen tests are most useful early in illness and in high-prevalence settings, and IDSA suggests antigen testing when NAAT is not available or when rapid results are needed, with NAAT preferred when feasible [^40d1ca3c] [^a884ed9a].

> Next, I should review influenza testing. Rapid molecular assays (NAATs) are preferred over antigen-based rapid tests for influenza because of higher sensitivity; testing is indicated when results will change antiviral management or infection control, particularly in high-risk patients or during influenza season, and negative results from less sensitive assays should be interpreted cautiously and confirmed if clinical suspicion is high [^c7b8786d] [^503322ce] [^5853f712].

> Let me consider broader respiratory viral panels. Multiplex NAAT panels can detect multiple viruses but have uncertain clinical utility in ambulatory care; they may be reasonable in hospitalized patients when results will influence cohorting, de-escalation of antibiotics, or diagnostic clarity, but a negative panel does not exclude bacterial coinfection and should not replace clinical judgment [^810d892d] [^a1a4b8be] [^fed23957].

> I need to check the role of biomarkers like CRP and procalcitonin. CRP has limited diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing bacterial from viral lower respiratory infections and is not recommended to rule in or rule out bacterial disease in URIs; procalcitonin-guided algorithms can reduce antibiotic exposure in acute respiratory infections, but evidence is stronger in lower respiratory tract disease and should be applied selectively with validated algorithms rather than used to "rule out URI" per se [^ffde133d] [^6643ccce].

> But wait, what if the clinical question is differentiating URI from bacterial complications. For suspected streptococcal pharyngitis, rapid antigen testing is indicated in children older than 3 years with sore throat and no viral features; for suspected acute bacterial sinusitis, diagnosis is clinical based on persistence, worsening, or severe onset, and imaging is not recommended to distinguish from viral URI; for suspected pneumonia, chest radiography and clinical prediction rules can help, but these are not tools to "rule out URI" either [^fe5b6f95] [^188d96c4] [^5c575fc3].

> I should double-check test performance nuances that affect interpretation. Molecular tests are highly sensitive and specific, but results depend on specimen quality and timing; upper respiratory specimens collected early in illness are preferred, and lower respiratory sampling improves yield in severe disease; false positives from asymptomatic carriage and false negatives from poor sampling or late presentation can occur, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^4e835e1e] [^9d9c43f9] [^59dbbd6f].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. In immunocompetent patients with typical URI symptoms, no testing is needed to "rule out URI"; instead, provide reassurance, symptom control, and return precautions. Test when results will change management: COVID-19 NAAT for symptomatic patients or when isolation decisions hinge on results; influenza NAAT in high-risk patients or during influenza season when antivirals are considered; multiplex panels in hospitalized patients when results will guide cohorting or antibiotics; and avoid testing when results will not change care, such as routine viral testing in otherwise healthy children or adults with mild symptoms [^ba6725ab] [^c7b8786d] [^810d892d] [^2bba5ae6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm exceptions. In immunocompromised hosts, critically ill patients, or outbreak settings, testing thresholds are lower because the consequences of missing a treatable viral infection or of transmission are higher; in these contexts, NAAT-based testing and, when appropriate, lower respiratory sampling may be warranted even with initially negative upper tract results [^ae83679e] [^30e730f2].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: we do not routinely "rule out URI" with diagnostic tests; we use targeted testing to identify specific pathogens when results will alter treatment, isolation, or public health actions, recognizing that most URIs are viral and self-limited and that indiscriminate testing can mislead without improving outcomes [^4e835e1e] [^2bba5ae6] [^8b630f77].

Routine testing is **not needed** to rule out URI in immunocompetent patients with classic viral symptoms [^2bba5ae6]; diagnosis is clinical, and most URIs are self-limited [^32f8eea8]. Testing is reserved for **specific scenarios**: suspected COVID-19 [^ba6725ab], influenza in high-risk or hospitalized patients [^c7b8786d] [^b584fac6], or when results will change management or infection control [^d9ab626f]. Rapid viral panels or multiplex PCR are not routinely indicated for uncomplicated URI [^2bba5ae6] because they rarely alter outcomes and can detect colonization or low-level shedding, leading to false positives [^e0f84b02]. If testing is pursued, use NAAT for COVID-19/influenza [^ba6725ab] [^c7b8786d] or targeted PCR panels in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients when results will guide care [^810d892d] [^ead119c6]. Routine labs (CBC, CRP, procalcitonin) are not recommended to distinguish viral from bacterial URIs [^ffde133d].

---

## Clinical diagnosis of URI

URIs are **typically diagnosed clinically** based on characteristic symptoms — nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and mild fever — and a physical examination that excludes signs of lower respiratory tract involvement or complications [^notfound]. Most URIs are self-limited and resolve within 7–10 days without medical intervention [^bf3247ca].

---

## Indications for diagnostic testing

Diagnostic testing is **not routinely indicated** for uncomplicated URIs. However, certain clinical scenarios warrant testing:

- **Suspected COVID-19**: NAAT (PCR) is recommended for symptomatic individuals suspected of COVID-19, especially when results will influence isolation, treatment, or public health measures [^ba6725ab] [^5450b4dd].

- **Suspected influenza**: Testing is recommended for high-risk patients (e.g. immunocompromised, elderly, chronic medical conditions) or hospitalized patients with suspected influenza, particularly during influenza season [^7aa803e1] [^b584fac6].

- **Unclear diagnosis or severe presentation**: In patients with severe or atypical symptoms, testing may be considered to differentiate viral URI from bacterial infections or other respiratory conditions [^4e835e1e].

---

## Types of diagnostic tests

When testing is indicated, **the following tests are commonly used**:

| **Test type** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Rapid antigen tests (e.g. COVID-19, influenza) | - Symptomatic patients <br/> - Point-of-care settings | - Quick results <br/> - Easy to use | - Lower sensitivity <br/> - False negatives common [^503322ce] [^40d1ca3c] |
| Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (e.g. PCR) | - COVID-19 <br/> - Influenza <br/> - Multiplex panels | - High sensitivity and specificity <br/> - Detects low viral loads | - Longer turnaround time <br/> - More expensive [^94a88453] |
| Multiplex respiratory panels | - Hospitalized patients <br/> - Immunocompromised patients <br/> - Severe cases | - Detects multiple pathogens simultaneously | - Expensive <br/> - May detect colonization or low-level shedding [^e0f84b02] |
| Routine laboratory tests (CBC, CRP, procalcitonin) | Not recommended for routine URI evaluation | - May help differentiate bacterial vs viral infections in some cases | - Limited utility <br/> - Not specific for URI [^ffde133d] |

---

## Limitations and pitfalls of diagnostic testing

- **False negatives**: Rapid antigen tests, particularly for influenza and COVID-19, have lower sensitivity, leading to false negatives, especially if testing is delayed after symptom onset [^503322ce] [^40d1ca3c].

- **False positives**: PCR and multiplex panels may detect low-level viral shedding or colonization, leading to false positives, especially in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients [^e0f84b02].

- **Limited clinical utility**: Routine testing in uncomplicated URI rarely changes management or outcomes, as most cases are self-limited and require only symptomatic treatment [^2bba5ae6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **IDSA guidelines**: Recommend NAATs for COVID-19 testing in symptomatic individuals and suggest testing for influenza in high-risk or hospitalized patients [^ba6725ab] [^c7b8786d].

- **WHO guidelines**: Emphasize the use of high-sensitivity and specificity tests (NAATs) for suspected severe influenza virus infection [^5853f712].

- **Pediatric guidelines**: Recommend against routine viral testing in immunocompetent children with uncomplicated URI, as it rarely alters management [^2bba5ae6].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Routine testing for uncomplicated URI is **generally not cost-effective** because of the low likelihood of altering clinical outcomes and the high cost of molecular testing. Cost-effectiveness improves when testing is targeted to high-risk patients, hospitalized patients, or when results will significantly influence management or infection control practices [^60ea9c77].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine testing is not indicated**: For immunocompetent patients with classic viral URI symptoms [^2bba5ae6].

- **Testing is reserved**: For specific scenarios, such as suspected COVID-19, influenza in high-risk patients, or severe/atypical presentations [^ba6725ab] [^c7b8786d].

- **Preferred tests**: NAATs are preferred for their high sensitivity and specificity when testing is indicated [^4e835e1e].

- **Routine laboratory tests**: Not recommended for routine URI evaluation [^notfound].

---

Routine testing is **not needed** to rule out URI in immunocompetent patients with classic viral symptoms; diagnosis is clinical, and most URIs are self-limited. Testing is reserved for **specific scenarios** — suspected COVID-19, influenza in high-risk or hospitalized patients, or when results will change management or infection control. Rapid viral panels or multiplex PCR are not routinely indicated for uncomplicated URI because they rarely alter outcomes and can detect colonization or low-level shedding, leading to false positives. If testing is pursued, use NAAT for COVID-19/influenza or targeted PCR panels in hospitalized or immunocompromised patients when results will guide care. Routine labs (CBC, CRP, procalcitonin) are not recommended to distinguish viral from bacterial URIs.

### Are point-of-care (POC) virological tests what is needed? [^92418bc7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) tests are becoming more available, although the way in which they should be used is currently undecided. Any 'laboratory'-based diagnosis of respiratory infections has three components: the specimen taken, the test used, and the interpretation of the results. Each of these components needs to be carefully addressed when using POC tests for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. Given the enthusiasm with which POC tests are being developed, it is likely that they will be used more and more widely. If so, the advantages and limitations of their use should be fully discussed and the implications recognised.

The clinical signs and symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are not pathogen specific. Highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests have become the diagnostic reference standard for viruses, and translation of bacterial assays from basic research to routine clinical practice represents an exciting advance in respiratory medicine. Most recently, molecular diagnostics have played an essential role in the global health response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. How best to use newer molecular tests for RTI in combination with clinical judgment and traditional methods can be bewildering given the plethora of available assays and rapidly evolving technologies. Here, we summarize the current state of the art with respect to the diagnosis of viral and bacterial RTIs, provide a practical framework for diagnostic decision making using selected patient-centered vignettes, and make recommendations for future studies to advance the field.

Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common infections of childhood. They result in clinical syndromes ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe lower respiratory tract disease requiring intensive care. Respiratory viruses are most commonly identified from a respiratory swab or nasopharyngeal aspirate by real-time PCR, which has a very high sensitivity and specificity. In this article, we review when and how children should be tested for viral respiratory tract infections and how to interpret the result in context of the clinical picture.

Viral pathogens are a common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in adults. Our ability to rapidly and accurately identify viral infections has dramatically improved as slow culture-based techniques have been largely replaced by multiplex high-throughput systems. Given these advances, reevaluation of the role of respiratory viral testing in adults presenting with lower respiratory tract infection is important. This article reviews the potential benefits of testing, provides an overview of the most commonly used diagnostic techniques, and considers whether current evidence supports routine testing.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline — question generation and search strategy are described as follows: Clinical questions were developed in Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) format, with panel members prioritizing patient-oriented outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 testing and considering the impact of results on infection prevention and public health practices. In this update, the panel retired questions on testing specimens from the upper versus lower respiratory tract in patients with lower respiratory tract disease and on testing of immunocompromised individuals due to absence of relevant data. The evidence search used a highly sensitive search from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), added the term COVID, and queried Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for studies from 2019 through July 1, 2022, with horizon scans, consultation with field experts, and review of reference lists and panelist-suggested literature; preprints were followed for final publication but were not included unless published.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^30255673]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Specimen handling and regulatory notes for influenza tests: Negative results may not rule out influenza, and respiratory tract specimens should be collected as close to illness onset as possible; clinicians should consult the manufacturer's package insert for approved specimen types. Most FDA‑cleared influenza diagnostic tests are approved for upper respiratory tract specimens but not for sputum or lower respiratory tract specimens. Specificities are generally high (> 90%) for all tests compared to RT‑PCR. FDA‑cleared rapid influenza diagnostic tests are CLIA‑waived, and most FDA‑cleared rapid influenza molecular assays are CLIA‑waived depending on the specimen. Rapid influenza molecular assays are described as highly sensitive molecular point‑of‑care tests providing rapid (15–30 minutes) detection of influenza A and B viral RNA in respiratory specimens.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^fe5b6f95]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Should all acutely ill children in primary care be tested with point-of-care CRP: a cluster randomised trial [^d82087c8]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic performance of CRP

Restricting CRP testing to those identified as at clinical risk increased the median CRP level of the children tested from 7 mg/L (IQR: 5–23 mg/L) to 11 mg/L (IQR: 5–30 mg/L). Time from onset of fever did not influence the median point-of-care CRP level (P > 0.06).

The impact on diagnostic performance of CRP is shown in Table 3. The small number of cases of serious infection means that the confidence intervals around the number of missed cases are wide, with no indication of a difference between randomisation arms. However, at a CRP threshold of 5 mg/L, no cases of serious infection were missed in either arm. The number of false alarms expressed was also similar in both arms, irrespective of the threshold applied. If the 5 mg/L threshold was adopted as a criterion for hospital referral, over half (59.2% overall) of the children tested with CRP would be referred. Of these children, 1 in 40 in the restricted testing arm would have serious infection (positive predictive value: 2.4%). If all children were tested and those with a CRP level ≥ 5 mg/L referred, then the positive predictive value would be even lower (0.8%) and only 1 in 130 children referred would have a serious infection.

Children referred to hospital with normal CRP

Twenty-four children were referred to hospital with a low CRP level (< 5 mg/L). The clinical presentation and stated reasons for referral are shown in Table 4. In 17 cases (70.8%), the referral was made to rule out serious infection. In only one of these cases was the child admitted – a case of viral gastroenteritis where the child was admitted because of dehydration.

### Procalcitonin testing to guide antibiotic therapy in acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections [^6643ccce]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is the use of procalcitonin for guiding antibiotic decisions in patients with acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care?

Bottom Line

Among patients with varying types and severity of acute respiratory infection, using procalcitonin to guide decisions about antibiotics is associated with lower rates of antibiotic exposure, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and mortality.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^5450b4dd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — despite evidence quality described as moderate to very low, the panel recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 and states that testing is suggested for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions; evidence supporting rapid testing and use of upper respiratory specimens other than nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs is sufficient to warrant conditional recommendations in favor of these approaches.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^1e7bad19]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate molecular diagnostic tests are necessary for confirming a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and for identifying asymptomatic carriage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The number of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests continues to increase as does the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients, and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss nuances of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing. IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations. Access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention, and the public health response to COVID-19 infection. Information on the clinical performance of available tests continues to grow, but the quality of evidence of the current literature to support this updated molecular diagnostic guideline remains moderate to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is suggested for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions. Evidence in support of rapid testing and testing of upper respiratory specimens other than nasopharyngeal swabs, which offer logistical advantages, is sufficient to warrant conditional recommendations in favor of these approaches.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing conclusions — based on moderate certainty evidence, the IDSA panel recommends NAAT for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19, suggests testing a specimen from the nasopharynx or alternative upper respiratory tract once rather than repeat testing, suggests testing selected asymptomatic individuals when results will significantly impact isolation/quarantine/usage of PPE, suggests against routine NAAT of asymptomatic individuals before hospitalization or a medical/surgical procedure with specified contextual exceptions, and suggests against repeat NAAT to guide removal of isolation in patients with COVID-19.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^08beb958]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — upper respiratory specimen collection and labeling considerations emphasize that swab collection of the upper respiratory tract is not uniform, creating uncertainty about whether the specimen is optimal even with NP collections. FDA approval of individual nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), including multiplex assays that also test for other respiratory pathogens, specifically indicates collection and specimen type(s), and failure to adhere to label requirements — unless otherwise approved through a lab developed test (LDT) validation or authorized by the FDA through a subsequent EUA for different collection or specimen type — can lead to inaccurate results and reimbursement denials. For community and outpatient testing, the benefits support the use of alternative collection methods and specimen types, and studies comparing NP against alternative upper respiratory collection methods using a more comprehensive reference method are needed.

### Outcomes from an infectious disease physician-guided evaluation of hospitalized persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at a large US academic medical center [^30e730f2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Prompt isolation and diagnosis of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for the prevention of nosocomial transmission and allocation of personal protective equipment (PPE). The mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis is detection of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA through nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). However, NAAT sensitivity varies by specimen quality, timing, and severity of infection. The sensitivity of a single NAAT is ~70%, while repeated testing increases sensitivity to 88%. Lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens generally have higher sensitivity than upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens.

Based on these data, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends repeating a NAAT, preferably with an LRT specimen, when clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains moderate or high. We describe an approach to the evaluation and isolation of hospitalized persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 in whom clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic testing after a first negative NAAT were guided by infectious disease (ID) physician review.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^5c575fc3]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — scope and key clinical questions focus on suspected pneumonia or influenza in nonimmunocompromised patients and frame eight PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions across diagnosis and treatment. The guideline states it "do[es] not include acute bronchitis and other upper respiratory tract infections" and "exclude[s] patients who are immunocompromised". It reports "Eight PICO questions were formulated", addressing diagnostic confirmation (chest radiography plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone; C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin rather than symptoms alone to predict pneumonia; diagnostic algorithm/clinical prediction rule/diagnostic score plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia; microbiological testing plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia) and therapeutic strategies (antibiotics vs no antibiotics; nonantibiotic therapy vs none; antibiotics with atypical coverage vs without atypical coverage; antiviral therapy vs no antiviral therapy with outcomes including antibiotic prescriptions, visits, hospitalizations, or mortality).

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^e9acf390]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

Pragmatic recommendations for repeat RT-PCR testing for de-isolation and hospital discharge are addressed in a separate article in this series (reference).
1 In LMICs where RT-PCR is available and affordable, we recommend using RT-PCR of the upper (NP) or lower (induced sputum, mid-trachea, or bronchoalveolar lavage) respiratory tract (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).
2 In LMICs, we suggest using lower respiratory samples in case a patient suspected of having COVID-19 has a negative RT-PCR of the NP swab. However, sampling methods should consider the risk of aerosol generation and attendant contamination risks to healthcare workers (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
3 In LMICs, we recommend that a positive RT-PCR from any anatomical source be considered confirmatory for SARS-CoV-2 infection (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Similarly, because false-negative testing can occur, we recommend that a negative RT-PCR does not definitively rule out active infection if the patient has high suspicion for COVID-19 (UG best practice statement).
4 In LMICs, where available, we recommend the use of point-of-care Ag-RDT for SARS-CoV-2 infection as an alternative to RT-PCR only if such testing is affordable, performed by trained operators in accordance with test manufacturer recommendations, and has ≥ 80% sensitivity and ≥ 97% specificity compared with the local reference nucleic acid test (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Where the minimal performance requirements are unknown, we suggest against the use of Ag-RDT point-of-care testing because of the high potential for false negatives (UG, best practice statement).
5 In LMICs, we suggest against using serologic assays for the detection of active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection until the clinical utility of such testing becomes clearer (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).
6 In LMICs, we suggest that screening for endemic infectious illnesses occur at the time of COVID-19 testing, as clinically appropriate (UG best practice statement)

In LMICs, which specific laboratory tests could be useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients?

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^503322ce]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Rapid influenza antigen tests — use and result interpretation by influenza activity: For rapid influenza diagnostic test antigen detection (immunoassay or immunofluorescence assay), sensitivity is low to moderate and specificity is high, and these tests should not be used for testing of patients with progressive illness and hospitalized patients. When influenza activity is low, a negative result has high negative predictive value and is likely to be a true-negative if an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected < 4 days after illness onset, while a positive result has low positive predictive value, is likely to be a false-positive result, and should be confirmed with a molecular assay. When influenza activity is high, a negative result has low negative predictive value, may be a false-negative result especially if an upper respiratory tract specimen was collected > 4 days after illness onset, cannot exclude influenza virus infection, antiviral treatment should not be withheld if clinically indicated, and confirmation with a molecular assay is advised; a positive result has high positive predictive value and is likely to be a true-positive result.

Upper respiratory molecular panels for influenza — "Upper respiratory tract testing for influenza using molecular panels is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude lower tract infections, particularly in critically ill and immunocompromised patients", and is also "not sufficiently sensitive to exclude some strains of influenza (e.g. H1N1 and H5N1) that preferentially infect the lower respiratory tract".

### Reporting results from studies evaluating diagnostic tests… [^7ffefe61]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic accuracy and the reference standard The diagnostic accuracy of a new test refers to the extent of agreement between the outcome of the new test and the reference standard. We use the term reference standard as defined in STARD. That is, a reference standard is "considered to be the best available method for establishing the presence or absence of the target condition. " It divides the intended use population into only two groups and does not consider the outcome of the new test under evaluation. The reference standard can be a single test or method, or a combination of methods and techniques, including clinical follow-up. If a reference standard is a combination of methods, the algorithm specifying how the different results are combined to make a final positive/negative classification is part of the standard.

Examples of reference standards include the diagnosis of myocardial infarction using the WHO standards, the diagnosis of lupus or rheumatoid arthritis using American Rheumatology guidelines, or the diagnosis of H. pylori infections by use of combinations of culture, histology, and urease testing. We point out that some definitions of diagnostic accuracy require that the reference standard and target condition refer only to a well-defined clinical disorder. The definitions used in this document are broader. For example, the target condition could be a well-defined health condition or a condition that prompts a clinical action such as the initiation of a treatment.
- the test label clearly describe the designated reference standard that was constructed
- the new reference standard be created independently from the analysis of results of the new diagnostic test
- you consult with CDRH medical officers and statisticians prior to constructing a reference standard. If a reference standard is not available and cannot be constructed.
- the nature of the specimens studied
- how the target condition status was determined
- the limitations introduced through selective sampling. resolver to see which one is "right. " A numerical example describing discrepant resolution appears in the Appendix.

If the resolver is a reference standard, this process provides the condition status for the subjects re-tested with the resolver, but it does not provide the condition status for subjects when the new test agrees with the non-reference standard. Even when the new test and non-reference standard agree, they may both be wrong.

### Are nasopharyngeal cultures useful in diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children? [^2add57a3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis can be challenging because symptoms of acute sinusitis and an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) overlap. A rapid test, if accurate in differentiating sinusitis from URI, could be helpful in the diagnostic process. We examined the utility of nasopharyngeal cultures in identifying the subgroup of children with a clinical diagnosis of acute sinusitis who are least likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy (those with completely normal sinus radiographs). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 204 children meeting a priori clinical criteria for acute sinusitis. All children had sinus X-rays at the time of diagnosis. To determine if negative nasopharyngeal culture results could reliably identify the subgroup of children with normal radiographs, we calculated negative predictive values and negative likelihood ratios. Absence of pathogens in the nasopharynx was not helpful in identifying this low-risk subgroup.

### Assessing the potential of upper respiratory tract point-of-care testing: a systematic review of the prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes [^c8c7258c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Microbial point-of-care testing (POCT) has potential to revolutionize clinical care. Understanding the prognostic value of microbes identified from the upper respiratory tract (a convenient sampling site) is a necessary first step to understand potential for upper respiratory tract POCTs in assisting antimicrobial treatment decisions for respiratory infections (RTIs). The aim was to investigate the relationship between upper respiratory tract microbial detection and disease prognosis, including effects of antimicrobial use.

Methods

Data sources were the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Study eligibility criteria consisted of quantitative studies reporting microbiological and prognostic data from patients of all age groups presenting with RTI. Patients presenting to healthcare or research settings with RTI participated. Interventions included upper respiratory tract swab. The methods used were systematic review and meta-analysis.

Results

Searches identified 5156 articles, of which 754 were duplicates and 4258 excluded on title or abstract. A total of 144 full texts were screened; 21 articles were retained. Studies reported data for 15 microbes and 26 prognostic measures (390 potential associations). One hundred and seven (27%) associations were investigated statistically, of which 38 (36%) were significant. Most studies reported only prognostic value of test positive results. Meta-analyses suggested hospitalization duration was longer for patients with respiratory syncytial virus than adenovirus and influenza, but significant heterogeneity was observed between studies.

Conclusions

A quarter of potential prognostic associations have been investigated. Of these, a third were significant, suggesting considerable potential for POCT. Future research should investigate prognostic value of positive and negative tests, and interactions between test results, use of antimicrobials and microbial resistance.

### Advances in the laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory disease [^8982f1a9]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In recent years significant advances in the laboratory diagnostics available to detect respiratory viral infections have been achieved.

Methods

This article presents the types of diagnostic methods currently available to the practitioner, as well as those on the horizon. The article covers tissue culture, serology and direct examination as well as some rapid diagnostic techniques and molecular assays, previewing developing new technology.

Conclusions

Laboratory diagnosis will likely be clinically useful in some but not all cases of viral infection. As new diagnostic methods become widely available, it is increasingly important to develop guidelines for laboratory testing when viral illness is suspected.

### The utility of syndromic respiratory pathogen panels: the premise of flexible and customizable approaches [^fed23957]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Viral upper respiratory tract infections are among the most common healthcare problems and reasons for healthcare visits. Although most cases are self-limiting and do not require medical intervention, severe disease can occur, particularly in elderly, immunocompromised, and pediatric patients. Available interventions are limited to antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, as well as vaccines currently recommended for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Seasonal and year-round disease can be caused by various virus groups beyond SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV. Symptoms often overlap, and the clinical diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections lacks specificity. As a result, molecular diagnosis has become the gold standard for accurate identification.

Various molecular assays and technologies are available for respiratory viral testing. These include single-target tests, panels for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV, as well as extended panels that multiplex testing for 19 or more respiratory viral and bacterial targets. Current recommendations favor testing, primarily when results inform patient management or infection control decisions. However, testing decisions are influenced by multiple factors, including access, cost, patient symptoms, immune status, healthcare settings, laboratory complexity, and available test options. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed testing for all other respiratory viral pathogens. During respiratory virus season, testing volumes for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV increase. Testing for other respiratory viral pathogens is less common and generally limited to immunocompromised, hospitalized, and pediatric patients.

### Signs and symptoms that differentiate acute sinusitis from viral upper respiratory tract infection [^24683d69]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Differentiating acute bacterial sinusitis from viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is challenging; 20% to 40% of children diagnosed with acute sinusitis based on clinical criteria likely have an uncomplicated URI. The objective of this study was to determine which signs and symptoms could be used to identify the subgroup of children who meet current clinical criteria for sinusitis but who nevertheless have a viral URI.

Methods

We obtained sinus radiographs in consecutive children meeting a priori clinical criteria for acute sinusitis. We considered the subgroup of children with completely normal sinus radiographs to have an uncomplicated URI despite meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria for sinusitis. We examined the utility of signs and symptoms in identifying children with URI.

Results

Of 258 children enrolled, 54 (20.9%) children had completely normal radiographs. The absence of green nasal discharge, the absence of disturbed sleep and mild symptoms were associated with a diagnosis of URI. No physical exam findings were particularly helpful in distinguishing between children with normal versus abnormal radiographs.

Conclusions

Among children meeting current criteria for the diagnosis of acute sinusitis, those with mild symptoms are significantly more likely to have a URI than those with severe symptoms. In addition to assessing overall severity of symptoms, practitioners should ask about sleep disturbance and green nasal discharge when assessing children with suspected sinusitis; their absence favors a diagnosis of URI.

### Respiratory pathogen panels in the hospital: good or unnecessary? [^3ad5f51c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We aim to review the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections and the strengths and limitations of multiplex respiratory pathogen panels that are currently available along with their respective features and differences.

Recent Findings

We give particular emphasis to the pathogens included on each test and evaluate their performance in the hospital setting.

Summary

We conclude with a discussion on the evidence for the clinical utility of respiratory pathogen multiplex panels in hospitalized patients, including the potential for coinfection with viral and bacterial pathogens.

### PCR testing for paediatric acute respiratory tract infections [^06aac5fa]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) is a frequently occurring disease in children. It is a clinical diagnosis for which no internationally accepted diagnostic test is available. The majority of ARI is viral in origin, though diagnostic tests for viruses were rarely performed in the past. In the past 2 decades, new molecular techniques have been introduced in many hospitals. They are capable of generating a high yield of viral and bacterial diagnoses, but their impact upon clinical practices is still questionable. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties of diagnosing ARI in children, the indications for conventional and new diagnostics and their implications.

### Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the emergency department [^8b630d77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pediatric acute respiratory infections (ARIs) represent a significant burden on pediatric Emergency Departments (EDs) and families. Most of these illnesses are due to viruses. However, investigations (radiography, blood, and urine testing) to rule out bacterial infections and antibiotics are often ordered because of diagnostic uncertainties. This results in prolonged ED visits and unnecessary antibiotic use. The risk of concurrent bacterial infection has been reported to be negligible in children over three months of age with a confirmed viral infection. Rapid viral testing in the ED may alleviate the need for precautionary testing and antibiotic use.

Objectives

To determine the effect of rapid viral testing in the ED on the rate of precautionary testing, antibiotic use, and length of ED visit.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); EMBASE (1988 to December 2011); MEDLINE Ovid (1950 to November week 4, 2011); MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (8 December 2011); HealthStar (1966 to 2009); BIOSIS Previews (1969 to December 2011); CAB Abstracts (1973 to December 2011); CBCA Reference (1970 to 2007); and Proquest Dissertations and Theses (1861 to 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rapid viral testing for children with ARIs in the ED.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors used the inclusion criteria to select trials, evaluate their quality and extract data. We obtained missing data from trial authors. We expressed differences in rate of investigations and antibiotic use as risk ratios (RRs), and expressed difference in ED length of visits as mean differences (MDs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Main Results

We included four trials (three RCTs and one quazi-RCT), with 759 children in the rapid viral testing group and 829 in the control group. Three out of the four studies were comparable in terms of young age of participants, with one study increasing the age of inclusion up to five years of age. All studies included either fever or respiratory symptoms as inclusion criteria (two required both, one required fever or respiratory symptoms, and one required only fever). All studies were comparable in terms of exclusion criteria, intervention, and outcome data. In terms of risk of bias, one study failed to utilize a random sequence generator, one study did not comment on completeness of outcome data, and only one of four studies included allocation concealment as part of the study design. None of the studies definitively blinded participants. Rapid viral testing did not reduce antibiotic use in the ED significantly, neither clinically nor statistically. We found lower rates of chest radiography (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.91) in the rapid viral testing group, but no effect on length of ED visits, or blood or urine testing in the ED. No study made mention of any adverse effects related to viral testing.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is insufficient to support routine rapid viral testing as a means to reduce antibiotic use in pediatric EDs. Results suggest that rapid viral testing may be beneficial in terms of reducing rates of antibiotic usage, urine investigations and blood investigations, but are not statistically significant due to lack of power. Rapid viral testing does reduce the rate of chest X-rays in the ED. A large trial addressing the effect on antibiotic usage is needed.

### Early diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections (point-of-care tests) [^35c87ff0]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Respiratory tract infections are a common reason for prescribing antibiotics, although not all of these infections require such therapy. Rapid diagnosis of etiology using point-of-care tests is a potentially useful way of reducing prescriptions of both unnecessary and unnecessarily broad-spectrum antibiotics. This can also lead to the facilitation of appropriate infection control measures to prevent spread of respiratory viruses within institutions.

Recent Findings

Point-of-care tests are available for diagnosing influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella infections using easily obtainable specimens. Their main benefit is that results can be obtained in about 15 min with reasonable accuracy. In many situations, however, it is still important to confirm diagnosis with more accurate but slower tests such as bacterial cultures with antibacterial susceptibility testing or viral polymerase chain reaction testing.

Summary

Although the sensitivities of many of the rapid diagnostic tests are moderate, when used at the time of initial consultation, they have the potential to reduce costs, length of stay, secondary spread of respiratory viruses, and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^03ce3332]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Management of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 is mainly modeled after care of patients with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome from other causes. These models are based on evidence that primarily originates from investigations in high-income countries, but it may be impractical to apply these recommendations to resource-restricted settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We report on a set of pragmatic recommendations for microbiology and laboratory testing, imaging, and the use of diagnostic and prognostic models in patients with severe COVID-19 in LMICs. For diagnostic testing, where reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) testing is available and affordable, we recommend using RT-PCR of the upper or lower respiratory specimens and suggest using lower respiratory samples for patients suspected of having COVID-19 but have negative RT-PCR results for upper respiratory tract samples. We recommend that a positive RT-PCR from any anatomical source be considered confirmatory for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but, because false-negative testing can occur, recommend that a negative RT-PCR does not definitively rule out active infection if the patient has high suspicion for COVID-19. We suggest against using serologic assays for the detection of active or past SARS-CoV-2 infection, until there is better evidence for its usefulness. Where available, we recommend the use of point-of-care antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection as an alternative to RT-PCR, only if strict quality control measures are guaranteed. For laboratory testing, we recommend a baseline white blood cell differential platelet count and hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver function tests and suggest a baseline C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin, prothrombin time (or other coagulation test), and D -dimer, where such testing capabilities are available. For imaging, where availability of standard thoracic imaging is limited, we suggest using lung ultrasound to identify patients with possible COVID-19, but recommend against its use to exclude COVID-19. We suggest using lung ultrasound in combination with clinical parameters to monitor progress of the disease and responses to therapy in COVID-19 patients. We currently suggest against using diagnostic and prognostic models as these models require extensive laboratory testing and imaging, which often are limited in LMICs.

### Diagnostic value of signs, symptoms and diagnostic tests for diagnosing pneumonia in ambulant children in developed countries: a systematic review [^7f604c1c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews have reported separately on the diagnostic value of clinical features, and laboratory teststo identify children with serious infections including pneumonia. These reviews identified shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia as most important to identify the presence of pneumonia. However, a lack of evidence particularly to identify children with serious infections in primary care was identified. Currently available decision rules for pneumonia showed value in ruling out the need for hospitalization in a child with suspected pneumonia. The rate of false positives when applying this decision rule is high. These decision rules do not aid the physician in identifying the ambulatory child in need of antibiotics. To our knowledge, a systematic review integrating information on all signs, symptoms, and additional tests currently available in ambulatory settings to diagnose pneumonia has not been performed.

The aim of this study was to therefore systematically identify and summarize available evidence of the diagnostic value of signs, symptoms, and additional diagnostic tests for confirming pneumonia or safely ruling it out in ambulant children with signs of a respiratory tract infection in developed countries.

QUESTIONS

We formulated four clearly defined questions regarding "microbiology and laboratory tests, imaging tools, and diagnostic and prognostic modeling":
1 In LMICs, which specific microbiology tests should be ordered for hospitalized patients to support a diagnosis of COVID-19?
2 In LMICs, which specific laboratory tests could be useful for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19?
3 In LMICs, what is the role of lung ultrasound in patients with severe COVID-19?
4 In LMICs, are diagnostic and prognostic models useful in patients with severe COVID-19?

In LMICs, which specific microbiology tests should be ordered to support a diagnosis of COVID-19?

Rationale.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection can be made by using multiple methods, including detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in upper respiratory tract samples, such as nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, and lower respiratory tract samples, such as sputum and bronchial lavage samples. The sensitivity and specificity of tests vary according to the type of assays used, site sampled, and timing of specimen collection relative to the symptom onset. It is therefore crucial to recognize individual test characteristics before COVID-19 infection is reliably diagnosed.

In LMICs, COVID-19 diagnosis may be compounded by issues of cost, access, and feasibility of testing. However, there is little literature to guide a specific testing strategy, and the current Surviving Sepsis guidelines for COVID-19 do not recommend a tailored approach to LMICs. In this section, we summarize the existing literature on microbiologic testing with the goal of providing pragmatic and feasible recommendations from an LMIC perspective.

Search results.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of October 2020. The search used combinations of medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", and "testing", "microbiology", "NP swab", "lavage", "endotracheal aspirate", "sputum", "serology", and "antibody". The search neither identified any publications from LMICs nor found articles with specific recommendations for LMICs.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^453f20bb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

RESULTS

Patient Population

The multi-cohort study population included 1016 patients recruited in 3 studies (Figure 1; see Methods and Supplementary Methods for details regarding the study participants, eligibility criteria and patient selection). Of them, 50.1% were male (Table 2); the median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR] 4–47); 81.1% of the patients were recruited at the emergency department (ED); the main clinical syndromes were upper respiratory tract infection (URTI, 49.7%) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI, 28.7%). At least 1 viral pathogen was detected in 65.1% of the patients, and at least 1 bacterial pathogen was detected in 17.7% of the patients. Pathogen detections are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Clinical syndromes definitions are given in Supplementary Table 2. There were fewer hospitalizations, comorbidities and LRTI cases in the suspected, unanimous, and microbiologically confirmed cohorts as compared to the all-inclusive cohort (Table 2). Conversely, there was a higher number of viral and bacterial pathogens detected in the suspected, unanimous and microbiologically confirmed cohorts as compared to the all-inclusive cohort (Table 2).

Patient Characteristics

Generating an Adjudication-based Infection Etiology for Each Patient

Out of 1016 adults and children comprising the study population, 565 (55.6%) had 3/3 adjudicators concur with high confidence and comprised the unanimous cohort (Figure 1). Among those, 427 had a concordant microbiological finding and comprised the microbiologically confirmed cohort (42.0% of the study population). An additional 295 cases had 3/3 adjudicators assign the same label with moderate or high confidence or 2/3 adjudicators concur with high confidence, and together with the 565 unanimous cases, comprised the suspected cohort (n = 860; 84.6% of the study population). The remaining 156 cases (15.4%) were inconclusive after the first adjudication round and required additional adjudication rounds to reach a conclusive reference standard infection etiology: 111 cases required one; 36 cases required 2; 5 cases required three; 1 case required 4; 1 case required 6; and 2 cases required 7 additional adjudicators. Details of selected patients that underwent the second round of adjudication are given in Supplementary Table 3.

Diagnostic tests for influenza — indications and modalities emphasize that diagnostic testing for influenza may be beneficial when results will be used to inform clinical management or infection prevention measures and to distinguish from other respiratory viruses with similar symptoms. Test results must be interpreted in the context of community influenza activity, and false-positive test results may occur during periods of low influenza activity. Molecular assays include rapid molecular tests, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, and other nucleic acid amplification tests; multiplex assays that allow for the simultaneous detection of influenza viruses plus SARS-CoV-2 and RSV are available and can be particularly useful when these viruses are cocirculating.

Table 5 — comparison of influenza diagnostic tests: Rapid molecular assay using nucleic acid amplification detects Influenza A or B viral RNA with 15–30 min time to results and high sensitivity/specificity; rapid influenza diagnostic test (antigen detection) detects Influenza A or B virus antigens with 10–15 min time to results and low to moderate sensitivity with high specificity; direct and indirect immunofluorescence assays (antigen detection) detect Influenza A or B virus antigens with 1–4 h time to results and moderate sensitivity with high specificity; molecular assays (including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) detect Influenza A or B viral RNA, can distinguish subtypes if primers are used, and have 1–8 h time to results with high sensitivity/specificity; multiplex molecular assays detect Influenza A or B viral RNA and other targets, can distinguish subtypes if primers are used, and have 1–2 h time to results with high sensitivity/specificity; virus isolation methods distinguish subtypes with rapid cell culture at 1–3 d and viral culture at 3–10 d, both with high sensitivity/specificity. Footnotes note that negative results may not rule out influenza, respiratory specimens should be collected as close to illness onset as possible, and specificities are generally high (> 95%) for all tests compared with RT-PCR; several assays are CLIA-waived depending on the specimen.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^188d96c4]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — imaging to distinguish from viral upper respiratory infection (URI) is guided by Key Action Statement 2A: Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies (plain films, contrast-enhanced computed tomography [CT], MRI, or ultrasonography) to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI (Evidence Quality: B; Strong Recommendation). The aggregate evidence quality is "B; overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies", and exclusions are "Patients with complications of sinusitis". Studies report high rates of abnormalities on imaging in children: "Sixty-two percent of patients overall had physical findings or history consistent with an upper respiratory inflammatory process, and 55% of the total group showed some abnormalities on sinus imaging; 33% showed pronounced mucosal thickening or an air-fluid level", and another series "performed MRI in children with URIs and confirmed the high frequency (68%) of major abnormalities seen in the paranasal sinuses". Imaging abnormalities considered diagnostic include "diffuse opacification, mucosal swelling of at least 4 mm, or an air-fluid level", yet "an abnormal image cannot confirm the diagnosis"; "Therefore, it is not necessary to perform imaging in children with uncomplicated episodes of clinical sinusitis", since "the majority of studies will be significantly abnormal" when the sinuses are imaged in children with uncomplicated URI.

### Testing for respiratory viruses in children: to swab or not to swab [^2bba5ae6]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

While most viral respiratory tract infections can be diagnosed clinically, clinicians frequently order tests to identify the specific offending virus. While there has been tremendous growth in the variety, availability, and sophistication of the types of respiratory viral tests, there may have been less critical thought and discussion among frontline clinicians about the clinical utility and specific indications for testing. We summarize the rationale historically used to support respiratory virus testing in children, with a review of the supporting evidence. We outline potential considerations and limitations of the various types of respiratory viral tests and suggest some clinical indications where viral testing may play an important role in clinical management.

Observations

The main value of testing for viruses in children who present with a respiratory tract infection is to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, hopefully facilitating clinical decision making regarding further investigations and the need for antibiotics. We have highlighted commonly cited rationale used to support testing and the generally poor evidence on which to base this rationale. In addition, difficulties with interpretation of respiratory viral testing results include somewhat poor diagnostic test characteristics for some tests, uncertainty regarding true positives and causation of illness, delay in receiving the test result, and the incidence of concurrent bacterial infections or the presence of multiple viruses. We have given some examples of clinical scenarios where respiratory viral testing results could be expected to contribute to more appropriate clinical management decisions.

Conclusions and Relevance

It is not good enough to "do" just because we "can". We suggest that for many healthy immune-competent children presenting with typical viral respiratory tract symptoms, the diagnosis can be made clinically, and frontline clinicians should think critically before automatically requesting a somewhat uncomfortable, expensive respiratory viral test, the result of which may not contribute to the child's treatment.

### Cost-effective respiratory virus testing [^a5b4162a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

As described here, the data supporting the cost-effectiveness of respiratory virus testing are suggestive but far from conclusive. Additional studies are critically important to inform the decision-making of microbiology and virology laboratory medical directors, clinicians, and hospital administrators as they work together to implement respiratory virus testing algorithms that ensure quality, cost-effective, clinical care of patients with suspected respiratory virus infections. In the future, perhaps clinically validated, sophisticated decision analytics incorporating patient age and key risk factors, patient location, test performance and turnaround time, and real-time respiratory virus prevalence data will be available to physicians at the time of test ordering, to help optimize the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of respiratory virus testing.

### Diagnostic value of C reactive protein in infections of the lower respiratory tract: systematic review [^ffde133d]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of C reactive protein in detecting radiologically proved pneumonia and to evaluate how well it can discriminate between bacterial and viral infections of the lower respiratory tract.

Data Sources

Medline and Embase (January 1966 to April 2004), with reference checking.

Study Selection

We included articles comparing C reactive protein with a chest radiograph or with microbiological work-up as a reference test. Two authors independently assessed methodological items.

Results

None of the studies met all validity criteria. Six studies used an infiltrate on chest radiograph as reference test. Sensitivities ranged from 10% to 98%, specificities from 44% to 99%. For adults, the relation of C reactive protein with an infiltrate (in a subgroup analysis of five studies) showed an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 0.85). In 12 studies, the relation of C reactive protein with a bacterial aetiology of infection of the lower respiratory tract was studied. Sensitivities ranged from 8% to 99%, specificities from 27% to 95%. These data were epidemiologically and statistically heterogeneous, so overall outcomes could not be calculated.

Conclusion

Testing for C reactive protein is neither sufficiently sensitive to rule out nor sufficiently specific to rule in an infiltrate on chest radiograph and bacterial aetiology of lower respiratory tract infection. The methodological quality of the diagnostic studies is generally poor. The evidence not consistently and sufficiently supports a wide introduction of C reactive protein as a rapid test to guide antibiotics prescription.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^9d9c43f9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Specimen timing and type for influenza testing indicate that the sensitivity of influenza screening assays such as rapid diagnostic tests is somewhat higher when respiratory specimens are collected within 48–72 hours of illness onset due to reduction in influenza viral shedding after this period. RT-PCR is more likely to still be positive later in illness. Viral shedding is more prolonged in infants, young children, and immunocompromised patients. Testing of lower respiratory tract specimens by RT-PCR in critically ill patients with respiratory failure can yield higher detection of influenza viruses compared with upper respiratory tract specimens.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare. 3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

Co-infections

The clinical significance of viral/bacterial co-infections has long been a controversial topic. While severe bacterial pneumonia following influenza infection has been well described, associations are less clear among infections caused by viruses common in young children; secondary infections due to other viruses are less well understood and has been reviewed by others. Although assessing the overall contribution of bacteria to disease severity is complicated by the presence of many confounding factors in clinical studies, understanding the role of viral/bacterial co-infections in defining the outcome of paediatric ARI may potentially reveal novel treatment and prevention strategies, improving patient outcomes.

A recent (2017) publication considered the role of bacterial colonisation with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis during symptomatic and asymptomatic viral upper respiratory infection in the nasopharynx of 4 to 7-year-old children during URI and when well. Using a multiplex PCR, virus was detected in about 80% of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) in children and is also detectable in the nasopharynx of 30% of asymptomatic children. All three bacteria "levels" were higher during acute URI visits compared to asymptomatic surveillance visits by the children. Of note, however, is that even during asymptomatic follow-up visits, if the virus was present, all bacteria were detected at higher levels.

### Viral detection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in upper respiratory tract and metagenomic RNA sequencing in lower respiratory tract in critically ill children with suspected lower respiratory tract infection [^59dbbd6f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and the majority of these are viral in origin.
Diagnosis is typically performed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of upper respiratory samples; however, it is not clear if the detection of a virus in the nasopharynx correlates with virus in the lower respiratory tract at the site of infection.
This study evaluates the concordance between viral detection in the upper and LRT in children who required mechanical ventilation.

AT THE BEDSIDE

Detection of viral nucleic acid in the upper respiratory tract (URT) demonstrates overall good agreement with the LRT but varies by virus.
Multiple viruses were detected in the LRT much less frequently than in the URT, and with rare exceptions, only one virus was dominant by quantity.
Nasopharyngeal samples may be a reasonable surrogate for LRT findings in critically ill pediatric patients with suspected LRTI.

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a common cause of hospital admissions among children and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These infections account for 12.8–15.6% of deaths in children less than 5 years of age worldwide. Viruses account for the majority of LRTIs in children and are mostly diagnosed by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on nasopharyngeal specimens in hospitalized patients due to the invasive nature of lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling. Even for intubated patients, nasopharyngeal specimens are typically utilized for RT-PCR testing as most clinical tests are not approved for use on LRT samples. However, the degree to which RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal samples reflects presence or absence of virus in the LRT is unclear. In particular, the detection of asymptomatic shedding of viruses in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is well-described, potentially resulting in false-positive tests. Furthermore, it is unclear whether a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR reflects the absence of the virus in the LRT or whether a positive test with multiple viruses implies infection by all viruses.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline — abstract states that accurate molecular diagnostic tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are necessary to confirm coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in respiratory specimens informs decision-making at patient, healthcare institution, and public health levels. The guideline's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assist clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests, with IDSA convening a multidisciplinary panel and using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. The panel agreed on 12 diagnostic recommendations, and access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is described as critical for patient care and hospital infection prevention.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^bf3247ca]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosis in children emphasizes differentiating it from uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI): Uncomplicated viral URIs typically last 5 to 7 days, with respiratory symptoms peaking by days 3 to 6, fever and constitutional symptoms disappearing in the first 24 to 48 hours, and some resolving signs persisting after day 10. Persistence without improvement of nasal discharge (of any quality) or daytime cough (which may be worse at night), or both, suggests acute sinusitis, yet only a minority (~6%–7%) of children with URI symptoms meet criteria for persistence. An alternative presentation is worsening ("double sickening") with substantial acute worsening of respiratory symptoms or a new fever often on the sixth or seventh day after initial recovery. A severe-onset presentation is concurrent high fever (temperature > 39°C) and purulent nasal discharge for the first 3 to 4 days of an acute URI. Bad breath, fatigue, headache, and decreased appetite are not specific indicators, and physical examination, sinus percussion, and transillumination are not helpful; nasopharyngeal cultures do not reliably predict the etiology.

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) molecular panels — clinical utility — remain uncertain; evaluations suggest pneumonia panels may allow earlier modification of antimicrobial therapy in hospitalized patients when positive, but given limited sensitivity and the potential for pathogens not on the panel (low negative predictive value), a negative result would not impact treatment decisions, and at this time culture and traditional susceptibility testing are still necessary, with molecular platforms used as an adjunct test.

Influenza diagnostic tests (Table 4) summarize methods, turnaround times, and performance: rapid molecular assay (nucleic acid amplification) detects Influenza A or B viral RNA, does not distinguish subtypes, has a typical time to results of 15–30 min, and shows high sensitivity; high specificity; rapid influenza diagnostic test (antigen detection) detects Influenza A or B virus antigens, does not distinguish subtypes, has a typical time to results of 10–15 min, and shows moderate sensitivity; high specificity; and molecular assays (including reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) detect Influenza A or B viral RNA, can distinguish subtypes ("Yes, if subtype primers are used"), have a typical time to results of 1–8 h, and show very high sensitivity; very high specificity. Negative results may not rule out influenza, specificities are generally high (> 90%) for all tests compared with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the typical sensitivity of a rapid test performed in a clinician's office is 50% to 70%, clinicians may wish to confirm negative rapid tests with molecular assays during peak community influenza activity, and some FDA-cleared rapid tests are CLIA-waived while most rapid influenza molecular assays are CLIA-waived depending on complexity.

### Hospital resource utilization and patient outcomes associated with respiratory viral testing in hospitalized patients [^72a52165]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In 2003, the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak infected 774 and killed 8,096 persons worldwide. It was quickly recognized that this virus spread between close contacts, because 21% of infected case-patients were health care workers caring for patients infected with the SARS coronavirus. During the outbreak, respiratory infection control policies were developed by clinical infectious disease and public health experts, and their use was mandated in all Canadian hospitals. These measures were attributed to the eventual control of the outbreak. As a result, infection control practices, including strict hand hygiene, viral testing of patient samples, and use of isolation precautions, quarantine rooms, and personal protective equipment, were mandated for routine use with all patients who sought treatment at emergency departments (EDs) with respiratory symptoms and fever.

National guidelines suggest that patients admitted to acute care hospitals with infectious respiratory symptoms should receive screening for viral infections by answering symptom-based questionnaires, and they should be placed under droplet isolation precautions until definitive evidence rules out a transmissible respiratory illness. Viral testing in this setting is carried out with a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample, which is processed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA), PCR, or both to identify a viral pathogen. Viral testing in these patients should improve diagnostic clarity, reduce the number of subsequent diagnostic tests and procedures required, and prevent infection transmission to other patients and health care workers by guiding the use of isolation precautions. However, these outcomes can only occur if physicians and infection control practitioners assess the results of the viral test and feel confident ruling out viral disease on the basis of the results.

### Evaluation of uncomplicated acute respiratory tract infection management in veterans: a national utilization review [^708a17f0]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are overprescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs). Guidelines provide criteria to determine which patients should receive antibiotics. We assessed congruence between documentation of ARI diagnostic and treatment practices with guideline recommendations, treatment appropriateness, and outcomes.

Methods

A multicenter quality improvement evaluation was conducted in 28 Veterans Affairs facilities. We included visits for pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections (URI-NOS) that occurred during the 2015–2016 winter season. A manual record review identified complicated cases, which were excluded. Data were extracted for visits meeting criteria, followed by analysis of practice patterns, guideline congruence, and outcomes.

Results

Of 5,740 visits, 4,305 met our inclusion criteria: pharyngitis (n = 558), rhinosinusitis (n = 715), bronchitis (n = 1,155), URI-NOS (n = 1,475), or mixed diagnoses (> 1 ARI diagnosis) (n = 402). Antibiotics were prescribed in 68% of visits: pharyngitis (69%), rhinosinusitis (89%), bronchitis (86%), URI-NOS (37%), and mixed diagnosis (86%). Streptococcal diagnostic testing was performed in 33% of pharyngitis visits; group A Streptococcus was identified in 3% of visits. Streptococcal tests were ordered less frequently for patients who received antibiotics (28%) than those who did not receive antibiotics 44%; P < .01). Although 68% of visits for rhinosinusitis had documentation of symptoms, only 32% met diagnostic criteria for antibiotics. Overall, 39% of patients with uncomplicated ARIs received appropriate antibiotic management. The proportion of 30-day return visits for ARI care was similar for appropriate (11%) or inappropriate (10%) antibiotic management (P = 0.22).

Conclusions

Antibiotics were prescribed in most uncomplicated ARI visits, indicating substantial overuse. Practice was frequently discordant with guideline diagnostic and treatment recommendations.

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years — diagnostic criteria and imaging: The diagnosis is made when a child with an acute upper respiratory tract infection presents with persistent illness lasting more than 10 days without improvement, a worsening course, or severe onset with concurrent fever (temperature ≥ 39°C[102.2°F]) and purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days. Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of any kind to distinguish acute bacterial sinusitis from viral URI; however, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses should be obtained whenever a child is suspected of having orbital or central nervous system complications.

### Procalcitonin for diagnosis of infection and guide to antibiotic decisions: past, present and future [^7770c33f]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There are a number of limitations to using conventional diagnostic markers for patients with clinical suspicion of infection. As a consequence, unnecessary and prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents adversely affect patient outcomes, while inappropriate antibiotic therapy increases antibiotic resistance. A growing body of evidence supports the use of procalcitonin (PCT) to improve diagnosis of bacterial infections and to guide antibiotic therapy. For patients with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, post-operative infections and for severe sepsis patients in the intensive care unit, randomized-controlled trials have shown a benefit of using PCT algorithms to guide decisions about initiation and/or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. For some other types of infections, observational studies have shown promising first results, but further intervention studies are needed before use of PCT in clinical routine can be recommended. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence for PCT in different infections and clinical settings, and discuss the reliability of this marker when used with validated diagnostic algorithms.

### Viral respiratory infections: a cause of community-acquired pneumonia or a predisposing factor? [^cf145a74]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A cause for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is only identified in ∼50% of cases. Nasopharyngeal PCR panels contain more viruses than previously. The problem then becomes determining the relevance of the organisms identified rather than figuring out which virus is present. This review addresses how to distinguish between viral CAP and bacterial CAP, how viral CAP predisposes to bacterial CAP and some novel antiviral treatment being conducted.

Recent Findings

The pneumonia severity index has been studied in patients with viral CAP. There are new studies using biomarkers to help determine when antimicrobial treatment is needed in CAP patients, and there is still no consensus. Newer devices are being invented in an effort to separate upper from lower respiratory organisms to make test results more relevant. Several outcome studies in patients with viral CAP are reviewed.

Summary

In addition to clinical correlation, using biomarkers can be useful to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP. Outcomes in patients with a co-infection are generally worse as a viral infection may predispose someone to a bacterial pneumonia. Influenza CAP treatment may be initially accompanied with antimicrobials until a patient's diagnosis is clear (∼48-72h). Future research is being conducted for antiviral treatment more than for influenza.

### Severe respiratory viral infections: new evidence and changing paradigms [^9aa504e6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Lower respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of death in the United States. Advances in diagnostic testing have improved our ability to detect pathogens. Viral pathogens are important causal pathogens in immunocompetent patients. As the number of elderly adults and those with chronic medical conditions increases, the burden of viral respiratory infections will increase. Clinicians must be familiar with the characteristics of rhinovirus, human adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus. Major challenges include distinguishing true infection from asymptomatic carriage and characterizing patients admitted with severe lower respiratory tract infection who do not have a causative pathogen identified.

On the basis of the reported detection rates, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (US) has recommended the collection of sole upper respiratory NPS, but the US Food and Drug Administration pointed out that a negative RT-PCR test result does not completely rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and it shall not be used as a single element for patient management decisions. As a fact, it has been described that a negative NPS or OPS does not rule out COVID-19 as in some cases consistent diagnosis occurs from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after repeated negative testing at NPS and OPS. This could be partially related to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 RNA titer in the upper respiratory tract peaks between days 7 and 10 after the clinical onset. Reduced detection rate could be also related to either inadequacy of sample collection into the nasopharynx (the risk that collection of secretions from the nasal cavity rather than the nasopharynx is unneglectable, given the incomplete patient cooperation during this unpleasant maneuver) or a limited viral local tropism due to the low expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors in the epithelial cells of the nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal surface.

All the currently available diagnostic techniques are reported and described in Table 1.

Diagnostic Test for SARS-CoV-2 Detection.

Some concerns should be also raised about safety, as during diagnostic maneuver dispersal of infected aerosol could occur with possible nosocomial transmission: at the time of writing, more than 28 600 cases have been documented among Italian health care workers, with 167 deaths among physicians.

This article aims at discussing advantages and limitations of the available diagnostic sampling modalities for nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including NPS, OPS, and self-collected saliva specimens, and proposing some practical suggestions to improve diagnostic reliability.

### Association between antibiotic prescriptions for acute upper respiratory infections and pneumonia among older adults: a nationwide cohort study [^b0bd01c9]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We investigated the associations between clinical characteristics, antibiotic prescriptions, and comorbidities and the diagnosis of pneumonia among older adults with acute URIs using national health insurance claims data. Antibiotic use was associated with a higher likelihood of pneumonia diagnosis, although a causal relationship could not be established. By broadening the diagnostic criteria to include up to four sub-diagnoses, we improved case identification. These findings may inform future policies and clinical guidelines for appropriate antibiotic use in older adults with acute URIs.

### Diagnosis and management of rhinosinusitis: a practice parameter update [^29c44215]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis — history of rhinosinusitis identifies that acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is suspected in patients whose upper respiratory infection (URI) has persisted beyond 7 to 10 days or is worsening after initial improvement, and symptoms lasting 5 to 10 days are the most difficult to assess because they may reflect an ongoing viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) or the beginning of a bacterial infection. In adults, prominent symptoms include nasal congestion, obstruction, anterior and/or posterior purulent rhinorrhea, and facial pain or pressure, and a history of persistent purulent rhinorrhea and facial pain appear to have some correlation with increased likelihood of bacterial disease; in children, symptoms often also include increased irritability, even more prolonged cough, and vomiting that occurs in association with gagging on mucus. In contrast to ABRS, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone and can be subdivided into CRSsNP and CRSwNP; patients with CRSwNP generally present with periodic exacerbations with increased facial pain or pressure and increased drainage, and fever is absent or low grade with persistence of some sinonasal symptoms between episodes that distinguishes CRS from recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS), in which the patient is asymptomatic between ABRS episodes.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing — For symptomatic patients, the IDSA panel suggests using standard NAAT over rapid antigen (Ag) tests due to higher sensitivity, and because Ag tests have very high specificity a positive result is actionable immediately and does not require routine confirmation; however, if Ag tests are used, a negative Ag test result should be confirmed with a standard NAAT when clinical suspicion remains, and testing within the first 5 days of symptoms optimizes Ag sensitivity with Ag testing done within 5 days of symptom onset to minimize false negatives and to diagnose patients within the treatment eligibility window.

Clinical pathway

Patients may be tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 when they present with symptoms, have had known exposure to a confirmed case, or in a screening context, with no known exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2. The standard approach to diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is through laboratory‐based testing of swab samples taken from the upper respiratory (e.g. nasopharynx, oropharynx) or lower respiratory tract (e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage or sputum) with RT‐PCR. RT‐PCR is the primary method for detecting infection during the acute phase of the illness while the virus is still present. Both the WHO and the China CDC (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China), have produced case definitions for COVID‐19 that include the presence of convincing clinical evidence (some including positive serology tests) when RT‐PCR is negative (Appendix 1).

Prior test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and to help identify those requiring tests. A number of key symptoms have been suggested as indicators of mild to moderate COVID‐19, including: cough, fever greater than 37.8 °C, headache, breathlessness, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste (Struyf 2021). However, the recently published review of signs and symptoms found good evidence for the accuracy for these symptoms alone or in combination to be lacking (Struyf 2021).

Where people are asymptomatic but are being tested as part of screening (e.g. universal testing of students as part of a risk‐reduction effort) or on the basis of epidemiological risk factors, such as exposure to someone with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 or following travel to more highly endemic countries, no prior tests will have been conducted.

### Advancing access to diagnostic tools essential for universal health coverage and antimicrobial resistance prevention: an overview of trials in sub-saharan Africa [^882b9e08]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

RDT selection was based on the following criteria: RDTs had to (1) be currently available on the international market and have European CE mark or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval; (2) be fit to be used in outpatient clinics in LMICs by a primary healthcare worker, with or without the guidance of a trained laboratory person; (3) be able to identify infections likely to be prevalent at the study sites or aid the differentiation between viral and bacterial infections; and (4) be approved for use in the country of the study site for either research or diagnostic purposes.

Following these criteria, we selected seven pathogen-specific tests for: malaria, group A Streptococcus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for children aged < 2 years, Streptococcus pneumoniae, dengue virus, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (enteric fever) and 3 general biomarkers of acute infection (white blood cell differentiation, C-reactive protein [CRP], and urine dipstick for nitrites and leucocyte esterase; Table 2).

Table 2.
Tests Used and Their Reported Performance

This test selection, however, has limitations. First, they may not cover the spectrum of infections among the study population, which was not known and could vary, both from country to country and seasonally. Second, the number of infections that can be detected with an RDT is limited, and each test is standalone; therefore, several tests may need to be performed for each patient, which is an important factor in young children where samples can be difficult to collect. Third, test performance is not always well established, also given the lack of gold standards, which means that the predictive value of a positive or negative test may be questionable especially in the presence of varying disease prevalence. Fourth, tests results do not necessarily conclusively inform treatment choices. For instance, a positive test for a viral infection does not exclude a potential concomitant bacterial infection; or the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae or group A Streptococcus from an upper respiratory sample in a child does not imply an aetiologic role in a concurrent respiratory illness, given the frequency of asymptomatic colonization with both organisms in early childhood. Specifically, the BinaxNOW urinary pneumococcal antigen test may not be of much utility in discriminating between children with and without pneumococcal LRTI due to nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae, cross-reactivity with antigens from other colonizing bacteria, such as Streptococcus mitis, and from pneumococcal vaccination. All these are factors prevalent in our study settings and may hinder the utility of the test.

### Development and internal validation of a clinical rule to improve antibiotic use in children presenting to primary care with acute respiratory tract infection and cough: a prognostic cohort study [^40a1fe41]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The main limitation is the relatively small number of hospital admissions for respiratory tract infections, which affects two areas. First, we were not able to externally validate the final model. Although external validation is desirable before clinical application, bootstrap validation takes model over-optimism into account and is considered better than data splitting, especially in the presence of limited outcome events. Our results are biologically plausible and the associations substantial, and by analogy, it is reasonable for clinical practice to change on the basis of a single, well done randomised trial. Second, our model development breached the widely quoted rule of ten events per candidate predictor. However, this is only a rule of thumb, with little theoretical or empirical justification, and the consequences of variable selection are strongly dependent on the strength of association between candidate predictors and the outcome. Finally, it is possible that other biomarkers could be used to improve prognostic certainty, for example, pulse oximetry (our missing data might have impeded a full assessment of usefulness); inflammatory markers, which are diagnostically useful; and rapid point-of-care pathogen tests. We chose not to include C-reactive protein testing because of the recruitment disincentive to children of taking blood. We considered but discounted assessing generalisability by comparing children's characteristics with those of routine datasets because of the variable coding of respiratory tract infections in primary careand the fact that cohort children had acute cough and respiratory tract infection, representing a range of underlying diagnoses including upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

Although new evidence is providing early warning of impending critical illness in secondary care, we are not aware of similar, representative, large-scale studies to establish the prognostic usefulness of children's clinical parameters in primary care, that is, studies that have developed algorithms to predict future complications. We are aware of two small primary care studies, the first of which also showed fever and abnormal chest signs predicted reconsultation for worsening illness, although the second did not find any prognostically useful characteristics. Other studies, have assessed the diagnostic usefulness of symptoms and signs for a range of serious infections (including meningitis, septicaemia, pyelonephritis, and pneumonia) arising within shorter timeframes of index testing, with all but onedone in secondary care. In contrast to our results, these studies showed parental concern, dyspnoea, and clinician gut feelingwere useful for diagnosing pneumonia.

IDSA molecular diagnostic testing — Recommendation 5 states that the IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and it notes that while repeat testing when the initial test result is negative is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered.

Influenza diagnostic testing and SARS-CoV-2 considerations — Nucleic acid assays are the most sensitive diagnostic assays, and do not delay starting antiviral treatment while waiting for confirmatory laboratory testing results; the sensitivity of antigen-based rapid influenza diagnostic tests is substantially lower than RT-PCR or viral culture, these tests cannot distinguish between seasonal influenza A and animal-origin influenza A infections, and a negative antigen-based rapid influenza diagnostic test result does not rule out influenza virus infection, so healthcare professionals should not rely on a negative antigen-based rapid influenza diagnostic test result to make decisions about treatment; in hospitalized patients with severe respiratory disease, the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 should be considered and use of multiplex assays that detect both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 can inform clinical management.
