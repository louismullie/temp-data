## Question

Blood cultures growing gram negative rods

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage blood cultures growing gram-negative rods. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate verification and preanalytic quality. Then, I should verify the clinical significance and distinguish true infection from contamination. Next, I will assess severity and start empiric therapy, followed by source control and follow-up blood cultures. After that, I need to tailor therapy to susceptibilities and consider duration, with special populations in mind. Finally, I will integrate rapid diagnostics and outline documentation and follow-up priorities, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the basics and avoid jumping to conclusions: I need to check the Gram stain morphology and ensure the organism is truly gram-negative, verify that the bottles are from different sites and adequate volume, and confirm time to positivity, because these factors influence both clinical significance and next steps. I should also ask whether antibiotics were given before cultures, as that can reduce yield and delay positivity, which matters for interpretation and stewardship planning [^d74a8e7d] [^30e9d72b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contamination; I should review the number of positive sets, the organism identity, and the clinical context. A single positive set for a common contaminant like coagulase-negative staphylococci is suspicious, but gram-negative rods are less often contaminants, and multiple sets from different sites strengthen the case for true bacteremia, so I need to correlate with fever, leukocytosis, and hemodynamics before labeling it a contaminant [^c272e3e4] [^04b7bb6d].

> I will now examine severity and risk stratification because this drives empiric therapy and urgency. I need to check for sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromise, neutropenia, central venous catheter, recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, and residence in a long-term care facility, as these increase the likelihood of multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens and worse outcomes. I should confirm whether the patient is hemodynamically stable and whether there are signs of end-organ dysfunction, because unstable patients require immediate broad-spectrum therapy and aggressive resuscitation [^30e9d72b] [^ef4a572c].

> Next, I should review empiric antibiotic choices and ensure I am not under-treating. For unstable patients or those with high risk for MDR, I need to cover Pseudomonas and ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, often with a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem, and consider adding an aminoglycoside initially for synergy in septic shock. Wait, let me verify the local antibiogram and prior cultures, because prior resistant gram-negative isolates strongly predict current resistance and should guide empiric avoidance of ineffective agents [^99f41598] [^cac299da].

> I need to ensure source control is addressed early because antibiotics alone are insufficient. Let me consider the most likely sources: urinary tract, pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, and catheter-related infection, and I should act on removing infected devices, draining abscesses, or decompressing obstructed systems within 24–48 hours when feasible. For suspected catheter-related infection, I should obtain paired peripheral and catheter-drawn cultures and plan for catheter removal if the patient is unstable or if bacteremia persists beyond 48–72 hours [^99f41598] [^30e9d72b].

> Now, I should confirm the role of follow-up blood cultures. Initially, I thought repeating cultures was always mandatory, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence; high-quality meta-analyses show that obtaining follow-up blood cultures is associated with significantly lower mortality in gram-negative bacteremia, particularly in high-risk groups such as those with end-stage renal disease, central venous catheters, ESBL producers, or inadequate initial therapy. I should obtain repeat cultures at 48–72 hours if the patient is not improving or if risk factors for persistent bacteremia are present [^acc81605] [^cb6b3c87].

> Let me think about tailoring therapy once susceptibilities return. I should de-escalate to the narrowest effective agent as soon as possible, and I need to remember that piperacillin-tazobactam is not recommended for Enterobacterales with inducible AmpC risk due to limited reliability of tazobactam against AmpC; in those cases, a carbapenem or a newer beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor with better AmpC coverage is preferred. I should double-check for on-therapy resistance risks, especially with Pseudomonas, and monitor closely for clinical response [^3f6c9e77] [^7e62c4d1].

> I should confirm duration next. For uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia with adequate source control and clinical response, 7 days is sufficient and noninferior to 14 days, with earlier switch to oral therapy reasonable once the patient is clinically stable and oral bioavailability is adequate. But wait, I need to ensure there is no endovascular infection, persistent bacteremia, or immunocompromise, which would extend therapy and may require longer courses or even imaging to exclude endocarditis or undrained foci [^8205d2b7] [^afe445ce] [^bb08654c].

> Special populations require tailored thinking. In neonates and young infants, I should maintain a low threshold for blood cultures and consider early catheter removal for gram-negative bacteremia, given high mortality and complication rates. In oncology or transplant patients, I need to cover MDR gram-negatives up front and consider rapid diagnostics to guide early de-escalation. In pregnancy, I should avoid teratogenic agents and favor beta-lactams, adjusting for renal function and source control needs [^788acf1e] [^0e4be16e] [^b8c7bd2d].

> Next, I should review how rapid diagnostics can accelerate optimization. Direct identification from positive blood cultures using MALDI-TOF and rapid susceptibility platforms can shorten time to effective therapy by 24–48 hours, and multiplex PCR panels detecting resistance genes can further refine choices. Hold on, I should verify organism coverage and local validation, because performance varies by pathogen and platform, and results must be integrated with clinical judgment and standard AST for final decisions [^ffc10eb6] [^b5984505] [^0fa099bb].

> I will now examine documentation and communication essentials. I need to record the preanalytic details, clinical assessment, empiric rationale, source control plan, and stewardship actions, and I should communicate with nursing, pharmacy, and the primary team to ensure timely administration, drug-level monitoring when indicated, and reassessment at 48–72 hours. I should also flag high-risk patients for ID consultation, which is associated with improved mortality in gram-negative bacteremia [^2bd7184b].

> Finally, I should double-check that my plan aligns with best practices: verify organism significance with clinical correlation, treat promptly with appropriate empiric coverage, secure source control, obtain follow-up cultures when indicated, de-escalate based on susceptibilities, and choose the shortest effective duration. If any step seems inconsistent with evolving data or local policy, I need to reconsider and adjust accordingly to optimize outcomes and minimize resistance [^30e9d72b] [^acc81605] [^8205d2b7].

Blood cultures growing gram-negative rods indicate **true bacteremia** in most cases and require **prompt empiric therapy** with agents active against local resistance patterns, followed by rapid de-escalation once susceptibilities return [^c6f82602] [^7afee29e]. Early source control and **follow-up blood cultures** at 48–72 hours are essential to guide therapy and detect persistent bacteremia, which is linked to worse outcomes [^acc81605] [^cb6b3c87]. Mortality is higher with **Pseudomonas**, ESBL, or carbapenem-resistant organisms, and delays in appropriate therapy increase risk; **ID consultation** improves outcomes [^2bd7184b] [^98f9d78f]. For uncomplicated cases, 7 days of therapy is sufficient; for complicated disease or slow response, extend to 10–14 days [^8205d2b7] [^afe445ce].

---

## Clinical significance and epidemiology

- **True bacteremia**: Gram-negative rods in blood cultures usually represent true bacteremia, not contamination, and carry significant morbidity and mortality [^notfound].

- **Common pathogens**: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Proteus mirabilis are frequent causes [^notfound].

- **Mortality**: Gram-negative bacteremia mortality is 13–20%, higher with Pseudomonas, ESBL, or carbapenem-resistant organisms [^d6d99ad7] [^98f9d78f].

---

## Risk factors and patient populations

- **Healthcare exposure**: Hospitalization, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, and indwelling devices increase risk [^notfound].

- **Immunocompromised hosts**: Neutropenia, malignancy, transplant, and HIV are high-risk groups [^0e4be16e].

- **Chronic diseases**: Diabetes, liver disease, and renal failure elevate risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and complications

- **Sepsis and septic shock**: Common presentations with hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction [^notfound].

- **Complications**: Endocarditis, metastatic infections, persistent bacteremia, and recurrent BSI are well described [^1bc5f72f].

- **Persistent bacteremia**: Associated with increased recurrence and worse outcomes [^1bc5f72f].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Initial assessment**: Identify the source with history, exam, and imaging (urine, lungs, abdomen, CNS, devices) [^ef4a572c].

- **Follow-up cultures**: Repeat at 48–72 hours to assess clearance and detect persistence [^acc81605] [^cb6b3c87].

- **Rapid diagnostics**: MALDI-TOF and multiplex PCR can expedite identification and resistance detection [^ffc10eb6] [^0fa099bb].

---

## Empiric antimicrobial therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local antibiograms**, patient-specific risk factors, and severity [^ef4a572c]. For stable patients without MDR risk, use a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime) or a beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (piperacillin-tazobactam) [^notfound]. For severe illness or MDR risk, use a carbapenem (meropenem, imipenem) or piperacillin-tazobactam plus an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone [^99f41598]. For suspected ESBL, use a carbapenem; for suspected Pseudomonas, use an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone [^notfound].

---

## Definitive antimicrobial therapy

Definitive therapy should be **narrowed to the narrowest effective agent** based on susceptibilities [^d6d99ad7]. For uncomplicated cases, 7 days is sufficient; for complicated disease or slow response, extend to 10–14 days [^8205d2b7] [^afe445ce]. Early switch to oral therapy is reasonable once stable and susceptibilities allow [^bb08654c].

---

## Adjunctive interventions

Source control entails **prompt identification and management** of the source — such as drainage of abscesses, removal of infected devices, or relief of obstruction [^notfound]. Infectious diseases consultation is associated with **reduced mortality** and should be obtained early [^2bd7184b].

---

## Prognostic factors and outcomes

- **Mortality predictors**: Severity of illness, Pseudomonas, ESBL, carbapenem resistance, and delays in appropriate therapy [^98f9d78f] [^905664d7].

- **Outcomes**: Appropriate empiric therapy and early source control improve survival; ID consultation further reduces mortality [^c6f82602] [^2bd7184b].

- **Recurrence**: Persistent bacteremia increases recurrence risk and signals complicated infection [^1bc5f72f].

---

## Special considerations

- **Polymicrobial bacteremia**: Occurs in ~6.5% of GNR bacteremias, more often with nonfermenters, and may require broader empiric coverage [^8d8f9691].

- **Pediatric patients**: Neonates and young infants have higher mortality with GNR bacteremia; prompt therapy and catheter management are critical [^3cce192f] [^788acf1e].

- **Rapid diagnostics**: MALDI-TOF and multiplex PCR can reduce time to effective therapy and support stewardship [^ffc10eb6] [^0fa099bb].

---

Blood cultures growing gram-negative rods signal **true bacteremia** with substantial mortality; **early, appropriate empiric therapy**, rapid source control, and follow-up cultures are essential. Therapy should be de-escalated to the narrowest effective agent, with 7 days sufficient for uncomplicated cases and longer courses for complicated disease. ID consultation and rapid diagnostics improve outcomes, and persistent bacteremia warrants intensified evaluation and management.

### Polyclonal bacteremia due to gram-negative rods [^8d8f9691]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The frequency of, risk factors for, and outcome of polyclonal gram-negative bacteremia are still unknown. We investigated them in a prospective cohort study of patients for whom a blood culture yielded ≥ 1 species of gram-negative aerobic rod. For each patient, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 4 colonies of each morphologic type. Episodes of bacteremia were considered polyclonal if caused by > 1 PFGE type of the same species. Ten (6.5%) of 153 investigated patients had polyclonal bacteremia. Bacteremia due to nonfermenting rods was the single significant risk factor for polyclonal bacteremia. Complications were equally frequent in all patient groups. However, patients with polyclonal bacteremia received more extensive antibiotic therapy than did patients with monoclonal bacteremia. Nearly 20% of episodes of bacteremia due to nonfermenting rods were polyclonal, but it remains unclear why nonfermenting rods were more likely to cause polyclonal bacteremia than were other gram-negative rods.

### Association of follow-up blood cultures with mortality in patients with Gram-Negative bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^acc81605]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with gram-negative bacterial bloodstream infections, is obtaining follow-up blood cultures after the initial positive blood cultures associated with decreased patient mortality?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis that included 5 observational studies and 4378 patients in the primary analysis, obtaining follow-up blood cultures was associated with decreased patient mortality. The overall strength of evidence for the association of obtaining follow-up blood cultures with decreased mortality was moderate.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that well-designed observational studies support the use of follow-up blood cultures in patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections; however, subgroup analyses that identify patients who do not require follow-up blood cultures are lacking.

Conclusions

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, 7 days of therapy likely represent the preferred duration for uncomplicated Gram-negative bloodstream infections. Future RCTs outside Enterobacterales bacteria and in populations that are more severely immunocompromised will be helpful in providing further evidence in support of shorter durations.

### Contamination of intravenous fluids: a continuing cause of hospital bacteremia [^0aaa845e]. American Journal of Infection Control (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Nosocomial bacteremia caused by the contamination of intravenous (IV) infusates is considered rare. Unfortunately, this problem has been underestimated because its identification requires culturing infusates, a procedure not performed routinely.

Methods

This study was conducted in a referral hospital where IV infusates are admixed in nursing areas. The aim was to determine the prevalence of infusate contamination in adult patients with gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia. Over a period of 32 months, a specimen of infusate was drawn for culture from each patient recruited after the laboratory reported a GNR in the blood.

Results

A total of 384 infusates were cultured from 384 patients who had been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia. Seven infusates grew a GNR in culture, for a contamination rate of 2% (7/384; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1% to 3%). In all cases, the infectious organism was the same as the organism isolated from the blood. Infusate contamination was responsible for 7% (7/108; 95% CI = 2% to 11%) of all primary bloodstream infections and 11% (7/62; 95% CI = 2% to 22%) of all primary bloodstream infections not associated with central venous catheter infection.

Conclusions

For patients in hospitals where IV drugs are admixed in nursing units, we recommend instituting infusate culture as routine practice following the diagnosis of a GNR in the blood.

### Blood culture utilization in the hospital setting: a call for diagnostic stewardship [^2cec5aa7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

There has been significant progress in detection of bloodstream pathogens in recent decades with the development of more sensitive automated blood culture detection systems and the availability of rapid molecular tests for faster organism identification and detection of resistance genes. However, most blood cultures in clinical practice do not grow organisms, suggesting that suboptimal blood culture collection practices (e.g., suboptimal blood volume) or suboptimal selection of patients to culture (i.e., blood cultures ordered for patients with low likelihood of bacteremia) may be occurring. A national blood culture utilization benchmark does not exist, nor do specific guidelines on when blood cultures are appropriate or when blood cultures are of low value and waste resources. Studies evaluating the potential harm associated with excessive blood cultures have focused on blood culture contamination, which has been associated with significant increases in health care costs and negative consequences for patients related to exposure to unnecessary antibiotics and additional testing. Optimizing blood culture performance is important to ensure bloodstream infections (BSIs) are diagnosed while minimizing adverse events from overuse. In this review, we discuss key factors that influence blood culture performance, with a focus on the preanalytical phase, including technical aspects of the blood culture collection process and blood culture indications. We highlight areas for improvement and make recommendations to improve current blood culture practices among hospitalized patients.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 — Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas — infection management for ulcerated/necrotic tumors states that infection with Gram-negative rods is common in necrotic tumors and may lead to serious complications such as bacteremia/sepsis. For active or suspected infections in patients with ulcerated and necrotic tumors, blood cultures should be obtained and empiric therapy with antibacterials should be considered even in the absence of a fever. An antimicrobial agent with broad-spectrum coverage (including coverage for both Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci) should be chosen initially. The role of skin/wound culture is not clear in this setting, and further information on empiric therapy in patients with cancer at risk for infections is included in the NCCN Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections.

### Impact on clinical outcome of follow-up blood cultures and risk factors for persistent bacteraemia in patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^cb6b3c87]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical usefulness of follow-up blood cultures (FUBCs) in gram-negative bloodstream infections (GN-BSIs) represents a debated issue.

Objective

To assess the impact on the clinical outcome of FUBCs in patients with GN-BSI and to predict risk factors for persistent bacteraemia.

Data Sources

PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library Database were independently searched until 24 June, 2022.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials, prospective, or retrospective observational studies, including patients affected by GN-BSIs. Primary endpoints were in-hospital mortality rate, and persistent blood stream infections were defined as FUBC-positive for the same pathogen isolated from index blood cultures (BCs).

Participants

Hospitalized patients with documented GN-BSIs.

Intervention

Performance of FUBCs (defined as subsequent BCs collected at least 24 hours after index BCs).

Assessment Of Risk Of Bias

Quality of included studies was independently assessed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions.

Methods Of Data Synthesis

Meta-analysis was performed by pooling odds ratio (OR) retrieved from studies providing adjustment for confounders using random-effect model with the inverse variance method. Risk factors for persistent blood stream infections were also assessed.

Results

A total of 3747 articles were screened, and 11 observational studies (6 assessing impact on outcome (N = 4631), and 5 investigating risk factors for persistent GN-BSI (N = 2566)), conducted between 2002 and 2020 were included. The execution of FUBCs was associated with a significantly lower risk of mortality (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.49–0.70; I² = 0.0%). The presence of end-stage renal disease (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.77–5.05), central venous catheter (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.82–5.95), infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing strains (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.18–4.28), resistance to empirical treatment (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.65–4.41), and unfavourable response at 48 hours (OR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.44–6.24) emerged as independent risk factors for persistent bacteraemia.

Conclusions

The execution of FUBCs is associated with a significantly low risk of mortality in patients with GN-BSIs. Our analysis could be useful to stratify patients at a high risk of persistent bacteraemia to optimize the use of FUBCs.

### About Gram-negative bacteria… [^6a8a20a0]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Gram-negative bacteria can cause serious infections in healthcare settings.
- Infections from these bacteria are becoming increasingly difficult to treat due to antimicrobial resistance.
- To prevent these infections, healthcare providers should follow recommended infection control practices. Overview Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis in healthcare settings. These infections can be hard to treat since the bacteria causing them can become resistant to common antibiotics. Resistance to most or all antibiotics has also been reported. Types Prevention
- Patients and caregivers should follow CDC guidelines on patient safety.
- Healthcare providers and facilities should follow core infection control practices to reduce the risk of spreading these germs to patients.

Testing CDC collaborates with laboratories to identify and recommend tests to detect gram-negative bacteria. Keep Reading: Laboratory Testing for Gram Negative. Treatment Gram-negative infections can be difficult to treat. Some types of gram-negative bacteria can become resistant to multiple drugs, including antibiotics like carbapenems. What CDC is doing
- Providing testing to identify antimicrobial resistance cases, measure resistance and track transmission in a healthcare setting through the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network.
- Tracking gram-negative bacteria infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by gram-negative bacteria and slow the spread of resistant germs.

### Clinical performance of the novel genMark Dx ePlex blood culture ID Gram-Positive panel [^3051f7d8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The BCID-GP Panel is unique in its inclusion of thegroup. This Gram-positive spore-forming rod is ubiquitous in the environment, and while it is best known for its association with foodborne infections, it can cause a variety of nongastrointestinal diseases, some of which are quite severe. Bacteremia can lead to sepsis and associated high mortality.bloodstream infections are often nosocomial and the result of infected central venous catheters, as this organism can produce significant biofilms. Injection drug users are another population at risk for bacteremia and endocarditis. Studies of immunocompromised hosts, especially those patients with hematological malignancies, have shown complicated outcomes, including metastatic neurological events such as meningoencephalitis and cerebral abscesses. Given its propensity for severe infections in hospitalized patients and its antimicrobial resistance profile due to broad beta-lactamase production, more rapid identification of this organism may have significant impact on the time to appropriate therapy.

### Comparison of 2 blood culture media shows significant differences in bacterial recovery for patients on antimicrobial therapy [^9e582b77]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial removal devices in blood culture media are designed to remove antibiotics from the blood culture solution, thereby facilitating bacterial growth. How well these devices function clinically has not been established.

Methods

All blood drawn for culture from adult inpatients and emergency department visitors in a level I trauma center was placed in paired BACTEC Plus and BacT/Alert FAN culture media and studied simultaneously, consecutively, and prospectively between 1 February and 30 September 2011. All cultures were processed per standard laboratory protocols.

Results

Of 9395 total cultures collected, 1219 (13%) were positive, 831 were included, and 524 (33%) contained pathogens. BACTEC had a 4.5-hour faster detection time (P < .0001), and isolated exclusively 182 of 524 (35%; P < .001) pathogens, 136 of 345 (39%) of the gram-positive cocci (P < .001), 48 of 175 (27%; P = 0.02) of the gram-negative rods, 101 of 195 (52%) of Staphylococcus aureus (P < .001), and 59 of 120 (49%; P = 0.004) septic events. If active antibiotics had been dosed 0–4 or 4–48 hours prior to culture collection, the odds of that culture growing in BACTEC were 4.8- and 5.2-fold greater, respectively, than of growing in BacT/Alert (P < .0001). Both were equivalent in the recovery of yeast and when no antimicrobials were dosed.

Conclusions

BACTEC media has faster time to detection and increased bacterial recovery over the BacT/Alert media in the following categories: overall growth, pathogens, septic events, gram-positive cocci, gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and cultures where antimicrobials were dosed up to 48 hours before culture collection.

4 Discussion

The current study results confirm recent findings from large cohorts of patients with GN-BSI in Italy and North Carolina. Obtaining FUBC was significantly associated with nearly 50% decline in 28-day mortality after adjustments for the propensity to obtain FUBC and other risk factors for mortality.

This consistent decline in mortality in association with obtaining FUBC was remarkable given the vast differences in patient populations, microbiology, and clinical practice among the three cohorts that combined over 4000 patients. Inclusion of patients from tertiary care referral centers in the two earlier studies as compared to community hospitals in the current investigation resulted in more complex patient populations with higher proportion of cancer and other comorbidities. Whereas nearly one-half and one-third of GN-BSI were hospital-acquired in the studies from Italy and North Carolina, respectively, the current cohort included only patients with community-onset GN-BSI. This led to considerably higher proportion of BSI due to P. aeruginosa and other non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli in the first two cohorts than the current study. Differences in the source of GN-BSI were also noted with predominance of the urinary tract (60%) in the current cohort compared to the other two studies (32–38%). Various study settings and geographical locations likely influenced antimicrobial resistance and empirical antimicrobial therapy. The proportion of patients receiving appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy was 68%, 84%, and 93% in Italy, North Carolina, and South Carolina, respectively. The medical practice also varied between the three sites; 68% of patients with GN-BSI in North Carolina had FUBC obtained as compared to only 29% in South Carolina and 18% in Italy. These differences likely contributed to the lower overall proportion of persistently positive FUBC in the current study (7%) compared to the previous two cohorts (20–38%).

### Gram-negative bacteremia upon hospital admission: when should Pseudomonas aeruginosa be suspected? [^a8102c92]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an uncommon cause of community-acquired bacteremia among patients without severe immunodeficiency. Because tension exists between the need to limit unnecessary use of anti-pseudomonal agents and the need to avoid a delay in appropriate therapy, clinicians require better guidance regarding when to cover empirically for P. aeruginosa. We sought to determine the occurrence of and construct a model to predict P. aeruginosa bacteremia upon hospital admission.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted in 4 tertiary care hospitals. Microbiology databases were searched to find all episodes of bacteremia caused by gram-negative rods (GNRs) ≤ 48 h after hospital admission. Patient data were extracted from the medical records of 151 patients with P. aeruginosa bacteremia and of 152 randomly selected patients with bacteremia due to Enterobacteriaceae. Discriminative parameters were identified using logistic regression, and the probabilities of having P. aeruginosa bacteremia were calculated.

Results

P. aeruginosa caused 6.8% of 4114 unique patient episodes of GNR bacteremia upon hospital admission (incidence ratio, 5 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). Independent predictors of P. aeruginosa bacteremia were severe immunodeficiency, age > 90 years, receipt of antimicrobial therapy within past 30 days, and presence of a central venous catheter or a urinary device. Among 250 patients without severe immunodeficiency, if no predictor variables existed, the likelihood of having P. aeruginosa bacteremia was 1:42. If ≥ 2 predictors existed, the risk increased to nearly 1:3.

Conclusions

P. aeruginosa bacteremia upon hospital admission in patients without severe immunodeficiency is rare. Among immunocompetent patients with suspected GNR bacteremia who have ≥ 2 predictors, empirical anti-pseudomonal treatment is warranted.

### Utility of pyrosequencing in identifying bacteria directly from positive blood culture bottles [^5e3d1eeb]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Growth in liquid media is the gold standard for detecting microorganisms associated with bloodstream infections. The Gram stain provides the first clue as to the etiology of infection, with phenotypic identification completed 1 or 2 days later. Providing more detailed information than the Gram stain can impart, and in less time than subculturing, would allow the use of more directed empirical therapy and, thus, reduce the patient's exposure to unnecessary or ineffective antibiotics sooner. The study had two objectives, as follows: (i) to identify new targets to improve our ability to differentiate among certain enteric gram-negative rods or among certain Streptococcus species and (ii) to determine whether real-time PCR and pyrosequencing could as accurately identify organisms directly from positive blood culture bottles as culture-based methods. Two hundred and fifty-five consecutive positive blood culture bottles were included. The results showed a high level of agreement between the two approaches; of the 270 bacteria isolated from the 255 blood culture bottles, results for pyrosequencing and culture-based identifications were concordant for 264/270 (97.8%) bacteria with three failed sequences, and three sequences without match. Additionally, compared to the universal 16S rRNA gene target, the new 23S rRNA gene targets greatly improved our ability to differentiate among certain enteric gram-negative rods or among certain Streptococcus species. In conclusion, combining real-time PCR and pyrosequencing provided valuable information beyond that derived from the initial Gram stain and in less time than phenotypic culture-based identification. This strategy, if implemented, could result in a more directed empirical therapy in patients and would promote responsible antibiotic stewardship.

### Impact of follow up blood cultures on outcomes of patients with community-onset gram-negative bloodstream infection [^2e441a14]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, the current study results confirm the findings of two recent large observational cohorts from Italy and North Carolina supporting the role of FUBC in the management of GN-BSI. In patietns with community-onset GN-BSI who are expected to remain hospitalized for > 72 hours, obtaining FUBC should be considered, particularly in the context of end-stage renal disease, central venous catheter source of infection, receipt of inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and BSI due to Serratia species among other risk factors for persistent GN-BSI.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^bb9295d6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial enteric infections in HIV — culture-based diagnosis and when to obtain blood cultures. The diagnosis of Gram-negative bacterial enteric infection is established through cultures of stool and blood, and stool cultures are required to obtain antibiotic sensitivity testing for isolated enteric pathogens; stool cultures are preferred over or in addition to molecular diagnostics in HIV-infected patients. Because incidence of bacteremia associated with Salmonella gastroenteritis is high in HIV-infected individuals, blood cultures should be obtained from any patient with diarrhea and fever, and for shigellosis, blood cultures may be helpful but are less likely to be positive than in salmonellosis. Patients may also have non-jejuni non-coli Campylobacter species and enteropathic Helicobacter spp.; blood culture systems will typically grow these bacteria, but they are unlikely to be identified on routine stool cultures because growing these fastidious organisms requires special stool culture conditions.

### Postconception age and other risk factors associated with mortality following Gram-negative rod bacteremia [^3cce192f]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal nosocomial Gram-negative rod bacteremia (GNR-b) is considered ominous.

Design

Multi-center cohort study of premature infants (N = 6172) who had a blood culture after day of life 3 and whose birthweight was ≤ 1250 g.

Results

A total of 437 neonates developed GNR-b; most commonly with Klebsiella (122/437; 28%), Enterobacter (97/437; 22%), Escherichia coli (90/437; 21%), Pseudomonas (63/437; 14%), and Serratia (49/437; 11%). Neonates infected with Pseudomonas were more likely to die (21/63; 33%) than infants infected with other GNR (50/374; 13%). In multivariable logistic regression, infection with Pseudomonas, mechanical ventilation, and race were associated with subsequent mortality. Postconception age (PCA) was most strongly associated with mortality. Using neonates with > 34 weeks PCA at the time of the first blood culture as the reference category, mortality was higher in neonates < 26 weeks PCA (odds ratio (OR) = 9.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.79, 30.44), and in neonates 26 to 28 weeks PCA (OR = 3.94; 95% CI = 1.29, 12.03).

Conclusions

Among premature infants, much of the mortality experienced in GNR-b is due to infection with Pseudomonas rather than enteric GNR. Race, the need for mechanical ventilation, and younger PCA when the blood culture was obtained were also strongly associated with mortality.

### Gram-negative sepsis caused by a rare pathogen [^c0117fa4]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

In the ED, the patient was started on intravenous cefepime (2 g daily) and given a loading dose of vancomycin. While at a blood pressure of 75/41, she was given 2 L of normal saline with no change in her blood pressure; thus, norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of shock. Over the next 48 hours, the patient demonstrated marked improvement, with down-titration and ultimate discontinuation of norepinephrine on day 3 of hospitalisation.

12 hours after the blood cultures were drawn, growth was observed in four of four culture bottles, confirming the diagnosis of distributive shock secondary to sepsis (no time to positivity differential between draw sites). The gram stain showed gram-negative rods, but no organism was identified by the Rapid Accelerate Pheno System, a fluorescence in situ hybridisation technology that tests for a panel of common bloodstream pathogens. Vancomycin was discontinued and the infectious disease service was consulted. While catheter tip cultures are considered part of the gold standard for confirmation of central line-associated bloodstream infections, their diagnostic and therapeutic value has come into question. Given the cogent source of bacteraemia (related to Hickman removal/leak), four of four peripheral cultures growing bacteria and the decision to remove the new Hickman catheter regardless of tip culture results, the infectious disease team did not obtain these cultures. The skin surrounding the catheter remained dry, intact and non-erythematous. Hickman removal was performed on hospital day 3 with interventional radiology, and subsequent blood cultures were negative.

On hospital day 3, the admission blood cultures speciated as P. ursingii using the Bruker Sirius Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-ToF) system, and research-use-only database 11897, validated for clinical use (2022). On monotherapy cefepime, the patient clinically improved. Her WBC count lowered to 12 100/mm 3, her lactate normalised to 1.3 mmol/L, BUN 29 mg/dL and creatinine had improved to 0.83 mg/dL. Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility breakpoints were used in this testing and yielded pan-sensitivity (figure 2). As a result, the patient was transitioned to ceftriaxone. On hospital day 7, after 72 hours of clear blood cultures, a new Hickman catheter was placed and TPN was restarted. The patient was discharged on hospital day 8, with a planned total course of 14 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy.

### Association of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy with in-hospital mortality in patients with bloodstream infections in the US [^c6f82602]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the use of appropriate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy associated with lower in-hospital mortality in patients with bloodstream infections?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study including 32 100 patients with bloodstream infections from 183 US hospitals, the crude proportions of appropriate empirical therapy use were 94.4% for gram-negative rods, 97.0% for gram-positive cocci, and 65.1% for Candida species, with lower proportions for resistant pathogens. Receipt of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy was associated with lower in-hospital mortality for patients infected with gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci, and Candida species.

Meaning

This study suggests that use of appropriate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy may have a role in inpatient hospital mortality.

### Clinical consensus conference: survey on Gram-positive bloodstream infections with a focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^d358c78c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The increased incidence over the past decade of bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, highlights the critical need for a consistent approach to therapy. However, there is currently no international consensus on the diagnosis and management of gram-positive BSIs. The Clinical Consensus Conference on Gram-Positive Bloodstream Infections was convened as a session at the 9th International Symposium on Modern Concepts in Endocarditis and Cardiovascular Infections held in 2007. Participants discussed various aspects of the practical treatment of patients who present with gram-positive BSI, including therapeutic options for patients with BSIs of undefined origin, the selection of appropriate empirical therapy, and treatment of complicated and uncomplicated BSIs. The opinions of participants about these key issues are reflected in this article.

### Clinical isolation and identification of haematospirillum jordaniae [^fcedd986]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

H. jordaniae is a common environmental microbe, but it was implicated in this clinical case in a man in Delaware. The patient had symptoms characteristic of other pathogenic bacterial illnesses. Concern exists that slow-growing, gram-negative rods identified in blood culture could be potential bioterrorism agents. Humrighouse et al. described how Francisella tularensis infection was suspected in 2 clinical cases that were actually H. jordaniae infections.

Humrighouse et al. proposed the name H. jordaniae on the basis of an isolate received in 2010. Previously, 14 organisms identified at CDC were isolated from blood taken from men 39–78 years of age with symptoms including swelling of the lower extremities (2 patients), septicemia (3 patients), and bacteremia (1 patient). The symptoms of the patient we report mirrored those symptoms.

This discovery is important because it demonstrates that organisms conceived to be environmental in nature and suspected to have limited clinical implications are emerging as human pathogens. The ability to identify bacteria by sequencing (in this case, sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene) was necessary to identify H. jordaniae because clinical information on this pathogen is still limited.

Introduction

Few data exist on the yield and utility of additional blood culture (BC) sets during extravascular infections. The low yield and false-positivity rate owing to contaminants during sample obtainment or handlingsupport optimizing patient management and resource use. We assessed the clinical relevance of collecting an additional BC set while the first set is still incubating with results pending.

### Blood culture contamination with enterococci and skin organisms: implications for surveillance definitions of primary bloodstream infections [^a41e4030]. American Journal of Infection Control (2011). Low credibility.

Enterococci are a common cause of bacteremia but are also common contaminants. In our institution, approximately 17% of positive blood cultures with enterococci are mixed with skin organisms. Such isolates are probable contaminants. The specificity of the current definition of primary bloodstream infection could be increased by excluding enterococci mixed with skin organisms.

### Multi-drug resistance, inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy and mortality in Gram-negative severe sepsis and septic shock: a retrospective cohort study [^905664d7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This large retrospective analysis confirms that non-IAAT is a key determinant of short-term mortality among patients with severe sepsis and septic shock due to a Gram-negative organism. More importantly, our findings indicate that the presence of a MDR Gram-negative pathogen is strongly associated with non-IAAT. Despite the relatively low prevalence of a MDR phenotype among all subjects with Gram-negative bacteremia, these pathogens exert an excessive impact on mortality. In other words, MDR pathogens disproportionately affect outcomes through an intermediate step as it relates to antibiotic therapy. In light of the increasing frequency of multidrug resistance, our observations suggest that urgent action is needed to prevent potential escalation of mortality rates in severe sepsis and septic shock.

Because the co-occurrence of MDR pathogens and non-IAAT was relatively rare, it is important to consider the context of total non-IAAT exposure. The pool for the MDR pathogens as defined in our study comprises the vast majority of Gram-negative organisms responsible for serious infections in the ICU. That is, compared with Acinetobacter spp. for example, the relative prevalence of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae was an order of magnitude higher. Epidemiologically, this imbalance makes it imperative for clinicians to consider these organisms first and foremost when choosing empiric treatment. We have demonstrated that multidrug resistance among these organisms comprises one important mechanism for errors in empiric coverage. At the same time, Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections, although a minority, were extremely likely to be subject to inappropriate empiric treatment (Table 6). Because the risk for drug resistance is very high among these organisms, the observed elevated rates of non-IAAT are probably not because the clinician did not consider their risk for resistance, but rather due to his/her determination that these were not likely pathogens. This approach therefore represents a slightly different mechanism for causing non-IAAT and implies a different solution. Rather than understanding the antibiogram of common pathogens, this requires a clinician to be aware of the rates of specific less common organisms at his/her institution. An additional important mechanism for receiving non-IAAT exists based on the timing of empiric therapy. Fully one-quarter of all non-IAAT fell into this category when there was no evidence of empiric treatment within 24 hours of obtaining the blood culture. This informs yet another corrective approach, one that requires simply to recognize the presence of a severe infection and to institute empiric treatment in a timely manner. These three mechanisms for exposure to non-IAAT and their corrective strategies are subtly yet importantly different from one another. In the current study we focus specifically on the impact of multidrug resistance on the risk of non-IAAT.

### Resistance to empiric antimicrobial treatment predicts outcome in severe sepsis associated with Gram-negative bacteremia [^98f9f78f]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Gram-negative bacteria are an important cause of severe sepsis. Recent studies have demonstrated reduced susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to currently available antimicrobial agents.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with severe sepsis who were bacteremic with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, or Enterobacteriaceae from 2002 to 2007. Patients were identified by the hospital informatics database and pertinent clinical data (demographics, baseline severity of illness, source of bacteremia, and therapy) were retrieved from electronic medical records. All patients were treated with antimicrobial agents within 12 hours of having blood cultures drawn that were subsequently positive for bacterial pathogens. The primary outcome was hospital mortality.

Results

A total of 535 patients with severe sepsis and Gram-negative bacteremia were identified. Hospital mortality was 43.6%, and 82 (15.3%) patients were treated with an antimicrobial regimen to which the causative pathogen was resistant. Patients infected with a resistant pathogen had significantly greater risk of hospital mortality (63.4% vs 40.0%; P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, infection with a pathogen that was resistant to the empiric antibiotic regimen, increasing APACHE II scores, infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, healthcare-associated hospital-onset infection, mechanical ventilation, and use of vasopressors were independently associated with hospital mortality.

Conclusions

In severe sepsis attributed to Gram-negative bacteremia, initial treatment with an antibiotic regimen to which the causative pathogen is resistant was associated with increased hospital mortality. This finding suggests that rapid determination of bacterial susceptibility could influence treatment choices in patients with severe sepsis potentially improving their clinical outcomes.

### Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated Gram-Negative bacteremia [^bb08654c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Gram-negative bacteremia is a global health concern, and optimizing the transition from intravenous (IV) to oral antibiotics is a critical step in improving patient treatment and resource utilization.

Objective

To assess the association of switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture with 90-day all-cause mortality compared with prolonged IV antibiotic treatment for patients with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study conducted using the target trial emulation framework included observational data from adults with uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia in 4 hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark, from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021. The duration of follow-up was 90 days. Eligibility criteria included a blood culture positive for growth of gram-negative bacteria, clinical stability within 4 days of initial blood culture, an available susceptibility report on day 4, and initiation of appropriate empirical IV antibiotic treatment within 24 hours of blood culture.

Exposure

Switching to oral antibiotics within 4 days after initial blood culture compared with continuing IV antibiotic treatment for at least 5 days after initial blood culture.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to adjust for confounding. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed using pooled logistic regression to estimate absolute risk, risk difference (RD), and risk ratio (RR); 95% CIs were computed using bootstrapping.

Results

A total of 914 individuals were included in the target trial emulation analysis (512 [56.0%] male; median age, 74.5 years [IQR, 63.3–83.2 years]); 433 (47.4%) transitioned early to oral antibiotic treatment, and 481 (52.6%) received prolonged IV treatment. Ninety-nine individuals (10.8%) died during follow-up. The proportion of individuals who died was higher in the group receiving prolonged IV treatment (69 [14.3%] vs 30 [6.9%]). In the intention-to-treat analysis, 90-day all-cause mortality risk was 9.1% (95% CI, 6.7%-11.6%) for the early-switch group and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.6%-13.8%) for the group receiving prolonged IV treatment; the RD was -2.5% (95% CI, -5.7% to 0.7%) and RR was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.60–1.10). In the per-protocol analysis, the RD was -0.1% (95% CI, -3.4% to 3.1%) and RR was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.70–1.40).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia, early transition to oral antibiotics within 4 days of initial blood culture was associated with 90-day all-cause mortality risk comparable to that of continuing IV antibiotic treatment and may be an effective alternative to prolonged IV treatment.

Diagnostic stewardship — blood cultures — Avoid routine use for nonspecific patients with low risk of bacteremia (eg, isolated fever in hospitalized patient, nonsevere CAP, cellulitis, and C. difficile), avoid daily blood cultures for febrile patients with negative blood cultures and no new clinical changes, and develop guidance on appropriate use of blood cultures. For collection, decontaminate skin prior to blood draw, ensure optimal volume and number of blood cultures, and avoid central line blood cultures. For reporting, report gram-stain results, specify common skin contaminants, provide link to antibiogram with pathogen ID, highlight resistant organisms, selectively report antibiotic susceptibility, and implement audit-feedback on blood-culture contamination rates.

### The effect of a nationwide infection control program expansion on hospital-onset Gram-Negative rod bacteremia in 130 veterans health administration medical centers: an interrupted time-series analysis [^90351956]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) introduced the Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Prevention Initiative in March 2007. Although the initiative has been perceived as a vertical intervention focusing on MRSA, it also expanded infection prevention and control programs and resources. We aimed to assess the horizontal effect of the initiative on hospital-onset (HO) gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia.

Methods

This retrospective cohort included all patients who had HO bacteremia due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 130 VHA facilities from January 2003 to December 2013. The effects were assessed using segmented linear regression with autoregressive error models, incorporating autocorrelation, immediate effect, and time before and after the initiative. Community-acquired (CA) bacteremia with same species was also analyzed as nonequivalent dependent controls.

Results

A total of 11 196 patients experienced HO-GNR bacteremia during the study period. There was a significant change of slope in HO-GNR bacteremia incidence rates from before the initiative (+0.3%/month) to after (-0.4%/month) (P < .01), while CA GNR incidence rates did not significantly change (P = 0.08). Cumulative effect of the intervention on HO-GNR bacteremia incidence rates at the end of the study period was estimated to be -43.2% (95% confidence interval, -51.6% to -32.4%). Similar effects were observed in subgroup analyses of each species and antimicrobial susceptibility profile.

Conclusions

Within 130 VHA facilities, there was a sustained decline in HO-GNR bacteremia incidence rates after the implementation of the MRSA Prevention Initiative. As these organisms were not specifically targeted, it is likely that horizontal components of the initiative contributed to this decline.

### Bacteroides bacillemia… [^c5cd5efa]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Bacteroides species are anaerobic, aero-intolerant, nonsporeforming, nonmotile, gram-negative bacilli that colonize the oropharynx, female genital tract, and large bowel, comprising 95% of the colonic bacterial population and 20% of the dry weight of stool. Bacteriologic identification of Bacteroides organisms is frequently difficult because they are fastidious, sometimes slow-growing, and often resemble Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacilli morphologically. Specimens infected by Bacteroides organisms may contain many gram-negative rods on gram stain but show no growth on culture if not inoculated promptly into anaerobic media. Infections are often mixed and sometimes fail to yield Bacteroides organisms because of overgrowth by less fastidious bacteria. Commonly, the clinician first recognizes Bacteroides infection in his patient when the laboratory reports blood cultures positive.

Accumulating experience suggests that the apparent incidence of bacillemia due to Bacteroides organisms is rising. In 1971 in the Mayo Clinic, Bacteroides was the second most common gramnegative bacillus isolated from. Medeiros AA. Bacteroides Bacillemia: Sepsis for Surgeons. Arch Surg. 1972; 105: 819–820.

### 14-year trends and resistance patterns of blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures in children under three years old [^199b28c2]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Bacterial infections are a major cause of UK paediatric hospitalisations, yet longitudinal data on causative organisms or antimicrobial resistance are scarce. This retrospective analysis describes trends in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures and resistance patterns in children under three years old from a large UK centre.

Methods

All culture results, and resistance data for Gram-negative rods (GNR) in blood cultures, collected between January 2005 and December 2018 were extracted from Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust microbiology database.

Results

Of 49,298 samples, 6.7% of blood and 3.1% of CSF cultures were positive for bacterial growth; 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively grew pathogens. Number of cultures taken increased over time; the proportion growing pathogens declined. Resistance of GNR to first-line antimicrobials was 9.3% to gentamicin (neonatal units), and 17.1% and 25.8% to ceftriaxone (paediatric ED and wards respectively). Resistance to any two of ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, or meropenem was ≤ 6% in both areas.

Conclusions

The proportion of positive cultures declined over time. Resistance of GNR to empirical antimicrobials were observed, but resistance to a second agent were lower. Our study informs clinician decisions on when, and to which antimicrobials, to escalate if a child is not improving on empirical therapy.

### Bacteremia, central catheters, and neonates: when to pull the line [^788acf1e]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Physicians who treat neonates who become bacteremic while dependent on central venous catheters face a serious and common dilemma. We sought 1) to evaluate the relationship between central venous catheter removal and outcome in bacteremic neonates, 2) to determine species of bacteria that are associated with an increased risk of infectious complications if the central catheter is not removed promptly, and 3) to provide evidence-based recommendations for central catheter management.

Method

A retrospective cohort study of all neonates who had central venous access and developed bacteremia between July 1, 1995, and July 31, 1999, was conducted in the Duke University neonatal intensive care unit.

Results

The outcome for patients in whom the central catheter was not removed within 24 hours of organism identification was significantly worse (odds ratio = 9.8) than it was for those whose catheters were removed promptly. For patients who were infected with Staphylococcus aureus or with nonenteric Gram-negative rods, delayed removal of the central catheter was associated with complicated bacteremia. Catheter sterilization was attempted in 27 neonates who were infected with enteric Gram-negative rods; only 10 of these infants retained their catheters without infection-related complications. Infants who had 4 consecutive blood cultures that were positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) were at significantly increased risk for end-organ damage and death, compared with infants who had 3 or fewer positive blood culture for CoNS (odds ratio = 29.58).

Conclusions

Bacteremic infants experienced fewer infection-related complications when the central catheter was removed promptly. One positive blood culture for S aureus or a Gram-negative rod warrants central line removal in a neonate. Clinicians who are faced with a neonate who has 1 positive culture for CoNS may attempt medical management without central catheter removal, but documentation of subsequent negative blood cultures is crucial. Once a neonate has 3 positive blood cultures for CoNS, the central catheter should be removed.central line, neonate, bacteremia, bacteria, umbilical catheter, Broviac, percutaneous.

### Epidemiology, resistance profiles, and outcomes of bloodstream infections in community-onset sepsis in the United States [^fb23b3af]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe frequency of positive blood cultures, patterns of pathogens' characteristics and their resistance profile in patients with blood cultures drawn due to a presumed diagnosis of community-onset sepsis, and to examine the association between blood culture-positive pathogens and hospital mortality.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Two hundred one U.S. hospitals from 2016 to 2020 using the Premier Healthcare Database.

Subjects

Adult patients presenting with community-onset sepsis who had blood cultures collected within 2 days of hospital admission. We defined sepsis using the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Adult Sepsis Event Surveillance criteria.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We identified 147,061 patients with community-onset sepsis. The number of blood culture-positive sepsis episodes was 21,167 (14%) and the number of nonblood culture-positive sepsis episodes was 20,326 (14%). Among patients with blood culture-positive sepsis, Gram-negative rods were isolated in 55% of patients, Gram-positive cocci were isolated in 47%. Of those, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 11%, ceftriaxone-resistant Enterobacterales /extended-spectrum β-lactamase was 7%, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales was 1.3%. The crude in-hospital mortality was 17% for culture-negative sepsis, 13% for nonblood culture-positive sepsis, and 17% for blood culture-positive sepsis. In multilevel logistic regression models, compared with culture-negative sepsis, blood culture-positive sepsis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.94) and nonblood culture-positive sepsis (aOR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78–0.87) were associated with lower odds of in-hospital mortality. Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and MRSA were associated with higher in-hospital mortality, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus species, and Streptococcus species were associated with lower in-hospital mortality.

Conclusions

In patients hospitalized with community-onset sepsis, the prevalence of blood culture-positive sepsis was 14%. Among positive blood culture sepsis resistant organisms were infrequent. Compared with culture-negative sepsis, blood culture-positive sepsis and nonblood culture-positive sepsis were associated with lower in-hospital mortality.

### Mortality following blood culture in premature infants: increased with Gram-negative bacteremia and candidemia, but not Gram-positive bacteremia [^af4715b4]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe survival following nosocomial bloodstream infections and quantify excess mortality associated with positive blood culture.

Study Design

Multicenter cohort study of premature infants.

Results

First blood culture was negative for 4648/5497 (78%) of the neonates — 390/4648 (8%) died prior to discharge. Mortality prior to discharge was 19% in the 161 infants with Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia, 8% in the 854 neonates with coagulase negative staphylococcus (CONS), 6% in the 169 infants infected with other Gram-positive bacteria (GP-o), and 26% in the 115 neonates with candidemia. The excess 7-day mortality was 0% for Gram-positive organisms and 83% for GNR bacteremia and candidemia. Using negative blood culture as referent, GNR [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.61] and candidemia (HR = 2.27) were associated with increased mortality; CONS (HR = 1.08) and GP-o (HR = 0.97) were not.

Conclusions

Nosocomial GNR bacteremia and candidemia were associated with increased mortality but Gram-positive bacteremia was not.

### Bordetella hinzii pneumonia and bacteremia in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection [^f49924f5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

We started the patient on dexamethasone. We considered remdesivir therapy but did not start it because of his renal disease. We also empirically initiated treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin for bacterial pneumonia. We performed right-side thoracentesis and drained 725 mL of transudative fluid; fluid culture was negative for growth of bacteria. He was intubated on day 7 after admission because of worsening hypoxemia but subsequently extubated on day 9. On day 13, acute respiratory failure (oxygen saturation ≈70%) and bradycardia (heart rate ≈40 beats/min) developed, and he was hypotensive with agonal breathing. He was emergently reintubated and given atropine, which improved his heart rate. We initiated broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime.

Blood cultures drawn on day 13 after admission grew gram-negative rods in routine blood, chocolate, and MacConkey agar media. A computed tomography scan of the chest revealed bilateral patchy ground glass opacities, dense consolidations in both lung bases, and a small right pleural effusion (Figure). The patient underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 14; the BAL fluid grew > 100,000 CFUs of the same gram-negative bacilli, which we had not yet identified, along with 20,000–50,000 CFUs of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Gram stain of the BAL fluid showed many leukocytes and few gram-negative rods. We continued treatment with vancomycin and cefepime. On day 17, we extubated then reintubated him the same day because of ongoing hypotension and poor mentation. Because of worsening hemodynamic status, continued poor mentation, and overall poor prognosis, we changed goals of care to comfort measures only, and the patient died soon after.

### Detection of bloodstream infections in adults: how many blood cultures are needed? [^27609ec8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Although several reports have shown that two to three 20-ml blood cultures are adequate for the detection of bacteremia and fungemia in adults, a recent study (F. R. Cockerill et al. Clin. Infect. Dis. 38:1724–1730, 2004) found that two blood cultures detected only 80% of bloodstream infections and that three blood cultures detected 96% of episodes. We reviewed data at two university hospitals to determine whether the recent observations by Cockerill et al. are applicable more widely. We assessed all blood cultures obtained from adult inpatients from 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2005 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Duke University Medical Center. All instances in which ≥ 3 blood cultures per patient were obtained during a 24-h period were included. The medical records of patients who met the inclusion criteria were reviewed retrospectively to determine the clinical significance of the positive blood culture (true infection versus contamination). Data were analyzed to determine the cumulative sensitivity of blood cultures obtained sequentially during the 24-h time period. Of 629 unimicrobial episodes with ≥ 3 blood cultures obtained during the 24-h period, 460 (73.1%) were detected with the first blood culture, 564 (89.7%) were detected with the first two blood cultures, 618 (98.2%) were detected with the first three blood cultures, and 628 (99.8%) were detected with the first four blood cultures. Of 351 unimicrobial episodes with ≥ 4 blood cultures obtained during the 24-h period, 257 (73.2%) were detected with the first blood culture, 308 (93.9%) were detected with the first two blood cultures, 340 (96.9%) were detected with the first three blood cultures, and 350 (99.7%) were detected with the first four blood cultures. Among unimicrobial episodes, Staphylococcus aureus was more likely to be detected with the first blood culture (approximately 90% detected with the first blood culture). There were 58 polymicrobial episodes in which ≥ 3 blood cultures were obtained. Forty-seven (81.0%) were detected with the first blood culture, 54 (93.1%) were detected with the first two blood cultures, and 58 (100%) were detected with the first three blood cultures. The results of this study indicate that two blood cultures in a 24-h period will detect approximately 90% of bloodstream infections in adults. To achieve a detection rate of > 99%, as many as four blood cultures may be needed. The previously held axiom that virtually all bloodstream infections can be detected with two to three blood cultures may no longer be valid but may also depend on the definition of the "first" blood culture obtained (see Materials and Methods and Discussion in the text).

### Leptotrichia trevisanii sepsis after bone marrow transplantation [^c178bc6d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Leptotrichia spp. have been identified as the cause of various infections. However, the most commonly reported infection is bacteremia in the setting of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. Only recently has L. trevisanii emerged as a cause of infection; case reports are rare. We recently observed 3 cases of L. trevisanii bacteremia in patients who had recently undergone peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT.) Our goal was to identify possible causes of these infections.

The patients were 2 men and 1 woman (ages 53, 56, and 63 years, respectively) who had received myeloablative chemotherapy. The 2 men had multiple myeloma and relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had neutropenic fever 5 and 4 days post-SCT, respectively. The woman had acute myelogenous leukemia that had arisen from a myelodysplastic syndrome after matched sibling donor SCT failure. She had neutropenic fever on day 13 of induction therapy.

Multiple blood cultures from > 1 site (peripheral and central venous catheter [CVC] or 2 separate CVCs) obtained from each patient during the initial febrile episode grew L. trevisanii. For the 2 patients with positive cultures for peripheral blood and CVC sites, the peripheral culture was reported as positive before the CVC culture but not before use of the CVC. All subsequent blood cultures and catheter tip cultures from these patients had negative results for bacteria.

All organisms were cultured by using the BacT/ALERT 3D blood culture instrument (bioMeriéux, Durham, NC, USA) and standard aerobic and anaerobic media. Times to positivity were approximated (range 28–58 hours). Gram staining of isolates from culture media showed large, fusiform gram-negative rods. One isolate had gram-positive beading and was reported as gram variable. A second isolate grew anaerobically from initial subculture on 5% sheep blood agar but grew aerobically in chocolate agar in 5% CO 2 on second subculture. A third isolate showed pinpoint growth on initial aerobic culture on sheep blood agar. No isolates were identified by using the RapID ANA II System (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA).

### Impact of reporting Gram stain results from blood culture bottles on the selection of antimicrobial agents [^24ab1489]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

We assessed the usefulness of reporting direct blood Gram stain results compared with the results of positive blood cultures in 482 episodes and monitored impact on selection of antimicrobial treatment. We found that the reporting groups "Staphylococcus spp", "Pseudomonas spp and related organisms", and "yeasts" identified in this way matched perfectly with later culture identification. When the report indicated Staphylococcus spp or Pseudomonas spp and related organisms, physicians started or changed antimicrobials suitable for these bacteria more frequently than when "other streptococci" and "family Enterobacteriaceae" were reported (P < .05). Incorrect recognition of Acinetobacter spp as Enterobacteriaceae family is still the most challenging problem in this context. Gram stain results that definitively identify Staphylococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp and related organisms, and yeasts reliably can be rapidly provided by clinical laboratories; this information has a significant impact on early selection of effective antimicrobials. Further investigation is needed to assess the clinical impact of reporting Gram stain results in bacteremia.

### Unanticipated multiplex PCR-based identification of polymicrobial blood culture resulting in earlier isolation, determination of susceptibilities, and optimization of clinical care [^2664f7fc]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

We describe a case of polymicrobial bloodstream infection with six organisms identified by multiplex PCR that was initially thought to be a monomicrobial infection. Early recognition of specific Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal organisms and resistance elements allowed significantly more rapid optimization of therapy.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^30e9d72b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Blood cultures in suspected sepsis — timing, number, and catheter considerations are specified: Although sending samples for culture does not affect initial treatment, isolation of a pathogen from samples collected early and prior to antibiotics can provide confirmation and enhance appropriate antibiotic tailoring because cultures taken after antibiotics have substantially lower yields. We recommend collecting blood cultures as early as feasible and before administration of antibiotics, unless culture collection will delay antibiotic administration, and taking 2 sets of blood cultures (1 aerobic bottle and 1 anaerobic bottle in each set) obtained from separate sites over a short time period is common practice. In a patient with a suspected infection involving an indwelling vascular catheter, collecting one set of blood cultures from the catheter in addition to peripheral blood cultures (with time-to-positivity testing) is one strategy to aid diagnosis of a catheter-related bloodstream infection, and in patients with suspected infection and signs of clinical instability (eg, hypotension), we recommend starting antibiotic therapy promptly after blood cultures are drawn.

### Direct screening of blood by PCR and pyrosequencing for a 16S rRNA gene target from emergency department and intensive care unit patients being evaluated for bloodstream infection [^880ee8df]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Here we compared the results of PCR/pyrosequencing to those of culture for detecting bacteria directly from blood. DNA was extracted from 1,130 blood samples from 913 patients suspected of bacteremia (enrollment criteria were physician-ordered blood culture and complete blood count [CBC]), and 102 controls (healthy blood donors). Real-time PCR assays for beta-globin and Universal 16S rRNA gene targets were performed on all 1,232 extracts. Specimens identified by Universal 16S rRNA gene PCR/pyrosequencing as containing staphylococci, streptococci, or enteric Gram-negative rods had target-specific PCR/pyrosequencing performed. Amplifiable beta-globin (melting temperature [Tm], 87.2°C ± 0.2°C) occurred in 99.1% (1,120/1,130) of patient extracts and 100% (102/102) of controls. Concordance between PCR/pyrosequencing and culture was 96.9% (1,085/1,120) for Universal 16S rRNA gene targets, with positivity rates of 9.4% (105/1,120) and 11.3% (126/1,120), respectively. Bacteria cultured included staphylococci (59/126, 46.8%), Gram-negative rods (34/126, 27%), streptococci (32/126, 25.4%), and a Gram-positive rod (1/126, 0.8%). All controls screened negative by PCR/pyrosequencing. Clinical performance characteristics (95% confidence interval [CI]) for Universal 16S rRNA gene PCR/pyrosequencing included sensitivity of 77.8% (69.5 to 84.7), specificity of 99.3% (98.6 to 99.7), positive predictive value (PPV) of 93.3% (86.8 to 97.3), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 97.2% (96.0 to 98.2). Bacteria were accurately identified in 77.8% (98/126) of culture-confirmed sepsis samples with Universal 16S PCR/pyrosequencing and in 76.4% (96/126) with follow-up target-specific PCR/pyrosequencing. The initial PCR/pyrosequencing took ∼5.5 h to complete or ∼7.5 h when including target-specific PCR/pyrosequencing compared to 27.9 ± 13.6 h for Gram stain or 81.6 ± 24.0 h for phenotypic identification. In summary, this molecular approach detected the causative bacteria in over three-quarters of all culture-confirmed cases of bacteremia directly from blood in significantly less time than standard culture but cannot be used to rule out infection.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^3f6c9e77]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Piperacillin-tazobactam for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: Piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections caused by Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant inducible AmpC production. Tazobactam is less effective at protecting β-lactams from AmpC hydrolysis than newer β-lactamase inhibitors such as avibactam, relebactam, and vaborbactam, and the role of piperacillin-tazobactam in treating Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production remains uncertain. A 2019 meta-analysis of observational studies did not identify a difference in mortality between patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for bacteremia caused by Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp., or Serratia spp., though significant heterogeneity and confounding by indication likely existed. A pilot unblinded clinical trial randomized 72 patients with bloodstream infections to piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 grams IV every 6 hours as a standard infusion) or meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a standard infusion) and found no significant differences in the primary composite outcome, with notable and seemingly conflicting findings among individual components.

### Infrastructure and current practice of blood culture diagnostics in patients with sepsis: teachings and recommendations from the European sepsis care survey [^d6d99ad7]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up blood cultures are indicated in specific conditions

Gram-negative bacteremia has a reported mortality of 13–20%. In cases of Gram-negative bacteremia successful control of the source of the infection can be verified by follow-up blood cultures. This practice is associated with decreased mortality, according to a meta-analysis of 5 studies with 4378 patients. Another study showed that obtaining follow-up blood cultures for bacteremia was not associated with mortality. Taking into consideration these controversies we suggest that follow-up cultures are collected in the case of new sepsis onset, lack of clinical response of relapse, patients with candidemia, patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) by Staphylococcus aureus, patients with multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacteraemia, and patients with central line BSI.

The time until positivity of blood culture has clinical implications

The time to bacterial culture positivity is the time from the start of incubation to the preliminary positive result of a blood culture. For some decades, differential time to positivity between samples from a central line and peripheral samples was used to differentiate central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) from bacteremia from a different source. As a next step, several studies analyzed the possible association between short time to positivity and mortality, especially in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. A meta-analysis of 24 studies showed that short time to positivity is a predictor of mortality and septic shock.

Blood cultures can be used for de-escalation where appropriate

De-escalation has several benefits that arise from reduction of antimicrobial consumption, shortening of hospital stay and reduction of cost. These facts will gradually contribute to slowing the rate of increase of resistant pathogen rates. De-escalation is one of the pillars of Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) programs, contributing to appropriate antimicrobial use. Several trials present contradictory results of the effect of de-escalation on mortality. A Greek observational study reported that de-escalation for BSIs by fully susceptible Gram-negatives had no effect on mortality. There is no available meta-analysis so far on this topic, and larger and well-designed studies are needed to reveal the possible association of de-escalation and mortality in patients with sepsis. As results of future studies are anticipated, the known benefits of de-escalation are indirect in terms of reduction of the incidence of MDR pathogens.

### Fatal bacteremia caused by Campylobacter gracilis, United States [^f1afd392]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

He was empirically given vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. Severe respiratory distress developed, and the patient died a few days later. Respiratory cultures at that time showed Klebsiella pneumoniae and C. gracilis. Blood cultures were positive for C. gracilis.

C. gracilis, originally known as Bacteroides gracilis, was transferred to the genus Campylobacter in 1995 after analysis of the cellular fatty acids, respiratory quinones, and proteins of B. gracilis and a comparison of them with the corresponding chemotaxonomic features of Campylobacter spp. C. gracilis is a nonmotile, non–spore-forming, anaerobic gram-negative rod that uniquely requires formate and fumarate in its metabolism. C. gracilis primarily inhabits the gingival crevice and has been associated with a wide variety of periodontal diseases.

A study of 28 persons with chronic asymptomatic periradicular lesions showed C. gracilis in 6 (21.4%), including 2 (16.7%) of 12 who had acute apical periodontitis and 4 (23.5%) of 17 who had acute periradicular abscess. C. gracilis has also been isolated from other anatomic sites and has caused severe infections such as peritonitis, pneumonia, and bacteremia.

Our patient had C. gracilis bacteremia complicated by acute respiratory distress secondary to pneumonia. Although another gram-negative rod was isolated from the respiratory cultures, C. gracilis potentially played a major pathogenic role for this patient because of concomitant bacteremia that resulted in an unfavorable outcome. Pleuropulmonary infections with C. gracilis are not surprising because of the frequency of its detection in the human oral flora. In a study of 23 isolates of C. gracilis and their associated clinical diagnosis, 7 were from patients with lung abscess or empyema, and 2 were from those with aspiration pneumonia.

RESULTS

Study cohort

We enrolled 148 unique patients with bacteremia due to a target pathogen. The median patient age was 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 55–78; Table S1). Forty-six percent of patients were women, 38% were non-White or of unknown race, and 9% were Hispanic/Latino. The most common comorbid illnesses were a hematologic malignancy (22% of patients), diabetes (21%), and a solid tumor (19%). Urinary (45% of patients) and intra-abdominal (24%) sources of bacteremia were most common. The most common antimicrobial therapies targeting gram-negative bacteria that were being administered when the BCID Panel result was released were piperacillin-tazobactam (54% of patients), meropenem (13%), and ceftriaxone (8%). The bacterial strain subsequently isolated in culture was susceptible to the antimicrobial therapy being administered at this time in 74% of patients. Thirteen (9%) patients died within 30 days of blood culture collection.

### Use of positive blood cultures for direct identification and susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system [^f2d443d0]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

In order to further decrease the time lapse between initial inoculation of blood culture media and the reporting of results of identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests for microorganisms causing bacteremia, we performed a prospective study in which specially processed fluid from positive blood culture bottles from Bactec 9240 (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) containing aerobic media were directly inoculated into Vitek 2 system cards (bio-Mérieux, France). Organism identification and susceptibility results were compared with those obtained from cards inoculated with a standardized bacterial suspension obtained following subculture to agar; 100 consecutive positive monomicrobic blood cultures, consisting of 50 gram-negative rods and 50 gram-positive cocci, were included in the study. For gram-negative organisms, 31 of the 50 (62%) showed complete agreement with the standard method for species identification, while none of the 50 gram-positive cocci were correctly identified by the direct method. For gram-negative rods, there were 50% categorical agreements between the direct and standard methods for all drugs tested. The very major error rate was 2.4%, and the major error rate was 0.6%. The overall error rate for gram-negatives was 6.6%. Complete agreement in clinical categories of all antimicrobial agents evaluated was obtained for 19 of 50 (38%) gram-positive cocci evaluated; the overall error rate was 8.4%, with 2.8% minor errors, 2.4% major errors, and 3.2% very major errors. These findings suggest that the Vitek 2 cards inoculated directly from positive Bactec 9240 bottles do not provide acceptable bacterial identification or susceptibility testing in comparison with corresponding cards tested by a standard method.

Adult ICU blood cultures — "we recommend sequentially collecting at least two sets of blood cultures (ideally 60 mL of blood total), from different anatomical sites, without a time interval between them (Best practice statement)." Blood cultures "are the most used method to detect bacteria and Candida species and related yeasts in blood," and technique affects yield: "Proper filling of blood culture bottles (10 mL per bottle) is important." Bottle selection is specified: "At a minimum, an aerobic and anaerobic bottle should be included in each set," and sampling should be from separate sites: "At least two sets should be collected, each from a separate site." Contamination guidance is provided: "Contamination is likely if only a single blood culture set is positive for a microorganism that is a common contaminant (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis)." Timing is cautioned: "Collection of blood cultures should not substantially delay (i.e., < 45 min in patients with sepsis)."

We studied the performance of an algorithm combining multiplex polymerase chain reaction with phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases and carbapenemases directly from positive blood culture bottles in patients with gram-negative bacteremia and found good concordance with routine cultures. Such an algorithm may be a tool to improve time to optimal therapy in patients with gram-negative bacteremia.

### Antimicrobial therapy of gram-negative bacteremia at two university-affiliated medical centers [^716d13ac]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe antimicrobial prescribing practices and patient outcomes associated with the treatment of aerobic gram-negative rod bacteremia at two university-affiliated medical centers.

Subjects and Methods

All adult patients with gram-negative bacteremia (N = 326) who were at Stanford and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Hospitals from September 1, 1996 through August 31, 1997 were evaluated via retrospective review of medical records.

Results

Most patient characteristics were similar between institutions; however, patients at Stanford were more likely to have had a diagnosis of bone marrow transplantation, liver failure, or poor nutritional status, while more patients at UCSF had solid organ transplant, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or hypotension. The bacteriology was similar at both sites, with Escherichia coli the predominant pathogen (139 [43%] of 326). The majority of episodes were community acquired (67% [218/326]). Patients at Stanford were more likely to have been treated empirically with aminoglycosides (28% vs. 7%, P < 0.001) and noncephalosporin beta-lactams (31% vs. 11%, P < 0.001), while patients at UCSF were more likely to have received cephalosporins (62% vs. 29%, P < 0.001) and fluoroquinolones (21% vs. 11%, P = 0.02). These patterns continued for definitive therapy. Overall mortality was 60 (19%) of 326. Several risk factors were associated with 14-day mortality, including severity of illness, neutropenia, diabetes mellitus, use of vasopressors, and empiric use of a noncephalosporin beta-lactam.

Conclusion

Prescribing practices for the treatment of gram-negative bacteremia differed significantly in the two institutions despite similar patients and pathogens.

### Evaluation of a simple blood culture amplification and antigen detection method for diagnosis of Salmonella enterica serovar typhi bacteremia [^3f439c99]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

In most areas where typhoid is endemic, laboratory diagnosis is not possible due to the lack of appropriate facilities. We investigated whether the combination of blood culture amplification of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi with an S. Typhi antigen rapid diagnostic test (RDT) could be an accurate and inexpensive tool for the accelerated diagnosis of patients with acute typhoid in Laos. For a panel of 23 Gram-negative reference pathogens, the Standard Diagnostics (catalog no. 15FK20; Kyonggi-do, South Korea) RDT gave positive results for S. Typhi NCTC 8385, S. Typhi NCTC 786 (Vi negative), Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (ATCC 13076), and Salmonella enterica serovar Ndolo NCTC 8700 (all group D). In a prospective study of 6,456 blood culture bottles from 3,028 patients over 15 months, 392 blood culture bottles (6.1%) from 221 (7.3%) patients had Gram-negative rods (GNRs) seen in the blood culture fluid. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and positive predictive value were 96.7%, 99.5%, 97.9%, and 87.9%, respectively, for patients with proven S. Typhi bacteremia and 91.2%, 98.4%, 98.9%, and 93.9% for patients with group D Salmonella. The median (range) number of days between diagnosis by RDT and reference assays was 1 (-1 to +2) day for those with confirmed S. Typhi. The use of antigen-based pathogen detection in blood culture fluid may be a useful, relatively rapid, inexpensive, and accurate technique for the identification of important causes of bacteremia in the tropics.

### Blood culture-based diagnosis of bacteraemia: state of the art [^75cafc88]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Blood culture remains the best approach to identify the incriminating microorganisms when a bloodstream infection is suspected, and to guarantee that the antimicrobial treatment is adequate. Major improvements have been made in the last years to increase the sensitivity and specificity and to reduce the time to identification of microorganisms recovered from blood cultures. Among other factors, the introduction in clinical microbiology laboratories of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology revolutionized the identification of microorganisms whereas the introduction of nucleic-acid-based methods, such as DNA hybridization or rapid PCR-based test, significantly reduce the time to results. Together with traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing, new rapid methods for the detection of resistance mechanisms respond to major epidemiological concerns such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum β-lactamase or carbapenemases. This review presents and discusses the recent developments in microbial diagnosis of bloodstream infections based on blood cultures.

### Implementation of a rapid phenotypic susceptibility platform for Gram-Negative bloodstream infections with paired antimicrobial stewardship intervention: is the juice worth the squeeze? [^7748f16b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient and Microbiologic Characteristics

A total of 590 unique patients with GNB-BSI were evaluated, with 264 during the historical period and 250 during the intervention period meeting inclusion criteria (Figure 1). Patient demographics, comorbidities, and clinical characteristics were similar between groups (Table 1), with the exception of moderate/severe chronic kidney disease and severe neutropenia being more prevalent in the historical group, and mechanical ventilation being more prevalent in the intervention group. BSI episode onset, source, organisms involved, and resistance characteristics were similar between groups (Table 2), with the exception of more catheter-associated infections and episodes involving Serratia marcescens in the historical period, and more episodes involving Escherichia coli in the intervention period.

Time to IPT was significantly reduced from the historical to interventions periods (median [IQR] PRE 64.5 [27.8, 88.1] vs POST 43.3 [21.2, 69.2] hours; difference 21.2; P < .001). Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure 2) demonstrated a significant increase in the cumulative proportion of patients achieving IPT in the intervention group over the observed time period (log-rank P value = .004).

### Infectious diseases consultation associated with reduced mortality in Gram-Negative bacteremia [^2bd7184b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Gram-negative bacteremia (GN-BSI) can cause significant morbidity and mortality, but the benefit of infectious diseases consultation (IDC) is not well defined. A 24-site observational cohort study of unique hospitalized patients with 4861 GN-BSI episodes demonstrated a 40% decreased risk of 30-day mortality in patients with IDC compared to those without IDC.

### The brief case: endocarditis in a pediatric patient with congenital heart disease [^9f634421]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Bacteria of the genus Cardiobacterium are fastidious gram-negative bacilli from two species, C. hominis and C. valvarum. Cardiobacterium are normal human oral and upper respiratory flora. Though this organism is rarely a cause of infection, endocarditis is the most common infectious presentation, and Cardiobacterium bacteremia is associated with endocarditis in approximately 90% of cases. Cardiobacterium is within the HACEK group of bacteria that includes Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella. These organisms together account for less than 5% of all infective endocarditis in both adult and pediatric patients but are highly fastidious and, therefore, are commonly suspected in cases of blood culture-negative endocarditis. Infection is typically presumed to stem from an oral source. Though rare, Cardiobacterium has been isolated from extracardiac infections including pneumonia and osteomyelitis.

Cardiobacterium is a fastidious, slow-growing, and capnophilic bacterium and typically requires at least 48 hours of growth at 35°C with 5% CO 2. It grows on enriched media including blood and chocolate agar but will not grow on selective media such as MacConkey (Fig. 2). Colonies are typically small, smooth, may be lightly alpha-hemolytic after prolonged growth, and may pit the agar. On Gram stain, Cardiobacterium may appear poorly stained and pleomorphic with short coccobacilli as well as long filaments. The bacilli may clump together at one end and form a characteristic "rosette" arrangement as seen in this case. Direct exam from blood culture may not show organisms at all due to the poor ability of this bacterium to retain stain. Cardiobacterium species are catalase negative, oxidase, and indole positive, but spot indole may be variable. Identification can be performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, though it may be challenging to get sufficient growth to do so. Of note, Cardiobacterium species are not present in the IVD-marked Bruker CA or VITEK libraries at the time of publication, but C. hominis is present in RUO databases. Additional safety measures such as handling cultures in a biosafety cabinet should be considered when encountering unidentified, fastidious, poorly staining gram-negative organisms from blood cultures as there is a risk of exposure to Francisella tularensis or similar organisms with biosafety concerns.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^7e62c4d1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug-resistant infections — suggested treatment and rationale — When isolates test susceptible to both traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam agents and carbapenems, the former are preferred over carbapenem therapy; for infections caused by isolates not susceptible to any carbapenem but susceptible to traditional β-lactams, administration of a traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam as high-dose extended-infusion therapy is suggested, and for critically ill patients or those with poor source control in this scenario, use of newer β-lactam agents to which P. aeruginosa test susceptible is also a reasonable treatment approach. Phenotypically, isolates not susceptible to a carbapenem agent (eg, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin MICs ≥ 4 µg/mL) but susceptible to other traditional β-lactams constitute approximately 20% to 60% of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, and the panel's preferred approach is high-dose extended-infusion therapy (eg, cefepime 2 g IV every 8 hours, infused over at least 3 hours). Patients infected with P. aeruginosa should be closely monitored to ensure clinical improvement given on-therapy resistance risks, exemplified by an analysis of 767 episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia showing emergence of resistance within 30 days with the following likelihood: piperacillin-tazobactam (8%), ceftazidime (12%), meropenem (14%), and imipenem (27%).

### Seven versus 14 days of antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated Gram-negative bacteremia: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial [^8205d2b7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gram-negative bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. Data to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy are limited.

Methods

This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial. Inpatients with gram-negative bacteremia, who were afebrile and hemodynamically stable for at least 48 hours, were randomized to receive 7 days (intervention) or 14 days (control) of covering antibiotic therapy. Patients with uncontrolled focus of infection were excluded. The primary outcome at 90 days was a composite of all-cause mortality; relapse, suppurative, or distant complications; and readmission or extended hospitalization (> 14 days). The noninferiority margin was set at 10%.

Results

We included 604 patients (306 intervention, 298 control) between January 2013 and August 2017 in 3 centers in Israel and Italy. The source of the infection was urinary in 411 of 604 patients (68%); causative pathogens were mainly Enterobacteriaceae (543/604 [90%]). A 7-day difference in the median duration of covering antibiotics was achieved. The primary outcome occurred in 140 of 306 patients (45.8%) in the 7-day group vs 144 of 298 (48.3%) in the 14-day group (risk difference, -2.6% [95% confidence interval, -10.5% to 5.3%]). No significant differences were observed in all other outcomes and adverse events, except for a shorter time to return to baseline functional status in the short-course therapy arm.

Conclusions

In patients hospitalized with gram-negative bacteremia achieving clinical stability before day 7, an antibiotic course of 7 days was noninferior to 14 days. Reducing antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated gram-negative bacteremia to 7 days is an important antibiotic stewardship intervention.

### Association of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy with in-hospital mortality in patients with bloodstream infections in the US [^7afee29e]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major public health problem associated with high morbidity. Little evidence exists regarding the epidemiology of BSIs and the use of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy.

Objective

To estimate the association between receipt of appropriate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy and in-hospital mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from the Premier Healthcare database from 2016 to 2020. The analysis included 32 100 adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with BSIs from 183 US hospitals who received at least 1 new systemic antimicrobial agent within 2 days after blood samples were collected during the hospitalization. Patients with polymicrobial infections were excluded from the analysis.

Exposures

Appropriate empirical therapy was defined as initiation of at least 1 new empirical antimicrobial agent to which the pathogen isolated from blood culture was susceptible either on the day of or the day after the blood sample was collected.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between receipt of appropriate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy and in-hospital mortality for patients infected with gram-negative rods (GNRs), gram-positive cocci (GPC), and Candida species.

Results

Among 32 100 patients who had BSIs and received new empirical antimicrobial agents, the mean (SD) age was 64 (16) years; 54.8% were male, 69.9% were non-Hispanic White, and in-hospital mortality was 14.3%. The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (58.4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (31.8%). Among patients infected with S aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus was isolated in 43.6%. The crude proportions of appropriate empirical therapy use were 94.4% for GNR, 97.0% for GPC, and 65.1% for Candida species. The proportions of appropriate therapy use for resistant organisms were 55.3% for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales species and 60.4% for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species. Compared with inappropriate empirical therapy, receipt of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy was associated with lower in-hospital risk of death for 3 pathogen groups (GNR: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.42–0.64]; GPC: aOR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.47–0.78]; Candida species: aOR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.21–0.87]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of patients hospitalized with BSIs, receipt of appropriate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy was associated with lower in-hospital mortality. It is important for clinicians to carefully choose empirical antimicrobial agents to improve outcomes in patients with BSIs.

### Contaminants in blood cultures: importance, implications, interpretation and prevention [^c272e3e4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the development of new microbiologic technologies, blood cultures (BCs) remain the first-line tool for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections. Their diagnostic value may be affected when a microorganism of questionable evidence is isolated-for example, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus spp., viridans group streptococci, Corynebacterium spp. Propionibacterium spp. and Micrococcus spp. Finally, making a correct diagnosis of pathogenicity (vs. contamination) is challenging.

Aims

To review the current ways of dealing with the problem of BC contaminants (BCCs) and to provide practical suggestions to decrease BCC rates.

Sources

PubMed electronic databases and existing reviews were searched up to December 2017 to retrieve relevant publications related to the topic.

Contents

This review describes the burden of BCC and analyses the main current issues and controversies in interpreting the occurrence of potential BC contaminants. It focuses on the best-described approaches to decide whether BCC is present and discusses the different strategies of prevention in adults.

Implications

Each institution should have an efficient policy to prevent BCC, emphasizing the importance of following guidelines for prescribing and collecting BCs. Training healthcare workers should focus on detrimental influence on patient care and highlight the work and costs due to contaminants. The accurate differentiation of a contaminant from a true pathogen relies on a multidisciplinary approach and the clinical judgement of experienced practitioners.

### Impact of follow up blood cultures on outcomes of patients with community-onset gram-negative bloodstream infection [^f1ec9b91]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Settings

The study was conducted at Prisma Health Richland and Baptist Hospitals in Columbia, South Carolina, USA. The two community-teaching hospitals combine for over 1000 licensed beds and provide medical, surgical, and subspecialty care for the residents of Richland and surrounding counties in the Midlands region of South Carolina. The Institutional Review Board at Prisma Health-Midlands approved the study and waived informed consent on April 8, 2020 (Amendment 7 for study #Pro00034526).

The Prisma Health-Midlands antimicrobial stewardship and support team receives real-time alerts for positive blood cultures and provides recommendations to primary healthcare providers to optimize source control and antimicrobial management based on local institutional guidelines. These management guidelines do not recommend for or against obtaining FUBC in patients with GN-BSI. The decision to obtain FUBC was solely made by the primary healthcare provider caring for the patient.

2.2 Case ascertainment

Patients ≥ 18 years old with first episodes of monomicrobial BSI due to gram-negative bacilli hospitalized at Prisma Health-Midlands hospitals from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2015 were identified through microbiology laboratory databases (n = 1376). Patients with polymicrobial (n = 166) and recurrent episodes of BSI (n = 47) were excluded. Nosocomial GN-BSI (n = 238) were excluded to reduce the potential impact of primary admission diagnoses on outcomes. Patients who died within 72 h of collection of index blood culture (n = 74) were excluded to minimize the impact of survival bias on the analysis. In addition, patients who were discharged within 72 hours of hospital admission (n = 84) were excluded to reduce the effect of selection bias based on initial response to antimicrobial therapy on the results. One patient was excluded due to missing baseline acute severity of illness variables. Overall, 766 hospitalized adults with community-onset GN-BSI were enrolled in the study.

Ventriculoatrial shunts — blood culture use and expected results: In patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, blood cultures should be performed because bacteremia is invariably present in patients with infected ventriculoatrial shunts (positive blood cultures in > 90% of cases). This contrasts with infections in other types of CSF shunts in which the incidence of negative blood cultures approaches 80%. Blood cultures may be considered in these patients, although positive results should be interpreted cautiously in patients with nonvascular CSF shunts and may represent a contaminant or another source of infection.

### Critical factors in the recovery of pathogenic microorganisms in blood [^0557e27b]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The critical factors for optimal recovery of microbial pathogens from blood are not only the basis for how we perform blood cultures on a daily basis, but are also important for development of all current blood-culture systems. Because much of this research was conducted and published between 1975 and 2010 there is a general sense that many physicians and scientists may not be familiar with it, but it is critical for performing and interpreting blood cultures.

Objectives

To review the critical factors in the laboratory recovery and isolation of pathogenic microorganisms in blood.

Sources

Literature review of published papers, select reviews and updated guidelines.

Content

This review focuses on the critical factors that affect the recovery isolation of pathogenic microorganisms from individuals with bloodstream infections. Contemporary blood-culture systems, and current methods for blood-culture collection, have been designed to incorporate these critical factors so as to optimize recovery and isolation of pathogens while minimizing contamination.

Implications

It is important for microbiologists and practitioners to understand how and why these critical factors affect current blood-culture practices to improve patient management. Future research should emphasize which of these critical factors will still play a role in the era of molecular diagnostic tests, which will no longer be relevant, and which new critical factors have yet to be defined.

### Antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in febrile neutropenic patients with cancer: current epidemiology and clinical impact [^0e4be16e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the recent years, several studies involving cancer patients have demonstrated a clear trend in the epidemiology of bacterial infections showing a shift in the prevalence from Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria and the extensive emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains among Gram-negatives isolated from the blood. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the recent trends in epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negatives recovered from neutropenic cancer patients, with particular emphasis on the impact of antimicrobial resistance on the clinical outcome of severe infections caused by such microorganisms.

Recent Findings

Overall, from 2007 to date, the rate of Gram-negative bacteria recovery ranged from 24.7 to 75.8% (mean 51.3%) in cancer patient cohorts. Escherichia coli represented the most common species (mean frequency of isolation 32.1%) among the Gram-negatives, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean frequency of isolation 20.1%). An increasing frequency of Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also reported. Increased rates of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative strains have been highlighted among Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenting Gram-negative rods, despite discontinuation of fluoroquinolone-based antibacterial prophylaxis for neutropenic patients. In addition, antimicrobial resistance and/or the inadequacy of empirical antibiotic treatment have been frequently linked to a worse outcome in cancer patients with bloodstream infections caused by Gram-negative isolates.

Summary

Sound knowledge of the local distribution of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns and prompt initiation of effective antimicrobial treatment for severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria are essential in cancer patients.

### The clinical and prognostic importance of positive blood cultures in adults [^589daf39]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults. Bloodstream infections should be reassessed periodically because of increased antibiotic resistance, more patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy, improved antiretroviral therapy, and acquisition of infection in health care settings other than hospitals.

Methods

We conducted retrospective assessment by infectious disease physicians of hospitalized adults with positive blood cultures at 3 academic medical centers.

Results

Two thousand two hundred seventy positive blood culture episodes occurred in 1706 patients. Of 2669 isolates, 51% represented true infection, 41% contamination, and 8% unknown clinical significance. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci were most common, only 10% were clinically significant. Among 1225 true bloodstream infections, the most frequent isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp. Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens. Intravenous catheters were the most common primary source of bloodstream infection (23% of episodes). Most (81%) bloodstream infections were acquired in the hospital or other health care settings. Crude and attributable in-hospital case-fatality ratios were 20% and 12%, respectively, lower than in previous studies. Increasing age, hypotension, absence of fever, hospital acquisition, extreme white blood cell count values, and the presence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, malignancy, or renal disease were significantly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital attributable death in multivariable analysis.

Conclusions

The proportion of bloodstream infections due to intravenous catheters is continuing to increase. Most episodes were acquired in the hospital or other health care setting. In-hospital case-fatality ratios have decreased compared with previous studies. Several previously identified factors associated with an increased mortality remain statistically significant.

### Identification and susceptibility testing of microorganism by direct inoculation from positive blood culture bottles by combining MALDI-TOF and vitek-2 compact is rapid and effective [^ffc10eb6]. The Journal of Infection (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the combined use of MALDI-TOF MS bacterial identification and the Vitek-2 Compact antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) directly from positive blood cultures.

Methods

Direct identification by MALDI-TOF MS and AST were performed in parallel to the standard methods in all positively flagged blood cultures bottles during the study period.

Results

Three hundred and twenty four monomicrobial positive blood cultures were included in the present study, with 257 Gram-negative and 67 Gram-positive isolates. MALDI-TOF MS identification directly from blood bottles reported the correct identification for Enterobacteriaceae in 97.7%, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli 75.0%, Staphylococcus aureus 75.8%, coagulase negative staphylococci 63.3% and enterococci 63.3%. A total 6156 isolate/antimicrobial agent combinations were tested. Enterobacteriaceae group and non-fermentative Gram-negative Bacilli showed an agreement of 96.67% and 92.30%, respectively, for the Gram-positive cocci the overall agreement found was 97.84%.

Conclusions

We conclude that direct identification by MALDI-TOF and inoculation of Vitek-2 Compact AST with positive blood culture bottles yielded very good results and decreased time between initial inoculation of blood culture media and determination of the antibiotic susceptibility for Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci causing bacteremia.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^ef4a572c]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

To operationalize the antibiogram, we need to know what threshold of coverage to target with empiric treatment. In one physician survey, the median preferred thresholds for adequate coverage were 80% for mild sepsis and 90% for severe sepsis. Using a 90% minimum threshold, for infections like VAP and CLABSI, we will potentially need to recommend toxic (e.g. aminoglycoside), reserved (e.g. carbapenem), or toxic and reserved (e.g. colistin) combinations of antibiotics for almost every patient, further driving antibiotic resistance. The solution is to use known predictors of antimicrobial resistance to individualize empiric antibiotic treatment so that we can use narrower spectrum monotherapy regimens when they will suffice, and limit broader spectrum combination therapy regimens to those who most need them (Fig. 2). Decision support models for empiric treatment of gram-negative bacteremia can incorporate risk factors for resistance (patient demographics, recent hospital exposure, recent antibiotic use, prior microbiology culture results) and promote rapid de-escalation of antibiotics without compromising time-to-adequate treatment. As discussed for pneumonia, patient's prior microbiology results provide powerful information to predict resistance for current infections. With Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, a prior positive MRSA surveillance swab result necessitates use of anti-MRSA empiric treatment. With gram-negative bacteremia, identification of a prior gram-negative organism resistant to a specific drug within the last year should preclude use of that antibiotic.

Fig. 2
The rapidity of empiric therapy and the choice of specific agents are determined by the clinical scenario of the patient with suspected sepsis. Immediate therapy is given to those with a high likelihood of infection, and severe illness and or shock. If biomarkers like procalcitonin are not elevated, and the patient is not severely ill, immediate therapy is not necessary, and some patients may not even have infection. Specific agents are chosen with a consideration of the most common site of infection (lung > abdomen > catheter-associated infection > urinary tract infection). Each site has a group of likely pathogens, but these can vary, depending on patient-specific risk factors for resistance, and local ICU patterns of drug-resistant organisms. In sepsis, gram-negatives are more common than gram-positive, but some patients may also have fungal infection

### Utility of prior cultures in predicting antibiotic resistance of bloodstream infections due to Gram-negative pathogens: a multicentre observational cohort study [^cac299da]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy in patients with bloodstream infections due to Gram-negative pathogens can improve outcomes. We evaluated the utility of prior microbiologic results for guiding empiric treatment in Gram-negative bloodstream infections.

Methods

We conducted a multicentre observational cohort study in two large health systems in Canada and the United States, including 1832 hospitalized patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection (community, hospital and intensive care unit acquired) from April 2010 to March 2015.

Results

Among 1832 patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infection, 28% (n = 504) of patients had a documented prior Gram-negative organism from a nonscreening culture within the previous 12 months. A most recent prior Gram-negative organism resistant to a given antibiotic was strongly predictive of the current organism's resistance to the same antibiotic. The overall specificity was 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91–0.93), and positive predictive value was 0.66 (95% CI 0.61–0.70) for predicting antibiotic resistance. Specificities and positive predictive values ranged from 0.77 to 0.98 and 0.43 to 0.78, respectively, across different antibiotics, organisms and patient subgroups. Increasing time between cultures was associated with a decrease in positive predictive value but not specificity. An heuristic based on a prior resistant Gram-negative pathogen could have been applied to one in four patients and in these patients would have changed therapy in one in five.

Conclusions

In patients with a bloodstream infection with a Gram-negative organism, identification of a most recent prior Gram-negative organism resistant to a drug of interest (within the last 12 months) is highly specific for resistance and should preclude use of that antibiotic.

### Time to positivity of blood cultures in infants 0 to 90 days old presenting to the emergency department: is 36 hours enough? [^6c991495]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous monitoring blood culture systems (CMBCS) now allow for more rapid detection of microbial growth. We aimed to determine whether a 36-hour period was sufficient to detect all blood cultures positive for pathogenic bacteria in infants 0 to 90 days old undergoing a septic workup in the emergency department of a tertiary care pediatric center.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of all positive blood cultures collected in these infants over a 5-year time period (from March 13, 2008 to July 29, 2013). Bottles were incubated in a CMBCS. The time to positivity (TTP) was calculated from time of blood culture registration into the laboratory system to time of Gram stain. Medical charts were reviewed for relevant clinical information. Cultures were classified as pathogenic or contaminant using microorganism type and clinical presentation.

Results

Three thousand five hundred fifty-nine blood cultures were collected. Of these, 98 (2.8%) were positive. Fifty-two (53.1%) were deemed pathogenic and 46 (46.9%) were deemed contaminant, for a true prevalence of bacteremia of 1.5%. At 24, 36, 48, and 50 hours, 87.8% (86 of 98), 96.9% (95 of 98), 99% (97 of 98), and 100% (98 of 98) of all cultures were positive. Considering only pathogenic organisms, 96.1% (50 of 52) and 100% (52 of 52) were positive at 24 and 36 hours. Mean TTP for pathogens and contaminants was 14.40 and 23.18 hours, respectively (P < .001).

Conclusions

An incubation period of 36 hours is sufficient to detect 100% of blood cultures positive for a pathogenic organism in our population.

### Helicobacter sp. flexispira bacteremia in an immunocompetent young adult [^6b6916ba]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

A young immunocompetent patient was admitted for a febrile illness with malaise, arthralgias, painful leg swelling, and polyserositis. Shortly prior to becoming ill, the patient had traveled to the Northern African desert. The symptoms disappeared during treatment with antibiotics (doxycycline and ceftriaxone) but recurred twice after stopping therapy. A motile gram-negative fusiform rod was isolated from a blood culture taken on the first admission. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene of the blood culture isolate revealed close similarity with Helicobacter sp. flexispira taxon 8 (99.9% identity), a species that was previously reported as "Flexispira rappini". This is the first reported case of a recurrent Helicobacter sp. flexispira bacteremia in an adult, immunocompetent patient.

### Performance of the lifeScale automated rapid phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing on Gram-negative rods directly from positive blood cultures [^b5984505]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (rAST) performed directly from blood cultures is essential to influencing the selection of appropriate antibiotics, preferably targeted therapy, for the treatment of bloodstream infections. Affinity Biosensors has developed the LifeScale, a phenotypic rAST system based on microfluidic sensors with a mechanical resonator that measures the mass of individual microbes. The combination of replication, biomass, and population profiling of individual microbes is analyzed to produce rAST results. The performance of the LifeScale was evaluated and compared to our current standard of care (SOC) antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) system under clinical conditions. The results indicated that the LifeScale is easy to use and provides rapid, reliable, and accurate AST results in less than 5 h directly from from positive blood cultures containing Gram-negative organisms listed in the current database. For all organism-antibiotic combinations involving polymicrobial cultures, LifeScale showed a resistant result when either mixed isolate was resistant. If these results prove to be robust on further testing, this may justify the reporting of rapid LifeScale results without the need for additional confirmatory testing.

Importance

This is the first clinical-based study of a unique technology using microfluidic sensors to generate rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test results directly from blood cultures containing Gram-negative rods. The issue of polymicrobial cultures was also addressed in this study, which, to our knowledge, has not been addressed in publications of other rapid phenotypic AST systems. Overall, LifeScale results compared favorably with the SOC in terms of overall agreement, especially categorical agreement.

Prolonged neutropenia and chemotherapy-induced mucositis render patients with hematologic malignancies highly vulnerable to Gram-negative bacteremia. Unfortunately, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria are increasingly encountered globally, and current guidelines for empirical antibiotic coverage in these patients may not adequately treat these bacteria. This expansion of resistance, coupled with traditional culturing techniques requiring 2–4 days for bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility results, have grave implications for these immunocompromised hosts. This review characterizes the epidemiology, risk factors, resistance mechanisms, recommended treatments, and outcomes of the MDR Gram-negative bacteria that commonly cause infections in patients with hematologic malignancies. We also examine the infection prevention strategies in hematology patients, such as infection control practices, antimicrobial stewardship, and targeted decolonization. Finally, we assess the strategies to improve outcomes of the infected patients, including gastrointestinal screening to guide empirical antibiotic therapy, new rapid diagnostic tools for expeditious identification of MDR pathogens, and use of two new antimicrobial agents, ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^b0e0ca3b]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

### Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-Negative rods causing bacteremia in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: intercontinental prospective study of the infectious diseases working party of the European bone marrow transplantation group [^0ace6b75]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This intercontinental study aimed to study gram-negative rod (GNR) resistance in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Methods

GNR bacteremias occurring during 6 months post-HSCT (February 2014-May 2015) were prospectively collected, and analyzed for rates and risk factors for resistance to fluoroquinolones, noncarbapenem anti-Pseudomonas β-lactams (noncarbapenems), carbapenems, and multidrug resistance.

Results

Sixty-five HSCT centers from 25 countries in Europe, Australia, and Asia reported data on 655 GNR episodes and 704 pathogens in 591 patients (Enterobacteriaceae, 73%; nonfermentative rods, 24%; and 3% others). Half of GNRs were fluoroquinolone and noncarbapenem resistant; 18.5% carbapenem resistant; 35.2% multidrug resistant. The total resistance rates were higher in allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) vs autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) patients (P < .001) but similar in community-acquired infections. Noncarbapenem resistance and multidrug resistance were higher in auto-HSCT patients in centers providing vs not providing fluoroquinolone prophylaxis (P < .01). Resistance rates were higher in southeast vs northwest Europe and similar in children and adults, excluding higher fluoroquinolone- and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor resistance rates in allo-HSCT adults. Non-Klebsiella Enterobacteriaceae were rarely carbapenem resistant. Multivariable analysis revealed resistance risk factors in allo-HSCT patients: fluoroquinolone resistance: adult, prolonged neutropenia, breakthrough on fluoroquinolones; noncarbapenem resistance: hospital-acquired infection, breakthrough on noncarbapenems or other antibiotics (excluding fluoroquinolones, noncarbapenems, carbapenems), donor type; carbapenem resistance: breakthrough on carbapenem, longer hospitalization, intensive care unit, previous other antibiotic therapy; multidrug resistance: longer hospitalization, breakthrough on β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, and carbapenems. Inappropriate empiric therapy and mortality were significantly more common in infections caused by resistant bacteria.

Conclusions

Our data question the recommendation for fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and call for reassessment of local empiric antibiotic protocols. Knowledge of pathogen-specific resistance enables early appropriate empiric therapy. Monitoring of resistance is crucial.

### Rapid detection of gram-negative antimicrobial resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths using a multiplex PCR system [^b4adf013]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently available rapid blood culture diagnostics detect few gram-negative resistance determinants, limiting their clinical utility. We prospectively evaluated the prototype BIOFIRE FILMARRAY Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Panel, a rapid multiplex PCR test that detects 31 AMR genes, on residual positive blood culture broths from patients with gram-negative bacteremia due to five target organisms at a New York City hospital. Predicted antimicrobial resistance based on the AMR Panel was compared to results from broth microdilution testing of bloodstream isolates recovered in culture. A simulated stewardship study assessed opportunities for the optimization of therapy if the AMR Panel results had been available for patient care in real time. We enrolled 148 patients with gram-negative bacteremia (Escherichia coli, n = 75; Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 44; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, n = 17; Enterobacter cloacae complex, n = 9; and Acinetobacter baumannii, n = 3). The sensitivity of the AMR Panel for predicting antimicrobial resistance was ≥ 90% for 10/14 antimicrobial agents in E. coli and for 10/16 agents in K. pneumoniae. Specificity was ≥ 90% for 15/17 agents in E. coli and for all 16 agents in K. pneumoniae. Performance for other organisms was poor. For E. coli or K. pneumoniae bacteremia, use of the AMR Panel could have led to earlier escalation or de-escalation of β-lactam therapy in a majority of patients compared to what actually occurred. This study demonstrates that a rapid multiplex PCR test with a large menu of AMR genes can be applied to positive blood culture broths to rapidly predict resistance to frontline antimicrobial agents in patients with E. coli or K. pneumoniae bacteremia. IMPORTANCEPatients with gram-negative bacteremia require urgent treatment with antimicrobial agents that are effective against their infecting pathogen. However, conventional laboratory work-up of blood cultures takes days to yield results, and during this time, patients may receive ineffective therapies. We evaluated the prototype BIOFIRE FILMARRAY AMR Panel, an assay that detects 31 genes in gram-negative bacteria that confer resistance to β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides in approximately 1 hour, directly from positive blood culture broths, and compared these results to antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates recovered in culture. We found that the AMR Panel accurately predicted resistance in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to most antimicrobials. Moreover, if results from this assay had been used for patient care, there would have been opportunities to optimize antimicrobial prescribing more quickly than using conventional methods. These data demonstrate how novel molecular assays could optimize care for patients with E. coli and K. pneumoniae bacteremia.

Regarding specific circumstances for infective endocarditis, more specifically with respect to patients with culture-negative endocarditis, AHA 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering antibiotics covering staphylococci, enterococci, and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli in patients with culture-negative PVE with an onset of symptoms within 1 year of prosthetic valve placement. Consider administering antibiotics covering staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci if the symptoms occur > 1 year after valve placement.
