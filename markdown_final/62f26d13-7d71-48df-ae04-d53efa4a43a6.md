## Question

can I start Farxiga in patient with chronic kidney disease without diabetes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can be started in a patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who does not have diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory indication and whether it explicitly includes non-diabetic CKD. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial evidence (DAPA-CKD) and its subgroup analyses. Next, I will review guideline positions from KDIGO and other societies. After that, I need to check the eGFR thresholds for initiation versus continuation, including any exceptions. I will then examine safety considerations and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with dosing and follow-up, and confirm any caveats about populations where it is not recommended.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because I need to ensure we are not overextending beyond labeled use. The FDA label for dapagliflozin includes an indication to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression, and this indication is not restricted to patients with type 2 diabetes, which supports use in non-diabetic CKD when criteria are met [^114Fd7d3] [^113dVeXm].

> Next, I should review the pivotal evidence base. The DAPA-CKD randomized trial enrolled 4,304 adults with CKD, including 1,398 without diabetes, and showed that dapagliflozin 10 mg daily reduced the primary composite renal outcome by 39% overall and provided consistent benefit in the subgroup without diabetes, with a hazard ratio of 0.50 (95% CI 0.35–0.72), confirming efficacy in non-diabetic CKD [^116uf9ia] [^114orNkL]. Hold on, I should verify mortality and heart failure outcomes too; yes, dapagliflozin also reduced all-cause mortality and the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization in the overall cohort, with benefits appearing consistent across diabetes subgroups, which strengthens the case for use in non-diabetic CKD [^111f1ypu] [^112rbUTN].

> I will now examine guideline alignment to ensure this is standard of care. KDIGO 2022 and subsequent commentaries explicitly recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD even in the absence of diabetes, moving SGLT2 inhibitors into the comprehensive CKD care pathway and endorsing initiation down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² in appropriate patients, with continuation even as kidney function declines further, which directly supports starting dapagliflozin in non-diabetic CKD when albuminuria and eGFR criteria are met [^114GBnZa] [^111Ei8NA]. Let me double-check other societies: the UK Kidney Association similarly recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD regardless of diabetes status, reinforcing this position [^116mgmQj].

> Now, I need to check the eGFR thresholds carefully, because initiation and continuation rules differ. Initially, I thought initiation should not occur below 25 mL/min/1.73 m² based on the DAPA-CKD enrollment range, but wait, let me verify the most current guidance; KDIGO and related commentaries updated recommendations to allow initiation down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m², supported by EMPA-KIDNEY and pooled analyses, while the FDA label still advises not to initiate below 25 mL/min/1.73 m², though patients who fall below that threshold during treatment may continue therapy without discontinuation, which reconciles the apparent discrepancy [^114GBnZa] [^111Ei8NA] [^117AeSck] [^111TsbpE]. I should confirm that continuation after dialysis initiation is acceptable; yes, the label allows continuation even if dialysis is initiated after enrollment, though evidence for benefit on dialysis is limited and expert guidance remains cautious about expecting efficacy in kidney replacement therapy [^115cQPpv] [^112La1Bp].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring, because I need to ensure we mitigate predictable risks. Let me consider volume depletion and hypotension, especially in older adults or those on diuretics; the safety profile in DAPA-CKD was consistent across eGFR strata, but prudent monitoring of blood pressure and volume status after initiation is warranted, and temporary interruption around major surgery or prolonged fasting is advised to reduce AKI risk [^115cQPpv] [^111TsbpE]. I should confirm the expected eGFR dip; an acute, reversible decline in eGFR of about 2–6 mL/min/1.73 m² is expected within 1–2 weeks and is not a reason to stop if the patient is clinically stable, with early albuminuria reduction correlating with better long-term kidney outcomes, which supports persistence unless there are red flags like symptomatic hypotension or intercurrent illness [^114piVL4] [^112eiiYo] [^1159Cx43]. But wait, what about ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients? While the risk is far lower than in type 1 diabetes, rare cases have been reported, so I should counsel on sick-day management and recognize that euglycemic DKA can occur, warranting vigilance during acute illness or reduced intake [^1146KJqV].

> Let me synthesize the clinical criteria for initiation so I don't miss anything important. Appropriate candidates are adults with CKD at risk of progression, typically with albuminuria (UACR ≥ 200 mg/g in DAPA-CKD), and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² per updated KDIGO guidance, while the FDA label still advises initiation at eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; importantly, the label does not require diabetes for the CKD indication, and benefits were consistent across causes of CKD including hypertensive/ischemic nephropathy and glomerulonephritides, though patients with polycystic kidney disease or recent immunosuppression for kidney disease were excluded and are not expected to benefit [^114GBnZa] [^111Ei8NA] [^114Fd7d3] [^114orNkL]. I should double-check that standard background therapy with ACEi/ARB is optimized when feasible, as most trial participants were on RAAS blockade, which aligns with best practice [^114iU36J].

> I will now outline practical steps for initiation and follow-up, and I need to ensure dosing and monitoring are precise. Start dapagliflozin 10 mg orally once daily for the CKD indication, independent of HbA1c, and continue the same dose regardless of eGFR decline as long as it remains clinically appropriate, with no dose adjustment needed for renal impairment in this indication [^111TsbpE]. Before starting, I should confirm eGFR, electrolytes including potassium, and volume status, and review concomitant diuretics; after initiation, I will recheck eGFR and electrolytes in about 2–4 weeks to document the expected hemodynamic dip and ensure stability, counsel on sick-day management, and temporarily hold perioperatively if major surgery or prolonged fasting is planned [^111TsbpE] [^114piVL4]. Hold on, I should verify that no renal dose adjustment is required; correct, the 10 mg dose is standard for CKD risk reduction across eGFR ranges in this indication [^111TsbpE].

> Let me reconsider any caveats so I don't overgeneralize. Use is not recommended for polycystic kidney disease or in those requiring recent immunosuppression for kidney disease, and while continuation after dialysis initiation is permitted, evidence for benefit on dialysis is limited, so expectations should be tempered and decisions individualized; in patients with very advanced CKD near the threshold, shared decision-making about potential benefit versus uncertainty is prudent, especially if albuminuria is high and the risk of progression is substantial [^114Fd7d3] [^112La1Bp]. I should also confirm that the absolute risk reduction is greatest in those with higher baseline risk, which supports prioritizing patients with significant albuminuria and lower eGFR within the eligible range [^117AeSck].

> Final answer: Yes, Farxiga (dapagliflozin) can be started in a patient with chronic kidney disease who does not have diabetes, provided the patient meets clinical criteria and eGFR thresholds. The FDA-approved CKD indication is not restricted to diabetes, DAPA-CKD demonstrated clear benefit in non-diabetic CKD, and contemporary guidelines endorse SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD regardless of diabetes status, with initiation generally recommended at eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² (KDIGO) or ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² (FDA label), and continuation even if kidney function later declines, alongside appropriate monitoring for volume status, electrolytes, and the expected early eGFR dip [^114Fd7d3] [^116uf9ia] [^114GBnZa] [^111Ei8NA] [^111TsbpE].

Yes, **Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is indicated** for adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at risk of progression, regardless of diabetes status [^114Fd7d3] [^113dVeXm]. It reduces the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalization in CKD patients with or without diabetes [^116uf9ia] [^114orNkL]. Initiate **10 mg once daily** if eGFR is ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; if eGFR falls below 25, you may continue therapy, but initiation is not recommended [^111TsbpE]. Monitor for volume depletion, ketoacidosis, and genital infections, and use caution with diuretics or RAAS inhibitors [^114T6hMR] [^1146KJqV]. The DAPA-CKD trial demonstrated significant renal and cardiovascular benefits in non-diabetic CKD, supporting its use in this population [^114orNkL].

---

## Indications and clinical evidence

Farxiga is **indicated to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with CKD at risk of progression**, regardless of diabetes status [^114Fd7d3] [^113dVeXm]. The DAPA-CKD trial demonstrated significant renal and cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD, including those without diabetes [^116uf9ia] [^114orNkL]. Specifically, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome (sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline, ESKD, or renal/cardiovascular death) by 39% overall and by 50% in patients without diabetes [^116uf9ia] [^114orNkL].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

The **recommended dosage** of Farxiga for CKD patients without diabetes is 10 mg orally once daily [^111TsbpE]. No dose adjustment is required based on renal function, but initiation is not recommended if eGFR is below 25 mL/min/1.73 m². If eGFR falls below 25 mL/min/1.73 m² during treatment, therapy may be continued, but close monitoring is advised [^111TsbpE].

---

## Clinical benefits

Farxiga provides **several clinical benefits** for CKD patients without diabetes:

- **Renal protection**: Significantly reduces the risk of sustained eGFR decline, ESKD, and renal death [^116uf9ia] [^114orNkL].

- **Cardiovascular benefits**: Reduces cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure [^114orNkL] [^111f1ypu].

- **Slows CKD progression**: Demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of eGFR decline, indicating slowed progression of CKD [^115hngCf].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

While Farxiga is generally well tolerated, **clinicians should monitor for the following**:

- **Volume depletion**: Monitor for hypotension, dizziness, and dehydration, especially in patients with impaired renal function or those receiving diuretics [^1122MrFb].

- **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**: Although rare in non-diabetic patients, monitor for signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis [^1146KJqV].

- **Genital infections**: Increased risk of mycotic infections due to glycosuria [^114T6hMR].

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: Monitor renal function, especially in patients with impaired renal function or those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications [^1122MrFb].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Farxiga is **contraindicated or requires caution** in the following scenarios:

- **Severe renal impairment**: eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m² (initiation not recommended) [^111TsbpE].

- **Polycystic kidney disease**: Not recommended due to lack of efficacy [^114Fd7d3] [^113dVeXm].

- **Immunosuppressive therapy**: Not recommended for patients requiring or with a recent history of immunosuppressive therapy for kidney disease [^114Fd7d3] [^113dVeXm].

- **Type 1 diabetes mellitus**: Not recommended for glycemic control due to increased risk of ketoacidosis [^114Fd7d3] [^1146KJqV].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **support the use** of Farxiga in CKD patients without diabetes. The KDIGO 2022 update recommends SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin, for CKD patients with or without diabetes, emphasizing their renal and cardiovascular benefits [^114GBnZa]. The UK Kidney Association also recommends SGLT2 inhibitors for CKD patients regardless of diabetes status, citing robust evidence from clinical trials [^116mgmQj].

---

## Patient selection criteria

When considering Farxiga for CKD patients without diabetes, **clinicians should assess the following**:

- **eGFR**: ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² for initiation [^111TsbpE].

- **Albuminuria**: Presence of albuminuria (UACR ≥ 200 mg/g) indicates higher risk of CKD progression and greater benefit from therapy [^115hngCf].

- **Comorbidities**: Assess for cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension, and other comorbidities that may influence treatment decisions [^notfound].

## Summary of clinical evidence

| **Study** | **Population** | **Primary outcome** | **Results** |
|-|-|-|-|
| DAPA-CKD | CKD patients with and without diabetes | Composite renal outcome | - HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.51–0.72) <br/> - Consistent benefit in non-diabetic patients |
| EMPA-KIDNEY | CKD patients with and without diabetes | Composite renal outcome | - HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.64–0.82) <br/> - Consistent benefit in non-diabetic patients |

Farxiga (dapagliflozin) is indicated for CKD patients without diabetes, providing significant renal and cardiovascular benefits. The recommended dosage is **10 mg once daily**, with initiation not recommended if eGFR is below 25 mL/min/1.73 m². Clinicians should monitor for volume depletion, ketoacidosis, and genital infections, and consider patient-specific factors when initiating therapy [^114Fd7d3] [^116uf9ia].

8.6 Renal Impairment

FARXIGA was evaluated in 4304 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the DAPA-CKD trial. FARXIGA was also evaluated in 1926 adult patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2in the DAPA-HF trial. The safety profile of FARXIGA across eGFR subgroups in these studies was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5)].

FARXIGA was evaluated in two glycemic control adult trials that included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using FARXIGA may be more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the trial of adult patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 13 patients receiving FARXIGA experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo. Use of FARXIGA for glycemic control in patients without established CV disease or CV risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Efficacy and safety trials with FARXIGA did not enroll patients with an eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled in the DAPA-CKD and DELIVER trials, adult patients were not required to discontinue therapy if eGFR fell below 25 mL/min/1.73 m2or if dialysis was initiated. Once enrolled in the DAPA-HF trial, adult patients were not required to discontinue therapy if eGFR fell below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2or if dialysis was initiated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5)].

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Other Indications in Adults

The recommended dosage of FARXIGA is 10 mg orally once daily in adults for the following indications:

To reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF) in patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.
To reduce the risk of CV death, hHF, and urgent heart failure visit in patients with heart failure.
To reduce the risk of hHF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and either established CV disease or multiple CV risk factors.

For Adults with Renal Impairment Receiving FARXIGA for Indications Other than Glycemic Control:

The recommended dosage of FARXIGA in patients with an eGFR greater than or equal to 25 mL/min/1.73 m2is the same as the recommended dosage in patients with normal renal function.
Initiation with FARXIGA is not recommended in patients with an eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2.
If the eGFR falls below 25 mL/min/1.73 m2while receiving treatment with FARXIGA, patients may continue FARXIGA 10 mg orally once daily to reduce the risk of eGFR decline, ESKD, CV death and hHF.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery

Withhold FARXIGA for at least 3 days, if possible, prior to major surgery or procedures associated with prolonged fasting. Resume FARXIGA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

14.4 Chronic Kidney Disease

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether FARXIGA reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to FARXIGA 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^111f1ypu]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

FARXIGA also reduced the incidence of the composite endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure [HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.55, 0.92), p = 0.0089] and all-cause mortality [HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.53, 0.88), p = 0.0035].

Figure 6: Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint, ≥ 50% Sustained Decline in eGFR, ESKD, CV or Renal Death (DAPA-CKD Study)

Patients at risk is the number of subjects at risk at the beginning of the period. 1 month corresponds to 30 days. 2-sided p-value is displayed. HR, CI and p-value are from the Cox proportional hazard model.

HR = hazard ratio; CI = confidence interval; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESKD = end stage kidney disease; CV = cardiovascular; vs = versus.

The results of the primary composite endpoint were consistent across the subgroups examined, including CKD patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus, causes of CKD, age, biological sex, race, UACR, and eGFR.

DAPA-CKD enrolled a population with relatively advanced CKD at high risk of progression. Exploratory analyses of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted to determine the effect of FARXIGA on CV outcomes (the DECLARE trial) support the conclusion that FARXIGA is also likely to be effective in patients with less advanced CKD.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling:

Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Volume Depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]
Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]
Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]
Genital Mycotic Infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

FARXIGA has been evaluated in clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in adult patients with heart failure, and in adult patients with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety profile of FARXIGA was consistent across the studied indications. No new adverse reactions were identified in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER heart failure trials, or in the DAPA-CKD trial in patients with chronic kidney disease. Severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were observed only in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Clinical Trials for Glycemic Control in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Pool of 12 Placebo-Controlled Adult Trials for FARXIGA 5 and 10 mg for Glycemic Control

The data in Table 1 is derived from 12 glycemic control placebo-controlled trials in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ranging from 12 to 24 weeks. In 4 trials FARXIGA was used as monotherapy, and in 8 trials FARXIGA was used as add-on to background antidiabetic therapy or as combination therapy with metformin [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1 The global rise in diabetes has led to an increase in the incidence of CKD, with over 35% of patients with diabetes aged ≥ 20 years having a diagnosis of CKD. 2 Optimal glycaemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD is crucial, to reduce the risk of further complications, as well as the progression rate of CKD. 3 However, glucose‐lowering treatment options in this population are limited, and several drugs have label restrictions concerning CKD. 3, 4, 5 Furthermore, patients with CKD are at greater risk of developing severe hypoglycaemia, and medications that carry a high risk of hypoglycaemia 3, 4, 5, 6 may be less appropriate for this population. New treatment options for patients with diabetes and CKD are therefore needed to optimize outcomes.

8.5 Geriatric Use

No FARXIGA dosage change is recommended based on age.

A total of 1424 (24%) of the 5936 FARXIGA-treated patients were 65 years and older and 207 (3.5%) patients were 75 years and older in a pool of 21 double-blind, controlled, clinical trials assessing the efficacy of FARXIGA in improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. After controlling for level of renal function (eGFR), efficacy was similar for patients under age 65 years and those 65 years and older. In patients ≥ 65 years of age, a higher proportion of patients treated with FARXIGA for glycemic control had adverse reactions of hypotension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In the DAPA-CKD, DAPA-HF and DELIVER trials, safety and efficacy were similar for patients aged 65 years and younger and those older than 65. In the DAPA-HF study, 2714 (57%) out of 4744 patients with HFrEF were older than 65 years. In the DELIVER study, 4759 (76%) out of 6263 patients with heart failure (LVEF > 40%) were older than 65 years. In the DAPA-CKD study, 1818 (42%) out of 4304 patients with CKD were older than 65 years.

Abstract

Background

Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have shown that sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Whether these benefits extend to CKD patients without type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease is unknown. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial (NCT03036150) will assess the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients with CKD with and without diabetes.

Methods

DAPA-CKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial in which ∼4300 patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion will be enrolled. The vast majority will be receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor at enrolment.

Results

After a screening assessment, eligible patients with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 200 mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 are randomly assigned to placebo or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day. Enrolment is monitored to ensure that at least 30% of patients do not have diabetes and that no more than 10% have an eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The primary endpoint is a composite of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage renal disease, renal death or cardiovascular death. The trial will conclude when 681 primary renal events have occurred, providing 90% power to detect a 22% relative risk reduction (α level of 0.05).

Conclusion

### Rationale and protocol of the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized controlled trial [^114r6EXh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have shown that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Whether these benefits extend to CKD patients without type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease is unknown. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial (NCT03036150) will assess the effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on renal and cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients with CKD with and without diabetes.

Methods

DAPA-CKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial in which ∼4300 patients with CKD Stages 2–4 and elevated urinary albumin excretion will be enrolled. The vast majority will be receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor at enrolment.

Results

After a screening assessment, eligible patients with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio ≥ 200mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 and 75mL/min/1.73m2 are randomly assigned to placebo or dapagliflozin 10mg/day. Enrolment is monitored to ensure that at least 30% of patients do not have diabetes and that no more than 10% have an eGFR > 60mL/min/1.73m2. The primary endpoint is a composite of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage renal disease, renal death or cardiovascular death. The trial will conclude when 681 primary renal events have occurred, providing 90% power to detect a 22% relative risk reduction (α level of 0.05).

Conclusion

DAPA-CKD will determine whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to guideline-recommended therapies, safely reduces the rate of renal and cardiovascular events in patients across multiple CKD stages with and without diabetes.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no information regarding the presence of dapagliflozin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Dapagliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). However, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data is not clear. Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney.

Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, advise women that use of FARXIGA is not recommended while breastfeeding.

Data

Dapagliflozin was present in rat milk at a milk/plasma ratio of 0.49, indicating that dapagliflozin and its metabolites are transferred into milk at a concentration that is approximately 50% of that in maternal plasma. Juvenile rats directly exposed to dapagliflozin showed risk to the developing kidney (renal pelvic and tubular dilatations) during maturation.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of FARXIGA as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients aged 10 years and older. Use of FARXIGA for this indication is supported by a 26-week placebo-controlled trial with a 26-week extension in 157 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, pediatric pharmacokinetic data, and trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)]. The safety profile observed in the placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was similar to that observed in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The safety and effectiveness of FARXIGA for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years of age.

The safety and effectiveness of FARXIGA have not been established in pediatric patients to reduce the risk of [see Indications and Usage (1)].

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition: which patient with chronic kidney disease should be treated in the future? [^1119vw2p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors represents a major advance for people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The results of the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial have clearly demonstrated that canagliflozin prevents kidney failure and cardiovascular events. The results from three other large-scale randomized trials, collectively enrolling > 30000 participants, have provided further evidence that the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on major kidney outcomes in people with T2DM may be present across the class, although this will only be known for certain when Dapagliflozin and Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with CKD (DAPA-CKD) (NCT03036150) and The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection with Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) (NCT03594110) are reported over coming years. Importantly, the benefits of SGLT2 inhibition have been achieved in addition to the current standard of care. This review summarizes evidence for SGLT2 inhibition in people with T2DM and CKD, evaluates key patient characteristics and concomitant drug use that may influence the use of these drugs in people with CKD, discusses current guideline recommendations and explores how these drugs may be used in people with CKD in the future, including in combination with other treatments.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on the rate of decline in kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial [^115hngCf]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes in the DAPA-CKD trial. In this pre-specified analysis, we assessed the effect of dapagliflozin on the rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)-ie, the eGFR slope.

Methods

DAPA-CKD was a randomised controlled trial that enrolled participants aged 18 years or older, with or without type 2 diabetes, with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 200–5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 25–75 mL/min per 1.73m 2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or placebo, added to standard care. In this pre-specified analysis, we analysed eGFR slope using mixed-effect models with different slopes from baseline to week 2 (acute eGFR decline), week 2 to end of treatment (chronic eGFR slope), and baseline to end of treatment (total eGFR slope). DAPA-CKD is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036150, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Feb 2, 2017, and April 3, 2020, 4304 participants were recruited, of whom 2152 (50%) were assigned to dapagliflozin and 2152 (50%) were assigned to placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (SD 12), 1425 (33.1%) participants were women, 2906 (67.5%) participants had type 2 diabetes. The median on-treatment follow-up was 2.3 years (IQR 1.8–2.6). From baseline to the end of treatment, dapagliflozin compared with placebo slowed eGFR decline by 0.95 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (95% CI 0.63 to 1.27) in the overall cohort. Between baseline and week 2, dapagliflozin compared with placebo resulted in an acute eGFR decline of 2.61 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (2.16 to 3.06) in patients with type 2 diabetes and 2.01 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (1.36 to 2.66) in those without type 2 diabetes. Between week 2 and end of treatment, dapagliflozin compared with placebo reduced the mean rate of eGFR decline by a greater amount in patients with type 2 diabetes (mean difference in chronic eGFR slope 2.26 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year [1.88 to 2.64]) than in those without type 2 diabetes (1.29 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year [0.73 to 1.85]; p interaction = 0.0049). Between baseline and end of treatment, the effect of dapagliflozin compared with placebo on the decline of total eGFR slope in patients with type 2 diabetes was 1.18 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (0.79 to 1.56) and without type 2 diabetes was 0.46 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 per year (-0.10 to 1.03; p interaction = 0.040). The total eGFR slope was steeper in patients with higher baseline HbA 1c and UACR; the effect of dapagliflozin on eGFR slope was also more pronounced in patients with higher baseline HbA 1c and UACR.

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin significantly slowed long-term eGFR decline in patients with chronic kidney disease compared with placebo. The mean difference in eGFR slope between patients treated with dapagliflozin versus placebo was greater in patients with type 2 diabetes, higher HbA 1c, and higher UACR.

### Initiating SGLT2 inhibitor therapy to improve renal outcomes for persons with diabetes eligible for an intensified glucose-lowering regimen: hypothetical intervention using parametric g-formula modeling [^116HGYgH]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The advent of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors mirrors a major advance for persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are at risk of advanced kidney disease. The renal benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors has been consistently shown in clinical trials and observational studies using real world data. In clinical guidelines, SGLT2 inhibitors are now listed as the second-line therapy for persons with T2DM, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is considered secondary prevention for diabetic kidney disease.

In a recent placebo-controlled trial, dapagliflozin showed a favorable effect on kidney outcomes among patients with chronic kidney disease, regardless of the presence or absence of T2DM. Another trial, EMPA-KIDNEY, is ongoing to examine whether empagliflozin prevents worsening of kidney disease among persons who have chronic kidney disease with or without T2DM. These results indicate that, in the future, the SGLT2 inhibitor class could be used for persons with T2DM, regardless of glycemic control (or even for persons without diabetes); as of September 2021, dapagliflozin already had the authorized indication for non-diabetic persons with kidney disease. Until the expanded indication is approved for other agents, persons with poorly controlled T2DM were most likely to be candidates for add-on SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. However, it is uncertain at what glycemic level SGLT2 inhibitors should be initiated to optimize renal outcomes for persons with T2DM or whether renal outcomes differ depending on the timing of SGLT2 inhibitor introduction. This topic is clinically relevant, given that glycemic control is one of the key components in preventing progression towards end-stage renal disease.

This study aimed to explore the optimal threshold of hemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c) for intervention with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy for persons with T2DM under several hypothetical scenarios using observational data.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease: a pre-specified analysis from the DAPA-CKD randomized controlled trial [^112rbUTN]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased in the last decade. Global estimates indicate that ∼700 million people are affected by CKD. According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study, the number of deaths that could be attributed to CKD increased by 41.5% from 1990 to 2017. While death due to cardiovascular diseases is an important contributor to all-cause mortality in patients with CKD, several studies have shown that other causes of death including infections and malignancies frequently occur in patients with CKD.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure and delay progression to kidney failure in patients with Type 2 diabetes, both at the early and more advanced stages of CKD. These benefits appear independent of the improvements in glycemic control and are likely mediated by other mechanisms including favourable effects on glomerular hemodynamics. These findings have led to the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitors may also preserve kidney function in patients with CKD without Type 2 diabetes. The DAPA-CKD trial therefore enrolled patients with CKD with and without Type 2 diabetes and demonstrated that dapagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of kidney events, hospitalizations for heart failure or cardiovascular death, and prolonged survival irrespective of Type 2 diabetes status. In this pre-specified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial, we investigated the causes of death in DAPA-CKD participants and assessed the effects of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular causes of death.

INTRODUCTION

In large clinical trials recruiting participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D), sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated beneficial effects on cardiovascular (CV) and kidney outcomes that extend beyond glycaemic control. One of these trials, and the first dedicated renal trial — the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) — involved participants with T2D and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CREDENCE recruited individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30– < 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) > 300–5000 mg/g]. It demonstrated that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on clinical outcomes extended to participants with T2D and CKD who were already receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as background renoprotective therapy.

An acute reduction in eGFR along with a reduction in albuminuria is observed on commencing SGLT2 inhibitors, even in participants with good glycaemic control. This, in conjunction with strong experimental data, has led to speculation that the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors may involve not only improvements in metabolic parameters, but also favourable changes to glomerular haemodynamics. Thus, like ACEi and ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors may also be beneficial to patients with non-diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in CKD (DAPA-CKD) trial tested the hypothesis that compared with placebo, the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin is superior in reducing the risk of kidney and CV events in a broad group of participants with CKD, the vast majority of whom are already receiving ACEis/ARBs. Unlike CREDENCE, the DAPA-CKD trial included participants with CKD but without T2D, to explore whether the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors extend to patients with non-DKD. Here we describe the baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in the DAPA-CKD trial and compare these with characteristics of participants included in other recent trials involving participants with T2D and/or CKD from other causes reporting kidney outcomes as primary endpoints.

CONCLUSION

Our analysis shows that slowing CKD progression through long-term treatment with dapagliflozin may lead to substantial delays in the time to major adverse cardio-renal outcomes such as kidney failure, as well as improving life expectancy. These findings may support informed decision making by patients and clinicians, improving treatment strategies for CKD.

14.4 Chronic Kidney Disease

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dosage of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin 10 mg reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months. The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 2906) and patients without diabetes (n = 1398). The mean age of the trial population was 62 years and 67% were male. The population was 53% White, 4% Black or African American, and 34% Asian; 25% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, mean eGFR was 43 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44% of patients had an eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73m2to less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2, and 15% of patients had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Median UACR was 950 mg/g. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy (58%), ischemic/hypertensive nephropathy (16%), and IgA nephropathy (6%). At baseline, 97% of patients were treated with ACEi or ARB. Approximately 44% were taking antiplatelet agents, and 65% were on a statin.

### Barriers to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease: a real-world study [^114p39Ly]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study indicated that patients with SGLT2i initiators were younger than SGLT2i nonusers in the high-risk CKD group eligible for SGLT2i. In the elderly group, the prevalence of high-risk CKD eligible for SGLT2i was higher (28.6%) than that in those aged < 65 years (21.8%). However, older patients were less likely to start SGLT2i therapy (17.6%) than those aged < 65 years (45.8%) in the high-risk group. Trials in the SGLT2i class show that older patients have similar or greater benefits than younger patients. These mutually opposed results are based on ADA recommendations that glycemic goals for some older adults might reasonably be relaxed as part of individualized care. Since older patients are more likely to have various complications, they are cautious about using newly available drugs. Besides, while understanding of clinical benefits of SGLT2i is evolving, side effects such as volume depletion might be more common for older patients. It is also difficult to distinguish whether chronic kidney disease in the elderly is due to aging or diabetes, although the DAPA-CKD study has shown that dapagliflozin can reduce the risk of worsening kidney function or death in patients with CKD without T2D. Notably, for subjects older than 65 years without albuminuria, CKD has been proposed as eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m² to distinguish age-related from disease-related changes in eGFR.

There were HbA1c differences in SGLT2i initiation. This is due to clinical inertia of physicians not to change medications when glycemic control is in the target range despite the presence of CVD-HF or CKD. This is contrary to the ADA/EASD consensus recommending SGLT2i should be considered independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target in appropriate high-risk individuals with established T2D. Furthermore, those who received SGLT2i showed significantly higher eGFR, BMI, and shorter diabetes duration. Indeed, it has been reported that obesity is a greater driver of treatment options when comparing SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. Efforts to provide treatment following guidelines and extension of an SGLT2i 's official prescription drug label for eGFR may help improve renal outcomes of patients with T2D.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on major adverse kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial [^114orNkL]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin reduces the risk of kidney failure and heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes according to presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and according to underlying cause of chronic kidney disease, reported as diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritides, ischaemic or hypertensive chronic kidney disease, or chronic kidney disease of other or unknown cause.

Methods

DAPA-CKD was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial done at 386 study sites in 21 countries, in which participants with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200–5000 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25–75 mL/min per 1.73m 2 were randomly assigned (1:1) to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo, as an adjunct to standard care. The primary outcome was a composite of sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or kidney-related or cardiovascular death. Secondary efficacy outcomes were a kidney-specific composite (the same as the primary outcome but excluding cardiovascular death), a composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. In this study, we conducted a prespecified subgroup analysis of the DAPA-CKD primary and secondary endpoints by presence or absence of type 2 diabetes and by aetiology of chronic kidney disease. DAPA-CKD is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036150.

Findings

The study took place between Feb 2, 2017, and June 12, 2020. 4304 participants were randomly assigned (2152 to dapagliflozin and 2152 to placebo) and were followed up for a median of 2.4 years (IQR 2.0–2.7). Overall, 2906 (68%) participants had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, of whom 396 (14%) had chronic kidney disease ascribed to causes other than diabetic nephropathy. The relative risk reduction for the primary composite outcome with dapagliflozin was consistent in participants with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.52–0.79) and those without diabetes (0.50, 0.35–0.72; p interaction = 0.24). Similar findings were seen for the secondary outcomes: kidney-specific composite outcome (0.57 [0.45–0.73] vs 0.51 [0.34–0.75]; P interaction = 0.57), cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure (0.70 [0.53–0.92] vs 0.79 [0.40–1.55]; P interaction = 0.78), and all-cause mortality (0.74 [0.56–0.98] vs 0.52 [0.29–0.93]; P interaction = 0.25). The effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was also consistent among patients with diabetic nephropathy (n = 2510; HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51–0.78), glomerulonephritides (n = 695; 0.43, 0.26–0.71), ischaemic or hypertensive chronic kidney disease (n = 687; 0.75, 0.44–1.26), and chronic kidney disease of other or unknown cause (n = 412; 0.58, 0.29–1.19; P interaction = 0.53), with similar consistency seen across the secondary outcomes. The proportions of participants in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups who had serious adverse events or discontinued study drug due to adverse events did not vary between those with and those without type 2 diabetes.

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin reduces the risks of major adverse kidney and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic chronic kidney disease.

While small mechanistic studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors exert physiological effects in people with non-DKD, including a characteristic haemodynamic 'dip' in GFR, the DAPA-CKD trial is the first to capture the effects on clinical kidney outcomes. In the context of other trials in this field, the DAPA-CKD trial will provide unique insights into how to treat patients with kidney disease due to diverse aetiologies.

2.3 Interventions

Patients with T2D were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo, taken orally in the morning, in addition to their usual care. Randomization was stratified by pre‐enrolment glucose‐lowering therapy (long/intermediate‐acting and mixed insulin regimen, metformin, sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione or other regimen). Oral glucose‐lowering drugs (apart from SGLT2 inhibitors), insulin (apart from rapid/short‐acting insulins), antihypertensive drugs, lipid‐lowering drugs and anti‐platelet drugs were permitted as long as the dose remained constant throughout the 24‐week treatment period. Patients who developed a loss of glycaemic control during the 24‐week treatment period, defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of > 13.3 mmol/L during Weeks 4–12 or FPG of > 11.1 mmol/L during Weeks 12–24, were eligible for open‐label rescue medication in addition to the blinded treatment. Rescue medication could comprise any appropriate glucose‐lowering agent, with the exception of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Study visits took place during enrolment (Week −6), lead‐in (Weeks −4, −1), randomization (Week 0), double‐blind treatment (Weeks 1, 4, 12, 24) and the follow‐up period (Week 27). HbA1c was recorded at Weeks −6, 0, 4, 12, 24, 27. Body weight and seated SBP were recorded at Weeks −6, −4, −1, 0, 1, 4, 12, 24, 27. FPG was recorded at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 27.

### Impact of diabetes on the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes: collaborative meta-analysis of large placebo-controlled trials [^117AeSck]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Based on the average risk in different trial populations, we estimated that for every 1000 patients with chronic kidney disease treated for one year with an SGLT2 inhibitor, 11 first kidney disease progression events would be prevented in patients with diabetes, and 15 would be prevented in patients without diabetes. In these patients, such treatment also appeared to result in an estimated four to five fewer acute kidney injury events in patients with and without diabetes. Individual trials have shown that kidney benefits translate into important reductions in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits appear to be cost-saving in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We found no good evidence that the kidney benefits were modified by the average level of kidney function studied in the trials. Importantly, efficacy and safety data from EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD combined include information on nearly 3000 patients with an eGFR of 20–30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. A total of 489 kidney disease progression outcomes accrued in those with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in those two trials. Although some clinical practice guidelines have started recommending use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes at eGFRs down to 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (based on grade B levels of evidence), many other recommendations limit initiation to those with eGFR greater than 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. As patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney disease progression, our findings should encourage the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 with continued use below this level. Several hundred participants in the chronic kidney disease trials had an eGFR below 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at randomisation or during follow-up (eg, 254 participants in EMPA-KIDNEY at randomisation), providing indirect evidence to support initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in selected patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2.

### The long-term effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease: a time-to-event analysis [^111uzEBD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a significant clinical and economic burden to healthcare systems worldwide, which increases considerably with progression towards kidney failure. The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial demonstrated that patients with or without type 2 diabetes who were treated with dapagliflozin experienced slower progression of CKD versus those receiving placebo. Understanding the effect of long-term treatment with dapagliflozin on the timing of kidney failure beyond trial follow-up can assist informed decision-making by healthcare providers and patients. The study objective was therefore to extrapolate the outcome-based clinical benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with CKD via a time-to-event analysis using trial data.

Methods

Patient-level data from the DAPA-CKD trial were used to parameterize a closed cohort-level partitioned survival model that predicted time-to-event for key trial endpoints (kidney failure, all-cause mortality, sustained decline in kidney function and hospitalization for heart failure). Data were pooled with a subpopulation of the Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial to create a combined CKD population spanning a range of CKD stages; a parallel survival analysis was conducted in this population.

Results

In the DAPA-CKD and pooled CKD populations, treatment with dapagliflozin delayed time to first event for kidney failure, all-cause mortality, sustained decline in kidney function and hospitalization for heart failure. Attenuation of CKD progression was predicted to slow the time to kidney failure by 6.6 years [dapagliflozin: 25.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 19.0–31.5; standard therapy: 18.5, 95% CI 14.7–23.4] in the DAPA-CKD population. A similar result was observed in the pooled CKD population with an estimated delay of 6.3 years (dapagliflozin: 36.0, 95% CI 31.9–38.3; standard therapy: 29.6, 95% CI 25.5–34.7).

Conclusion

Treatment with dapagliflozin over a lifetime time horizon may considerably delay the mean time to adverse clinical outcomes for patients who would go on to experience them, including those at modest risk of progression.

### Importance of early screening and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^112nhUgK]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Both SGLT-2is and GLP-1 RAs have been shown to reduce major cardiac adverse events. The SGLT-2is dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2D and CKD, whereas ertugliflozin does not (Table 2). The GLP-1 RAs liraglutide, semaglutide (injection), and dulaglutide reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and/or stroke relative to placebo, whereas semaglutide (oral), exenatide, and lixisenatide do not (Table 2).

The ADA recommends that independent of baseline A1C or individualized A1C target, if a patient has heart failure or CKD, then an SGLT-2i with evidence of reducing heart failure and/or CKD progression should be a part of a patient's glucose-lowering regimen as long as the eGFR is adequate for the use of an SGLT-2i. If an SGLT-2i is not tolerated or if the eGFR is less than can be used with an SGLT-2i, then a GLP-1 RA should be used. SGLT-2is and GLP-1 RAs can also be used for the treatment of patients who are unable to use or tolerate metformin. In the KDIGO guidelines, an SGLT2i is recommended for the treatment of patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and if metformin and SGLT2is are not effective or unusable, a long-acting GP-1 RA is recommended.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

14.4 Chronic Kidney Disease

The Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD, NCT03036150) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) and albuminuria [urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 and 5000 mg/g] who were receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximally tolerated, labeled daily dosage of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). The trial excluded patients with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis and patients requiring cytotoxic, immunosuppressive, or immunomodulatory therapies in the preceding 6 months.

The primary objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin 10 mg reduces the incidence of the composite endpoint of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (defined as sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or renal transplant), CV or renal death.

A total of 4304 patients were randomized equally to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo and were followed for a median of 28.5 months. The trial included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 2906) and patients without diabetes (n = 1398). The mean age of the trial population was 62 years and 67% were male. The population was 53% White, 4% Black or African American, and 34% Asian; 25% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. At baseline, mean eGFR was 43 mL/min/1.73 m2, 44% of patients had an eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73m2 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73m2, and 15% of patients had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Median UACR was 950 mg/g. The most common etiologies of CKD were diabetic nephropathy (58%), ischemic/hypertensive nephropathy (16%), and IgA nephropathy (6%). At baseline, 97% of patients were treated with ACEi or ARB. Approximately 44% were taking antiplatelet agents, and 65% were on a statin.

### Efficacy of dapagliflozin by baseline diabetes medications: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD study [^115meWvB]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the benefits of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in CKD trial (DAPA-CKD) varied by background glucose-lowering therapy (GLT).

Research Design and Methods

We randomized 4,304 adults (including 2,906 with type 2 diabetes) with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200–5,000 mg/g to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo once daily (NCT03036150). The primary end point was a composite of ≥ 50% eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney or cardiovascular cause of death. Secondary end points included a kidney composite end point (primary composite end point without cardiovascular death), a cardiovascular composite end point (hospitalized heart failure or cardiovascular death), and all-cause mortality. In this prespecified analysis, we investigated the effects of dapagliflozin on these and other outcomes according to baseline GLT class or number of GLTs.

Results

The effects of dapagliflozin on the primary composite outcome were consistent across GLT classes and according to the number of GLTs (all interaction P > 0.08). Similarly, we found consistent benefit of dapagliflozin compared with placebo on the secondary end points regardless of background GLT class or number of GLTs. The same applied to the rate of decline in the eGFR rate and safety end points. Dapagliflozin reduced the initiation of insulin therapy during follow-up compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.54–0.96; P = 0.025).

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin reduced kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD across baseline GLT class or classes in combination.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dapagliflozin was evaluated in 4304 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the DAPA-CKD trial. Dapagliflozin was also evaluated in 1926 adult patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2in the DAPA-HF trial. The safety profile of dapagliflozin across eGFR subgroups in these studies was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5)].

Dapagliflozin was evaluated in two glycemic control adult trials that included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using dapagliflozin may be more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the trial of adult patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo. Use of DAPAGLIFLOZIN TABLETS for glycemic control in patients without established CV disease or CV risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Efficacy and safety trials with dapagliflozin did not enroll patients with an eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2or on dialysis. Once enrolled in the DAPA-CKD and DELIVER trials, adult patients were not required to discontinue therapy if eGFR fell below 25 mL/min/1.73 m2or if dialysis was initiated. Once enrolled in the DAPA-HF trial, adult patients were not required to discontinue therapy if eGFR fell below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2or if dialysis was initiated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. However, the benefit-risk for the use of dapagliflozin in patients with severe hepatic impairment should be individually assessed since the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin have not been specifically studied in this population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A multinational real-world study on the clinical characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes initiating dapagliflozin in Southern Europe [^117KfD87]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is currently estimated to affect more than 415 million adults globally and, with its increasing prevalence, more than 640 million adults are anticipated to have diabetes by 2040. As a result of hyperglycaemia and other metabolic abnormalities, T2D is associated with various comorbidities that reduce the quality of life, increase disease-related mortality and complicate its management. Indeed, patients with diabetes are at high risk for adverse outcomes due to cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Accordingly, minimizing the risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes has become a new cornerstone in overall management strategies for T2D.

Dapagliflozin is a selective sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) that promotes glucosuria by blocking resorption of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Thanks to the resulting reduction in plasma glucose, SGLT2i, including dapagliflozin, are indicated for the management of T2D. In addition to lowering glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c), SGLT2i also reduce blood pressure and promote weight loss. Four dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have shown favourable cardiovascular effects of SGLT2i, mainly in patients with T2D and established cardiovascular disease, including a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. Furthermore, SGLT2i may also delay the progression of renal disease.

Dialysis and kidney replacement therapy — evidence and regulatory updates are summarized. There is limited evidence to suggest that dapagliflozin is safe to use in persons receiving dialysis, and the US Food and Drug Administration reviewed safety data from patients who had initiated dialysis during DAPA-CKD and concluded that there were no safety signals; following this, the warning that dapagliflozin should be discontinued when dialysis was initiated was removed from the package insert. However, the KDOQI Work Group believes that there is not enough evidence to suggest that these medications are effective in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease, with and without other cardiovascular medications: DAPA-CKD trial [^114WWDuk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background The DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial (NCT03036150) demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease and albuminuria with and without type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine whether baseline cardiovascular medication use modified the dapagliflozin treatment effect. Methods and Results We randomized 4304 adults with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 to 75mL/min per 1.73m 2 and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 200 to 5000mg/g to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo once daily. The primary end point was a composite of ≥ 50% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney or cardiovascular death. Secondary end points included a kidney composite end point (primary composite end point without cardiovascular death), a cardiovascular composite end point (hospitalized heart failure or cardiovascular death), and all-cause mortality. We categorized patients according to baseline cardiovascular medication use/nonuse. Patients were required by protocol to receive a stable (and maximally tolerated) dose of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor. We observed consistent benefits of dapagliflozin relative to placebo, irrespective of baseline use/nonuse of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (98.1%), calcium channel blockers (50.7%), β-adrenergic antagonists (39.0%), diuretics (43.7%), and antithrombotic (47.4%), and lipid-lowering (15.0%) agents. Use of these drugs in combination with dapagliflozin did not increase the number of serious adverse events. Conclusions The safety profile and efficacy of dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular end points in patients with chronic kidney disease were consistent among patients treated and not treated at baseline with a range of cardiovascular medications.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds for SGLT2 inhibitor use — initiation, continuation, and trial enrollment: The guideline specifies a lower limit eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor, but maintains that it is safe to continue until reaching the need for KRT. DAPA-CKD and EMPEROR enrolled patients down to an eGFR of 25 and 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2, respectively. EMPA-KIDNEY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03594110) is enrolling patients down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. It may be appropriate in patients with uACR > 1,000 mg/g who are at high risk for rapid decline in eGFR or have a history of rapid eGFR decline to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, as the DAPA-CKD trial is directly applicable to patients with CKD.

### Effectiveness of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin for kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^116yX1bv]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

No large randomized clinical trial has directly compared empagliflozin with dapagliflozin, leaving their comparative effectiveness regarding kidney outcomes unknown.

Objective

To compare kidney outcomes between initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving antihyperglycemic treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This target trial emulation used nationwide, population-based routinely collected Danish health care data to compare initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in adults with type 2 diabetes who received antihyperglycemic treatment between June 1, 2014, and October 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to August 2024. Persons were followed up until an outcome, emigration, death, 6 years, or December 31, 2021, whichever occurred first.

Exposure

Initiation of empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcomes included acute kidney injury, incident chronic kidney disease (stages G3 to G5 or stage A2 or A3), and progression of chronic kidney disease (≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline). Risks of kidney outcomes were estimated in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses using an Aalen-Johansen estimator that adjusted for 56 potential confounders and considered death as a competing event.

Results

A total of 32 819 individuals who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and 17 464 with dapagliflozin were included (median [IQR] age, 63 [54–71] years; 18 872 female individuals [37.5%]; median [IQR] estimated glomerular filtration rate, 88 [73–104] mL/min/1.73 m2). After weighting, all measured covariates were well balanced between the groups. In intention-to-treat analyses, people who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin exhibited comparable 6-year risks of acute kidney injury (18.2% vs 18.5%; risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.06), chronic kidney disease stages G3 to G5 (11.8% vs 12.1%; risk ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89–1.05), chronic kidney disease stage A2 or A3 (14.8% vs 14.3%; risk ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93–1.15), and progression of chronic kidney disease (5.3% vs 5.7%; risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.56–1.58). The primary analyses were supported by corresponding per-protocol analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this cohort study suggest that people with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with empagliflozin and dapagliflozin had comparable long-term kidney outcomes.

### Effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on proteinuria in non-diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (DIAMOND): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^1151CMWL]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

SGLT2 inhibition decreases albuminuria and reduces the risk of kidney disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. These benefits are unlikely to be mediated by improvements in glycaemic control alone. Therefore, we aimed to examine the kidney effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with proteinuric kidney disease without diabetes.

Methods

DIAMOND was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial done at six hospitals in Canada, Malaysia, and the Netherlands. Eligible participants were adult patients (aged 18–75 years) with chronic kidney disease, without a diagnosis of diabetes, with a 24-h urinary protein excretion greater than 500 mg and less than or equal to 3500 mg and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and who were on stable renin-angiotensin system blockade. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive placebo and then dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or vice versa. Each treatment period lasted 6 weeks with a 6-week washout period in between. Participants, investigators, and study personnel were masked to assignment throughout the trial and analysis. The primary outcome was percentage change from baseline in 24-h proteinuria during dapagliflozin treatment relative to placebo. Secondary outcomes were changes in measured GFR (mGFR; via iohexol clearance), bodyweight, blood pressure, and concentrations of neurohormonal biomarkers. Analyses were done in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03190694.

Findings

Between Nov 22, 2017, and April 5, 2019, 58 patients were screened, of whom 53 (mean age 51 years [SD 13]; 32% women) were randomly assigned (27 received dapagliflozin then placebo and 26 received placebo then dapagliflozin). One patient discontinued during the first treatment period. All patients were included in the analysis. Mean baseline mGFR was 58.3 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (SD 23), median proteinuria was 1110 mg per 24 h (IQR 730–1560), and mean HbA 1c was 5.6% (SD 0.4). The difference in mean proteinuria change from baseline between dapagliflozin and placebo was 0.9% (95% CI -16.6 to 22.1; p = 0.93). Compared with placebo, mGFR was changed with dapagliflozin treatment by -6.6 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (-9.0 to -4.2; p < 0.0001) at week 6. This reduction was fully reversible within 6 weeks after dapagliflozin discontinuation. Compared with placebo, bodyweight was reduced by 1.5 kg (0.03–3.0; p = 0.046) with dapagliflozin; changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and concentrations of neurohormonal biomarkers did not differ significantly between dapagliflozin and placebo treatment. The numbers of patients who had one or more adverse events during dapagliflozin treatment (17 [32%] of 53) and during placebo treatment (13 [25%] of 52) were similar. No hypoglycaemic events were reported and no deaths occurred.

Interpretation

6-week treatment with dapagliflozin did not affect proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease without diabetes, but did induce an acute and reversible decline in mGFR and a reduction in bodyweight. Long-term clinical trials are underway to determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can safely reduce the rate of major clinical kidney outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without diabetes.

### Dapagliflozin and new-onset type 2 diabetes in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure: pooled analysis of the DAPA-CKD and DAPA-HF trials [^111UQ1U2]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease and heart failure are insulin resistant states associated with a high incidence of diabetes. We assessed the effect of dapagliflozin on new-onset type 2 diabetes in a pooled analysis of patient-level data from the DAPA-CKD and DAPA-HF trials.

Methods

This study is a pooled analysis of individual participant data from two phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, clinical trials. Participants with no history of diabetes and HbA 1c less than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) at baseline were included in this pooled analysis. New-onset type 2 diabetes was a prespecified exploratory endpoint in both DAPA-CKD and DAPA-HF trials and is the focus of this analysis. New-onset type 2 diabetes was identified by serial trial measurements of HbA 1c (two consecutive values ≥ 6.5% [≥ 48 mmol/mol]) or following a clinical diagnosis of diabetes between trial visits. Time to new-onset type 2 diabetes was analysed in a Cox proportional Hazards model from random assignment to end of treatment.

Findings

4003 participants (1398 [34.9%] from the DADA-CKD trial and 2605 [65.1%] from the DAPA-HF trial) were included in our analysis: 1995 (49.8%) had received dapagliflozin and 2008 (50.2%) had received placebo. Over a median follow-up of 21.2 months (IQR 16.0 to 25.4), 126 (6.3%) of 2008 patients in the placebo group (event rate 3.9 per 100 patient-years) and 85 (4.3%) of 1995 patients in the dapagliflozin group (event rate 2.6 per 100 patient-years) developed type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 0.67 [95% CI 0.51 to 0.88]; p = 0.0040). There was no heterogeneity between studies (p interaction 0.77) and there was no clear evidence that the effect of dapagliflozin varied in prespecified subgroups including sex, age, glycaemic status, BMI, glomerular filtration rate, systolic blood pressure, and baseline cardiovascular medication use. More than 90% of the participants who developed type 2 diabetes had prediabetes at baseline (HbA 1c 5.7% to 6.4% [39 to 46 mmol/mol]). Mean HbA 1c remained unchanged (placebo-adjusted change in the dapagliflozin group of -0.01% [95% CI -0.03 to 0.01], -0.1 mmol/mol [95% CI -0.3 to 0.1] at 12 months).

Interpretation

Treatment with dapagliflozin reduced the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes in participants with chronic kidney disease and HF without a reduction in HbA 1c.

DISCUSSION

The DAPA-CKD trial has enrolled participants with albuminuria and a wide range of kidney diseases, the majority already receiving RAS blockade therapy. It is one of three large outcome trials (with CREDENCE and EMPA-KIDNEY) assessing the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the progression of CKD with kidney endpoints as the primary outcome. Notably, the study was stopped early following routine review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, who cited overwhelming efficacy.

Unlike CREDENCE, the only SGLT2 inhibitor trial to have reported results to date, the DAPA-CKD trial recruited patients with CKD both with and without T2D and will be the first SGLT2 inhibitor trial to report clinical outcome data in non-diabetic CKD patients. Inclusion of non-diabetic patients with CKD will help to determine whether the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated in CREDENCE also extend to these individuals. Of the 2906 patients with T2D included, the mean duration of diabetes is broadly similar to other DKD studies, reflecting the fact that patients generally develop kidney disease several years after the diagnosis of T2D. All but 3% of participants were receiving ACEi/ARB at the time of enrolment.

### The long-term effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease: a time-to-event analysis [^114cyMAB]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

A common limitation of randomized, controlled clinical trials is that they have a typical follow-up period of up to 4 years, yet patients are often treated over a much longer period in clinical practice. Therefore, despite their large size, the DECLARE-TIMI 58 and DAPA-CKD trials may not fully demonstrate the clinical value of dapagliflozin in treating a chronic, progressive disease. Furthermore, clinical trials are powered to demonstrate risk reduction only over the time horizon of the trial; extrapolating the treatment effect beyond the follow-up period to estimate delayed time to adverse outcomes can provide evidence to support informed decision-making by patients and clinicians, and resource planning for healthcare providers.

The objectives of this study were to quantify the long-term benefits of dapagliflozin extrapolated beyond the time horizon of typical clinical trials, and to determine whether kidney/cardiovascular benefits are observed in early, intermediate and advanced stages of CKD using patient level data from the DAPA-CKD and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials.

### Correlates and consequences of an acute change in eGFR in response to the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with CKD [^114piVL4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Dapagliflozin reduces kidney failure risk in patients with CKD but can result in a reversible acute reduction in eGFR upon treatment initiation. Determinants of this eGFR reduction and its associations with efficacy and safety outcomes are unknown.

Methods

The DAPA-CKD trial randomized 4304 adults with CKD and albuminuria to once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo, added to standard care. We prespecified an analysis comparing the effects of dapagliflozin among patients who experienced relative reductions in eGFR (> 10% or > 0%-10%) or an increase in eGFR from baseline to 2 weeks and assessed long-term efficacy and safety thereafter.

Results

A total of 4157 (96.6%) patients had eGFR data available at baseline and at 2 weeks. In the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, 1026 (49.4%) and 494 (23.7%), respectively, experienced an acute reduction in eGFR > 10%. Among patients receiving dapagliflozin, those with an acute reduction in eGFR > 10% experienced a long-term eGFR decline of -1.58 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year compared with -2.44 and -2.48 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year among those experiencing a less pronounced reduction or increase in eGFR, respectively (P -interaction = 0.05). In the placebo group, long-term eGFR decline was -3.27, -3.84, and -3.77 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year for acute eGFR reduction subgroups of > 10%, > 0%-10%, or increase in eGFR (P -interaction = 0.48). Rates of serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest in patients randomized to dapagliflozin were unrelated to the acute eGFR change.

Conclusions

Among patients with CKD and albuminuria treated with dapagliflozin, an acute reduction in eGFR (from baseline to 2 weeks) is not associated with higher rates of CKD progression.

### Rationale and design of the renal lifecycle trial assessing the effect of dapagliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes in severe chronic kidney disease [^113UkB1E]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Several clinical trials have shown beneficial effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on kidney disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some subgroups of patients with CKD have been excluded from participation in these trials, such as patients with severely impaired kidney function, patients on dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients.

Methods

The Renal Lifecycle trial (NCT05374291) is a pragmatic, international, multicenter, investigator-initiated, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial planned to enroll approximately 1500 patients with 1) an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 25 ml/min/1.73m2, 2) on hemo- or peritoneal dialysis 3) a kidney transplant and an eGFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73m2, who will be randomized 1:1 to receive either dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo.

Results

The primary endpoint is a composite of heart failure hospitalization, all-cause mortality or, for those not on dialysis, kidney failure (start of dialysis longer than 1 month, receiving a kidney transplantation or death due to kidney failure). The trial is event-driven, indicating that it will end after 468 first primary endpoint events have occurred with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming an annual 12.5% incidence of the primary outcome. The secondary endpoints include a separate analysis of the incidence of each component of the primary endpoint in the overall trial population as well as the incidence of the combined primary endpoint in each of the three subgroups of patients. Other (exploratory) endpoints are efficacy, safety, tolerability, health-related quality of life and cognition.

Conclusion

The Renal Lifecycle trial aims to investigate the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin compared to placebo on the incidence of kidney failure, heart failure, mortality, and safety in three subgroups of patients with advanced CKD.

Model outcomes

The modelled endpoints were all-cause mortality; kidney failure (sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2, initiation of chronic dialysis treatment or receipt of kidney transplant), sustained decline in kidney function (≥ 40% decline in eGFR compared with baseline) and hospitalization for heart failure. The primary definition of sustained kidney function decline differed between the two trials (DAPA-CKD: ≥ 50% eGFR decline; DECLARE-TIMI 58: ≥ 40% eGFR decline); the present analysis was consequently restricted to the ≥ 40% eGFR decline definition, since only this definition was available consistently across both datasets. The primary outcome for each endpoint was the mean time-to-event in years, with delay defined as the difference in means. Incidence of all outcomes are presented graphically over time, with survival curves plotted for expected incidence over the lifetime of a cohort of 1000 patients.

Table 3
Selected clinical trials of SGLT2i and SGLT1/2i, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin

The Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial was a seminal study of SGLT2i in DKD with a dedicated primary composite kidney outcome.CREDENCE enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes, eGFR of 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300–5000 mg/g. The prespecified enrollment strategy aimed to include at least 60% of patients with eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a population at higher risk of ESKD than previously studied. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, canagliflozin reduced the primary composite kidney endpoint by 31%, with a noteworthy benefit in a secondary heart failure outcome. The trial was prematurely discontinued after 2.6 years due to overwhelming efficacy. CREDENCE demonstrated kidney benefits independent of baseline HbA1c, extent of HbA1c reduction, and stage of CKD, leading to the first kidney-related indication for SGLT2i by the US FDA in 2019.

There is evolving information about the use of SGLT2i among patients with eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and non-DKD. Dapagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease included 4304 participants, two-thirds with diabetes, with eGFR of 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite risk of ≥ 50% eGFR decline, ESKD, and renal or cardiovascular death by 39%. In subgroup analyses, the benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent regardless of HbA1c, eGFR, or presence of diabetes. The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) is an ongoing study that will report the effect of empagliflozin on kidney progression or cardiovascular (CV) death.EMPA-KIDNEY will deliver important information among patients with or without diabetes, with or without albuminuria, and eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Results

As previously described,4304 adults with and without type 2 diabetes with baseline eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio of 200 to 5000 mg/g were randomized to either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo once daily with a median follow‐up of 2.4 years. Table 1 shows selected demographic and clinical characteristics of participants in each of the randomized groups (dapagliflozin versus placebo) stratified by diabetes status, including baseline use/nonuse of cardiovascular medications.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics of Participants Stratified by Diabetes Status at Baseline (All Randomized Participants)

Cardiovascular medications were generally used more frequently in patients with diabetes, but there were no material differences in the proportion of patients using cardiovascular medications by randomized group. Of the 4304 randomized participants, 4224 (98.1%) were receiving a RAAS inhibitor at baseline, with roughly twice as many patients treated with ARBs as compared with ACE inhibitors. Among the 4296 (99.9%) participants with available data on baseline RAAS inhibitor dose, 1231 (28.6%), 1867 (43.5%), and 1068 (24.8%) were prescribed 100% (or more), 50 to < 100%, and < 50% of the maximum labeled antihypertensive dose, respectively, and 130 (3.0%) were not prescribed RAAS inhibitors.

### Dapagliflozin and metformin hydrochloride (Xigduo) [^112dKpUz]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Initiation of XIGDUO XR is not recommended in patients with an eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end‑stage renal disease [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].

Dapagliflozin

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in 4304 adult patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2) in the DAPA-CKD trial. Dapagliflozin 10 mg was also evaluated in 1926 adult patients with an eGFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the DAPA-HF trial. The safety profile of dapagliflozin across eGFR subgroups was consistent with the known safety profile [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.4 and 14.5)].

Dapagliflozin 10 mg was evaluated in two glycemic control trials that included adult patients with moderate renal impairment (an eGFR of 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and an eGFR of 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Patients with diabetes and renal impairment using dapagliflozin 10 mg are more likely to experience hypotension and may be at higher risk for acute kidney injury secondary to volume depletion. In the trial of adult patients with an eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 13 patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced bone fractures compared to none receiving placebo. Use of dapagliflozin 10 mg for glycemic control in patients without established CV disease or CV risk factors is not recommended when eGFR is less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Metformin HCl

Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. XIGDUO XR is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Barriers to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease: a real-world study [^1139VwLZ]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trends in clinical characteristics for SGLT2i have also demonstrated potential impacts of clinical practice guidelines or formulary information on rates of SGLT2i initiation. In fact, the presence of HF and CAD significantly increased the odds of SGLT2i initiation. Drug labeling for eGFR to start SGLT2i also influenced the rise in prescription. In Korea, SGLT2i was introduced in 2014 and approved for those with eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m 2. Empagliflozin 10 mg and dapagliflozin were approved in 2015 and 2019, respectively, for those with eGFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73m 2. Hence, we can notice the rise of SGLT2i prescriptions in G3 category recently. Notably, safety and efficacy results from the DAPA-CKD trial can broaden the population of patients eligible for SGLT2i to those in the upper range of stage 4 CKD. Physicians should identify patients with T2D who may benefit from renal function protection by using SGLT2i.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

In the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) trial, treatment of patients with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D) with dapagliflozin was associated with significant reductions to the incidence of CKD progression, hospitalization for heart failure and death from any cause, leading to its approval for use in patients with CKD regardless of T2D status.
The Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58 (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial estimated the effect of dapagliflozin in patients with T2D with or at risk of atherosclerotic disease. In this population, dapagliflozin significantly reduced the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure and the renal composite endpoint.
Randomized, controlled clinical trials are typically conducted over a follow-up period of up to 4 years, which may not fully demonstrate the full clinical value in the treatment of chronic, progressive diseases.

This study adds:

Using patient-level data from the DAPA-CKD trial, we estimate that long-term treatment with dapagliflozin may considerably delay the time to adverse cardio-renal outcomes and death from any cause. Notably, we estimated delayed CKD progression through treatment with dapagliflozin to slow the time to kidney failure by 6.6 years.
By forming a pooled CKD population with the addition of a subpopulation of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial with CKD at baseline, we estimated this larger CKD cohort, including patients with less advanced CKD than the DAPA-CKD cohort, to experience comparable delays in kidney-related outcomes and hospitalization for heart failure.

Potential impact:

Further characterization of treatment benefits beyond what is demonstrated in clinical trials can assist informed decision making by healthcare providers and patients.
Our analysis suggests that long-term treatment with dapagliflozin has the potential to substantively delay the time to adverse outcomes including kidney failure, which could have beneficial consequences for healthcare service delivery.
A delay in reaching kidney failure could substantially improve the health-related quality of life of patients and additional life years could be spent without the need for kidney replacement therapies.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor trials and impact at lower eGFR: Inclusion thresholds were eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in DAPA-CKD and ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in EMPA-Kidney; the primary composite kidney outcome — end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or ≥ 40% decline from baseline, or renal or cardiovascular death — was reduced by 28% (95% CI, 18%-36%). In EMPA-Kidney, of 6,609 participants, 34.5% had an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and this stratum showed a 27% (95% CI, 14%-38%) reduction, and post hoc DAPA-CKD analyses in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a 27% (95% CI, 2%-47%) reduction. Expanding the lower limit at which an SGLT2 inhibitor may be initiated provides additional options for treatment to more than 750,000 US adults living with stage 4 CKD, 39% of whom have diabetes.

### Dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116uf9ia]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study DAPA-CKD was published by Hiddo J L Heerspink and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the DAPA-CKD study, the trial question was: what is the role of dapagliflozin in patients with CKD? In the DAPA-CKD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DAPA-CKD study, the population was: 4304 patients (1425 female, 2879 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with CKD. The key exclusion criteria were documented diagnosis of T1DM; polycystic kidney disease; lupus nephritis, or ANCA-associated vasculitis; receipt of immunotherapy for kidney disease within 6 months. In the DAPA-CKD study, the interventions were: n = 2152 dapagliflozin (10 mg once daily) n = 2152 placebo (matching placebo once daily). In the DAPA-CKD study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in composite outcome of sustained decline in the eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes (9.2% vs. 14.5%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72). In the DAPA-CKD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in composite outcome of sustained decline in the eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal causes (6.6% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.68) Significant decrease in composite outcome of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for HF (4.6% vs. 6.4%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.92) Significant decrease in death from any cause (4.7% vs. 6.8%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.88). In the DAPA-CKD study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in renal-related adverse event, amputation, fracture. significant difference in serious adverse event (29.5% vs. 33.9%). In the DAPA-CKD study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with CKD, dapagliflozin was superior to placebo with respect to the composite outcome of sustained decline in the eGFR of ≥ 50%, end-stage kidney disease, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes.

### Dapagliflozin, advanced chronic kidney disease, and mortality: new insights from the DAPA-CKD trial [^113PKZzB]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients without diabetes, non-cardiovascular death occurred more often than cardiovascular death (54% vs. 30%), a result not observed in subjects with diabetes (38% vs. 39%), underscoring epidemiological data showing that diabetes is an additional cardiovascular risk promoter in CKD patients.DAPA-CKD enrolled two-thirds of all patients with diabetes and one-third without a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, but dapagliflozin led to a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in both subgroups. The second important message is therefore that in DAPA-CKD, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, a therapy originally developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, was life-saving in all CKD patients — irrespective of their diabetes status.

In a very large cohort study on non-cardiovascular mortality in advancing CKD, the relative importance of malignancy diminished, whereas infectious and diabetic complications increasingly contributed to deaths. While these Canadian data mostly have been reproduced in subsequent studies, it is important to note that such studies are all based on ICD-9 or -10 codes, and causes of death have hardly ever been adjudicated in an independent fashion. The more important are the adjudicated DAPA-CKD non-cardiovascular deaths (41% of the overall mortality). The beneficial effect of dapagliflozin on deaths due to infections raises the hypothesis that SGLT2 inhibitors may exhibit modulatory effects on inflammatory processes and immune function beyond the cardiovascular system and the kidney.

A limitation of the present post-hoc analysis of the DAPA-CKD trial is that the findings are based on a relatively low number of events, in particular in non-diabetic patients, as 80% of deaths were clustered in the subgroup with diabetes. Thus, in non-diabetic patients in particular, the effects of an SGLT2 inhibitor on infection- or cancer-related mortality can at best be hypothesis generating but deserve further evaluation in clinical studies and experimental approaches. While the authors propose potential mechanisms by which dapagliflozin or, more probably, SGLT2 inhibitors in general might contribute to such benefits, there is a significant likelihood for chance findings given the low event rates. Finally, as with all large clinical trials, a common limitation is that 'healthier' patients tend to be included, which renders an extrapolation to all patients with advanced CKD difficult. Nevertheless, we eagerly await subgroup analyses of particular, more homogeneous, DAPA-CKD patients, such as the 270 patients with IgA nephropathy.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease, with and without other cardiovascular medications: DAPA-CKD trial [^113LztJ5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

In the DAPA‐CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease)) trial, the sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin reduced the risk of major kidney and cardiovascular events and prolonged survival in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with and without type 2 diabetes. Similar results had been observed in patients with type 2 diabetes in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial, in which canagliflozin significantly reduced the risks of progressive kidney disease and major cardiovascular events but not cardiovascular mortality. Previous studies with these and other SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits (EMPA‐REG (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome), DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 58), and CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study).

Patients included in these and other cardiovascular trials are typically treated with a variety of concomitant medications, many of which are indicated either for control of hypertension or for prevention or treatment of other cardiovascular conditions (eg, hypercholesterolemia, coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation). In DAPA‐CKD and other trials, maximally tolerated doses of renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors were required by protocol.

The DAPA‐CKD trial required that all patients be treated with standard of care (regional guideline–concordant) therapies for kidney, cardiovascular, and other conditions unless contraindicated. The protocol itself did not mandate specific drugs or doses, with the exception of the RAAS inhibitors, as previously described.

In this prespecified analysis of the DAPA‐CKD trial, we aimed to examine whether baseline use of cardiovascular medications modified the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular end points and on safety in patients with CKD and albuminuria.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114xfYwD]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m². A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

UPDATED UNITED KINGDOM GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO KIDNEY INDICATIONS OF SGLT2i

The guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) focused on drug treatment of T2DM, specifically on 'anti-hyperglycaemic drugs' was published in February 2022. For SGLT2i, the target population are patients with T2DM and one other disease: HF, ASCVD, or people at risk for development cardiovascular disease. Also, SGLT2i are suggested as anti-hyperglycaemic drug if people have contraindication for Metformin in chronic HF, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or in people at risk for development cardiovascular disease. Perhaps more importantly, in CKD, a NICE update now recommends use of dapagliflozin, in addition to RASi, in patients with T2DM, or patients with a uACR of 22.6 mg/mol or more (irrespective of diabetes). This is consistent with the UK Kidney Association recommendations, with the exception that there is an effort to simplify the summary of where there is clear evidence for use of an SGLT2i, suggesting any member of the SGLT2i class could be used in CKD. To facilitate implementation, the UK Kidney Association guideline also has a full lay summary and template patient information leaflets. A pragmatic algorithm for using SGLT2i across the range of indications is proposed in Fig. 2.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in stage 4 chronic kidney disease [^11732Jtf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin significantly reduced risk of kidney failure and prolonged survival in patients with CKD with or without type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Adults with eGFR of 25–75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 200–5000 mg/g had been randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/d or placebo. Here, we conducted a prespecified analysis of dapagliflozin's effects in patients with stage 4 CKD (eGFR,30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) at baseline. The primary end point was a composite of time to ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, ESKD, or kidney or cardiovascular death. Secondary end points were a kidney composite (same as the primary end point but without cardiovascular death), a composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause death.

Results

A total of 293 participants with stage 4 CKD received dapagliflozin and 331 received placebo. Patients with stage 4 CKD randomized to dapagliflozin experienced a 27% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: -2 to 47%) reduction in the primary composite endpoint, and 29% (-2 to 51%), 17% (-53 to 55%), and 32% (-21 to 61%) reductions in the kidney, cardiovascular and mortality endpoints, respectively, relative to placebo. Interaction P-values were 0.22, 0.13, 0.63, and 0.95, respectively, comparing CKD stages 4 versus 2/3. The eGFR slope declined by 2.15 and 3.38 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 per year in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.005). Patients treated with dapagliflozin or placebo had similar rates of serious adverse events and adverse events of interest.

Conclusions

Among patients with stage 4 CKD and albuminuria, the effects of dapagliflozin were consistent with those observed in the DAPA-CKD trial overall, with no evidence of increased risks.

### The long-term effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease: a time-to-event analysis [^112Gek3p]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Analysis populations

The analysis considered two populations: the DAPA-CKD population and a pooled CKD population, comprising both the DAPA-CKD population and a subset of the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial population that met the criteria for a CKD diagnosis at baseline. The analysed trials were subject to ethical review and trial participants provided written informed consent as recorded in the associated publications.

The DAPA-CKD population reflected the eligibility criteria for the DAPA-CKD trial, namely patients with or without T2D, with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) 200–5000 mg/g; details of the DAPA-CKD study design and patient characteristics have previously been published. The DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial did not include CKD diagnosis as part of its inclusion or exclusion criteria, but baseline trial data were used to inform the risk of CKD according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or UACR > 30 mg/g). Filtering by these criteria yielded a subset of the trial population with CKD, defined as DECLARE CKD (n = 5969). The DECLARE CKD population consisted of patients with T2D who typically had higher eGFR levels at baseline and lower levels of albuminuria than patients in the DAPA-CKD trial (Fig. 1), thus representing patients with less advanced CKD relative to the DAPA-CKD population. The summary baseline characteristics for the analysis populations are detailed in Table 1.

### Effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease across the spectrum of age and by sex [^111vq2e5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin reduces the risk of progressive kidney disease and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease, with and without type 2 diabetes. Whether its effects are uniform across the spectrum of age and among men and women is unknown.

Objective

We performed a pre-specified analysis in DAPA-CKD to evaluate efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to baseline age and sex.

Design

Prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Participants

A total of 4304 adults with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2; urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 200–5000 mg/g) with and without type 2 diabetes.

Intervention

Dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo once daily.

Main Measures

Primary endpoint was a composite of ≥ 50% sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney or cardiovascular death. Secondary endpoints included kidney composite endpoint (same as primary composite endpoint but without cardiovascular death), cardiovascular composite endpoint (hospitalized heart failure or cardiovascular death), and all-cause mortality.

Key Results

Median follow-up was 2.4 years. Absolute risks of cardiovascular composite endpoint and all-cause mortality were higher in older patients. Absolute risk of kidney composite endpoint was highest in patients < 50 years (10.7 and 6.2 per 100 patient-years in the placebo and dapagliflozin groups, respectively) and lowest in patients ≥ 80 years (3.0 and 1.2 per 100 patient-years in the placebo and dapagliflozin groups, respectively). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of the effects of dapagliflozin on the primary or secondary endpoints based on age or sex. Neither age nor sex modified the effects of dapagliflozin on total or chronic eGFR slope.

Conclusions

Dapagliflozin reduced the risks of mortality, cardiovascular events, and CKD progression in older patients, including in septuagenarians and octogenarians who comprised 25% of participants. Ageism and/or therapeutic nihilism should not discourage the use of dapagliflozin in older women and men who are likely to experience considerable benefit.

### Albuminuria-lowering effect of dapagliflozin alone and in combination with saxagliptin and effect of dapagliflozin and saxagliptin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (DELIGHT): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114kJyz9]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Background

In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose control can be renoprotective and albuminuria-lowering treatments can slow the deterioration of kidney function. We assessed the albuminuria-lowering effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with and without the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor saxagliptin, and the effect of dapagliflozin-saxagliptin on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (DELIGHT), we enrolled patients at 116 research centres in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, and the United States. We included patients with a known history of type 2 diabetes, increased albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 30–3500 mg/g), an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25–75 mL/min per 1.73 m 2, and an HbA 1c of 7.0–11.0% (53–97 mmol/mol), who had been receiving stable doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy and glucose-lowering treatment for at least 12 weeks. After a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1; via an interactive voice-web response system) to receive dapagliflozin (10 mg) only, dapagliflozin (10 mg) and saxagliptin (2.5 mg), or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks. Primary endpoints were change from baseline in UACR (dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin-saxagliptin groups) and HbA 1c (dapagliflozin-saxagliptin group) at week 24 in all randomly allocated patients with available data (full analysis set). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02547935 and is completed.

Findings

The study took place between July 14, 2015, and May 18, 2018. 1187 patients were screened, of whom 461 were randomly assigned: 145 to the dapagliflozin group, 155 to the dapagliflozin-saxagliptin group, and 148 to the placebo group (13 patients were excluded because of data integrity issues). Dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin-saxagliptin reduced UACR versus placebo throughout the study period. At week 24, the difference (vs placebo; n = 134 patients with available data) in mean UACR change from baseline was -21.0% (95% CI -34.1 to -5.2; p = 0.011) for dapagliflozin (n = 132) and -38.0% (-48.2 to -25.8; p < 0.0001) for dapagliflozin-saxagliptin (n = 139). HbA 1c was reduced in the dapagliflozin-saxagliptin group (n = 137) compared with the placebo group (n = 118) at week 24 (-0.58% [-0.80 to -0.37; p < 0.0001]). The numbers of patients with adverse events (79 [54%] in the dapagliflozin group, 104 [68%] in the dapagliflozin-saxagliptin group, and 81 [55%] in the placebo group) or serious adverse events (12 [8%], 12 [8%], and 16 [11%], respectively) were similar across groups. There were no new drug-related safety signals.

Interpretation

Dapagliflozin with or without saxagliptin, given in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment, is a potentially attractive option to slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease: a pre-specified analysis from the DAPA-CKD randomized controlled trial [^1147DdXB]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary composite endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a sustained decline in eGFR of at least 50%, onset of end-stage kidney disease, or death from kidney or cardiovascular causes. Kidney death was defined as death due to end-stage kidney disease where dialysis treatment was deliberately withheld (dialysis was not started or discontinued) for any reason. Secondary outcomes were the time to: a kidney specific composite outcome, which included the same components as the primary outcome except cardiovascular death; a composite cardiovascular endpoint defined as hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death; and death from any cause (all-cause mortality).

The outcome of this pre-specified analysis was mortality. All deaths were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee using rigorous outcome definitions. All mortality outcomes were sub-classified as cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular, or undetermined primary cause of death. Categories and definitions of cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular death are reported in the Supplementary material online, Appendix. Undetermined cause of death refers to a death not attributable to a cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular cause due to the lack of information or insufficient supporting information to assign the cause of death. For the purpose of the primary efficacy assessment, undetermined causes of death were classified as cardiovascular death.

3.4 Exploratory endpoints

The adjusted proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7% (95% CI) at 24 weeks (LOCF) was similar between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (12.1% [7.4, 19.1] vs 8.3% [4.7, 14.2], respectively; P = 0.209).

Dapagliflozin did not reduce mean percent changes from baseline in UACR at Week 24 in the overall population (difference vs placebo [95% CI], 8.0% [−14.4, 36.3]; P = 0.513) (Figure S2 A). However, in patients with baseline UACR ≥ 30 mg/g, mean percent reductions from baseline in UACR were observed with dapagliflozin relative to placebo at Week 4 (difference [95% CI], −30.7% [−47.3, −8.9]; P = 0.009) and at Week 12 (difference [95% CI], −41.7% [−57.1, −21.0]; P < 0.001). Although the mean percent reductions from baseline in UACR were maintained from Week 12 to Week 24 with dapagliflozin, the difference vs placebo at Week 24 was not significant (−14.0% [−42.3, 28.0]; P = 0.454) (Figure S2 B), because of a decrease in UACR from Week 12 to Week 24 in the placebo group. Dapagliflozin was associated with significant reductions in fasting serum uric acid compared with placebo at Week 24 (LOCF; adjusted mean changes from baseline [95% CI], −11.9 μmol/L [−32.1, 8.3] vs 13.0 μmol/L [−6.8, 32.8]; difference [95% CI], −24.9 [−40.7, −9.0]; P = 0.002).

The number of patients receiving rescue medication after failing to maintain adequate glycaemic control during the 24‐week treatment period was similar between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (8 [5.0%] vs 10 [6.2%], respectively; difference [95% CI], −1.2 [−6.2, 3.9]; P = 0.809).

### Effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease, with and without other cardiovascular medications: DAPA-CKD trial [^115Feekh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures

Participants were randomly assigned to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo, in accordance with the sequestered, fixed‐randomization schedule, with the use of balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 1:1 ratio of the 2 regimens. Randomization was stratified by diabetes status and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (≤ or > 1000 mg/g). We calculated eGFR using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration and incorporated results from the equation as originally defined, including a term for self‐reported race (Black versus non‐Black race). Recruitment of patients with eGFR 60 to 75 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 was limited to no more than 10% of trial participants. Participants and all study personnel (except the Independent Data Monitoring Committee) were masked to treatment allocation.

After randomization, in‐person study visits were performed after 2 weeks, 2, 4, and 8 months, and at 4‐month intervals thereafter. At each follow‐up visit, study personnel recorded vital signs, obtained blood and urine samples, and recorded information on potential study end points, adverse events, concomitant therapies, and study drug adherence.

End Points

The primary composite end point was time to ≥ 50% decline in eGFR (confirmed by a second serum creatinine measurement after at least 28 days), onset of kidney failure (defined as maintenance dialysis for at least 28 days, kidney transplantation, or eGFR < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 confirmed by a second measurement after at least 28 days), or death from a kidney or cardiovascular cause. Secondary end points were time to (1) a composite kidney end point of ≥ 50% sustained decline in eGFR, kidney failure, or death from kidney disease; (2) a composite cardiovascular end point defined as hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death; and (3) death from any cause. We also prespecified change in eGFR slope as an exploratory efficacy end point. All efficacy end points were adjudicated by a masked, independent Clinical Events Committee, except for the quantitative assessments of eGFR, which were obtained from our central laboratory.

### The dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) trial: baseline characteristics [^115qD6u3]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD; NCT03036150) trial was designed to assess the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular events in participants with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). This analysis reports the baseline characteristics of those recruited, comparing them with those enrolled in other trials.

Methods

In DAPA-CKD, 4304 participants with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 200mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 and 75mL/min/1.73m2 were randomized to dapagliflozin 10mg once daily or placebo. Mean eGFR was 43.1mL/min/1.73m2 and median UACR was 949mg/g (108mg/mmol).

Results

Overall, 2906 participants (68%) had a diagnosis of T2D and of these, 396 had CKD ascribed to a cause other than diabetes. The most common causes of CKD after diabetes (n = 2510) were ischaemic/hypertensive nephropathy (n = 687) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 695), of which immunoglobulin A nephropathy (n = 270) was the most common. A total of 4174 participants (97%) were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 1882 (43.7%) diuretics, 229 (5.3%) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and 122 (2.8%) glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. In contrast to the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE), the DAPA-CKD trial enrolled participants with CKD due to diabetes and to causes other than diabetes. The mean eGFR of participants in the DAPA-CKD trial was 13.1mL/min/1.73m2 lower than in CREDENCE, similar to that in the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in DKD (FIDELIO-DKD) trial and the Study Of diabetic Nephropathy with AtRasentan (SONAR).

Conclusions

Participants with a wide range of underlying kidney diseases receiving renin-angiotensin system blocking therapy have been enrolled in the DAPA-CKD trial. The trial will examine the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in participants with CKD Stages 2–4 and increased albuminuria, with and without T2D.

Outcome definitions and event adjudication

Efficacy outcomes

The primary outcome for the evaluation of the effect of dapagliflozin on delaying the progression of renal disease is the time to the first occurrence of any of the following components of the composite renal endpoint: ≥ 50% eGFR decline (confirmed by a second serum creatinine measurement at least 28 days later), the onset of ESRD or renal or cardiovascular death (Table 2). Secondary and exploratory endpoints are listed in Table 2. A blinded and independent event adjudication committee (EAC) consisting of nephrologists, cardiologists and neurologists will adjudicate the primary and secondary endpoints, except for the sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline and sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (which will be ascertained from central laboratory measurements).

Table 2
Primary, secondary, exploratory and safety endpoints of DAPA-CKD

ESRD is defined as the need for maintenance dialysis (peritoneal or haemodialysis) for at least 28 days and renal transplantation or sustained eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for at least 28 days. Renal death is defined as death due to ESRD when dialysis treatment was deliberately withheld (dialysis was not started or discontinued) for any reason. The 28-day time frame is included in the definition of the ESRD endpoint definition to avoid misclassification of acute kidney injury (AKI) as ESRD. If the dialysis treatment was stopped before Day 28 due to death, futility or patient electing to stop dialysis, then the EAC will decide whether or not the need for dialysis was likely to be permanent and meets the ESRD criteria.

The EAC will also be responsible for adjudicating possible myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke and transient ischaemic attack.

Safety outcomes

Selected adverse event data are being collected, given the extensive prior experience with dapagliflozin. Only serious adverse events and adverse events of interest or leading to premature study drug discontinuation, study drug interruption or dose reduction are recorded. Adverse events of interest include volume depletion, renal events, major hypoglycaemia, fractures, potential diabetic ketoacidosis, adverse events leading to amputations or adverse events leading to an increased risk of lower limb amputations.

Background medication

Efforts are being made to maintain patients on their stable optimized dose of ACEi or ARB for the duration of the trial. Management of blood pressure, lipids and glucose and the use of other essential therapies is left to the discretion of the investigator, in keeping with local clinical practice and guidelines.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^116mgmQj]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The excellent safety profile of SGLT-2 inhibition in people with CKD without DM has been established in nearly 5000 such people from DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated beneficial effects across the spectrum of eGFR in terms of progression of kidney disease in people with and without diabetes (Fig. 5). Furthermore, EMPA-KIDNEY also showed that among people without albuminuria rate of kidney function decline (chronic eGFR slope) was reduced by 0.78 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year in participants with A1 levels of albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) to a rate of -0.11 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year, and by 1.20 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year in participants with A2 levels (30–299 mg/g; Fig. 3). Such absolute benefits would be predicted to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in progression of kidney disease, even among people with low albuminuria at baseline. Among those with low levels of albuminuria and low eGFR at initiation, such effects on eGFR decline could translate into delay in the onset of kidney failure if used over a period of years. Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to reduce the risk of AKI and cardiovascular risk, as well as hospitalisations from any cause. Given the clear magnitude of benefit of SGLT-2 inhibition in this population and the reassuring safety profile, we provide a grade 1 Recommendation for this statement. However, at present only EMPA-KIDNEY provides direct evidence in this population, with further supporting evidence obtained from eGFR slopes of the trials in heart failure (i.e.g.rade B level of evidence). Cost-effective analyses in this group would provide valuable additional information.
3 We suggest clinicians consider initiating SGLT-2 inhibition in people with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 to slow progression of kidney disease (Grade 2B)

### SGLT2 inhibitors to slow chronic kidney disease progression: a review [^1147TWEn]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

One in seven Americans is at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). For decades, the only treatment proven to slow progression of CKD was the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. Based on promising secondary kidney outcomes in the cardiovascular outcome trials with sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, kidney outcome trials in patients with CKD were published for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of PubMed using the MeSH terms "Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors" and "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic" and looking for clinical trials, meta-analyses, or randomized controlled trials in humans between 2015 and 2023.

Findings

Primary and secondary outcomes from CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation), DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease), and EMPA-KIDNEY (Empagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease) are described along with complete descriptions of the patient populations studied.

Implications

This review describes the role of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors in slowing the progression of CKD, describes guideline changes that have occurred because of these data, and provides information on how these agents may be used clinically.

The main adverse effect of RAS inhibitor therapy is hyperkalemia, particularly in the advanced stages of disease. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of 20 studies covering 47,122 participants reported that hyperkalemia is twice as common (risk ratio 2.03; 95% CI 1.67–2.48) in participants on drugs that act on the RAS compared with the control group. In most individuals, the clinical benefit of RAS inhibition outweighs the risk of hyperkalemia. Moreover, the risk can be managed without the need to discontinue therapy with RAS inhibitors by using strategies such as reducing potassium intake or prescribing loop diuretics and potassium binders, and the risk of hyperkalemia is lower in people on SGLT2 inhibitors.

SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose and sodium reabsorption by kidney proximal tubular cells, by their action on SGLT2, a sodium‐coupled glucose transporter, which is upregulated in diabetes.

Data from randomized controlled trials (CREDENCE, SCORED, DAPA‐CKD, and EMPA‐KIDNEY) demonstrate improvements in cardiorenal outcomes following SGLT2‐inhibitor treatment in diabetic kidney disease (and non‐diabetic CKD).

CREDENCE (NCT02065791) was a double‐blind, randomized trial evaluating the effects of canagliflozin on kidney and CV outcomes in participants with T2D and albuminuric CKD who were randomized to receive canagliflozin or placebo in addition to maximally tolerated/clinically appropriate RAS blockade. The primary endpoint was a composite kidney outcome, including end‐stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained eGFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from kidney or CV causes. In participants receiving canagliflozin, the relative risk of the composite kidney outcome was 30% lower compared with the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient‐years, respectively (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.59–0.82). The risk of CV death, MI, or stroke was also lowered (HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.67–0.95). In participants with a history of CVD, the relative risk of the composite kidney outcome was 30% lower compared with the placebo group (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56–0.88). The event rates per 1000 patient‐years were 46.8 and 65.1 in the canagliflozin and placebo arm, respectively.

### Effects of dapagliflozin on mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease: a pre-specified analysis from the DAPA-CKD randomized controlled trial [^1122SrUm]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The reduction in all-cause mortality with dapagliflozin in our trial was achieved on top of guideline-recommended standard of care including optimal blood pressure management with ACEi or ARBs, which have not been shown to prolong survival in patients with CKD. It is possible that the observed effects of dapagliflozin on non-cardiovascular death may be related to its benefits on cardiovascular and kidney protection, with preserved cardiorenal function providing better resilience under strain from severe illness and intercurrent events, and thereby leading to improved survival. Furthermore, dapagliflozin reduced the risks of end-stage kidney disease, a condition which is known to be associated with higher cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality rates.

The effect size of dapagliflozin on cardiovascular death in the DAPA-CKD trial was generally similar to that observed in two other clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with Type 2 diabetes and CKD (CREDENCE and SCORED). Neither of these trials were designed and powered to assess effects of SGLT2 inhibition on cardiovascular death, and the relative risk reductions were not statistically significant in either trial. However, when meta-analysed, SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of cardiovascular death by 16% (HR [95% CI] 0.84 [0.73, 0.97]) with no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.67; I 2 for heterogeneity 0.0%; Figure 5). This finding suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors prevent cardiovascular death in patients with CKD. Although there was no effect of canagliflozin or sotagliflozin on non-cardiovascular deaths, in the CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin also reduced the incidence of death due to infections, which is consistent with our findings. Reasons for contrasting effects on non-cardiovascular death across the three trials are unknown but may relate to differences in patient population since we included patients without diabetes, who are more likely to die of non-cardiovascular causes. Furthermore, we enrolled patients with lower eGFR compared to CREDENCE (25–75 vs. 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2).SCORED exclusively enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk factors who are more likely to die of cardiovascular causes. A history of cardiovascular disease was not an inclusion criterion in DAPA-CKD. Indeed, while cardiovascular death event rates were comparable between DAPA-CKD and CREDENCE, the cardiovascular death rate was higher in SCORED while the non-cardiovascular death rate was somewhat higher in DAPA-CKD. There were also differences in the design of the trials, such as the possibility to continue study medication when dialysis was initiated in DAPA-CKD.

### The dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) trial: baseline characteristics [^115WZVaM]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD; NCT03036150) trial was designed to assess the effect of the sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular events in participants with CKD with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). This analysis reports the baseline characteristics of those recruited, comparing them with those enrolled in other trials.

Methods

In DAPA-CKD, 4304 participants with a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 200 mg/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 and 75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were randomized to dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily or placebo. Mean eGFR was 43.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and median UACR was 949 mg/g (108 mg/mmol).

Results

Overall, 2906 participants (68%) had a diagnosis of T2D and of these, 396 had CKD ascribed to a cause other than diabetes. The most common causes of CKD after diabetes (n = 2510) were ischaemic/hypertensive nephropathy (n = 687) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 695), of which immunoglobulin A nephropathy (n = 270) was the most common. A total of 4174 participants (97%) were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 1882 (43.7%) diuretics, 229 (5.3%) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and 122 (2.8%) glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists. In contrast to the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE), the DAPA-CKD trial enrolled participants with CKD due to diabetes and to causes other than diabetes. The mean eGFR of participants in the DAPA-CKD trial was 13.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 lower than in CREDENCE, similar to that in the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in DKD (FIDELIO-DKD) trial and the Study Of diabetic Nephropathy with AtRasentan (SONAR).

Conclusions

Participants with a wide range of underlying kidney diseases receiving renin–angiotensin system blocking therapy have been enrolled in the DAPA-CKD trial. The trial will examine the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in participants with CKD Stages 2–4 and increased albuminuria, with and without T2D.

### Barriers to early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for renal protection: a comprehensive review and call to action [^1163nfiX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 13% of people globally, including 20%-48% with type 2 diabetes (T2D), resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. There is an urgent need to increase early screening and intervention for CKD. We are experts in diabetology and nephrology in Central Europe and Israel. Herein, we review evidence supporting the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for kidney protection and discuss barriers to early CKD diagnosis and treatment, including in our respective countries. SGLT2 inhibitors exert cardiorenal protective effects, demonstrated in the renal outcomes trials (EMPA-KIDNEY, DAPA-CKD, CREDENCE) of empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin in patients with CKD. EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated cardiorenal efficacy across the broadest renal range, regardless of T2D status. Renoprotective evidence also comes from large real-world studies. International guidelines recommend first-line SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2D and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20mL/min/1.73m 2, and that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists may also be administered if required for additional glucose control. Although these guidelines recommend at least annual eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio screening for patients with T2D, observational studies suggest that only half are screened. Diagnosis is hampered by asymptomatic early CKD and under-recognition among patients with T2D and clinicians, including limited knowledge/use of guidelines and resources. Based on our experience and on the literature, we recommend robust screening programmes, potentially with albuminuria self-testing, and SGLT2 inhibitor reimbursement at general practitioner (GP) and specialist levels. High-tech tools (artificial intelligence, smartphone apps, etc.) are providing exciting opportunities to identify high-risk individuals, self-screen, detect abnormalities in images, and assist with prescribing and treatment adherence. Better education is also needed, alongside provision of concise guidelines, enabling GPs to identify who would benefit from early initiation of renoprotective therapy; although, regardless of current renal function, cardiorenal protection is provided by SGLT2 inhibitor therapy.

Recommendations for Optimal Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of progression to DKD and renal death by approximately 40–50% in people with T2DM who are at risk of CV events and are on ACE-Is and ARBs. Thus, SGLT2i have emerged as the new drugs that must be included in the armamentarium for the management for people with T2DM having CVD or mild-to-moderate DKD to curb morbidity and mortality. The recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i, generated on the basis of evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses, is summarized below.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on urinary albumin excretion in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes: a prespecified analysis from the DAPA-CKD trial [^112eiiYo]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Reductions in albuminuria are associated with a subsequent lower risk of kidney failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. The SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin significantly reduced albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal or near-normal kidney function. Whether this effect persists in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes is unknown. We assessed the effects of dapagliflozin on albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes in the dapagliflozin and prevention of adverse outcomes in chronic kidney disease (DAPA-CKD) trial.

Methods

DAPA-CKD was a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial done at 386 sites in 21 countries. Patients were eligible for the trial if they had chronic kidney disease, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and 75 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) between 200 mg/g and 5000 mg/g (22.6 to 565.6 mg/mmol). Participants were randomly assigned to dapagliflozin 10 mg (AstraZeneca; Gothenburg, Sweden) once daily or matching placebo, in accordance with the sequestered, fixed randomisation schedule, using balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 1:1 ratio. Change in albuminuria was a pre-specified exploratory outcome of DAPA-CKD. Regression in UACR stage, defined as a transition from macroalbuminuria (≥ 300 mg/g) to microalbuminuria or normoalbuminuria (< 300 mg/g), and progression in UACR stage, defined as a transition from less than 3000 mg/g to 3000 mg/g or greater, were additional discrete endpoints. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03036150.

Findings

Between Feb 2, 2017, and April 3, 2020, 4304 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either dapagliflozin (n = 2152) or placebo (n = 2152). Median UACR was 949 mg/g (IQR 477 to 1885). Overall, compared with placebo, dapagliflozin reduced geometric mean UACR by 29.3% (95% CI -33.1 to -25.2; p < 0.0001); relative to placebo, treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in a geometric mean percentage change of -35.1% (95% CI -39.4 to -30.6; p < 0.0001) in patients with type 2 diabetes and -14.8% (-22.9 to -5.9; p = 0.0016) in patients without type 2 diabetes over the follow-up visits (p interaction < 0.0001) Among 3860 patients with UACR of 300 mg/g or greater at baseline, dapagliflozin increased the likelihood of regression in UACR stage (hazard ratio 1.81, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.05). Among 3820 patients with UACR less than 3000 mg/g at baseline, dapagliflozin decreased the risk of progression in UACR stage (0.41, 0.32 to 0.52). Larger reductions in UACR at day 14 during dapagliflozin treatment were significantly associated with attenuated eGFR decline during subsequent follow-up (β per log unit UACR change -3.06, 95% CI -5.20 to -0.90; p = 0.0056).

Interpretation

In patients with chronic kidney disease with and without type 2 diabetes, dapagliflozin significantly reduced albuminuria, with a larger relative reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes. The similar effects of dapagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with or without type 2 diabetes, but different effects on UACR, suggest that part of the protective effect of dapagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease might be mediated through pathways unrelated to reduction in albuminuria.

Variation and changes in individual licence indications in people with reduced eGFR have fuelled misunderstandings about the appropriate circumstances for initiation and continuation of these agents when kidney function is impaired. Each of the currently available SGLT2i agents are licensed for initiation in people with eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2, with product-specific caveats concerning initiation and continuation of treatment at eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and dosing (although dapagliflozin may be used in people with eGFR 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2). SGLT2i mechanism of action results in significantly reduced glucose-lowering effect when eGFR is < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 and additional T2DM therapy will be needed if HbA1c is above target, although individuals will still benefit from the CVRM protection and slowing of further decline in kidney function offered by SGLT2is.

The uptake of SGLT-2 inhibitors

The utilisation of the SGLT-2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, increased approximately two-fold in the calendar year after its approval for CKD treatment (i.e. from the beginning to the end of 2022; Fig. 3); from 5.3 to 9.3% and from 1.0 to 2.1% in patients with T2D and patients without T2D, respectively.

The dotted green line indicates the date on which dapagliflozin was approved in Norway (December 21st, 2021) for use in treating chronic kidney disease, regardless of whether the patient has type 2 diabetes or not

Medication utilisation in new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors and RAS inhibitors

Following the approval of the SGLT-2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, for CKD treatment, 1,659 and 1,760 patients with CKD initiated treatment with dapagliflozin and/or RAS inhibitors, respectively (Table S3). Following new initiation, less than 20% of patients who used dapagliflozin discontinued their treatment and almost all these patients maintained their target dose of 10 mg throughout 12-months follow-up, irrespective of diabetes status (Fig. 4). New initiation of RAS inhibitor treatment was followed by slightly higher discontinuation rates, with the medication prescribed mainly at a low dose.

### The long-term effects of dapagliflozin in chronic kidney disease: a time-to-event analysis [^116uNfs2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Time-to-event analysis

To quantify outcomes-based clinical benefit of dapagliflozin beyond the trial periods of DAPA-CKD and DECLARE-TIMI 58, a closed cohort level partitioned survival model was used to predict the outcomes of patients receiving dapagliflozin plus standard therapy versus standard therapy alone. This approach considers the development of a single cohort of patients over time (closed cohort) as opposed to the addition of new, incident-disease patients over time. Here, the partitioned survival approach is used on a clinical event basis to incorporate competing risks of mortality. Patients begin in the event-free partition and, over time, the proportion who die move to a 'dead' partition and among the remaining proportion of the cohort, those who are expected to have an event are moved to the 'event occurred' partition according to the independently determined survival curves for each clinical event. In subsequent time periods, only patients in the 'event-free' partition are at risk of events, so the entire cohort is accounted for across all partitions at every point in time.

The analysis assumes an intention-to-treat perspective and events were considered separately for extrapolation. Non-fatal events were analysed assuming constant hazard in a competing risk framework, with a first-order adjustment for mortality (that is, an adjustment according to general population age/sex mortality). Mortality was taken as the maximum of trial-observed, all-cause mortality (modelled using a generalized gamma distribution) and general population mortality (sex- and age-weighted average, according to top country representation in the trials; Supplementary data, Fig. S1). Only time to first event was considered, thus excluding subsequent events; outcomes were estimated for a cohort size of 1000 patients.

Given the infrequency of some events, a median time (50% of patients) was not expected to be reached within typical patients' lifetimes; mean times were therefore estimated for consistency. Mean time to first event was calculated as the number of events over the corresponding survival time (defined as time until death of the 1000-patient cohort). For fatal events (all-cause mortality), this time represents mean survival. For non-fatal events, this time frame is the average time until the event occurs in patients who do not die, i.e. patients may die without experiencing a non-fatal event, thus the mean time corresponds only to those who would both experience an event in their lifetime. Uncertainty intervals (95% confidence) were calculated from 1000 bootstrap replicates of the corresponding patient populations.

### Acute effects of dapagliflozin on renal oxygenation and perfusion in type 1 diabetes with albuminuria: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial [^117KAG8e]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Initially SGLT2 inhibitors were introduced to lower glucose in type 2 diabetes. Subsequent cardiovascular and kidney outcome studies demonstrated cardiovascular-, heart failure-, and kidney benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes. There have been multiple reviews trying to explain these benefits which do not seem to relate to the blood glucose lowering effect. Suggested mechanisms include weight loss, reduction in the systemic or intraglomerular pressure, lowering of uric acid, decreased inflammation, as well as changes in cell metabolism. Recently, increasing focus has been on a unifying mechanism related to the potential impact on hypoxia as demonstrated experimentally and reviewed by Packer. Diabetes leads to kidney hypoxia and oxidative stress which changes the balance between HIF1α and HIF2α causing inflammation and impaired erythropoiesis. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors reverse these unfavourable effects in experimental settings, but human data have been lacking until now.

Patients with type 2 diabetes have a high prevalence of comorbidities and a heterogenous background for kidney disease. In our mechanistic, mode-of-action study we chose to study patients with type 1 diabetes, as a more direct model of diabetic kidney disease. This is in line with previous studies investigating the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on hyperfiltration. Thus, our results may not be generalised to patients with type 2 diabetes, but are important for the general understanding of diabetic kidney disease and support future studies to confirm our findings with chronic SGLT2 inhibition in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, our findings emphasise the need for studies with interventions improving renal tissue oxygenation to prevent or treat diabetic kidney disease as already suggested by Hesp and colleagues. Furthermore, our study can serve as a proof-of-concept study for the consideration of initiating major clinical trials with SGLT2 inhibitors in individuals with type 1 diabetes to prevent or reverse diabetic kidney disease. Dapagliflozin is approved as an adjunctive glucose lowering treatment for individuals with type 1 diabetes with a body mass index > 27 kg/m 2, but no major cardiovascular- or renal outcome trials in type 1 diabetes have been conducted so far. The main reason is the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. However, preliminary post hoc analyses from the studies in type 1 diabetes do support kidney benefitsand our results might contribute additionally to the debate on the potential risks and benefits with SGLT2 inhibition in type 1 diabetes.

### Dapagliflozin (Farxiga) [^1146KJqV]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, FARXIGA significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo. FARXIGA is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors, including FARXIGA.

Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 3 days after discontinuing FARXIGA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.
