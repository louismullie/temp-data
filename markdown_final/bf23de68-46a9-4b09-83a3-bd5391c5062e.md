## Question

What is the deep sulcus sign?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the deep sulcus sign is on chest radiography. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and precise definition of the sign. Then, I should review the pathophysiology in the supine position that creates this finding. Next, I will describe the key radiographic features that help identify it. After that, I need to assess its diagnostic significance and common pitfalls or mimics. Finally, I should consider the clinical implications, limitations, and how to corroborate with other modalities such as CT or ultrasound, anchoring on established radiograph–CT correlation reviews and ICU imaging guidance [^114wDRQP] [^113TbBEH] [^115ecowf].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definition to avoid any ambiguity. The deep sulcus sign is a radiographic clue to pneumothorax that is classically described on a supine anterior–posterior chest radiograph, where pleural air collects basally and laterally rather than apically, making the lateral costophrenic angle appear abnormally deep and lucent extending toward the hypochondrium, sometimes with unusually sharp visualization of the diaphragm and adjacent structures [^114wDRQP] [^113TbBEH].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism before I over-interpret any single film. In the supine position, free pleural air rises anteriorly and inferiorly, layering in the subpulmonary and lateral nondependent regions; this redistributes the air away from the apex and can medially and superiorly displace the basal lung, thereby deepening the lateral costophrenic sulcus on the affected side, especially in children where the inferior lateral hemithorax is the most nondependent pleural space [^115ecowf].

> I will now examine the imaging appearance in practical terms. On a portable supine radiograph, the deep sulcus sign appears as disproportionate deepening and increased lucency of the lateral costophrenic sulcus, often extending below the expected diaphragmatic contour toward the upper abdomen, with sharp delineation of the diaphragm and, on the right, even a sharply outlined inferior vena cava; this pattern reflects lateral subpulmonary air collection and may be asymmetric compared with the contralateral side [^114wDRQP] [^113TbBEH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — how reliable is this sign when CXR sensitivity is limited in supine patients. Identification of pneumothorax on portable AP films is challenging, and the deep sulcus sign can be the only visible clue of a subpulmonary pneumothorax on a supine film, so recognizing it materially improves detection on otherwise low-sensitivity radiographs in the ICU and trauma settings [^115ecowf] [^113hs9qh]. Let me also consider corroboration: bedside lung ultrasound, which outperforms supine CXR for ruling in/out pneumothorax overall, can rapidly confirm with absent lung sliding and a lung point when present, acknowledging exceptions, so it is a useful adjunct when the deep sulcus is suspected but equivocal on CXR [^111f5UXL].

> Next, I should review related signs and common mimics to avoid false calls. Subpulmonary pneumothorax on supine CXR may also show a double diaphragm sign, a hyperlucent upper abdomen, and an unusually sharp diaphragmatic silhouette, which should be assessed together with the deep sulcus configuration to increase confidence in the diagnosis [^114wDRQP]. But wait, I need to check for pitfalls: skin folds can mimic pleural lines yet show vascular markings beyond the apparent line and often run in parallel bands; interlobar fissures or accessory fissures can simulate visceral pleura; and intrathoracic extrapleural air may produce lucencies with fascial webs and a wavier pleural line that does not shift with patient position, all of which argue against true pneumothorax if present [^113TbBEH] [^114B3nBq].

> I should double-check the clinical implications and limitations so we use the sign appropriately. The deep sulcus sign is specifically a supine radiographic phenomenon, so it is not expected on erect PA films where pleural air ascends apically; it may be subtle and demands careful side-to-side comparison and, where available, prior films for context, particularly in ICU and post-procedural patients in whom erect imaging is infeasible [^115ecowf] [^113hs9qh]. But wait, what if we see dramatic radiographic features — do they imply tension physiology? Radiographic "tension" signs in spontaneous pneumothorax do not consistently correlate with hemodynamic compromise, so clinical correlation remains paramount even when the deep sulcus and related findings are present [^112pc78n].

> Let me synthesize to ensure I have not missed anything important. The deep sulcus sign is the characteristic supine CXR manifestation of subpulmonary pleural air, seen as an abnormally deep, hyperlucent lateral costophrenic sulcus extending toward the hypochondrium with sharply defined diaphragmatic contours; it arises from anterior–inferior redistribution of air in the pleural space when supine and is a key clue for otherwise occult pneumothorax on portable films, warranting prompt clinical correlation and often confirmation with ultrasound or CT when management hinges on certainty [^114wDRQP] [^113TbBEH] [^111f5UXL] [^115ecowf].

---

The deep sulcus sign is a **radiographic indicator of pneumothorax** in supine patients, appearing as an abnormally deep, lucent lateral costophrenic angle due to anterior pleural air tracking inferiorly [^114wDRQP]. It is most often seen in trauma [^117TGzJv], mechanically ventilated, or postoperative patients, and is easily missed or misinterpreted on supine films [^111UsEp6]. **Prompt recognition** is essential to avoid delayed diagnosis and complications; confirm with CT or ultrasound when uncertain, and manage based on pneumothorax size and clinical status [^114wDRQP] [^111f5UXL] [^113qS6Z7].

---

## Radiographic appearance and anatomical basis

Radiographic appearance: an **abnormally deep, lucent lateral costophrenic angle** extending toward the hypochondrium, often with a sharply outlined diaphragm and visible inferior lung surface [^114wDRQP] [^1165Pc44]. Anatomical basis: in supine patients, **pleural air rises anteriorly and medially**, collecting in the nondependent anteromedial and subpulmonary spaces and deepening the lateral costophrenic sulcus.

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

Most common settings: the **deep sulcus sign** occurs in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Trauma patients | Blunt or penetrating chest trauma causing pneumothorax [^116FqzKg] [^117TGzJv] |
| Mechanically ventilated patients | Barotrauma-related pneumothorax in ICU settings [^113TbBEH] |
| Postoperative patients | Iatrogenic pneumothorax after thoracic or abdominal surgery [^113TbBEH] |
| Critically ill patients | Supine positioning due to severe illness or injury [^116sR2ub] |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations

Sensitivity and specificity: the deep sulcus sign is **specific but not highly sensitive** for pneumothorax; small or loculated pneumothoraces may be missed, and artifacts can mimic the sign [^113TbBEH]. Limitations include the **low sensitivity of supine radiographs** for occult pneumothorax and the potential for false positives from skin folds, interlobar fissures, or extrapleural air [^111UsEp6] [^114B3nBq].

---

## Differentiation from other radiographic signs

The deep sulcus sign is identified by its **characteristic appearance and clinical context**:

| **Radiographic sign** | **Description** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Deep sulcus sign | Abnormally deep, lucent lateral costophrenic angle | Supine pneumothorax [^116sR2ub] |
| Double diaphragm sign | Two diaphragm-lung interfaces | Supine pneumothorax [^116FqzKg] |
| Lung point sign | Transition between normal lung and pneumothorax | Pneumothorax (ultrasound) [^112HrJNY] [^111waDXx] |
| Skin fold artifact | Broad radiopaque band with vascular markings beyond | Artifact |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Clinical implications: recognition of the deep sulcus sign is **critical for early pneumothorax detection** in supine patients, preventing delayed diagnosis and complications such as tension pneumothorax or respiratory compromise [^114wDRQP] [^115ex1Xj]. Management: **confirm suspected pneumothorax** with CT or ultrasound and treat according to size and clinical status, which may involve observation, needle aspiration, or chest tube insertion [^114wDRQP] [^111f5UXL] [^113qS6Z7].

---

## Potential pitfalls and common errors

Pitfalls include **mistaking skin folds, interlobar fissures, or extrapleural air for pneumothorax** and overlooking small or loculated pneumothoraces [^113TbBEH]. Errors such as **failure to recognize the deep sulcus sign** can delay diagnosis and treatment, increasing morbidity and mortality [^111UsEp6].

---

## Role of advanced imaging modalities

**Computed tomography (CT)** is the gold standard for confirming pneumothorax, especially when the deep sulcus sign is equivocal or when other conditions are suspected [^114wDRQP] [^111UsEp6]. **Ultrasound** is a rapid and accurate bedside modality for pneumothorax detection, particularly in critically ill or trauma patients [^111f5UXL] [^112HrJNY].

---

The deep sulcus sign is a **key radiographic clue** to pneumothorax in supine patients. Accurate recognition and confirmation with CT or ultrasound enable timely management and reduce complications.

### Demystifying the persistent pneumothorax: Role of imaging [^1165Pc44]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The pleural space is a potential space typically filled with a few milliliters of fluid, maintaining a negative intrapleural pressure. Pneumothorax is defined as an abnormal accumulation of gas within this pleural space. Pneumothoraces can be classified into three categories: spontaneous, post-traumatic, or iatrogenic. A spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in the absence of a triggering event and can be further subclassified as primary or secondary, depending on the presence of associated diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Post-traumatic pneumothorax results from blunt or penetrating trauma to the chest, whereas iatrogenic pneumothorax occurs as a complication of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The incidence of pneumothorax is higher among cigarette and cannabis smokers.

Tension pneumothorax is identified as a distinct entity characterized by the progressive buildup of air within the pleural space due to a one-way valve mechanism. This can occur from chest wall or pulmonary injury, allowing air to enter the pleural space without escaping. Pneumothorax ex vacuo is a distinct type occurring with lobar atelectasis from acute bronchial obstruction. The resultant increase in negative intrapleural pressure draws gas into the pleural space. This type of pneumothorax spontaneously resolves once the bronchial obstruction is relieved. Recently, the term has also been used to describe the development of gas in the pleural space when the lung cannot expand and fill the thoracic cavity after pleural fluid evacuation.

### Ultrasonography for clinical decision-making and intervention in airway management: from the mouth to the lungs and pleurae [^111f5UXL]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

The evaluation of lung pathology through lung ultrasound (LUS) reveals several distinct morphological patterns. These patterns can be categorized into pneumothorax, interstitial syndrome, focal B-lines, lung consolidation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion.

- **Pneumothorax**: Generally, LUS is a more effective diagnostic tool than conventional chest X-rays for diagnosing pneumothorax, particularly for ruling out the condition. Meta-analyses indicate that LUS examinations have a pooled sensitivity of 78.6% to 90.9% and specificity of 98.2% to 98.4% in diagnosing pneumothoraces in supine patients, compared to chest radiographs (39.8% to 50.2% sensitivity and 99.3% to 99.4% specificity).

	- Four characteristic ultrasound signs are essential for diagnosing and excluding pneumothorax: lung sliding, B-lines, lung pulse, and lung point. When utilizing LUS for pneumothorax diagnosis, characteristic signs can be pragmatically divided into three categories:
		- Findings which exclude pneumothorax
		- Findings which are suggestive of pneumothorax
		- Findings which are diagnostic of pneumothorax

Additionally, in a LUS examination (Fig. 14), the transducer is placed longitudinally over an intercostal space on the anterior chest surface, where free air in the chest cavity is typically located. If pneumothorax is present, the pleura-line reflects only the parietal pleura, indicating that the motion of the visceral pleura is not visible, and consequently, lung sliding is absent. In M-mode, the absence of lung sliding is represented by the "stratosphere sign", a pattern consisting solely of horizontal lines.

### Tension pneumothorax and the "forbidden CXR" [^115ex1Xj]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A case is presented of unilateral tension pneumothorax associated with flail chest and pulmonary contusions in a spontaneously ventilating patient following a fall. The tension element was not suspected until a chest X-ray was available, nor was immediate needle thoracocentesis performed. No morbidity resulted as a consequence. This case highlights the difficulty in deciding whether tension pneumothorax is the predominant cause of respiratory distress in a patient with multiple chest injuries. It provides further evidence challenging some of the doctrines on how to treat suspected tension pneumothorax.

### Is a routine chest X-ray necessary in every patient after percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy? A retrospective review of 278 cases [^114ffmLC]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the rate, clinical significance, and predictors of delayed pneumothorax after CT-guided lung biopsy.

Medical and imaging records of all patients who underwent CT-guided lung biopsy between January 1, 2012, and January 9, 2015, were reviewed. An "early pneumothorax" was defined as one visualized on a CT scan at the time of the biopsy, while a "delayed pneumothorax" was one discovered on the first follow-up chest X-ray (CXR). A "clinically significant pneumothorax" was one requiring chest tube placement.

A total of 357 lung biopsies were performed; however, 79 patients did not have follow-up CXRs and were excluded from the study. Of the 278 cases included in the study, early pneumothorax occurred in 109 patients. Follow-up CXRs were available for the remaining 169 patients without early pneumothorax and were obtained 3.1 ± 2.9 hours after the biopsy. The rate of delayed pneumothorax was 8.6% (24/278). Clinically significant pneumothorax occurred in 10 out of 24 (41.7%) patients with delayed pneumothorax, including one case of tension pneumothorax.

Patients with delayed pneumothorax (n = 24) had smaller lesion long axial diameters (18.58 ± 9.84 mm vs. 25.83 ± 17.69 mm, p = 0.005), longer intrapulmonary needle tracts (23.45 ± 14.98 vs. 14.17 ± 14.49, p = 0.004), and lower FEV1/FVC ratios (53.30 ± 22.47 vs. 71.15 ± 13.77, p = 0.015) compared to those without delayed pneumothorax (n = 145). The length of the intrapulmonary needle tract was the only independent predictor of delayed pneumothorax (p = 0.008) and symptomatic delayed pneumothorax (p = 0.019).

In conclusion, obtaining a routine follow-up CXR is essential for detecting delayed pneumothorax following a CT-guided lung biopsy.

### Incidental detection of late presenting co-arctation of the aorta on chest x-ray: The importance of rib notching [^1117HTbU]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old obese male presented to the emergency department with symptoms and signs suggestive of a viral upper respiratory tract illness, along with a background of low exercise tolerance. Rib notching was identified on plain film chest radiography, and a subsequent CT of the thorax revealed a moderately tight 2-mm juxta-ductal co-arctation of the aorta with multiple enlarged chest wall collaterals. The patient underwent a two-stage percutaneous procedure involving stent insertion and angioplasty up to 16 mm, resulting in significant improvement in exercise capacity and a modest reduction in blood pressure.

### The value of supine chest X-ray in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the basal lung zones [^113XMzEB]. Academic Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Basal lung opacities are frequently observed on supine chest X-ray (SCXR) in intensive care patients, leading to uncertainty among clinicians and radiologists. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of SCXR for detecting basal pneumonia.

We evaluated 172 patients who underwent both SCXR and computed tomography within an hour. Two readers reviewed the SCXR and rated findings in both basal zones using a scale: 0 = "no pneumonia", 1 = "possible pneumonia", 2 = "highly suspected pneumonia". Computed tomography was the reference standard. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) based on two pooling strategies: pooling 0 and 1 as negative, and pooling 1 and 2 as positive.

- **Results**: When pooling 0 and 1 as negative, sensitivity was 0.45 (right)/0.38 (left), specificity was 0.94/0.97, PPV was 0.76/0.79, and NPV was 0.81/0.84. When pooling 1 and 2 as positive, sensitivity was 0.80/0.75, specificity was 0.62/0.58, PPV was 0.45/0.35, and NPV was 0.88/0.89. The most common findings in false-positive cases were combined pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.

Concluding, interpreting only highly suspicious basal opacities as indicative of pneumonia significantly enhances the PPV while maintaining a relatively constant NPV. It is crucial for clinicians and radiologists to acknowledge the limitations of SCXR in diagnosing basal pneumonia.

### Lung point in the absence of pneumothorax [^111waDXx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Given a reported 100% specificity for the diagnosis of pneumothorax, the lung point has been considered a sign that cannot be mimicked. However, we now present a unique case of the presence of a lung point in the absence of pneumothorax in a 75-year-old man admitted after coronary artery bypass graft.

- **Figures**:
	- *Figure 1a*: The lung point. The yellow arrow shows where lung sliding was absent. A single B-line, marked by the yellow asterisk, was present in the absence of lung sliding. The green arrow shows where lung sliding was present.
	- *Figure 1b*: The M-mode of the lung point where the immobility of the affected lung alternates with the movement of the healthy lung, which can be observed in the M-mode as the stratosphere sign (yellow asterisk) alternating with the seashore sign (green asterisk), respectively.
	- *Figure 1c*: Post-operational chest X-ray showing pleural thickening.
	- *Figure 1d*: Thoracic CT scan showing pre-existent asbestos-related pleural disease. The red arrows on the CT and X-ray indicate pleural thickening and calcification.

Scanning at the right anterior third intercostal space showed an absence of lung sliding (online video A) and a stratosphere sign, indicating an A′-profile. A lung point was actively searched for and indeed found. Pneumothorax was ruled out by the presence of a B-line in the same view as the lung point (online video B), supported by a post-operative chest X-ray and CT scan indicating pre-existing asbestos-related pleural disease.

We postulate that the healthy part of the lung moves unrestrictedly, whereas the affected part is restricted, their transition resulting in a lung point.

### Training physicians in India to interpret pediatric chest radiographs according to World Health Organization research methodology [^115X1cwP]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

We developed a training course for the WHO standardized interpretations of pediatric chest radiographs to support two research studies in India. Our findings show significant improvements in the correct identification of endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign, both key features of the radiologic definition of primary endpoint pneumonia, that have not been reported previously. Following recommendations from the WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies project, we considered readers to have been successfully standardized to the radiologic definitions if they correctly identified the presence or absence of primary endpoint pneumonia in ≥ 80% of images.

While more radiologists (12/13) achieved this standard at baseline compared to pediatricians (6/13), after training the same number of pediatricians and radiologists achieved the standard (both 12/13). Similarly, radiologists had better pretraining mean scores for primary endpoint pneumonia and silhouette sign when compared to pediatricians, but this difference did not persist in test scores after training. These findings suggest that future training should consider focusing on teaching and standardization efforts for endpoint consolidation and silhouette sign, with an emphasis on the objective measurement approaches for both, rather than primary endpoint pneumonia more generally, as has been done previously.

Over a period of two decades, the WHO pediatric chest radiograph interpretation methodology has been used for landmark pediatric research, including efficacy and effectiveness studies of bacterial conjugate vaccines.

### Infectious diseases society of America/American thoracic society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^114PtydE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

With respect to diagnostic investigations for community-acquired pneumonia, particularly regarding chest X-ray (CXR), the IDSA 2007 guidelines recommend obtaining a CXR (or other imaging technique) to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrates. This should be done with or without supporting microbiological data for the diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with suggestive clinical features.

### Demystifying the persistent pneumothorax: Role of imaging [^115ecowf]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Radiographs are the cornerstone for diagnosing pneumothorax. If a pneumothorax is present, a white visceral pleural line separates the lung from the chest wall, with a loss of normal lung markings peripheral to this white line (Fig. 1a, b). Occasionally, the lung on the affected side may completely collapse.

Erect inspiratory posterior-anterior radiographs are generally preferred for assessment of pneumothorax. In critically ill patients, anterior-posterior, supine, or semi-erect radiographs may be obtained. In difficult cases, lateral decubitus radiographs can help identify an anterior pneumothorax.

Identification of a pneumothorax on portable radiographs can be challenging, and the presence of a "deep sulcus" sign constitutes an important clue (Fig. 1b). Expiratory radiographs are no longer recommended. Note that the most nondependent portion of the pleural space is the inferior lateral hemithorax, especially in children. Therefore, it is important that the lateral costophrenic angles be included on all supine radiographs being used to evaluate for pneumothorax.

Ultrasound has developed as a robust tool for identification, as well as follow-up, of pneumothorax. In normal subjects, respiration-dependent movement of visceral pleura on parietal pleura can be seen by ultrasound. This sliding movement or lung pulse at the pleural interface indicates that there is no pneumothorax at the site of the examination. Air in the pleural space prevents visualization of visceral pleural movement. Therefore, in the presence of pneumothorax, the gliding is absent.

### The yield of chest X-ray or ultra-low-dose chest-CT in emergency department patients suspected of pulmonary infection without respiratory symptoms or signs [^116r8uBt]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

History taking, physical examination, and laboratory tests were initiated by the attending physician. After setting the indication for chest imaging and acquiring informed consent, the attending physician provided a clinical question on the structured and standardized radiology request form. This was followed by either ULDCT or CXR, according to the imaging method allocated to the month of presentation. If the clinical question was not adequately answered after obtaining the CXR or ULDCT, standard additional imaging (e.g. chest CT with intravenous contrast medium, CT pulmonary angiography) was performed. The median ULDCT dose was 0.2 mSv (IQR 0.2 to 0.3 mSv). The median CXR dose for portable anterior-posterior (AP) CXR was 0.02 mSv (IQR 0.02 to 0.03 mSv), and for bucky CXR posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral, 0.05 mSv (IQR 0.03 to 0.07 mSv). Additional technical information on the imaging techniques used (ULDCT and CXR) is available in the supplementary appendix.

Radiologists used a structured standardized report to optimize and standardize reading. Reading and reporting were performed or supervised by the radiologist on call at the time of clinical management, also outside office hours. The ULDCT and CXR were read with prior imaging, if available. To increase inter-reader consistency, residents and radiologists less experienced in the field of chest imaging were supervised by a group of seven radiologists with a subspecialty in chest imaging. When a radiologic diagnosis of pneumonia was made, a pneumonia pattern was reported: lobar, interstitial, or bronchial.

### Prediction of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio in patients with congenital heart disease using deep learning-based analysis of chest radiographs [^1173xJXL]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Chest radiography is a useful noninvasive modality to evaluate pulmonary blood flow status in patients with congenital heart disease. However, the predictive value of chest radiography is limited by the subjective and qualitative nature of the interpretation. Recently, deep learning has been used to analyze various images, but it has not been applied to analyzing chest radiographs in such patients.

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a quantitative method to predict the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio from chest radiographs using deep learning. This retrospective observational study included 1,031 cardiac catheterizations performed for 657 patients from January 1, 2005, to April 30, 2019, at a tertiary center. Catheterizations without the Fick-derived pulmonary to systemic flow ratio or chest radiography performed within one month before catheterization were excluded. Seventy-eight patients, involving 100 catheterizations, were randomly assigned for evaluation. A deep learning model that predicts the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio from chest radiographs was developed using the method of transfer learning.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Whether the model can predict the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio from chest radiographs was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. The diagnostic concordance rate was compared with three certified pediatric cardiologists. The diagnostic performance for a high pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of 2.0 or more was evaluated using cross-tabulation and a receiver operating characteristic analysis.

### Feasibility and safety of the craniocaudal approach for superior sulcus lesions of the thorax [^114K3QLy]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

All patients who underwent the craniocaudal approach were successful both technically and clinically. The median procedure time was 25 minutes, similar to the time reported by Takizawa et al, which was within 20 minutes. Unlike their report, where all procedures were performed using fluoroscopic guidance, half of our procedures were performed using ultrasound (US) guidance. Poor visibility of the superior sulcus lesion precluded the US-guided puncture, and thus fluoroscopic puncture was used in four patients. It might be preferable to prioritize fluoroscopic puncture.

- **Alternative approaches**: Possible approaches to the superior sulcus lesions other than the craniocaudal approach include the conventional intercostal approach and the transscapular approach. Although the safety and efficacy of the conventional intercostal approach are established, reaching the superior sulcus lesion is sometimes difficult because of the presence of normal lung parenchyma. The transscapular approach has been reported to reach the superior sulcus lesions; however, this approach requires penetration of the bone and is thus more invasive than the craniocaudal approach.

- **Advantages of the craniocaudal approach**: The craniocaudal approach has two advantages. First, it allows the procedure to be performed in the supine position, which may be feasible for patients connected to ventilators, thus making posture changes difficult. Second, it is effective for patients with diffuse subcutaneous metastases or pleural dissemination. If the conventional intercostal approach is performed for such patients, it may be less effective.

### Demystifying the persistent pneumothorax: Role of imaging [^111EUk9q]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, persistent pneumothorax poses a diagnostic conundrum. The specific aetiology may often be hidden in plain sight. A careful evaluation of radiographs and CT scans can identify the underlying cause, leading to early diagnosis and treatment.

### The "lung point": An ultrasound SIGN specific to pneumothorax [^112HrJNY]. Intensive Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

We studied an ultrasound sign, the fleeting appearance of a lung pattern (lung sliding or pathologic comet-tail artifacts) replacing a pneumothorax pattern (absent lung sliding plus exclusive horizontal lines) in a particular location of the chest wall. This sign was called the "lung point".

- **Design**: Prospective study.

- **Setting**: The medical ICU of a university-affiliated teaching hospital.

- **Patients**: The "lung point" was sought in 66 consecutive cases of proven pneumothorax analyzable using ultrasound, including 8 radio-occult cases diagnosed by means of CT and in 233 consecutive hemithoraces studied by CT and free of pneumothorax, including 17 cases where pneumothorax was suspected.

- **Results**: The "lung point" was observed in 44 of 66 cases of pneumothorax (including 6 of 8 radio-occult cases) and in no case in the control group. The location of this sign roughly correlated with the radiological size of the pneumothorax. The "lung point" therefore had an overall sensitivity of 66% (75% in the case of radio-occult pneumothorax alone) and a specificity of 100%.

- **Conclusion**: The presence of a "lung point" allows positive diagnosis of pneumothorax at the bedside using ultrasound.

### ARC concave sign on thin-section computed tomography: A novel predictor for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma in pure ground-glass nodules [^1158AUDV]. European Journal of Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

We aimed to investigate the risk factors of invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma, especially to report and validate the use of our newly identified arc concave sign in predicting the invasiveness of pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs).

From January 2015 to August 2018, we retrospectively enrolled 302 patients with 306 pGGNs ≤ 20 mm pathologically confirmed (141 preinvasive lesions and 165 invasive lesions). The arc concave sign was defined as a smooth and sunken part of the edge of the lesion on thin-section computed tomography (TSCT). The degree of the arc concave sign was expressed by the arc chord distance to chord length ratio (AC-R); a deep arc concave sign was defined as AC-R larger than the optimal cut-off value. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent risk factors of invasiveness.

- **Results**: Arc concave sign was observed in 65 of 306 pGGNs (21.2%), and a deep arc concave sign (AC-R > 0.25) was more common in invasive lesions (P = 0.008). Under the microscope, interlobular septal displacements were found at the tumor surface. Multivariate analysis indicated that irregular shape (OR, 3.558; CI: 1.374–9.214), presence of a deep arc concave sign (OR, 3.336; CI: 1.013–10.986), the largest diameter > 10.1 mm (OR, 4.607; CI: 2.584–8.212), and maximum density > -502 HU (OR, 6.301; CI: 3.562–11.148) were significant independent risk factors of invasive lesions.

- **Conclusions**: The arc concave sign on TSCT is caused by interlobular septal displacement. The degree of the arc concave sign can reflect the invasiveness of pGGNs. Invasive lesions can be effectively distinguished.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Treat the patient, not the X-ray [^113qS6Z7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The primary endpoint of the trial followed those of many prior studies and centered on the expansion of the lung. "Failure" was defined by any residual pneumothorax ⩾2 cm on radiographs 24 hours after the intervention. The study was set up as a non-inferiority trial, but the predicted failure rate in the control group (based on literature data) differed significantly from the actual observed rate in the recruited subjects. Two different methods to define the inferiority margins were presented and created much discussion on their relative statistical validity.

Not surprisingly, the trial did find that patients treated with chest tubes had better radiographic success. Only 18% of drainages in the chest-tube group "failed", compared with 29% in those treated with simple aspiration. However, patients in the aspiration group reported less pain (mean difference, −1.4 [95% CI: −1.89 to −0.91] on a 10-point scale), and significantly fewer of them described restriction in breathing as a result of pain (frequency difference, −18% [−27% to −9%]). Serious adverse events were uncommon in both groups. No intergroup differences were found in the long-term outcome measures, especially the recurrence rates after 1 year (20% in the aspiration group and 27% in the chest-tube group).

These results serve to confront clinicians to examine their priorities for PSP management. More invasive drainages provide better CXR improvement, reassuring clinicians, but at the expense of patient comfort and procedural risks. The fundamental focus in PSP management should be to relieve symptoms and stop the recurrence of the pneumothorax.

### Will the presence of radiological signs of tension pneumothorax affect the clinical presentation of primary spontaneous pneumothorax [^112pc78n]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) rarely present with radiological signs of tension pneumothorax on their initial chest X-ray. Even though these patients may not develop the hemodynamic instability typically seen in tension pneumothorax, the aim of this study is to determine whether the presence of radiological signs of tension pneumothorax in patients with PSP affects their clinical presentation.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study reviews all cases of PSP from January 2007 to December 2014. The cases were divided into two groups: the tension group, which includes cases with radiological signs of tension pneumothorax, and the non-tension group, which includes cases without these signs. The main outcome was a comparison of the hemodynamic status of both groups.

- **Results**: A total of 151 cases of PSP were included in the study. Radiologic signs of tension pneumothorax were identified in 13 cases. Only one case in the tension group developed hemodynamic instability, evidenced by desaturation below 92%, with no statistical difference between the two groups in maintaining hemodynamic stability.

- **Conclusion**: While PSP can present with radiological signs of tension pneumothorax, those patients usually maintain hemodynamic stability. Tension pneumothorax rarely presents as a consequence of PSP.

### Avoid the trap: Nonexpanding lung [^1115wL2w]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Nonexpanding lung is a mechanical complication in which part of the lung is unable to expand to the chest wall, preventing apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura. This can result from various visceral pleural disease processes, including malignant pleural effusion and empyema. Nonexpanding lung can be referred to as trapped lung or lung entrapment, both with distinct clinical features and management strategies.

Early evaluation of pleural effusions is important to address underlying causes of pleural inflammation and to prevent the progression from lung entrapment to trapped lung. Some patients with trapped lung will not experience symptomatic relief with pleural fluid removal. Therefore, misrecognition of trapped lung can result in patients undergoing unnecessary procedures with significant cost and morbidity. We reviewed the understanding of nonexpanding lung, which included causes, common presentations, preventative strategies, and recommendations for clinical care.

### Effect of contrast level and image format on a deep learning algorithm for the detection of pneumothorax with chest radiography [^111FygN1]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). High credibility.

The black-box nature of deep learning models creates uncertainty regarding how changes in contrast level and format affect performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of contrast level and image format on the effectiveness of deep learning for diagnosing pneumothorax on chest radiographs. A total of 3316 images were collected, comprising 1016 pneumothorax images and 2300 normal images. All images were set to a standard contrast level of 100% and stored in Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) and Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) formats. The data were randomly divided into 80% training and 20% test sets. The contrast of images in the test set was adjusted to five levels: 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150%.

The model was trained to detect pneumothorax using ResNet-50 with images at the 100% contrast level and tested on images with the five contrast levels in both formats. When comparing overall performance across each contrast level in the two formats, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was significantly different (all p < 0.001), except between 125% and 150% in the JPEG format (p = 0.382). When comparing the two formats at the same contrast levels, AUC was significantly different (all p < 0.001), except for the 50% and 100% levels (p = 0.079 and p = 0.082, respectively). The contrast level and format of medical images can influence the performance of deep learning models. It is necessary to train models with various contrast levels and formats of images, along with further image processing, to improve and maintain performance.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^1177WCBy]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Pneumothorax in the posteromedial space occurs in the presence of lower lobe collapse or parenchymal diseases. Radiographic findings include a lucent triangle with its vertex in the hilum and a V-shaped base that delineates the costovertebral sulcus. The medial surface of the triangle is the paraspinal line and descending aorta, while the lateral surface is the medial surface of the collapsed lower lobe that is displaced from the midline. CT reveals a collapsed lower lobe anchored to the mediastinum by the inferior pulmonary ligament (IPL) and air collection in the posteromedial space. Pneumomediastinum may mimic pneumothorax in the posteromedial space. The former often continues into the retroperitoneum or extends across the midline, whereas the latter remains above the diaphragm, ends at the costovertebral sulcus, and does not extend across the midline.

- **Pneumothorax in the posteromedial space of an 82-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease**:
	- A supine radiograph shows a lucent triangle (red dotted line) with a partially collapsed left lower lobe (black asterisk). The lucent triangle corresponds to the air collection space with its vertex in the hilum and a V-shaped base that delineates the costovertebral sulcus between the paraspinal line/descending aorta and the medial surface of the partially collapsed lower lobe.
	- An axial CT image of the lung bases shows pneumothorax in the posteromedial space (white asterisk) and the left inferior pulmonary ligament (arrow).

### The empty azygos fissure [^1136wBYm]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

The azygos fissure is typically visible on chest radiography as a right paramediastinal supernumerary line in the projection of the right lung apex. The azygos vein, located at the bottom of the fissure, is visible as a teardrop-shaped opacity. The empty azygos fissure is a rare finding; it is the consequence of the displacement of the azygos vein out of the fissure with a close paramediastinal position. This phenomenon, related to lung collapse, has been described in the literature as the migration of the azygos vein due to various etiologies such as increased intrathoracic pressure, spontaneous or iatrogenic pneumothorax, or even during the sudden development of kyphosis. In our clinical case, the empty azygos fissure developed after drainage of a large right pleural effusion. An empty azygos fissure must therefore suggest a history of pulmonary atelectasis related to pneumothorax or large drained effusion.

### Double-lung point SIGN in traumatic pneumothorax [^116M8RPV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Lung ultrasound has emerged as a rapid and accurate screening tool for pneumothorax. The lung point sign, a sonographic representation of the point on the chest wall where the pleural layers re-adhere, is 100% specific to confirm the diagnosis. A double lung point sign for a single pneumothorax is extremely unusual and has only been reported twice in the literature.

A 49-year-old woman was transported to the emergency department (ED) intubated and sedated with a severe head injury. She remained hemodynamically stable without respiratory compromise throughout her ED course. Chest computed tomography was notable for an anterior left pneumothorax with an underlying pulmonary contusion. Bedside ultrasound of this region revealed a double lung point sign. Our case report is the first to confirm the association of the double lung point sign with a single pneumothorax on corresponding computed tomographic imaging.

### Test-retest reproducibility of a deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm for the chest radiograph [^114JrQxT]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

To perform test-retest reproducibility analyses for a deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm (DLAD), two stationary chest radiographs (CRs) with short-term intervals were utilized. The study aimed to analyze influential factors on test-retest variations and investigate the robustness of DLAD to simulated post-processing and positional changes.

This retrospective study included patients with pulmonary nodules resected in 2017. Preoperative CRs without interval changes were used. Test-retest reproducibility was analyzed in terms of median differences of abnormality scores, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and 95% limits of agreement (LoA). Factors associated with test-retest variation were investigated using univariable and multivariable analyses. Shifts in classification between the two CRs were analyzed using pre-determined cutoffs. Radiograph post-processing (blurring and sharpening) and positional changes (translations in x- and y-axes, rotation, and shearing) were simulated, and agreement of abnormality scores between the original and simulated CRs was investigated.

Our study analyzed 169 patients (median age, 65 years; 91 men). The median difference of abnormality scores was 1–2% and ICC ranged from 0.83 to 0.90. The 95% LoA was approximately ± 30%. Test-retest variation was negatively associated with solid portion size (β, -0.50; p = 0.008) and good nodule conspicuity (β, -0.94; p < 0.001). A small fraction (15/169) showed discordant classifications when the high-specificity cutoff (46%) was applied to the model outputs (p = 0.04). DLAD was robust in maintaining consistent test results across various conditions.

### Are chest radiographs routinely necessary following thoracostomy tube removal [^114Qcp6e]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are routinely obtained at many institutions in all pediatric patients following thoracostomy tube removal to search for pneumothorax (PTX). To aid in evaluating the necessity of this practice, this study investigates whether clinical signs and symptoms may be a sensitive predictor of PTX in such patients.

- **Materials and methods**: Reports from CXRs obtained following chest tube removal in all pediatric patients (374 patients) who underwent cardiac surgery with chest tube placement over 1 year were reviewed. For cases with reported PTX, the PTX was quantified and a chart review was performed to assess whether signs and symptoms of PTX preceded the CXR result.

- **Results**: Fifty-one of 374 children (13.6%) had a radiographically defined PTX within 6 hours after thoracostomy tube removal. The PTX was large (> 40%) in 2 children, moderate (20–40%) in 5 children, and small (< 20%) in 44 children. Symptoms (dyspnea, tachypnea, respiratory distress) or signs (increased oxygen requirement, worsening arterial blood gas, and/or hypotension) of respiratory distress were present at the time of the initial CXR in six of seven patients who later underwent a major clinical intervention, and in one patient who did not. Major clinical interventions were performed in all patients with a large PTX, four of five patients with a moderate PTX, and one patient with a small PTX that later enlarged.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical signs and symptoms identified nearly all patients with significant pneumothoraces. Future prospective investigations may examine reserving chest radiography.

### Pneumothorax: From definition to diagnosis and treatment [^116sR2ub]. Journal of Thoracic Disease (2014). High credibility.

Pneumothorax, a medical condition, can be associated with various symptoms and factors, including hypotension, hyperresonance upon chest wall percussion, subcutaneous emphysema, cyanosis, and atelectasis. Symptoms such as epigastric abdominal pain, tachypnea, dyspnea, and decreased breath sounds are also common. Additionally, it can be linked with absence of lung sliding, presence of the lung point sign, and certain diseases like pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, endometriosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax may also relate to lifestyle factors and conditions such as cigarette smoking, asthma, chest pain, and sweating. Moreover, it may occur in conjunction with serious medical conditions like lung cancer and tuberculosis, and present with characteristic signs such as the halo sign.

### Chest imaging using signs, symbols, and naturalistic images: A practical guide for radiologists and non-radiologists [^115v4m4d]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Several other diseases or abnormalities may produce signs, symbols, and naturalistic figures such as the serpent sign, the water lily sign, the cervicothoracic sign, the hilum overlay sign, the deep sulcus sign, Hampton's hump, and the swiss-cheese sign.

Among these radiological signs, two radiological features have been specifically described for pulmonary hydatid disease: the "serpent sign" and the "water lily sign". Knowledge of these imaging appearances is very important for radiologists, considering that after hepatic localization, the lung is reported as the second most frequent site of hydatid infection. The "water lily sign" is a pathognomonic radiological sign of hydatid infections; it is due to the detachment from the pericyst of the endocyst membrane, which collapses and fluctuates in the hydatid fluid, reproducing the appearance of a water lily. The serpent sign refers to the internal rupture of the hydatid cyst, with the collapse of parasitic membranes into the cyst.

Other signs are very helpful for localization, such as the cervicothoracic sign or the hilum overlay sign, both of which are based on the "silhouette principle". The cervicothoracic sign is used to differentiate if a mass within the superior mediastinum is located anteriorly or posteriorly, whereas the hilum overlay sign allows us to localize an opacity within the hilum, either anterior or posterior to it.

The deep sulcus sign refers to the radiolucency of the cardiophrenic or costophrenic angles in a supine chest X-ray, which is reproduced by…

### The answer may lie in avoiding the underwater seal rather than the chest drainage tube [^114GhFDJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023).

When a patient presents to a health facility with symptoms suggesting a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), a finite amount of time has already passed since the index event of the creation of a visceral pleural defect (T0). When the PSP is diagnosed using radiological tests, an intercostal chest drain (ICD) may be inserted, according to the existing guidelines, at time point T1. Two different events could have occurred between T0 and T1: the pleural defect causing the pneumothorax is either closed because of natural healing or still open.

When the ICD is connected to an underwater seal, the underwater placement acts as a barrier to air entry into the pleural space through the drainage tube had it been left open to the air. The negative pleural pressure during each inspiration results in lung expansion, while it also pulls the water column up the drainage bag to a level numerically equal to the negative pleural pressure. During expiration, the positive pleural pressure drives the accumulated air out through the drainage tube.

If healing of the visceral pleural defect has occurred between T0 and T1, there might be a quick expulsion of air from the pleural cavity through the ICD with successive respiratory cycles over a few minutes to hours. At the end of this variable period, bubbling in the ICD bag would cease. In the other scenario, in which the visceral pleural defect is persistent, air will repeatedly accumulate in the pleural cavity with each inspiration, only to be expelled through the ICD either with each expiration (when the leak is grade 2 according to Cerfolio classification) or during an inadvertent forced expiratory maneuver.

### Primary spontaneous pneumothorax: Treat the patient, not the X-ray [^111pLRmS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In this issue of the journal, Marx and colleagues reported the largest randomized controlled trial on the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). The Comparison of Exsufflation Versus Drainage in Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (EXPRED) trial randomized 402 patients (at a 1:1 ratio) from 31 emergency departments in France to undergo simple aspiration or insertion of a chest tube.

PSP predominantly affects young people with no significant underlying lung diseases. Its diagnosis and monitoring are always made based on imaging, usually with chest X-rays (CXRs). Throughout past decades, clinicians have focused first-line management of PSP on correcting the radiographic abnormality. Prompt and full reexpansion of the lung is considered the key priority. A variety of drainage techniques have been used to evacuate pleural air. Large-bore chest tubes, often aided by suction and obsessive apical positioning of drainage tubes, have become the default practice in many centers to achieve the best radiographic lung expansion.

However, large-bore chest tubes are known to cause pain, and their insertion also poses recognized risks. Less invasive alternative methods to evacuate air have been assessed. Aspiration of the air via different types of needles or small catheters is an attractive option and has been included in clinical guidelines as an alternative to chest tube drainage after several smaller randomized controlled trials showed promising results.

Although clinicians are willing to entertain less invasive options for "smaller" PSP, most still consider it.

### The reverse halo SIGN in emergency chest CT: A diagnostic guide across diverse pulmonary conditions [^111QoQnC]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Vascular causes**:

	- Pulmonary embolism (PE) can lead to wedge-shaped infarcts that manifest as the reverse halo sign (RHS), typically in the posterior or basal segments of the lung. The central ground-glass opacity (GGO) represents ischemic lung parenchyma, and the surrounding consolidation reflects inflammatory hemorrhage or partial necrosis. Clinically, patients with PE often present with acute onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and sometimes signs of right heart strain. They usually have predisposing conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or hypercoagulable states. The PE-related RHS is characteristically wedge-shaped and peripherally distributed. Elevated D-dimer levels and findings on CT pulmonary angiography, such as direct visualization of intraluminal thrombus, further support the diagnosis.

	- **Figures**:
		- Atoll sign in a patient with pulmonary embolism: The patient had been monitored as an inpatient due to arrhythmia and developed chest pain over the past 24 hours. A frontal radiograph shows a peripheral, wedge-shaped opacity in the right mid-lung (white arrow). Sagittal and axial chest CT angiography images demonstrate pulmonary embolism (orange arrows) and a right lower lobe posterior basilar wedge-shaped pulmonary opacity with the atoll sign (red arrows), consistent with pulmonary infarction.

- **Septic pulmonary embolism**:

	- In septic pulmonary embolism, the RHS may indicate infected infarcts. These lesions are typically characterized by cavitation and the presence of multiple peripheral nodular opacities, which suggest an embolic process.

### Is routine chest radiograph necessary after chest tube removal [^114sS6pu]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Obtaining a chest radiograph (CXR) after chest tube (CT) removal to rule out a pneumothorax is a universal practice. However, the yield of this CXR has not been well documented. Additionally, most iatrogenic pneumothoraces resulting from CT removal are atmospheric in origin, asymptomatic, and can be observed. Recently, we have begun to discontinue routine CXR for CT removal. We evaluated our experience with CT removal to clarify the usefulness of routine post-CT removal CXR.

- **Methods**: After IRB approval, a retrospective study was conducted on patients who had a CT placed in the past decade. Cardiac patients requiring a CT were excluded. Patient demographics, diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into two groups: those with a CXR after CT removal (Group 1) and those without (Group 2). Percentages were compared with Chi square with Yates correction.

- **Results**: A total of 462 patients were identified (group 1 = 327, group 2 = 135). Indications for CT included empyema (n = 176), lung resection (n = 146), pneumothorax (n = 71), pleural effusion (n = 26), spinal fusion (n = 20), trauma (n = 16), and miscellaneous (n = 7). Seven patients (2.1%) in group 1 required reinsertion for pneumothorax (n = 4), empyema (n = 2), and pleural effusion (n = 1), compared to 1 patient (0.7%) in group 2 who required reinsertion for pleural effusion. This difference was not significant (P = 0.2).

- **Conclusions**: In non-cardiac patients with a CT, tube reinsertion is uncommon and tube replacement is secondary to symptoms. Therefore, routine post-CT removal CXR is not necessary.

### High-resolution computed tomography of the lungs: The borderlands of normality [^111sYLyh]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is now widely used in the assessment of airways and diffuse lung disease. Considerable literature on pathologic correlation has increased the understanding of the signs of disease seen on HRCT. However, neither the significance of subtle individual signs nor the spectrum of HRCT appearances in healthy lungs is well documented. HRCT signs that cause diagnostic uncertainty and the spectrum of findings that exist between definite normality and definite abnormality are discussed.

### Dark-field chest radiography outperforms conventional chest radiography for the diagnosis and staging of pulmonary emphysema [^115zpNX9]. Investigative Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The differentiation of the CT-based visual emphysema scores may be of high relevance as it is an independent predictor of subsequent progression of emphysema in participants who are former tobacco smokers, with and without COPD. For early stages, the score is based mainly on small, localized changes. Because of the projection in radiography, these changes in lung density are overlaid with the signal from other tissues in the beam path, such as bones and soft tissue.

In contrast to attenuation, the dark-field signal originates from the lung's alveolar structure itself. Other tissues do not generate any signal, and the assessment of structural changes in the lung parenchyma is possible without impeding overlaying signals. This leads to a significantly higher capability for detection of at least mild emphysema with dark-field chest radiography (dfCXR) (AUC = 0.85) than with conventional radiography (AUC = 0.73, P = 0.005).

This is not only of great interest for the early detection of pulmonary emphysema and its predominant corresponding disease, COPD, but it also highlights the potential of dfCXR for lung imaging in general and for possible screening applications in particular. As recent studies have shown, mortality in smokers is increased when emphysema is found in CT, even if there is no obstruction in the spirometry (GOLD 0). Thus, an early detection of these patients is crucial to be able to start preventive interventions, including smoking cessation and other risk factor modifications. Another study found that mortality is also increased in a general population without a significant smoking history.

### Imaging of pleural fluid in healthy individuals [^116reFVZ]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to determine the ability of radiography and ultrasonography to detect normal pleural fluid in healthy individuals and to assess the frequency of this finding.

- **Materials and methods**: Chest ultrasonography of both pleural spaces was performed in a group of 106 healthy volunteers to identify pleural fluid, first in the lateral decubitus position and then leaning on one elbow. Posteroanterior (PA) and lateral decubitus expiratory radiography were subsequently performed. An anechoic layer at least 2 mm thick on chest ultrasonography and a density with a horizontal level at least 3 mm in depth on lateral decubitus radiography were taken as positive results.

- **Results**: On ultrasonography, the fluid layer with a typical wedge-shaped appearance was visible in the pleural space of 28 of 106 (26%) volunteers, on both sides in 17 of 28 (61%) and unilaterally in 11 of 28 (39%). The mean fluid layer thickness in both positions was 2.84 mm (SD 0.41 mm, range 2.0–4.3 mm). Mean thickness in the decubitus position was found to be significantly larger than in the elbow position (P < 0.01). Lateral decubitus expiratory radiography showed physiological pleural fluid in only one case.

- **Conclusion**: Chest ultrasonography is superior to lateral decubitus expiratory chest radiography for demonstrating small amounts of normal pleural fluid in healthy individuals. A positive result, if detected, should not be taken as a sign of occult thoracic disease.

### Interpretation of plain chest roentgenogram [^115ZCAe8]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Plain chest roentgenogram remains the most commonly ordered screening test for pulmonary disorders. Its lower sensitivity demands greater accuracy in interpretation. This greater accuracy can be achieved by adhering to an optimal and organized approach to interpretation. It is important for clinicians not to misread an abnormal chest radiograph (CXR) as normal. Clinicians can only acquire the confidence in making this determination if they read hundreds of normal CXRs. An individual should follow the same systematic approach to reading CXRs each time.

All clinicians must make a concerted effort to read plain CXRs themselves first without reading the radiologist report and then discuss the findings with their radiology colleagues. Looking at the lateral CXR may shed light on 15% of the lung that is hidden from view on the posteroanterior film. Comparing prior films with the recent films is mandatory, when available, to confirm and/or extend differential diagnosis.

This article outlines one of the many systematic approaches to interpreting CXRs and highlights the lesions that are commonly missed. A brief description of the limitations of CXR is also included.

### Plastic bronchitis due to adenoviral infection: a case report [^115JcUj6]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans indicated features of consolidation and progressive worsening, especially in the right upper and both lower lung lobes. Signs of airway obstruction, such as the finger-in-glove pattern or bronchiectasis disappearance, were not obvious (Fig. 1 a-b). Ultrasound examination showed bilateral pleural effusion of approximately 0.77 cm and 1.74 cm thickness on the left and right sides, respectively. Additionally, peritoneal (maximum depth 5.0 cm) and pelvic (maximum depth 2.1 cm) effusions were noted. Thoracentesis was performed 6 days after admission, and approximately 50 mL of slightly turbid, yellowish pleural effusion fluid was collected.

- **Radiology findings**
- a. Chest radiography scan shows consolidation in the right upper and both lower lung lobes.
- b. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan shows consolidation in the right upper and both lower lung lobes.
- c. Chest CT scan shows significant resorption of the consolidated lesions.
- d. Chest CT scan shows an almost complete disappearance of the consolidated lesions.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^114wDRQP]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The subpulmonary space is the second most common area for air collection in supine patients with pneumothorax. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge of the radiographic anatomy of this space, which may lead to a high failure rate in detecting subpulmonary pneumothorax.

Radiographic signs of pneumothorax in the subpulmonary space include a hyperlucent upper quadrant of the abdomen, visualization of the inferior surface of the lung, a sharply outlined diaphragm, sharp delineation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) on the right lung, the "deep sulcus" sign, and the "double diaphragm" sign (Fig. 4). Additionally, the diaphragmatic dome becomes slightly elevated as the lung collapses.

- **Pneumothorax in the subpulmonary space of a 36-year-old woman with interstitial pneumonia**:
	a. A supine radiograph shows a hyperlucent upper quadrant of the abdomen (black asterisk). The inferior surface of the lung (arrowheads), a sharply outlined diaphragm (black arrows), sharp delineation of the IVC (white arrow), and the "deep sulcus" sign (white asterisk) are also visible.
	b. A coronal CT image clearly depicts the inferior surface of the lung (arrowheads), a sharply outlined diaphragm (black arrows), the sharp delineation of the IVC, and the "deep sulcus" sign (white asterisk).

The "deep sulcus" sign appears on radiographs as an abnormal deepening and lucency of the lateral costophrenic sulcus that extends toward the hypochondrium (Fig. 4). This sign is caused by air that collects in the lateral region.

### Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary? A prospective study of 350 cases [^112QdP51]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The study objective was to assess the necessity of routine chest radiography (CXR) after flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with transbronchial biopsy (TBB). Pneumothorax following FB with TBB occurs in 1 to 6% of cases, prompting most pulmonologists to request routine CXR post-procedure to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax.

The study included 350 consecutive patients undergoing FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 hours post-procedure. Recorded data included sex, age, immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies, segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax.

Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 patients (2.9%). Seven of these exhibited symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax prior to CXR, including four patients with large pneumothorax (> 10%). The remaining three patients were asymptomatic, with minimal pneumothorax (≤ 10%) that resolved within 24 to 48 hours.

In conclusion, routine CXR after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients showing symptoms suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and usually minimal, indicating that routine CXR may not be necessary for this group.

### Clamping of chest drain before removal in spontaneous pneumothorax [^112hy7kq]. Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

There are limitations to our study. Firstly, clamped and unclamped cases were not randomized, indicating that comparisons between these two groups, particularly the clinical outcome, should be interpreted with caution. Secondly, being a retrospective study, some data, especially the exact time of cessation of air leak, may not be entirely accurate. Thirdly, there was no standard management protocol, leading to a wide variation in data, such as the timing of chest X-rays (CXR) post-intervention. Fourthly, the vast majority of patients were male, hence the data may not apply to females. Fifthly, mixing up primary and secondary pneumothorax cases in the same cohort may be problematic, as these two disease entities differ in many clinical aspects. Finally, the sample size is not large enough for more stringent statistical handling of the data, so many findings can only be considered preliminary.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of chest radiograph (CXR) findings in COVID-19 [^112twE4E]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Chest radiography (CXR) is most likely to be the utilized modality for diagnosing COVID-19 and following up on any lung-associated abnormalities. This review provides a meta-analysis of the literature on CXR imaging findings to determine the most common appearances of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, equipping medical researchers and healthcare professionals in their efforts to combat this pandemic.

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. The inclusion criteria consisted of:
(1) published in English literature;
(2) original research study;
(3) sample size of at least 5 patients;
(4) reporting clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients as well as CXR imaging features; and
(5) noting the number of patients with each corresponding imaging feature.

A total of 1948 patients were included in this study. To perform the meta-analysis, a random-effects model calculated the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of abnormal CXR imaging findings.

Seventy-four percent (74%) (95% CI: 51–92%) of patients with COVID-19 had an abnormal CXR at the initial time of diagnosis or sometime during the course of the disease. While there was no single feature on CXR that was diagnostic of COVID-19 viral pneumonia, a characteristic set of findings was obvious. The most common abnormalities were consolidation (28%, 95% CI: 8–54%) and ground-glass opacities (29%, 95% CI: 10–53%). The distribution was most frequently bilateral (43%, 95% CI: 27–60%), peripheral (51%, 95% CI: 36–66%), and basal zone (56%, 95% CI: 37–74%) predominant. Contrary to parenchyma…

### Bedside chest radiography [^113hs9qh]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

The bedside chest X-ray (CXR) is an indispensable diagnostic tool for monitoring seriously ill patients in the intensive care unit. The CXR often reveals abnormalities that may not be detected clinically. In addition, bedside CXRs are irreplaceable for detecting the malposition of tubes and lines, as well as identifying associated complications. Although the image quality is often limited, bedside CXRs still provide valuable diagnostic information. The interpretation of bedside CXRs is often challenging and requires extensive radiologic experience to avoid misinterpretation of the wide spectrum of pleural and pulmonary disease. Clinical information is of substantial value for interpreting the frequently nonspecific findings.

### Retrodiaphragmatic portion of the lung: How deep is the posterior costophrenic sulcus on posteroanterior chest radiography [^112sK52i]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

To determine the depth of the posterior costophrenic sulcus (CPS) on posteroanterior (PA) chest radiography in relation to the diaphragmatic dome and lateral CPS, five hundred and forty consecutive PA chest radiographs performed for general health screenings were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 282 radiographs were selected that met the following criteria: visualization of the inferior boundary of the posterior CPS behind the right hemidiaphragm, and no abnormal findings affected the shape and level of the diaphragm. The selected chest radiographs were from 155 men and 127 women with a mean age of 40.7 ± 8.4 years.

On these 282 PA chest radiographs, several measurements were taken: the distances between the right diaphragmatic dome and posterior CPS (total diaphragmatic height), between the diaphragmatic dome and lateral CPS (diaphragmatic dome height), and between the lateral and posterior CPS (posterior CPS depth). In addition, the levels of the right lateral and posterior CPS were scored in relation to the levels of the thoracic and lumbar spines. Relationships between the posterior CPS depth and demographic, physical data, and other radiographic measurements were analyzed.

The mean right posterior CPS depth was 29.2 ± 15.6 mm. The average level of the posterior CPS in relation to the spine was 13.5 ± 0.6, corresponding to the lower half of the L1 vertebral body. The posterior CPS depth tended to be deeper in participants who were taller (r = 0.17, p < 0.01), had a higher body mass index (BMI; r = 0.25, p < 0.01), and a longer total diaphragmatic height.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^113TbBEH]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

When a portable chest radiography is conducted, the x-ray cassette is positioned behind the patient, and skin folds may occur between the chest wall and the cassette. Skin folds are likely to occur in elderly and cachectic patients who have sagging skin. In contrast to the pleural line in pneumothorax, skin folds manifest as a broad radiopaque band that may extend beyond the parietal pleural line or midline, with vascular markings beyond the lines of the folds. Skin folds usually run in pairs or three at a time. Additionally, skin folds may be multiple, bilateral, or may disappear suddenly. A negative Mach effect enhancing the skin folds may be seen. Clothing or bed sheets may also produce a similar artifact.

- **Example of skin fold**: A skin fold mimicking pneumothorax on a radiograph in a 66-year-old woman with glioblastoma. The skin fold appears as a broad radiopaque band (black arrows) that is adjacent to a radiolucent band (white arrows), which reflects a negative Mach band effect in the left lung field on a supine radiograph. It extends beyond the pleural cavity. Vascular markings (black arrowhead) are visible beyond its edge.

- **Interlobar fissures**: In the presence of interlobar pleural effusion or thickening of interlobar or accessory fissures, the interlobar fissures may resemble the visceral pleura seen in pneumothorax. If a normal interlobar fissure is parallel to the x-ray beam, it may be visible and mimic the visceral pleura observed in pneumothorax on radiographs. However, unlike pneumothorax, vascular markings are evident.

### Cabergoline [^11553k2g]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Physicians should use the lowest effective dose of cabergoline for the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders and should periodically reassess the need for continuing therapy with cabergoline. Following treatment initiation, clinical and diagnostic monitoring (for example, chest x-ray, CT scan, and cardiac echocardiogram) should be conducted to assess the risk of cardiac valvulopathy. The recommended frequency of routine echocardiographic monitoring is every 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated with the presence of signs and symptoms such as edema, new cardiac murmur, dyspnea, or congestive heart failure.

Cabergoline should be discontinued if an echocardiogram reveals new valvular regurgitation, valvular restriction, or valve leaflet thickening. Cabergoline should be used with caution in patients exposed to other medications associated with valvulopathy.

- **Extracardiac fibrotic reactions**: Postmarketing cases of pleural, pericardial, and retroperitoneal fibrosis have been reported following the administration of cabergoline. Some reports were in patients previously treated with other ergotinic dopamine agonists. Cabergoline should not be used in patients with a history of cardiac or extracardiac fibrotic disorders.

Fibrotic disorders can have an insidious onset, and patients should be monitored for manifestations of progressive fibrosis. Therefore, during treatment, attention should be paid to the signs and symptoms of pleuro-pulmonary disease such as dyspnea, shortness of breath, persistent cough, or chest pain, as well as renal insufficiency or ureteral/abdominal vascular obstruction.

### Thoracic abnormal air collections in patients in the intensive care unit: Radiograph findings correlated with CT [^114B3nBq]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Air collection in the intrathoracic extrapleural space

The extrapleural space is anatomically part of the chest wall and lies between the parietal pleura and the inner surface of the ribs. It contains extrapleural fat, endothoracic fascia, and the innermost intercostal muscle. The normal extrapleural space is not distinguishable as separate structures on CT images, and it can extend into the mediastinum. Air collection in the extrapleural space is caused by barotrauma, disruption of the tracheobronchial and esophagus, and the extension of air from other areas, such as the neck and retroperitoneum. Although this condition is usually managed with close observation, other treatments may be needed in cases of tracheobronchial tree or esophageal lesions.

Air collection in the extrapleural space appears on radiographs as a lucency, such as visible fascial webs bounded by the pleural line (i.e. consisting of the parietal and visceral pleura). Air collection in the extrapleural space resembles pneumothorax, and the differential diagnosis is very important to avoid unnecessary thoracentesis. Some radiographic findings can help in their differentiation. With air collection in the extrapleural space, visible fascial webs are detected outside of the pleural line, and air distribution does not change with patients' positions. The pleural line is wavier in air collections in the extrapleural space than the typical visceral line in pneumothorax. CT allows for the clear visualization of fascial webs outside of the pleural line.

### Routine chest radiography in uncomplicated suspected acute coronary syndrome rarely yields significant pathology [^115nk29i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and nature of chest radiographic abnormalities in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected acute coronary syndrome but without signs or symptoms of other pathology.

A retrospective study was undertaken of patients presenting to a tertiary referral ED between July 2005 and June 2006. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years and suspected acute coronary syndrome (as defined). Exclusion criteria were any signs or symptoms consistent with other cardio/pulmonary pathology (as defined). The study endpoints were the proportion of patients who had a chest radiograph, the proportion who had an abnormal chest radiograph, the nature of the abnormality, and whether the radiograph changed management.

Of 158 patients who met the entrance criteria, 130 (82.2%, 95% CI 75.2% to 87.7%) underwent chest radiography. In 40 patients (30.8%, 95% CI 23.1% to 39.6%), an abnormality was reported by the radiologist, although most were of no consequence (e.g. previous sternotomy). In three patients, there was documented evidence that the chest radiograph altered management: one was treated for pulmonary oedema, one for pneumonia, and one was investigated further for suspicious hilar nodes. In a further two patients (one with middle lobe collapse and consolidation and one with pulmonary oedema), the chest radiograph may have changed management, although this was not documented.

In conclusion, in the patient group examined, chest radiography resulted in a low yield of unexpected chest pathology. Routine chest radiography for this patient population may not be necessary.

### Clinical analysis of the "small plateau" sign on the flow-volume curve followed by deep learning automated recognition [^112XpMby]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

With the availability of portable spirometers in primary care, forced spirometry (FS) has become easily accessible to all levels of healthcare. However, in clinical practice, most non-professionals lack the ability or experience to identify the configuration of the flow-volume curve, which may lead to the need for a simple and effective approach for visual inspection of the curve.

The application of artificial intelligence in medicine is rising quickly. Deep learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, could provide a simple and useful tool to automate spirogram recognition. Although some simpler computer vision (CV) techniques could also solve the problem, deep learning-based CV methods are able to outperform those traditional CV and signal processing methods in most scenarios. This is because the deep learning model often encompasses a large parameter space and does not require hand-crafted features but instead automatically learns appropriate features. These characteristics give the deep learning model a stronger capacity to model the task and better generalization abilities compared to traditional methods. Since deep learning has produced promising results in tackling the display of the curve, we hypothesize that the application of deep learning is ideal for the automatic recognition of the SP sign.

In trying to analyze the potential use of the SP sign as a negative marker for airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in patients with suspected asthma, we retrospectively reviewed the characteristics of the SP sign in bronchial provocation tests (BPT). Since an FEV₁ < 60% predicted is a contraindication, further research is needed to explore these aspects comprehensively.

### Community-acquired pneumonia visualized on CT scans but not chest radiographs: Pathogens, severity, and clinical outcomes [^113hN54e]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of pneumonia visualized on a CT scan in the presence of a normal chest radiograph is uncertain.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we compared the presenting clinical features, pathogens present, and outcomes of patients with pneumonia visualized on a CT scan but not on a chest radiograph (CT-only pneumonia) and those with pneumonia visualized on a chest radiograph. All patients underwent chest radiography; the decision to obtain CT imaging was made by the treating clinicians. Chest radiographs and CT images were interpreted by study-dedicated thoracic radiologists who were blinded to the clinical data.

- **Results**: The study population included 2,251 adults with CAP; 2,185 patients (97%) had pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, whereas 66 patients (3%) had pneumonia visualized on a CT scan but not on chest radiography. Overall, these patients with CT-only pneumonia had a clinical profile similar to those with pneumonia visualized on chest radiography. This included comorbidities, vital signs, hospital length of stay, prevalence of viral (30% vs 26%) and bacterial (12% vs 14%) pathogens, ICU admission (23% vs 21%), use of mechanical ventilation (6% vs 5%), septic shock (5% vs 4%), and in-hospital mortality (0% vs 2%).

- **Conclusions**: Adults hospitalized with CAP who showed radiological evidence of pneumonia on a CT scan but not on a chest radiograph had pathogens, disease severity, and outcomes similar to patients who had signs of pneumonia visible on a chest radiograph.

### Deep learning for chest x-ray diagnosis: Competition between radiologists with or without artificial intelligence assistance [^117A4wrP]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Using the relabeling procedure, the radiologists' performance improved for six signs and worsened for six signs. The AI performed significantly worse than the radiologists in aortic calcification, calcification, cavity, nodule, pleural thickening, and rib fracture recognition, and the prevalence of all of these signs — except nodules — was low in the original training set. However, in pneumothorax and subphrenic free air recognition, the AI performed as well as the radiologists, even though the prevalence of these signs in the original training set was low. In the recognition of normal, fibrosis, heart shadow enlargement, mass, pleural effusion, and pulmonary consolidation, the AI performed better than the radiologists.

### Diagnostic accuracy of oblique chest radiograph for occult pneumothorax: Comparison with ultrasonography [^116PDgp2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, the false positives of ultrasound (US) for pneumothorax may stem from pleural adhesion with tuberculous pleuritis that were blocking lung sliding. A judgment of pneumothorax by US requires attention in Japan and developing countries where tuberculosis is more common compared to Western countries. Chest tube insertion for a patient with pleural adhesion is dangerous, especially using the Seldinger technique. Other causes of absent sliding signs include lung contusion, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a giant bulla, unilateral intubation, fibroid lung, and atelectasis lung.

Subcutaneous emphysema is a finding suggestive of pneumothorax; however, it may produce comet-tail artifacts that have the potential of causing false negatives. The oblique chest radiograph (OXR) had high specificity; however, there were two false positive cases in this study. The positive finding of OXR is a collapsed lung surface (visceral pleural line) visible on X-rays. In the false positive case, a large breast was visualized by mimicking the visceral pleural line. When this false positive image of OXR was retrospectively evaluated, the presence of the lung marking distal to the false visceral pleural line could be detected. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the pleural visceral line but also the presence of lung marking.

The majority of false negative cases of both US and OXR were minuscule pneumothoraces. It is difficult to detect minuscule pneumothorax; however, this may be of low importance because most patients do not require thoracostomy.

### Derivation of a decision instrument for selective chest radiography in blunt trauma [^117TGzJv]. The Journal of Trauma (2011). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "NEXUS criteria for chest X-ray in blunt chest trauma" assists in evaluating patients with blunt cardiac injury, blunt chest trauma, traumatic thoracic aortic injury, and clavicle fracture.

The NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument (NEXUS Chest X-ray) serves as a clinical calculator for patients who have experienced blunt chest trauma. This scoring system identifies patients at low risk of injury who may not require imaging, specifically chest X-ray, thus reducing unnecessary radiation exposure and healthcare costs.

The NEXUS Chest X-ray applies to patients who have sustained blunt chest trauma, often resulting from incidents such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, or physical assaults.

- **Clinical utility**: This calculator aids in the decision-making process regarding chest X-ray necessity, based on the presence or absence of specific criteria. These criteria include age over 60, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, altered mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness in the chest wall, sternum, thoracic spine, or scapula. Patients who meet none of these criteria are considered at low risk for significant injury and may not require a chest X-ray. However, the decision to forego imaging should always involve clinical judgment.

The NEXUS Chest X-ray is inappropriate for patients with penetrating chest trauma or a known history of chest injury.

### Training physicians in India to interpret pediatric chest radiographs according to World Health Organization research methodology [^112ur1Zq]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

All participants completed a pretraining examination after listening to introductory presentations on the overall background and goals of the associated research projects. The examination comprised sixty WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies and WHO reference chest radiographs, which had been previously adjudicated by a panel of experts and determined to have high agreement amongst the expert panel for findings of interest, including either primary endpoint pneumonia, other infiltrate, neither, or uninterpretable.

High agreement was defined in the WHO Chest Radiography in Epidemiological Studies set of images as greater than 66% agreements among an expert panel. However, in the WHO reference images, this level of agreement was not explicitly defined. The sixty images were selected based on balancing the desire to have a representative distribution of image classifications and a reasonable examination length.

To ensure consistency with the post-test examination — where the goal was to test participants on their ability to correctly identify images with and without primary endpoint pneumonia — we intentionally selected an image distribution for each test in which approximately half of the images were positive for primary endpoint pneumonia. This classification was based on a variety of features such as silhouette sign, pleural effusion, or endpoint consolidation.

Test participants were permitted to refer to decision-support tools designed by E.D.M., although these tools had not yet been formally introduced to the participants.

### Novel imaging detailing the origins of a pneumothorax [^113JHE4X]. Thorax (2018). Low credibility.

This prospective clinical study introduces a method for visualizing the location of an air leak and identifying the bulla responsible using three-dimensional (3-D) cine CT. Dynamic 320-detector row CT was performed on 10 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. A 0.9% saline solution was injected into the affected pleural cavity via a preplaced chest tube. In eight cases, 3-D cine CT thoracography successfully revealed the location of the air leak and identified the responsible bulla. In seven cases, the air stream sign was noted, while in one case, there was repeated collapse and expansion of a bulla with the patient's breathing.

### Bedside chest ultrasound in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgery patients: Comparison with bedside chest radiography [^112TUrJU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Low credibility.

The primary objective was to study the degree of agreement between chest ultrasound (CUS) and chest X-ray (CXR) studies in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients, focusing on the diagnosis of thoracic abnormalities. Additionally, the study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of CUS relative to CXR for detecting thoracic abnormalities. The secondary objective was to evaluate the necessity for interventions based on CUS and CXR findings in the postoperative setting.

- **Design**: A prospective observational study conducted at a postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary-care center.

- **Participants**: One hundred sixty patients, aged 2 months to 18 years, undergoing elective cardiac surgery for various congenital heart diseases.

- **Interventions**: After obtaining permission from the institutional ethics committee, 160 pediatric cardiac surgical patients were studied prospectively in the postoperative period. On the day of surgery (postoperative day [POD] 0), a bedside CXR was performed in the immediate postoperative period. Following the CXR, a CUS examination was conducted and interpreted by the principal investigator, while the CXR was interpreted by the surgical team. A provisional diagnosis was made by the principal investigator and the surgical team, with necessary interventions based on CXR, CUS findings, or both. The procedure was repeated on the morning of POD 1.

- **Measurements and main results**: The degree of agreement between CUS and CXR studies in detecting abnormalities was evaluated using Cohen's kappa coefficient.

### A straight left heart border: a new radiological sign of a hemopericardium [^114bZgkX]. World Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Detection of a cardiac injury in a stable patient following a penetrating chest injury can be difficult. Ultrasound of the pericardial sac may be associated with a false negative result in the presence of a hemothorax. A filling in of the left heart border inferior to the pulmonary artery, called the straight left heart border (SLHB), is a radiological sign on chest X-ray that we have found to be associated with the finding of a hemopericardium at surgery. The aim of the present study was to determine if this was a reliable and reproducible sign.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study of patients with a penetrating chest injury admitted between 1 October 2001 and 28 February 2009, who had no indication for immediate surgery, and were taken to the operating room for creation of a subxiphoid pericardial window (SPW). The chest X-ray was reviewed by a single trauma surgeon prior to surgery.

- **Results**: A total of 162 patients with a possible occult cardiac injury underwent creation of a SPW. Fifty-five of the 162 patients (34%) were noted to have a SLHB on chest X-ray and a hemopericardium confirmed at SPW. The sensitivity of the SLHB sign was 40%; specificity, 84%; and positive predictive value, 89% [p = 0.005, odds ratio 3.48, lower 1.41, upper 8.62].

- **Conclusions**: The straight left heart border is a newly described radiological sign that was highly significant in predicting the presence of a hemopericardium and should alert the clinician to a possible occult cardiac injury.

### Failure of detection of pneumothorax on initial chest radiograph [^111UsEp6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2002). Low credibility.

### A method to detect occult pneumothorax with chest radiography [^116FqzKg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Small pneumothoraces are often not visible on supine screening chest radiographs because they develop anteriorly to the lung. These pneumothoraces are termed occult and account for an astonishingly high 52% to 63% of all traumatic pneumothoraces. A 19-year-old obese woman was involved in a head-on car accident. The admission anteroposterior chest radiographs were unremarkable. Because of the presence of right chest tenderness and an abrasion, we suspected the presence of a pneumothorax. Thus, we decided to take a supine oblique chest radiograph of the right side of the thorax, which clearly revealed a visceral pleural line, consistent with a diagnosis of traumatic pneumothorax.

A pneumothorax may be present when a supine chest radiograph reveals either an apparent deepening of the costophrenic angle (the "deep sulcus sign") or the presence of two diaphragm-lung interfaces (the "double diaphragm sign"). However, in practice, supine chest radiographs have poor sensitivity for occult pneumothoraces. Oblique chest radiography is a useful and fast screening tool that should be considered for cases of blunt chest trauma, especially when the transportation of critically ill patients to the computed tomographic suite is dangerous or when imminent transfer to another hospital is being arranged, making early diagnosis of an occult pneumothorax essential.
