## Question

ADHD medication for patient with hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage ADHD medications in patients with hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline cardiovascular risk profile and whether hypertension is controlled. Then, I should verify the expected hemodynamic effects of stimulant versus non-stimulant ADHD medications. Next, I will review the long-term cardiovascular risk data, especially for hypertension and arterial disease. After that, I need to check guideline-based screening and monitoring recommendations. Then, I will consider medication selection strategies, including first-line and alternatives, and how to titrate safely. Finally, I should confirm special populations, drug–drug interactions, and a practical decision framework with shared decision-making and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the baseline assessment priorities: I need to establish whether the patient's hypertension is controlled, what the current blood pressure and heart rate are, whether there is target-organ damage, and what other cardiovascular risk factors or comorbidities exist, because these will shape both the choice of ADHD medication and the intensity of monitoring. I should also review personal and family history for structural heart disease, arrhythmias, syncope, or sudden cardiac death, and document baseline vitals before any ADHD pharmacotherapy is initiated [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c].

> Wait, let me verify the expected hemodynamic effects of stimulants. Multiple authoritative sources converge on modest average increases with methylphenidate and amphetamines of about 2–4 mmHg in systolic/diastolic blood pressure and 3–6 bpm in heart rate, with a subset of patients experiencing larger increases, which is why monitoring is essential even when the mean change seems small [^7037328c] [^d15e5e5b] [^999e393a]. I should double-check that these effects are consistent across formulations; yes, FDA labeling for multiple stimulant products repeats the same magnitude of average effects and the need for vigilance in those with preexisting hypertension or heart disease [^7037328c] [^d15e5e5b] [^999e393a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about long-term outcomes. I need to check the highest-quality longitudinal data. A 2024 Swedish nested case-control study with 14-year follow-up found a dose–response increase in cardiovascular disease with longer cumulative ADHD medication use, driven primarily by hypertension and arterial disease, with a 23% higher CVD risk after more than 5 years of use and a 4% per year increase in risk during the first 3 years. Importantly, the risk appeared similar in those with and without preexisting CVD, though confounding and surveillance differences complicate interpretation [^23f2ef2f] [^ef54d607]. Let me reconsider whether other meta-analyses contradict this; several large observational meta-analyses found no statistically significant increase in composite CVD, but could not exclude modest risk and highlighted heterogeneity and potential for confounding, so the signal for hypertension and arterial disease remains plausible and clinically meaningful in shared decision-making [^f817d79e] [^7087d05a] [^d6f9ebe0].

> Next, I should review guideline-based screening and monitoring. The AAP recommends obtaining personal and family cardiac history, performing a focused physical exam, and considering an ECG if risk factors are present. Routine ECG for all is not required, but I need to ensure I do not miss red flags like structural heart disease or arrhythmias that would shift risk–benefit unfavorably [^0981a0d3]. I should confirm that baseline and periodic blood pressure and heart rate checks are advised for all patients on ADHD medications, and that this is especially critical in those with hypertension; yes, both AAP and FDA guidance emphasize scheduled vitals monitoring and dose adjustment if clinically significant increases occur [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c].

> I will now examine medication selection strategy. If hypertension is uncontrolled, I should prioritize non-stimulant options such as atomoxetine or extended-release guanfacine/clonidine, because stimulants can exacerbate blood pressure and heart rate. Atomoxetine can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients, so I need to monitor closely, whereas guanfacine and clonidine tend to lower blood pressure and heart rate and may even have antihypertensive benefit, though sedation and rebound hypertension on abrupt withdrawal are concerns requiring slow tapering when discontinuing [^a36428a8] [^c089b648] [^ad882031]. But wait, what if ADHD symptoms are severe and stimulants are indispensable? In controlled hypertension, carefully selected stimulants can be used with enhanced monitoring, dose minimization, and coordination with the treating physician for blood pressure management, recognizing that the average pressor effect is modest but individual responses vary [^7037328c] [^d15e5e5b].

> Let me think about titration and monitoring cadence. I should start low, go slow, and recheck blood pressure and heart rate within 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose changes, then at each visit until stable, and at least annually thereafter. If increases exceed about 10–15 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic, I should consider dose reduction, switching formulation, or switching class, and coordinate with the primary care or cardiology team to optimize antihypertensive therapy and lifestyle measures [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c]. I should double-check that home blood pressure logs are encouraged when feasible to distinguish white-coat effects and guide timely adjustments [^f20b1974].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and comorbidities. In older adults, the background CVD risk is higher and stimulant-associated hypertension may carry more consequence, so I should have a lower threshold to choose non-stimulants or use the lowest effective stimulant dose with close monitoring. In patients with established CVD, stimulants are generally avoided unless benefits clearly outweigh risks and a cardiologist is involved. In pregnancy, data are limited and shared decision-making with maternal–fetal medicine is essential. In patients with substance use disorder, careful misuse risk assessment and consideration of abuse-deterrent formulations or non-stimulants is prudent [^7037328c] [^a6a810e4] [^24351e3c]. Hold on, I should verify that guanfacine and clonidine require tapering to avoid rebound hypertension; yes, FDA labeling and neurology guidelines emphasize gradual dose reduction for alpha-2 agonists [^ad882031] [^6406d5e3].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interactions and practical co-management. Stimulants can theoretically counteract antihypertensive effects, so I should coordinate with the prescriber of blood pressure medications, consider once-daily, longer-acting antihypertensives to smooth control, and avoid abrupt withdrawal of centrally acting agents like clonidine or guanfacine that can precipitate rebound hypertension. If stimulant intoxication is a concern, I must avoid beta-blockers that risk unopposed alpha stimulation and instead use short-acting vasodilators or alpha-2 agonists in monitored settings [^ad882031] [^c74a09c8] [^00de8019]. I should confirm that NSAIDs, decongestants, and some antidepressants can worsen blood pressure and should be minimized in patients with resistant hypertension, which is relevant when reviewing the full medication list [^a2aee3a4].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework. If hypertension is uncontrolled, I should defer stimulants and start a non-stimulant with baseline and serial vitals, reassessing control of both ADHD and blood pressure over 4–6 weeks. If hypertension is controlled, I can consider a stimulant with explicit informed consent about pressor effects, institute close monitoring, and set a low threshold to adjust or switch if blood pressure rises meaningfully. Throughout, I should document baseline vitals, counseling, and the shared decision-making discussion that balances ADHD functional impairment against cardiovascular risk, and I should revisit this balance at least annually or when clinical status changes [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c].

> Finally, I should double-check that my bottom line aligns with the evidence. The average blood pressure and heart rate increases with stimulants are modest, but clinically important increases occur in a minority and long-term use is associated with higher risks of hypertension and arterial disease, so individualized risk–benefit assessment, careful selection and titration, and proactive monitoring are the cornerstones of safe care in patients with hypertension who need ADHD treatment [^7037328c] [^23f2ef2f] [^0981a0d3].

In patients with hypertension and ADHD, **stimulants are not absolutely contraindicated** but require caution due to modest increases in blood pressure and heart rate (about 2–4 mmHg and 3–6 bpm on average) [^7037328c] [^d15e5e5b]. Non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine) are **preferred when hypertension is uncontrolled or cardiovascular risk is high**, as they have minimal or beneficial effects on blood pressure [^a36428a8] [^7b8101ac]. If stimulants are used, start low, titrate slowly, and monitor blood pressure and heart rate at baseline and each visit; avoid stimulants in severe or uncontrolled hypertension, and coordinate with cardiology when risk is elevated [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c]. Long-term stimulant use may increase cardiovascular risk, so reassess periodically and prioritize non-stimulants or behavioral therapy when feasible [^23f2ef2f] [^5b5eb27a].

## Cardiovascular effects of ADHD medications

ADHD medications include stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) and non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine, clonidine). Stimulants increase **sympathetic activity**, modestly raising blood pressure and heart rate on average by 2–4 mmHg and 3–6 bpm, respectively [^7037328c] [^d15e5e5b]. Non-stimulants have different profiles: atomoxetine can increase blood pressure and heart rate in some patients, whereas guanfacine and clonidine typically lower them and may be beneficial in hypertensive patients [^c089b648] [^7b8101ac].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized risk–benefit assessment** and careful monitoring:

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiovascular history before starting ADHD medication [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c].
- **Monitoring**: Check blood pressure and heart rate at each visit, especially after dose changes [^0981a0d3] [^7037328c].
- **Medication selection**: Prefer non-stimulants in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or high cardiovascular risk; consider stimulants only if benefits outweigh risks and hypertension is well controlled [^a6a810e4] [^e2559bad].
- **Dose titration**: Start low, titrate slowly, and adjust based on blood pressure response and clinical need [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with stimulant medications in hypertensive patients

Stimulants can cause clinically meaningful blood pressure increases in some patients, particularly with higher doses or prolonged use. Long-term use has been associated with a modestly increased risk of cardiovascular events, including hypertension and arterial disease, especially with stimulants [^23f2ef2f] [^ef54d607]. However, **absolute risk remains low**, and many patients with controlled hypertension tolerate stimulants without significant adverse effects [^f817d79e] [^7087d05a].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

Non-stimulant medications are **preferred alternatives** for patients with hypertension:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Effect on blood pressure** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Atomoxetine | Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor | Modest increase in BP/HR | Monitor BP/HR; avoid in severe hypertension |
| Guanfacine | Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist | Lowers BP/HR | Sedation, fatigue, rebound hypertension if stopped abruptly |
| Clonidine | Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist | Lowers BP/HR | Sedation, fatigue, rebound hypertension if stopped abruptly |

---

## Clinical management strategies

When treating ADHD in hypertensive patients, **clinicians should**:

- **Control hypertension**: Optimize antihypertensive therapy before starting ADHD medication [^a6a810e4].
- **Start low, go slow**: Begin at the lowest effective dose and titrate slowly, monitoring blood pressure and heart rate at each visit [^0981a0d3].
- **Adjust therapy**: Modify ADHD medication or antihypertensive therapy if significant blood pressure increases occur [^e2559bad].
- **Educate patients**: Inform patients about symptoms of hypertension and when to seek medical attention [^notfound].
- **Coordinate care**: Collaborate with cardiology or primary care for patients with complex cardiovascular profiles [^c407acc1].

---

## Long-term cardiovascular outcomes

Long-term stimulant use is associated with a modestly increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly hypertension and arterial disease, with risk rising with duration of use [^23f2ef2f] [^ef54d607]. However, **absolute risk remains low**, and many patients benefit from continued ADHD treatment with appropriate monitoring [^f817d79e] [^7087d05a].

---

## Special considerations

- **Severe or uncontrolled hypertension**: Avoid stimulants; prioritize non-stimulants or behavioral therapy [^e2559bad].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Use caution with stimulants; consider cardiology consultation [^7037328c].
- **Pediatric patients**: Monitor growth, blood pressure, and heart rate regularly; non-stimulants may be preferred in those with hypertension [^0981a0d3] [^a36428a8].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Non-stimulants**: Preferred in patients with uncontrolled hypertension or high cardiovascular risk [^notfound].
- **Stimulants**: Use cautiously in controlled hypertension, with close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate [^7037328c].
- **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiovascular symptoms [^0981a0d3].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor treatment to patient-specific risk factors, comorbidities, and treatment response [^14d64aa9].

---

ADHD medications can be used in hypertensive patients with careful monitoring and individualized risk assessment. Non-stimulants are **preferred in uncontrolled hypertension**, while stimulants may be used cautiously in controlled cases. Regular monitoring and coordination with cardiology or primary care are essential to ensure safe and effective treatment.

### Novel treatments for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children [^60dc87b9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Optimal medications for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be effective, well tolerated, and long acting and not cause mood swings or worsen comorbid conditions. Current medications work on brain dopamine and/or norepinephrine systems, which are thought to be involved in ADHD. The medication class with the most evidence of efficacy in ADHD is stimulants, but they may be abused, are effective for only 4 to 12 hours, and may cause mood swings or increase tic severity. In recent years, alternative treatments have been explored. Tricyclic antidepressants have efficacy comparable to that of stimulants but may cause constipation, dry mouth, tremors, blood pressure changes, and potentially serious side effects including cardiac conduction and repolarization delays. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may improve ADHD symptoms but are associated with severe dietary restrictions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have little or no effect in ADHD but may improve comorbid depression. Bupropion, although less effective than stimulants, may improve both ADHD symptoms and comorbid depression. Antihypertensive agents may improve impulsivity, hyperactivity, and comorbid tics but cause sedation or rebound hypertension. Atomoxetine, which is being developed for ADHD, reduces symptoms of ADHD without exacerbating comorbid conditions and is associated with only minor side effects, including subtle changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Before prescribing a treatment, physicians should consider the appropriateness and effectiveness of any medication for children with ADHD, who may be less tolerant of side effects and less able to monitor and express concerns about their well-being than adults.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder afflicting adults worldwide. This article is an update on the evidence supporting medications for adult ADHD, with particular emphasis on cardiovascular implications. Relevant clinical literature was sought using PubMed searches, with an emphasis on new reports from April 2009 to April 2011. This review describes the efficacy and general tolerability of stimulant and nonstimulant medications for adults with ADHD as seen in contemporary clinical trials. Cardiovascular response to medications for ADHD is primarily seen in heart rate and blood pressure elevations, while less is known about the etiology of rare cardiovascular events or long-term sequelae. Further research is indicated to delineate clinical and functional outcomes for adults with ADHD, as well as long-term safety of medication treatment.

### Cardiovascular risk of stimulant treatment in pediatric attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: update and clinical recommendations [^5f551ecd]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This review provides an update on the cardiovascular impact of therapeutic stimulant-class medication for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Relevant clinical literature was ascertained using PubMed searches limited to human studies and the English language as of May 2011. Current practice guidelines and consensus statements also were reviewed.

Results

Stimulant-class medications for healthy children and adolescents with ADHD are associated with mean elevations in blood pressure (≤ 5 mmHg) and heart rate (≤ 10 beats/min) without changes in electrocardiographic parameters. A subset (5–15%) of children and adolescents treated may have a greater increase in heart rate or blood pressure at a given assessment or may report a cardiovascular-type complaint during stimulant treatment. It is extremely rare for a child or adolescent receiving stimulant medication to have a serious cardiovascular event during treatment, with the risk appearing similar to groups of children not receiving stimulant medication.

Conclusions

Clinicians should adhere to current recommendations regarding the prescription of stimulant medications for youth with ADHD. Scientific inquiry is indicated to identify patients at heightened risk and to continue surveillance for the longer-term cardiovascular impact of these agents.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases [^9fb114a6]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this population-based case-control study with a longitudinal follow-up of 14 years suggested that long-term use of ADHD medication was associated with an increased risk of CVD, especially hypertension and arterial disease, and the risk was higher for stimulant medications. These findings highlight the importance of carefully weighing potential benefits and risks when making treatment decisions on long-term ADHD medication use. Clinicians should be vigilant in monitoring patients, particularly among those receiving higher doses, and consistently assess signs and symptoms of CVD throughout the course of treatment. Monitoring becomes even more crucial considering the increasing number of individuals engaging in long-term use of ADHD medication.

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with medications used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^31c9fca8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, is characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms starting in childhood. The symptoms often persist into adulthood, and even into older age for a substantial number of patients. ADHD medications, including both stimulants and nonstimulants, are recommended for pharmacological treatment of ADHD, and the prevalence of ADHD medication use among both children and adults has increased substantially in many countries.

While evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) suggests ADHD medications are efficacious in reducing core ADHD symptoms, there are concerns about their cardiovascular safety. As ADHD medications are sympathomimetic agents that exert dopaminergic and noradrenergic effects, increasing heart rate and blood pressure is biologically plausible. A previous Cochrane review of RCTs found that the stimulant methylphenidate was associated with increased pulse or heart rate. However, as these RCTs could only evaluate short-term effects, it remains uncertain whether these changes led to a clinically significant risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over time. Longitudinal observation studies evaluating serious cardiovascular outcomes associated with ADHD medication use have emerged during the last decade, but with mixed findings. A review paper incorporating five large population-based studies in the US reported no association between stimulants and serious cardiovascular events in children. A meta-analysis of only 3 studiesfound no increased risk of arrhythmic and ischemic cardiac events but a decreased risk of stroke. A more recent meta-analysis of 10 studiesshowed a positive association between ADHD medications and risk of sudden death or arrhythmia but not for stroke, myocardial infarction, or all-cause mortality. However, it had several methodology limitations (eg, not preregistered, narrow outcome definition, and missing several important studies). Moreover, several new original studies have been published after these meta-analyses. Thus, an updated synthesis is needed to address those limitations as well as to include a broader range of cardiovascular events (eg, hypertension, heart failure, and transient ischemic attack that have not been included in previous meta-analyses) and conduct sub-analyses by type of cardiovascular events and ADHD medications. In addition, observational studies that evaluate the benefits or risks of medical treatments are prone to bias (eg, immortal time bias, prevalent user bias, confounding by indication) if not conducted appropriately. It is therefore critical to make a rigorous quality assessment of the available studies and discuss common problems that future studies need to address. Understanding whether, and to what extent, ADHD medications are associated with CVD is highly relevant from both clinical and public health perspectives, as an increasing number of individuals are receiving ADHD medications globally. Findings of any significant association would prompt research on underlying causal mechanisms (eg, dopaminergic dysfunction and alterations in cytochrome P450 2D6 metabolism).

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases [^ced6e8a5]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate inattentiveness, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Pharmacological therapy, including both stimulants and nonstimulants, is recommended as the first-line treatment for ADHD in many countries. The use of ADHD medication has increased greatly in both children and adults during the past decades. Although the effectiveness of ADHD medications has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and other studies, concerns remain regarding their potential cardiovascular safety. Meta-analyses of RCTs have reported increases in heart rate and blood pressure associated with both stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medications.,

As RCTs typically evaluate short-term effects (average treatment duration of 75 days), it remains uncertain whether and to what extent the increases in blood pressure and heart rate associated with ADHD medication lead to clinically significant cardiovascular disease (CVD) over time. Longitudinal observational studies, examining the association between ADHD medication use and serious cardiovascular outcomes have emerged in recent years, but the findings have been mixed. A meta-analysisof observational studies found no statistically significant association between ADHD medication and risk of CVD. However, the possibility of a modest risk increase cannot be ruled out due to several methodological limitations in these studies, including confounding by indication, immortal time bias, and prevalent user bias. Additionally, most of these studies had an average follow-up time of no more than 2 years. Thus, evidence regarding the long-term cardiovascular risk of ADHD medication use is still lacking.

Examining the long-term cardiovascular risk associated with ADHD medicine use is clinically important given that individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD, regardless of whether they receive treatment, face an elevated risk of CVD. Additionally, a substantial proportion of young individuals with ADHD continues to have impairing symptoms in adulthood, necessitating prolonged use of ADHD medication. Notably, studies have indicated a rising trend in the long-term use of ADHD medications, with approximately half of individuals using ADHD medication for over 5 years. Furthermore, evidence is lacking regarding how cardiovascular risk may vary based on factors such as type of CVD, type of ADHD medication, age, and sex. Therefore, there is a need for long-term follow-up studies to address these knowledge gaps and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cardiovascular risks associated with ADHD medication use. This information is also crucial from a public health perspective, particularly due to the increasing number of individuals receiving ADHD medications worldwide.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e2559bad]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline — Table 11 — medications and other substances that may cause elevated blood pressure details management strategies: For alcohol, options include abstinence or limit alcohol to ≤ 1 drink daily for women and ≤ 2 drinks daily for men. For caffeine, limit caffeine intake to < 300 mg/d, and avoid more than 1 cup daily in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension. For decongestants, use for shortest duration possible and avoid in severe or uncontrolled hypertension, with consideration of alternative therapies (nasal saline, intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamines) as appropriate. For NSAIDs and acetaminophen, avoid systemic NSAIDs when possible, limit acetaminophen to less than 4 g/d, and consider alternative analgesics (e.g., topical NSAIDs) depending on indication and risk. For sudden withdrawal of central-acting sympathetic drugs such as clonidine and tizanidine, recommend avoiding oral clonidine for treatment of hypertension whenever possible and tapering upon discontinuation; use cyclobenzaprine or other muscle relaxants instead of tizanidine. For amphetamines, discontinue or decrease dose and consider behavioral therapies or nonstimulants (such as guanfacine) for ADHD. For antidepressants, consider alternative agents (e.g. SSRIs) depending on indication and avoid tyramine-containing foods with MAOIs. For atypical antipsychotics, discontinue or limit use when possible, consider behavior therapy where appropriate, recommend lifestyle modification (Section 5.1 "Lifestyle and Psychosocial Approaches"), and consider alternative agents associated with lower risk of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. For immunosuppressants, consider converting to tacrolimus, which may be associated with fewer effects on BP. For oral contraceptives, use low-dose agents (e.g., 20–30 mcg ethinyl estradiol) or a progestin-only form, or consider alternative forms of birth control (barrier, abstinence, nonhormonal IUD), and avoid use in women with uncontrolled hypertension. For androgen deprivation therapy, avoid or limit use when possible and consider alternative chemotherapy.

Most included studies investigated both the effectiveness and AEs of stimulants (69 trials [74.2%],) in male patients (67.4% [n = 11 034] of the overall population) with ADHD alone (77 trials [82.7%]). Additionally, fixed dosing regimens of stimulants (ie, all participants receiving the same predetermined doses within each study) were used in 86 RCTs (92.4%). Among the stimulants, methylphenidate was used in 60 trials (64.5%), of which 20 (23.6%), had the osmotic-release oral system (OROS) formulation. Regarding study duration, 21 RCTs (22.5%), had a 4-week duration, 13 (13.9%), had a 6-week duration, and other trials spanned variable periodsup to 52 weeks. Therefore, the results were limited to AEs occurring within approximately 1 year after stimulant use. None of the included trials reported growth assessments or growth delays as noted AEs.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the athlete: an American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^df506567]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD pharmacotherapy utilization, effectiveness, and safety — stimulants: Approximately 56% of patients with ADHD receive pharmacologic treatment, and a majority of medications used are stimulants, and stimulant medications have been found to be helpful in over 75% of the patients receiving them. Many stimulants utilized in treating ADHD increase core temperature, possibly increasing risk of heat injury, and these agents may also mask signs and symptoms of fatigue and allow for a longer duration of exercise with elevated temperature > 40°C; in situations of increased exogenous heat stress, team physicians should use special caution in prescribing stimulant medications. Contraindications to the use of stimulant medications include hypertension, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, symptomatic cardiovascular disease, structural heart disease, psychosis, stimulant hypersensitivity, history of drug dependence, and concomitant use of a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or St. John's Wort.

### Investigation and management of resistant hypertension: British and Irish hypertension society position statement [^66c0f927]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Physical inactivity

Both reduced physical activity and lower physical fitness are independent risk factors for hypertension. Although the data to show a correlation between physical inactivity and RH are limited, the prevalence of self-reported physical inactivity is high in people with RH (~40%). There is good evidence supporting the benefits of exercise therapy for hypertension, and several studies have reported benefits of exercise therapy among people with RH.

Alcohol

A causal association between alcohol consumption and increased BP has been established by RCTs and Mendelian randomisation studies. Around a third of people with RH have a history of excessive alcohol intake, and people who consume excess alcohol are more likely to develop RH during treatment for hypertension.

Exclude drug-induced hypertension

Many therapeutic agents increase BP and render hypertensive patients apparently resistant to BP lowering treatments. It is therefore essential to obtain a detailed history of all concurrent prescribed medications (considering preparations with a high salt content), over-the-counter products and illicit drugs. Removal or dose reduction of any such agents should be attempted where possible, although BP may not always normalise as a result. In such scenarios, multidisciplinary team working may permit alternative treatments or use of the lowest necessary doses of the interfering agent. In many cases however, medications cannot be discontinued, and appropriate antihypertensive treatment should be instated. The mechanism of action by which some therapeutic agents and other commonly used substances affect BP control are summarised in Table 3.

### Comparative cardiovascular safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^7b8101ac]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Background

Concerns about the cardiovascular safety of medications used for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain. We aimed to compare the effects of pharmacological treatments for ADHD on haemodynamic values and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods

For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched 12 electronic databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, from database inception to Jan 18, 2024, for published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines, atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, modafinil, or viloxazine against each other or placebo. Primary outcomes were change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), measured in mm Hg, and pulse, measured in beats per minute, at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. Summary data were extracted and pooled in random-effects network meta-analyses. Certainty of evidence was assessed with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) framework. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021295352. Before study initiation, we contacted representatives of a UK-based charity of people with lived experience of ADHD-the ADHD Foundation-regarding the relevance of the topic and the appropriateness of the outcomes chosen.

Findings

102 randomised controlled trials with short-term follow-up (median 7 weeks [IQR 5–9]) were included, encompassing 13315 children and adolescents (aged ≥ 5 years and < 18 years; mean age 11 years [SD 3]; of available data, 9635 [73%] were male and 3646 [27%] were female; of available data, 289 [2%] were Asian, 1719 [15%] were Black, and 8303 [71%] were White) and 9387 adults (≥ 18 years, mean age 35 years [11]; of available data, 5064 [57%] were male and 3809 [43%] were female; of available data, 488 [6%] were Asian, 457 [6%] were Black, and 6372 [79%] were White). Amphetamines, atomoxetine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and viloxazine led to increments in haemodynamic values in children and adolescents, adults, or both. In children and adolescents, mean increase against placebo ranged from 1.07 (95% CI 0.36–1.79; moderate CINeMA confidence) with atomoxetine to 1.81 (1.05–2.57; moderate) with methylphenidate for SBP; from 1.93 (0.74–3.11; high) with amphetamines to 2.42 (1.69–3.15; low) with methylphenidate for DBP; and from 2.79 (1.05–4.53; moderate) with viloxazine to 5.58 (4.67–6.49; high) with atomoxetine for pulse. In adults, mean increase against placebo ranged from 1.66 (95% CI 0.38–2.93; very low) with methylphenidate to 2.3 (0.66–3.94; very low) with amphetamines for SBP; from 1.60 (0.29–2.91; very low) with methylphenidate to 3.07 (0.69–5.45; very low) with lisdexamfetamine for DBP; and from 4.37 (3.16–5.59; very low) with methylphenidate to 5.8 (2.3–9.3; very low) with viloxazine for pulse. Amphetamines, lisdexamfetamine, or methylphenidate were not associated with larger increments in haemodynamic values compared with atomoxetine or viloxazine in either children and adolescents or adults. Guanfacine was associated with decrements in haemodynamic values in children and adolescents (mean decrease against placebo of -2.83 [95% CI -3.8 to -1.85; low CINeMA confidence] in SBP, -2.08 [-3 to -1.17; low] in DBP, and -4.06 [-5.45–2.68; moderate] in pulse) and adults (mean decrease against placebo of -10.1 [-13.76 to -6.44; very low] in SBP, -7.73 [-11.88 to -3.58; very low] in DBP, and -6.83 [-10.85 to -2.81; very low] in pulse). Only four RCTs informed on effects in the medium term and none on the long term.

Interpretation

Practitioners should monitor blood pressure and pulse in patients with ADHD treated with any pharmacological intervention, and not stimulants only. Given the short duration of available randomised controlled trials, new research providing insights on the causal effects of ADHD medications on cardiovascular parameters in the longer term should be funded.

Additional findings

BP changes can lead to changes in the BP category, which is used to determine the initiation of diagnostic and therapeutic measures according to the guidelines. Because of BP increases/decreases during MPH therapy, 11 of 44 participants (25%) were categorised into a higher BP group than they had previously been categorised in (eg, normotension to hypertension), whereas 6 participants (14%) were categorised into a lower BP group (figure 2). Similar results (although based on single-point BP measurements) were shown by Stowe et al and Hammerness et al, who reported newly met criteria for prehypertension or hypertension in 37.5% of 8 patients and 14.04% of 114 patients with ADHD, respectively, after the beginning of MPH therapy. Stowe et al also reported a patient with initial hypertensive BP values based on single BP measurements who additionally met the ABPM criteria of arterial hypertension during MPH therapy. However, BP classification during childhood and adolescence, unlike the BP classification in adulthood, is based on the statistical normal distribution of the BP values in a healthy comparison group. Accordingly, exceeding or falling below the percentile limits for normotension is not necessarily associated with cardiovascular consequences (although, an association between statistically defined 'high' BP levels in childhood, and high BP values and their corresponding cardiovascular consequences in adulthood is well known). Additionally, the percentile-oriented interpretation of BP is ordinally scaled and shows a very broad normal range (5th to 90th percentiles of the reference group), but with only very narrow prehypertensive, hypertensive and hypotensive BP rangesthat are difficult to reach. Consequently, a change in the BP category and as well an absolute BP change in mm Hg should be considered during the risk-benefit assessment of MPH therapy.

Stimulant Medications

Stimulants are usually the first line of treatment to treat co-occurring attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as they present with a rapid clinical effect and there is enough data supporting their use and safety. Approximately half of autistic children also meet criteria for ADHD, but prevalence widely varies based on samples. Treating co-occurring ADHD symptoms in autistic individuals should focus on improvement in enhancing their daily function in multiple settings, including learning, and hopefully long-term functional outcomes improving associated symptoms causing impairment in the academic setting, peer relationships, and emotional regulation, which are also key predictors and mediators of functional difficulties in adulthood. Before starting a patient on a regimen, the prescribing clinician should assess the potential risks for pharmacotherapy by obtaining a complete past medical history, family history, and a physical examination with a specific focus on the cardiovascular system. It is important to obtain pretreatment baseline information and a close follow up to objectively evaluate the impact of common side effects associated with pharmacotherapy for ADHD (i.e. appetite changes, hypertension, weight loss, sleep disturbances, headaches, abdominal pain). Baseline sleep problems do not appear to predict stimulant-related sleep problems and may improve with stimulant therapy. Adolescent patients should be assessed for substance use or abuse prior to starting treatment.

Limitations

The external validity of the study sample has certain limitations. Given the high proportion of participants with pre-existing prehypertension or hypertension, BP values measured during MPH therapy may not be representative of patients with ADHD without such a cardiovascular risk profile. Furthermore, BP values collected before the start of MPH therapy apply to children and adolescents whose ADHD symptom severity had already led to psychiatric presentation and the planning of stimulant therapy. Therefore, these results may not be representative of children and adolescents with only mild ADHD who do not require drug therapy.

Although the psychiatrists near the cardiology centres were familiarised with the study design, it cannot be ruled out that they referred predominantly patients with ADHD with high-risk cardiovascular profiles to paediatric cardiology centres. This would have resulted in channeling bias, and might then partly explain the high number of prehypertensive or hypertensive participants in the sample. Because the total number of patients treated with MPH by psychiatrists was not documented, the degree of selection bias in the sample was difficult to estimate.

In favour of epidemiologically appropriate BP percentiles, methodological differences regarding the BP measurement method were accepted. Neuhauser et al used two single-point BP measurements, whereas the present study chose ABPM. Nevertheless, serious inaccuracies in percentile classifications are rather unlikely because resting daytime BP in children and adolescents measured using an ambulatory method or in clinical practice does not differ remarkably. Furthermore, higher ambulatory BP values that might be caused by daily activity during ABPM are relativised by averaging the multiple measurements of the ABPM session (effect of the regression to the middle).

Because the follow-up period was only 6 months, the long-term haemodynamic effects during MPH therapy and the impact of these effects on adults formerly treated with MPH could not be addressed. A study with long-term follow-up is needed to answer these questions.

Methods

Participant recruiting process

Patients with ADHD were recruited from nine paediatric cardiology centres in Germany and one in Austria. Inclusion criteria were age 6–13 years (defined as children) or 14–18 years (defined as adolescents); confirmed ADHD diagnosis according to the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision; an individual decision to initiate MPH therapy; and written informed consent from the participants' parents and from the participants themselves depending on their age. Exclusion criteria were pre-existing MPH therapy or use of other medications that could potentially influence BP or interfere with MPH. In accordance with the scope of practice of different medical specialists, the ADHD diagnosis and decisions regarding therapy were the responsibility of a child and youth psychiatrist. Detailed cardiac examinations, recommended before and during MPH therapy, were performed by a paediatric cardiologist. After the patients were referred by the psychiatrist to the cardiologist for routine cardiac examination, they were recruited by the latter according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the non-interventional study (NIS). Cardiologists measured BP and collected personal data relevant to the NIS. (figure 1)

Since the earliest descriptions of the condition, controversy has prevailed as to the existence of as well as appropriate management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Often diagnosed in childhood, symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can continue into adolescence and adulthood, requiring lifelong therapy. Effective therapeutic interventions include stimulant medications with all their respective potential side effects, including the cardiovascular system. However, although initial studies raised concerns for an increase in serious adverse cardiovascular effects among children receiving these drugs, more recent and extensive reports have failed to substantiate those findings among young patients.

Avoid using long-acting antihypertensives to avoid abrupt hemodynamic collapse. Administer nitroglycerin if signs or symptoms of cardiac ischemia are present.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^fde2132b]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioural disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) is one of the major pharmacological options for ADHD. MPH is known to result, on average, in a small increase in arterial blood pressure (BP). However, there are few clinical data regarding the individual influences of MPH on BP among children and adolescents with ADHD. According to the European Union-wide standardised patient information sheet for MPH, BP changes > 10 mm Hg compared with baseline values are 'common' (ie, ≥ 1% to < 10%) in children and adolescents with ADHD during MPH therapy.

Aim

To investigate the frequency and individual severity of BP changes in children and adolescents with ADHD during the first 6 months of new MPH therapy.

Methods

In this study, 44 (77% male) children and adolescents (mean age (SD) 9.13 (1.86) years) with a diagnosis of ADHD according to the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision, underwent ambulatory BP monitoring before and during the first 6 months of routine MPH therapy. Exclusion criteria were pre-existing MPH therapy and other medications that potentially influence BP or interfere with MPH. The non-interventional study was conducted prospectively at 10 paediatric cardiology centres in Germany and Austria.

Results

After beginning MPH therapy, 34% of participants (99% CI 15.52% to 52.66%) had BP increases/decreases > 10 mm Hg. The mean changes in systolic BP and diastolic BP were 0.87 mm Hg (95% CI -1.75 mm Hg to 3.48 mm Hg) and 1.96 mm Hg (95% CI 0.21 mm Hg to 3.7 mm Hg), respectively. The proportion of participants with initial prehypertension/hypertension was 54.55%.

Conclusions

In our sample with a high baseline rate of prehypertension/hypertension, BP changes > 10 mm Hg during MPH therapy were more frequent than those indicated by the patient information sheet. Moreover, individual BP changes, including increases and decreases > 10 mm Hg, resulted in a small average BP increase in the sample, thus reflecting neither the severity nor the direction of individual BP changes. Therefore, the frequency and, due to the common use of the arithmetic mean, the individual severity of BP changes during MPH therapy may be underestimated. Further studies without averaging and with larger samples including patients in primary care settings are warranted.

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with medications used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f817d79e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Use of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications has increased substantially over the past decades, but there are concerns regarding their cardiovascular safety.

Objective

To provide an updated synthesis of evidence on whether ADHD medications are associated with the risk of a broad range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science up to May 1, 2022.

Study Selection

Observational studies investigating the association between ADHD medications (including stimulants and nonstimulants) and risk of CVD.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality using the Good Research for Comparative Effectiveness (GRACE) checklist. Data were pooled using random-effects models. This study is reported according to the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcome was any type of cardiovascular event, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, tachyarrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

Results

Nineteen studies (with 3 931 532 participants including children, adolescents, and adults; 60.9% male), of which 14 were cohort studies, from 6 countries or regions were included in the meta-analysis. Median follow-up time ranged from 0.25 to 9.5 years (median, 1.5 years). Pooled adjusted relative risk (RR) did not show a statistically significant association between ADHD medication use and any CVD among children and adolescents (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.91–1.53), young or middle-aged adults (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.43–2.48), or older adults (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.62–4.05). No significant associations for stimulants (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.84–1.83) or nonstimulants (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.25–5.97) were observed. For specific cardiovascular outcomes, no statistically significant association was found in relation to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.94–2.72), cerebrovascular diseases (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72–1.15), or myocardial infarction (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.68–1.65). There was no associations with any CVD in female patients (RR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.43–8.24) and in those with preexisting CVD (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.80–2.16). Heterogeneity between studies was high and significant except for the analysis on cerebrovascular diseases.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis suggests no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and the risk of CVD across age groups, although a modest risk increase could not be ruled out, especially for the risk of cardiac arrest or tachyarrhythmias. Further investigation is warranted for the cardiovascular risk in female patients and patients with preexisting CVD as well as long-term risks associated with ADHD medication use.

WARNINGS

Serious Cardiovascular Events

Sudden Death and Pre-Existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems

Children and Adolescents –Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

Adults – Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.

Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions

Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^1925ebf8]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, the proportion of participants with baseline prehypertension or hypertension was relatively high. According to the percentile-dependent definition of arterial prehypertension and hypertension during childhood, only 10% of the study participants were expected to have elevated BP values (ie, ≥ 90th percentile) before the beginning of MPH therapy. However, the proportion of prehypertensive or hypertensive participants in the NIS was 54.55% (95% CI 39.61% to 69.49%). The study by Hammerness et al showed similar results, with 29% of 114 participants having arterial hypertension. Therefore, systematically increased BP levels in children and adolescents with ADHD seem likely. A connection between neurocognitive disorders, such as ADHD, and arterial hypertension is possible. Although the question of a causal relationship between neurocognitive disorders and arterial hypertension cannot be answered with this study design, the findings of this study encourage further investigations into arterial hypertension as a possible cause or consequence of ADHD. However, selection bias as the cause of the high proportion of initially prehypertensive or hypertensive participants in the NIS cannot be ruled out. Overall, the high baseline rate of prehypertension and hypertension observed in patients with ADHD is worth mentioning because screening for cardiac disorders before stimulant therapy is frequently disregarded. According to a survey of 615 members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, up to 25% of respondents do not routinely perform the officially recommended physical examination for their patients before stimulant therapy. In these cases, the patients' cardiovascular predispositions, eg severe arterial hypertension as a contraindication for MPH therapy, remain undetected. This emphasizes the importance of the recommended cardiovascular examination of every ADHD patient before MPH therapy.

### An open-label study of the tolerability of mixed amphetamine salts in adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and treated primary essential hypertension [^a41ff6f2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the short-term tolerability of an extended-release preparation of the stimulant medication mixed amphetamine salts (MAS XR) in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) whose hypertension has been successfully treated with antihypertensive medications.

Method

An 8-week, 2-phase, open-label study design was implemented. All adults had ADHD (DSM-IV diagnosis) and essential hypertension and were required to be normotensive (blood pressure < 135/85 mm Hg, treated) for at least 4 weeks at entry into the study. MAS XR was given for a 6-week period, titrated once each week to a target maximum dose of 60 mg/day given once daily in the morning (phase 1), and then discontinued for 2 weeks at the end of the study (phase 2). At baseline, subjects underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment, medical history, vital signs assessment, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Rating scales were used throughout the study to assess response to treatment, and blood pressure was measured manually at each study visit. The primary outcome was the effect of MAS XR on blood pressure and the development of hypertension.

Results

Thirteen subjects receiving antihypertensive therapy were entered and placed on MAS XR treatment and completed the trial. There were no serious adverse events. No sustained elevated blood pressure (> 140/90 mm Hg at 2 consecutive visits) was observed in the subjects treated with MAS XR. Similar rates of single episodes of hypertension were observed in phases 1 and 2. Similarly, there was no group mean increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or pulse during treatment with MAS XR. No clinically significant changes in the ECG were observed. During the 6-week medication phase, significant improvement was found on rating scales assessing ADHD symptoms and severity that reversed with discontinuation of MAS XR.

Conclusion

The results of this open study suggest that adults with ADHD and controlled hypertension can be safely treated with MAS XR.

### Guanfacine (guanfacine extended-release) [^ad882031]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Maintenance Treatment

Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Healthcare providers should periodically re-evaluate the long-term use of guanfacine extended-release tablets, and adjust weight-based dosage as needed. The majority of children and adolescents reach optimal doses in the 0.05 to 0.12 mg/kg/day range. Doses above 4 mg/day have not been evaluated in children (ages 6 to 12 years) and above 7 mg/day have not been evaluated in adolescents (ages 13 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

2.5 Discontinuation of Treatment

Following discontinuation of guanfacine extended-release tablets, patients may experience increases in blood pressure and heart rate [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue guanfacine extended-release tablets without consulting their health care provider. Monitor blood pressure and pulse when reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug. Taper the daily dose in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension.

2.6 Missed Doses

When reinitiating patients to the previous maintenance dose after two or more missed consecutive doses, consider titration based on patient tolerability.

2.7 Dosage Adjustment with Concomitant Use of Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Dosage adjustments for guanfacine extended-release tablets are recommended with concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), or CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) (Table 2) [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Diagnosis and management of ADHD in children [^8204f797]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder in children, and the prevalence is increasing. Physicians should evaluate for ADHD in children with behavioral concerns (e.g., inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, oppositionality) or poor academic progress using validated assessment tools with observers from several settings (home, school, community) and self-observation, if possible. Physicians who inherit a patient with a previous ADHD diagnosis should review the diagnostic process, and current symptoms and treatment needs. Coexisting conditions (e.g., anxiety, learning, mood, or sleep disorders) should be identified and treated. Behavioral treatments are recommended for preschool-aged children and may be helpful at older ages. Effective behavioral therapies include parent training, classroom management, and peer interventions. Medications are recommended as first-line therapy for older children. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, are most effective for the treatment of core ADHD symptoms and have generally acceptable adverse effect profiles. There are fewer supporting studies for atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine, and they are less effective than the psychostimulants. Height, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, symptoms, mood, and treatment adherence should be recorded at follow-up visits.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^887f52e4]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Implications

In our sample with a high baseline rate of prehypertension and hypertension, BP changes > 10 mm Hg during MPH therapy were more frequent than those indicated by the EU-wide standardised patient information sheet. Moreover, individual BP changes, including BP increases and decreases > 10 mm Hg, considerably varied. These individual BP changes resulted in a small average BP increase in the sample. Thus, the arithmetic mean reflected neither the severity nor the direction of individual BP changes because the use of the arithmetic mean neutralises opposing BP changes and relativizes stronger individual BP reactions. In spite of this, the arithmetic mean is commonly used to indicate the severity of the possible BP change during MPH therapy. Therefore, the frequency and individual severity of BP changes during MPH therapy may be underestimated. Further studies without averaging and with larger samples including patients in primary care settings are warranted.

### Hypertension in children with intellectual disabilities: a population not to be overseen [^a48e0b5f]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, the presence of psychiatric conditions, which are common in children with intellectual disabilities, must also be considered in HTN management. Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and stimulants for ADHD can interact with antihypertensive drugs, requiring careful monitoring and dose adjustments. Various psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, and conduct disorders, are associated with increased cardiovascular risk through mechanisms, such as autonomic dysfunction, inflammation, and metabolic abnormalities.

Other co-existing conditions, such as hyperlipidemia and thyroid disorders, frequently accompany HTN in this population. The use of statins for managing hyperlipidemia and the optimization of thyroid hormone levels in children with hypothyroidism are crucial for overall cardiovascular risk reduction. Given the complexity of treating HTN in children with intellectual disabilities and comorbidities, clinicians should refer to the 2016 ESH Guidelines for specific pharmacological recommendations, including drug selection and dosing strategies. These guidelines emphasize a personalized, multidisciplinary approach, starting with a single antihypertensive agent and titrating as needed while considering the child's overall health status and risk factors.

Summary

Implementing lifestyle modification strategies, particularly those focused on nutrition and physical activity is critical for managing HTN in children and adolescents with intellectual disability, who frequently encounter difficulties in making healthful dietary choices due to cognitive limitations. To support healthier eating habits, structured education is essential, with the Mediterranean diet identified as a beneficial option that can positively impact BP and overall health. A tailored treatment plan for HTN should also account for the individual's specific needs, comorbidities, and medication adherence, with roles for nutritionists in creating user-friendly meal plans, physical therapists promoting exercise, and family support for lifestyle changes and medication compliance.

Effectively addressing HTN in children with intellectual disabilities requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary strategy, integrating expertise from various specialties and active involvement of caregivers and the community.

Preventive measures

Preventive strategies include early identification and management of the primary risk factors and underlying conditions contributing to HTN; dietary interventions: dieticians play a central role in formulating balanced, low-sodium diets rich in potassium, fiber, and essential nutrients, tailored to the specific needs of children with intellectual disabilities. These interventions should consider individual dietary preferences, challenges, and any metabolic disorders; physical activity: physical activity specialists/physiotherapist should design adaptive exercise programs promoting aerobic and strength-based activities that suit the child's physical abilities; family and community education: engage families, caregivers, and schools to foster a supportive environment for implementing healthy lifestyles. Education on reducing sedentary behaviors, limiting screen time, and ensuring active family involvement is vital.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^5c7db206]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Main findings

Two main observations were made regarding the frequency and individual severity of BP changes during the first 6 months of new MPH therapy. First, BP changes > 10 mm Hg were observed in 34.09% (99% CI 15.52% to 52.66%) of the 44 participants after the start of MPH therapy. The EU-wide standardised patient information sheet for MPH estimates that BP changes > 10 mm Hg are 'common' (≥ 1% to < 10%) in children and adolescents with ADHD treated with MPH. Consequently, in our sample of children and adolescents with a high baseline rate of prehypertension and hypertension, the occurrence of BP changes > 10 mm Hg during MPH therapy was higher than what was stated by the patient information sheet. To investigate the possibility that the frequency of BP changes during MPH therapy is underestimated, further studies with larger samples that include children in primary care settings are warranted. Second, the individual BP changes observed in the 44 participants considerably varied on both severity and direction, including BP increases and BP decreases > 10 mm Hg. These individual BP changes resulted in average BP changes of 0.87 mm Hg (95% CI -1.75 mm Hg to 3.48 mm Hg) and 1.96 mm Hg (95% CI 0.21 mm Hg to 3.7 mm Hg) in systolic daytime BP and diastolic daytime BP, respectively. However, these relatively small average BP increases in the sample reflect neither the severity nor the direction of individual BP changes because the use of the arithmetic mean naturally neutralises opposing BP changes and relativises stronger individual BP reactions. Nevertheless, previous relevant studies usually used the arithmetic mean to measure the severity of BP changes during MPH therapy in children and adolescents with ADHD. These studies reported results similar to those of this NIS with an average BP increase in the sample of 1–4 mm Hg in systolic daytime BP and/or diastolic daytime BP. A recent meta-analysis confirmed a statistically significant increase in the averaged post-treatment versus pretreatment systolic BP as compared with placebo. It is possible that the BP results of these studies that reported statistically significant but clinically 'small", slight", minimal', or 'minor'BP changes in children and adolescents with ADHD might have been stronger if the arithmetic mean had not been used. Consequently, the common use of the arithmetic mean potentially led to an underestimation of the severity of BP changes during MPH therapy. To investigate this possibility, further research without averaging seems warranted. This is important for the individual patient because information about the possibility or, even better, the frequency of strong BP increases and decreases during MPH therapy is clinically more crucial than information about the average BP change in a sample. An increase or decrease in BP is associated with different clinical consequences, depending on the patient risk group. For example, congestive heart failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, or renal failure may occur as a result of an acute BP increase. Lower BP in younger individuals is associated with an increased incidence of accidental deaths, which is possibly an indication of reduced reaction performance at low BP. Finally, a single severe BP change can have acute clinical consequences, especially in patients with cardiovascular predispositions.

### Updates in pharmacologic strategies in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^1e5483bb]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) significantly worsens quality of life and long-term functional outcomes in adults. Individual impairments in adults with ADHD can be further contextualized within considerable costs to society at large. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved stimulants and nonstimulant medications can significantly improve ADHD symptoms in adults. In the past 2 decades, the United States FDA has expanded approval of pharmacotherapeutic options for adult ADHD. However, limitations still persist in available psychotropics for certain patient populations such as those with comorbid substance use or cardiovascular illness. Clinicians therefore must appreciate several ongoing investigations into medications with unique mechanisms of action. This article reviews the current FDA approved and emerging medication options while providing guidelines for pharmacologic management of adult ADHD.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^70463b8a]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

To enable interindividual analyses, SD scores (z-scores) for the daytime BP of all participants were calculated using the LMS method (with L, skewness; M, median; and S, coefficient of variation) described by Cole and Greenand modified by Neuhauser et al. Hereby, participants' BP results were transformed into the value range of the normal distribution of a healthy reference population, standardised by age, sex, and height. The population of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents was chosen as the reference group. Then, participants were categorised into five groups according to their z-scores, following the German guideline for arterial hypertensionand the recommendations of the European Society of Hypertension(table 1): hypotension, normotension, prehypertension, hypertension stage I, and hypertension stage II. The individual BP group at baseline was compared with the BP group during MPH therapy. When two ABPM sessions were performed during MPH therapy, the one with the greater change in the BP category (eg, from normotension to hypertension) was chosen for data analyses, which was consistent with our aim of measuring the maximum possible individual load of MPH on the cardiovascular system.

Table 1
Definition of arterial hypertension for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) in children and adolescents

Efforts to address potential sources of bias

For quality assurance, all participating paediatric cardiologists used the same ABPM device. All ABPM devices were programmed according to the study protocol and were installed by trained staff. Moreover, measurements per day were reduced to a minimum to increase participants' acceptance. Higher BP values that might be caused by a high activity level during ABPM were controlled for by averaging the multiple ABPM measurements within one session (effect of regression to the middle). We excluded participants with a history of MPH therapy and those using other medications that might interact with MPH or influence BP.

Patient involvement

BP measurements obtained before and during MPH therapy are part of routine care for children and adolescents with ADHD. In this NIS, ABPM was chosen to measure BP because it is the gold standard. Nevertheless, ABPM can be more stressful for participants than the alternative single-point BP measurements. Therefore, participants and their parents were informed about the advantages and disadvantages of ABPM measurements, and participants were asked to assess the burden of using ABPM, including the imposed stress and required time.

Reporting guidelines

The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Statement was used for reporting the NIS.

### Blood pressure changes associated with medication treatment of adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^084a81a6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of medications used in the treatment of adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on blood pressure and pulse.

Method

Subjects were those with DSM-III-R-/DSM-IV-diagnosed ADHD enrolled in placebo-controlled studies of 5 different medications for ADHD. Cardiovascular data from these studies of both stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamine compounds, pemoline) and nonstimulants (bupropion, desipramine) were reanalyzed for baseline-to-endpoint active-treatment or placebo effects on blood pressure and heart rate.

Results

There were 125 subjects with a mean ± SD age of 39 ± 9 years. In general, active drug treatment for ADHD compared to baseline was associated with several statistically significant changes in systolic blood pressure (bupropion: +5.9 mm Hg, p < .05 by paired t test; amphetamine: +5.4 mm Hg, p < .05), diastolic blood pressure (desipramine: +7.1 mm Hg, p < .05), and heart rate (bupropion: +6.9 mm Hg, p < .05; amphetamine: +7.3 mm Hg, p < .05; methylphenidate: +4.5 mm Hg, p < .05). New-onset cases of systolic or diastolic hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 140/90) were recorded in 8% (7/89) of placebo-treated subjects and 10% (9/89) of subjects receiving active medication, regardless of the class (stimulant, nonstimulant).

Conclusion

Both stimulant and nonstimulant catecholaminergic medications used in adults with ADHD are associated with minor, but statistically significant, changes in heart rate and blood pressure that were often observed in those receiving placebo. Given the minor pressor and chronotropic effect of these medications, adults with ADHD should have their blood pressure and heart rate checked at baseline and periodically during treatment.

WARNINGS

Serious Cardiovascular Events

Sudden Death and Pre-Existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems

Children and Adolescents - Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

Adults - Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.

Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions

Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with pre-existing hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia.

### Blood pressure and heart rate over 10 years in the multimodal treatment study of children with ADHD [^29d05818]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

It is unknown whether prolonged childhood exposure to stimulant medication for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) increases the risk for developing abnormalities in blood pressure or heart rate. The authors examined the association between stimulant medication and blood pressure and heart rate over 10 years.

Method

A total of 579 children, ages 7–9, were randomly assigned to 14 months of medication treatment, behavioral therapy, the combination of the two, or usual community treatment. The controlled trial was followed by naturalistic treatment with periodic assessments. Blood pressure and heart rate data were first analyzed with linear regression models based on an intent-to-treat approach, using raw data and the blood pressure categories of prehypertension and hypertension. Currently medicated patients were then compared with never or previously medicated patients. Associations between cumulative stimulant exposure and blood pressure or heart rate were assessed.

Results

No treatment effect on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure could be detected. Children who were treated with stimulants had a higher heart rate (mean = 84.2 bpm [SD = 12.4] on medication alone and mean = 84.6 bpm [SD = 12.2] on medication plus behavioral therapy) than those who were treated with behavioral therapy alone (mean = 79.1 bpm [SD = 12.0]) or those who received usual community treatment (mean = 78.9 bpm [SD = 12.9]) at the end of the 14-month controlled trial, but not thereafter. Stimulant medication did not increase the risk for tachycardia, but greater cumulative stimulant exposure was associated with a higher heart rate at years 3 and 8.

Conclusions

Stimulant treatment did not increase the risk for prehypertension or hypertension over the 10-year period of observation. However, stimulants had a persistent adrenergic effect on heart rate during treatment.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^63980e2e]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Observation process

All participants completed a 24-hour ABPM session before the start of MPH therapy, thereby providing the baseline BP. A second session before the start of MPH therapy was intended (but not obligatory) to achieve familiarisation with the measurement method. Subsequently, a 24-hour ABPM session was conducted during the first 6 months of MPH therapy, with the measured BP compared with the baseline BP. A second session during MPH therapy was intended (but not obligatory) to increase the likelihood of monitoring possible BP changes during MPH therapy. If there were two ABPM sessions during MPH therapy, one was performed during the first 7 weeks after the start of MPH therapy and one was performed during the period thereafter when titration of the individual MPH dose was completed. The individual observation period ended 6 months after the start of MPH therapy.

BP measurement protocol

Children and adolescents, especially those with ADHD, tend to move during BP measurements, which might result in an incorrect BP measurement or render measurements impossible. To increase participant acceptance, measurements were reduced to a minimum of two per hour during the day and one per hour during the night. Daytime was defined from 08:00 to 20:00, and night-time was from 00:00 to 06:00. Time intervals between these two defined periods were discarded because of interindividual differences in sleep-wake cycles. A maximum of 32 single-point BP measurements within a 24-hour cycle was possible. Only ABPM sessions with at least six daytime measurements were eligible for further analyses. Additionally, at least four night-time measurements were mandatory for adolescents because night-time BP is needed to assess arterial hypertension in adolescents. Measurements beyond the following ranges were excluded: systolic BP, 60–220 mm Hg; diastolic BP, 35–120 mm Hg; and heart rate, 40–180 bpm.

### Paying attention to attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and cardiovascular risk… [^61e01435]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Zhang, et al1 performed a meta-analysis of 19 observational studies with more than 3. 9 million participants followed from 3 months to
9. 5 years and found no association between use of medications to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and any cardiovascular disease outcome. This is an important study for many reasons. First, the possibility that medications used to treat ADHD might adversely affect the risk of CVD has biological plausibility. Many ADHD medications are stimulants with important sympathomimetic effects and can increase heart rate and blood pressure and potentially increase the risk of arrhythmias, especially in susceptible individuals, such as those with preexisting CVD. Second, the use of ADHD medications is increasing in both children and adults. Finally, as ADHD medication use increases among older adults, the likelihood that individuals with preexisting CVD will be exposed to these medications increases as well.

The authors highlight the possibility that CVD risk in ADHD medication users may be elevated in women compared with men as well as in those with preexisting CVD vs those without, even though they note wide and overlapping confidence intervals. With this important caveat, it would have also been appropriate to emphasize the potential of increased risk in older adults compared with young and middle-aged adults. Tadrous et al5 found that prescription stimulant use was associated with an increased risk of a CVD event at 30 days, with a hazard ratio of 3. 0 for ventricular arrhythmias and an HR of

1. 6 for stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Every treatment decision is a balance of potential harm and potential benefit, and that balance is different for every individual patient based on their biological variability and on "personomics, "7 ie, other important differences in psychological, social, cultural, behavioral, and economic factors and each individual's unique life circumstances. Although the study by Zhang et al1 is reassuring in many ways, health care professionals must carefully weigh these factors when prescribing ADHD medications, especially to older adults, individuals with established CVD, and those with other comorbidities that increase CVD risk.

5.4 Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Atomoxetine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients whose underlying medical conditions could be worsened by increases in blood pressure or heart rate such as certain patients with hypertension, tachycardia, or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. It should not be used in patients with severe cardiac or vascular disorders whose condition would be expected to deteriorate if they experienced clinically important increases in blood pressure or heart rate [see Contraindications (4.5)]. Pulse and blood pressure should be measured at baseline, following atomoxetine hydrochloride dose increases, and periodically while on therapy to detect possible clinically important increases.

### Improving the quality of physical health monitoring in CAMHS for children and adolescents prescribed medication for ADHD [^d475c13e]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. In the UK, a survey of 10 438 children and adolescents aged between 5 and 15 years found that 3.62% of boys and 0.85% of girls had ADHD. Stimulant medication such as methylphenidate is the most frequently prescribed medication for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents in the UK. Stimulant medication acts at the central nervous system and is associated with a risk of side effects which may include reduced appetite and weight, increased blood pressureand pulse rate, and possible reduced growth.UK NICE Guidelinesand European Guidelinesrecommend that children and adolescents should have a comprehensive baseline physical assessment including height, weight and blood pressure and that these should be plotted on standardised growth charts and monitored regularly during treatment. The authors are not aware of any studies or initiatives to support clinicians in meeting these requirements using an electronic platform.

Sudden Death And Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities Or Other Serious Heart Problems

Assessing Cardiovascular Status In Patients Being Treated With Stimulant Medications

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^0eef7c8b]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common behavioural disorders in childhood and currently affects more than 63 million children and adolescents worldwide. The lack of concentration, hyperactivity, and occasional impulsive and antisocial behaviours of these children often result in sustained impairment of social, educational, and professional levels. Pharmacological treatment using the highly effective psychostimulant methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) is one of the main therapeutic options for ADHD. However, the 'Special warnings and precautions' subsection of the European Union (EU)-wide standardised patient information sheet regarding MPH warns that children and adolescents with ADHD commonly (ie, ≥ 1% to < 10%) develop changes in systolic blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP > 10 mm Hg, compared with their baseline values, during MPH therapy. This warning is based on a comprehensive risk assessment of MPH-containing drugs commissioned by the European Commission from the European Medicines Agency in 2007. The need for this risk assessment was prompted by concerns regarding the extent of severe adverse events related to pharmacological MPH products after MPH-related cardiovascular events and strokes in Germany and other EU countries. Consequently, a detailed cardiovascular examination including BP measurements is recommended for every patient with ADHD before and during MPH therapy. However, pre-existing clinical data regarding the individual influences of MPH on BP among children and adolescents with ADHD are lacking. To our knowledge, only one small (n = 8) study has addressed this issue, using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) as the gold standard for measuring BP. A second studythat focused on the individual influences of MPH on BP used less reliable single-point BP measurements. In contrast, other studies regarding this topic have reported average BP changes in the whole study group instead of individual BP changes. The method of averaging BP changes in all participants within a study group relativises stronger individual BP reactions, especially when there are BP changes in both directions, ie increases and decreases. Hence, the method of averaging BP changes might not permit inferences regarding the MPH load on the cardiovascular system at the level of the individual patient. These limitations underline the clinical importance of a systematic evaluation of individual BP changes during MPH treatment. Our observational study addressed the aforementioned limitations through the comparison of ABPM measurements performed before and during the first 6 months of new MPH therapy. An assessment of the frequency and individual severity of BP changes in children and adolescents with ADHD during MPH therapy is presented.

### Effect of amphetamines on blood pressure [^da2f1e77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Daily ingestion of amphetamines is common, as they are widely prescribed for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other diagnoses. People also use amphetamines recreationally or in an attempt to boost cognitive or athletic performance. Amphetamines have the potential to increase blood pressure, and we do not know if the long-term benefits of daily amphetamine use outweigh the potential harms.

Objectives

Primary: to quantify the changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children and adults taking amphetamines, compared to placebo. Secondary: to quantify the changes in heart rate in children and adults taking amphetamines, compared to placebo; to quantify the number of withdrawals due to adverse effects of amphetamine, compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We used the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify the studies included in the review. We imposed no restrictions on language, publication year or publication status. The latest search date was March 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of daily oral amphetamines versus placebo on blood pressure. There were no restrictions on participants' age or gender.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above atmospheric pressure; continuous outcomes). Secondary outcomes were heart rate (measured as beats per minute; continuous outcome) and withdrawals due to adverse effects (dichotomous outcome). We calculated continuous outcomes as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We expressed withdrawals due to adverse effects as a risk ratio with 95% CI. We used a fixed-effect model to pool effect sizes from all studies.

Main Results

We included 56 RCTs with a total of 10,583 participants, both adults and children. Most studies were conducted in North America (mainly the USA), followed by Europe. A few studies took place in Asia (Japan) and Australia. The studies tested racemic amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, mixed amphetamine salts, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA) and methylphenidate. The amphetamines were prescribed for ADHD, weight loss and other indications. In 48 RCTs, blood pressure was measured within 24 hours of the last dose. Based on data from all included studies, amphetamines increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 1.93 mmHg (95% CI 1.54 to 2.31) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 1.84 mmHg (95% CI 1.51 to 2.16) (56 studies, 10,583 participants; high-certainty evidence for both). Amphetamines increased heart rate by 3.71 beats per minute (95% CI 3.27 to 4.14; 47 studies, 10,075 participants; high-certainty evidence). In a subgroup analysis limited to studies that gave participants amphetamines for at least eight weeks, the effects were similar, suggesting that these are sustained effects. These findings suggest that people taking daily oral amphetamines are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Participants in the amphetamine group were also more likely to withdraw from the study due to adverse effects compared to those given placebo (risk ratio 2.69, 95% CI 2.13 to 3.40; absolute risk increase of 4.3% over an average duration of 1 month; 42 studies, 8952 participants; high-certainty evidence). In general, the studies were well-executed, and the methodology was sound. We judged most studies to have a low risk of bias across most domains. Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) was the domain most often rated as at unclear risk of bias, because the methods used were not reported. We judged 13 studies (23%) to have a high risk of bias in at least one of the seven domains, primarily due to high dropout rates, leading to a high risk of attrition bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Daily oral amphetamines increase blood pressure, heart rate, and withdrawals due to adverse effects, with these effects observed across all time points, including shorter (≤ four weeks) and longer durations (> four weeks to < eight weeks; ≥ eight weeks) of use. Future trials should measure blood pressure using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and assess the effect of long-term use.

### Cardiovascular safety of stimulant medications for pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^c137d504]. Clinical Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurobehavioral disorder that is often treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts. Despite their efficacy and long history of use, there is concern about their potential for adverse cardiovascular effects in children and adolescents. Data from placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials published after 2000 were reviewed, and cardiovascular adverse event data were compared. Both placebo-controlled and open-label extension trials have repeatedly shown stimulant-induced increases in mean blood pressure, heart rate, and QT interval in children, adolescents, and adults. Although these increases seem relatively minor, their existence raises questions regarding whether stimulants could influence the likelihood of sudden death or other serious cardiovascular consequences, especially in patients with underlying heart problems. Moreover, questions have been raised regarding the necessity of screening patients for occult or unrecognized heart problems that are felt to be adversely affected by stimulant use. Obtaining a baseline electrocardiogram for any patient starting stimulant treatment is reasonable if access to such screening is readily available and not too costly.

### Cardiovascular risks in people with narcolepsy: expert panel consensus recommendations [^7f55eda7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 2e: Tailor Narcolepsy Pharmacotherapy on the Basis of the Risk for Hypertension and Cardiovascular Disease

For patients with cardiovascular/cardiometabolic comorbidities, narcolepsy treatment should be selected carefully to avoid further increased cardiovascular risk. The following considerations are important to balancing the risks and benefits of treatment options that may be associated with greater cardiovascular risk.

Stimulants such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine that are commonly prescribed to treat narcolepsy are associated with cardiovascular risks and are accompanied by warnings against use in patients with known cardiac disorders. Accordingly, the American College of Cardiology issued a statement in 2015 cautioning against the use of stimulants in patients with arrhythmia and advising that, for patients whose condition may warrant treatment with stimulants, a careful weighing of benefits and risks should be performed.ECGs are not routinely performed before prescribing stimulants; however, for patients with suspected cardiac disease, obtaining a cardiologist's opinion before prescribing stimulants may be recommended. A 2023 case–control study of individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder found that longer cumulative duration of methylphenidate use was associated with increased risk of CVD. However, a meta‐analysis of observational studies of methylphenidate found no increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or all‐cause death, but did find an increased risk of sudden death/arrhythmia (risk ratio, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.0–2.1]; from 6 studies and 1.5 million individuals). Importantly, patients with narcolepsy may be taking stimulants for an extended period because narcolepsy symptoms usually begin in childhood or adolescence and require ongoing management throughout adulthood. Thus, patients should be educated on the cardiovascular risks associated with stimulant treatments. Future longitudinal studies should examine whether patients with narcolepsy taking stimulants for years have an increased risk of CVD.

Stimulant medications — common adverse effects, growth impact, and cardiovascular evaluation are as follows: Common short-term adverse effects are appetite loss, abdominal pain, headaches, and sleep disturbance. Diminished growth was in the range of 1 to 2 cm from predicted adult height, and the effects diminished by the third year of treatment, with no compensatory rebound growth observed. On average, stimulants increase heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) mildly (average increases: 1–2 beats per minute for HR and 1–4 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP), but more substantial increases can occur in a subset of individuals (5%–15%), so clinicians are encouraged to monitor these vital signs. Stimulant medications have not been shown to increase the risk of sudden death beyond that observed in children not receiving stimulants, yet before initiating therapy it is important to obtain the child or adolescent's cardiac history and family history of specific conditions; if any of these risk factors are present, clinicians should obtain additional evaluation. An uncommon significant adverse effect is the occurrence of hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms.

### Risks and benefits of available treatments for adult ADHD [^14d64aa9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Several pharmacotherapeutic options, both FDA-approved and off-label, exist for the treatment of adult ADHD. The most commonly used agents include several stimulants and atomoxetine, which have demonstrated significant, though similar, efficacy for ADHD versus placebo. Treatment should be selected according to patient comorbidity profiles, cardiovascular risks, and risk of abuse of prescription medications. In this activity, treatments for ADHD with and without comorbidity are discussed, including mechanisms of action, safety risks, and the potential for substance abuse. Implementing psychosocial education in conjunction with pharmacotherapy is recommended.

The cardiovascular (CV) impact of stimulants has been examined for decades, with investigations ranging from small sample targeted studies of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP), to large scale epidemiologic investigations. The preponderance of evidence is reassuring, albeit generally based on healthy samples using variable methodology, excluding those at theoretic high risk (eg, comorbid cardiac illness). Screening for theoretically vulnerable patients are recommended, as well as monitoring for CV symptoms and BP/HR, with shared inquiry/further evaluation if concerned. Future investigations to support the identification of risk are needed, while attention to stimulant-associated CV risk is an opportunity for clinicians to engage in general CV risk identification and intervention.

Weight was decreased significantly by amphetamines (in children and adolescents, SMD −0.71, 95% CI −1.15 to −0.27; in adults, −0.60, −1.03 to −0.18), methylphenidate (in children and adolescents, −0.77, −1.09 to −0.45; in adults, −0.74, −1.20 to −0.28), atomoxetine (in children and adolescents, −0.84, −1.16 to −0.52), and modafinil (in children and adolescents, −0.93, −1.59 to −0.26), compared with placebo (appendix pp 476, 477). Systolic blood pressure was increased with use of amphetamines (SMD 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.18) and atomoxetine (0.12, 0.02–0.22) in children and adolescents, and with use of methylphenidate (0.17, 0.05–0.30) in adults, compared with placebo (appendix p 477). Use of amphetamines (0.21, 0.12–0.31), atomoxetine (0.28, 0.18–0.37), and methylphenidate (0.24, 0.14–0.33) in children and adults, and atomoxetine (0.19, 0.08–0.30) and methylphenidate (0.20, 0.08–0.32) in adults, significantly increased diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo (appendix p 478).

For acceptability, compared with placebo, methylphenidate (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.91) in children and adolescents and amphetamines (0.68, 0.49–0.95) in adults were significantly better (appendix p 478).

In subgroup and sensitivity analyses, data were sufficient to assess the effect of study length, comorbidities, IQ, crossover design, unfair dose comparisons, and data imputation. Findings of these analyses were generally robust (appendix pp 479–91). Because of a paucity of data, we could not assess the effect of gender, age (children vs adolescents), low risk of bias, medication status, and industry sponsorship. Sensitivity analyses investigating the effect of different maximum doses confirmed the results of the primary dose analysis (appendix pp 492–575).

Serious Cardiovascular Events

Sudden Death and Preexisting Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems

Children and Adolescents

Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug.

Adults

Sudden death, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs.

Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions

Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2–4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3–6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e.g., those with preexisting hypertension, heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmia.

Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications

Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history (including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease (e.g., electrocardiogram and echocardiogram). Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.

### Methylphenidate and short-term cardiovascular risk [^0391a13e]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study of more than 250 000 children, adolescents, and adults, including 26 710 individuals receiving methylphenidate, we found evidence (87% posterior probability) of an increased rate of cardiovascular events associated with methylphenidate use after the first 6 months of pharmacologic treatment compared with matched controls, with inconclusive evidence regarding differences between those with vs without a history of CVD. When considering at least a 10% increased rate of cardiovascular events, the probability of finding a difference between individuals receiving methylphenidate and controls was lower (70%), and the probability decreased even further for larger differences in the rates of cardiovascular events.

In contrast with recent meta-analytic evidence from observational studiesshowing no association between ADHD medication use and increased risk of CVD (relative risk, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.88–1.68), we found an increased cardiovascular risk with methylphenidate use. However, when quantifying this risk, we found little evidence for an increased risk of 20% or higher. We also found insufficient evidence for a difference in risk between individuals with and without a history of CVD. Our findings align with a Danish register-based studyreporting an elevated risk of CVD in individuals who started pharmacologic treatment for ADHD, as well as a lack of evidence supporting a difference in CVD risk between individuals with and without preexisting CVD. Furthermore, the increased IRR 1 year before the start of methylphenidate in the ADHD group aligns with recent studies suggesting that ADHD itself confers significantly greater cardiovascular risk.

The somewhat higher risk in those without a history of CVD may be accounted for by the fact that individuals with a history of CVD are more closely monitored for cardiovascular risk factors and receive more intensive treatment to manage those risk factors. For instance, individuals with a history of CVD may be more likely to receive medications to manage hypertension, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, or diabetes, which are all risk factors for CVD. They may also be more likely to receive regular medical check-ups and undergo more frequent testing to monitor their CVD risk, ultimately reducing their recurrent event risk. In contrast, individuals without a history of CVD who are prescribed methylphenidate for ADHD may not receive the same level of monitoring and treatment for CVD risk factors. Therefore, they may be more vulnerable to the potential cardiovascular effects of methylphenidate use.

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with medications used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d6f9ebe0]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Main Findings

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal observational studies on the association between ADHD medication use and the risk of CVD. By pooling results of 19 studies, we found no statistically significant association between ADHD medication use and CVD among children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, or older adults, although the pooled RR did not exclude a modest risk increase, especially for the risk of cardiac arrest or tachyarrhythmias. We did not detect any difference in the cardiovascular risk between stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medication use. There was no association between ADHD medication and any CVD among female patients and those with preexisting CVD, although further study may be needed in these populations.

This updated meta-analysis enabled us to include 13 more studies than the previous meta-analyses. Unlike the previous meta-analyses, we did not include all-cause mortality in our primary outcome (but sudden cardiac death), as previous studies have shown that most of the mortality in patients with ADHD was due to unnatural causes (eg, accidents and suicide). We examined a broad range of cardiovascular outcomes including important cardiovascular outcomes (eg, hypertension and heart failure) in addition to those examined in previous meta-analyses (cardiac arrest, tachyarrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke). We found no statistically significant association between ADHD medication use and CVD among children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, or older adults, although the confidence interval could not exclude an increased risk. It should be noted that as the absolute risk is relatively low, even a significant RR of 22% risk increase in general would possibly be offset by the benefits of medications, eg, alleviating ADHD symptoms and reducing risky behavior. The trade-off between benefits and risks could be different in high-risk patients. Regarding specific cardiovascular outcomes, results from previous meta-analyses for specific cardiovascular outcomes (ie, cardiac arrest or tachyarrhythmias and stroke) are inconsistent. We found that ADHD medication use seemed to be associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrest or tachyarrhythmias, but not with cerebrovascular disease and myocardial infarction.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases [^b227a987]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

The association between ADHD medication use and CVD was significant for hypertension and arterial disease, while no significant association was observed with other types of cardiovascular events. To our knowledge, only 1 previous studyhas examined the association between ADHD medication use and clinically diagnosed hypertension, and it found an increased risk, although the increase was not statistically significant. Furthermore, increased blood pressure associated with ADHD medication use has been well documented. One studyfound that blood pressure was mainly elevated during the daytime, suggesting that the cardiovascular system may recover at night. However, the cross-sectional nature of that study cannot preclude a long-term risk of clinically diagnosed hypertension associated with ADHD medication use. We also identified an increased risk for arterial disease. To date, no previous study has explored the association between ADHD medication use and arterial disease. A few studies have reported that ADHD medication may be associated with changes in serum lipid profiles, but the results were not consistent. Further research is needed on the potential implications of ADHD medications for individuals' lipid profiles. We did not observe any association between ADHD medication use and the risk of arrhythmias. A recent systematic review of observational studies of ADHD medication use reported an elevated risk of arrhythmias, but the finding was not statistically significant. A review of RCTs also found that the use of stimulants was associated with an average increase in heart rate of 5.7 beats/min, but no evidence of prolonged QT interval or tachycardia was found based on electrocardiograms. Additionally, it is worth noting that some individuals receiving ADHD medications might be prescribed antiarrhythmic β-blockers to alleviate palpitation symptoms, thus potentially attenuating an association between ADHD medications and arrhythmias. Nevertheless, the absence of an association between ADHD medication use and clinically diagnosed arrhythmias in the present study does not rule out an increased risk for mild arrhythmias or subclinical symptoms, as palpitations and sinus tachycardia are not routinely coded as arrhythmia diagnoses. Further research is necessary to replicate our findings.

5.2 	Serious Cardiovascular Events

Sudden Death and Pre-existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems

Children and Adolescents

Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death, stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug [see Contraindications (4)].

Adults

Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems. Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs [see Contraindications (4)].

Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions

Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure (about 2 to 4 mmHg) and average heart rate (about 3 to 6 bpm), and individuals may have larger increases. While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure.

Nonstimulant medications — cardiovascular precautions and adverse effects are as follows: Among nonstimulants, the risk of serious cardiovascular events is extremely low, but atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine may be associated with cardiovascular parameter changes, including increased HR and BP for atomoxetine and decreased HR and BP for guanfacine and clonidine. Clinicians are recommended to not only obtain the personal and family cardiac history but also perform additional evaluation if risk factors are present before starting nonstimulants (for example, perform an electrocardiogram [ECG] and possibly refer to a pediatric cardiologist if the ECG is not normal). Atomoxetine adverse effects include initial somnolence, gastrointestinal tract symptoms if the dosage is increased too rapidly, and decreased appetite; less commonly, an increase in suicidal thoughts has been found and is noted by an FDA black box warning; extremely rarely, hepatitis has been associated. Atomoxetine has been linked to growth delays in the first 1 to 2 years of treatment, with a return to expected measurements after 2 to 3 years of treatment on average, with decreases observed among those who were taller or heavier than average before treatment. For extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine, adverse effects include somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, irritability, headache, bradycardia, hypotension, and abdominal pain, and because rebound hypertension after abrupt discontinuation has been observed, these medications should be tapered off rather than suddenly discontinued.

### ADHD risk reduction | AAFP… [^a6a810e4]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

While many adults with ADHD are able to cope with their symptoms, studies have shown that ADHD is associated with: Medication treatment risks usually relate to one or more of the following categories: Stimulant and related medications are generally well tolerated. Stimulant side effects are usually mild and respond to waiting, adjustment of dose, timing, or change in medication. Stimulant products have a high potential for abuse. Stimulant products carry cardiovascular side effects, including tachycardia, palpitations, and blood pressure elevations. As a result, blood pressure should be monitored in those even with mild hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension should be controlled prior to starting stimulant therapy. Warnings exist with stimulants regarding the potential risk of serious cardiovascular events, of sudden death with use in those with pre-existing structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems.

Additional adverse reactions with stimulants include insomnia, decreased appetite with possible weight loss, overstimulation, restlessness, dry mouth, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, and constipation. The amphetamine group is also associated with dizziness, euphoria, dyskinesia, tremor, exacerbations of motor and phonic tics, and Tourette's syndrome. Clinical evaluation and review of family history for tics and Tourette's syndrome should precede use of stimulant medication. However, treatment in these studies did not result in normalization. Studies also found that ADHD medications reduce ADHD symptoms and impairments, but that there is limited and inconsistent evidence for long-term medication effects on improved social functioning, academic achievement, employment status, and psychiatric comorbidity.

Although some studies show an association between ADHD and suicidality, depression, and substance use disorder, some emerging evidence suggests that these co-occurrence could be due to shared familial risk factors rather than to harmful effects of ADHD medications. Stimulant products and atomoxetine should generally not be used in patients with serious heart problems, or for whom an increase in blood pressure or heart rate would be problematic. Periodically monitor patients for changes in heart rate and blood pressure Stimulant products are contraindicated for persons with the following co-existing conditions: Universal-precautions should be applied to all adult ADHD patients for whom stimulants are being considered. Universal-precautions include: Assume all patients are at risk of misuse, abuse, diversion, or having their medications stolen. Physicians should prescribe agents with less potential for abuse and monitor patients more intensely.

Short-acting stimulant medications are the most likely to be abused and longer-acting stimulant medications less likely to be abused.

Key Points

Question

Are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis based on 19 observational studies with more than 3.9 million participants suggested that there was no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and the risk of cardiovascular events among children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, or older adults.

Meaning

Despite no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and CVD, more evidence is needed for the potential risk of cardiac arrest and tachyarrhythmias, the cardiovascular risk in female patients and in those with preexisting CVD, and long-term risk.

### Phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of the effects on blood pressure of abrupt cessation versus taper down of guanfacine extended-release tablets in adults aged 19 to 24 years [^f3883643]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Guanfacine hydrochloride is an alpha(2a)-adrenoreceptor agonist found to be effective in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because the available immediate-release formulation requires multiple daily dosing and has been associated with rebound hypertension on abrupt cessation, an extended-release (ER) formulation has been developed for study of efficacy and tolerability parameters in patients with ADHD.

Objective

This trial was primarily undertaken to determine the effect on blood pressure (BP) of abrupt cessation versus taper-down of guanfacine ER.

Methods

This Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial was conducted at MDS Pharma Services, Lincoln, Nebraska. Male and female healthy young-adult (aged 19–24 years) volunteers were included. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive guanfacine ER as follows. Abrupt-cessation and taper-down groups both received guanfacine ER at forced titration: 1 mg on days 1 to 4, 2 mg on days 5 to 8, 3 mg on days 9 to 12, and 4 mg on days 13 to 16. The abrupt-cessation group then received placebo daily on days 17 to 32. The taper-down group began the following taper-down schedule: 3 mg on days 17 to 20, 2 mg on days 21 to 24, 1 mg on days 25 to 30, and placebo on days 31 to 32. Placebo was administered daily to the subjects in the placebo group (days 1–32). All doses were given in the morning. Tolerability was assessed before (at the 8-hour baseline visit), during (approximately every 4 days and during 48-hour confinements at days 17/18 and 31/32), and 7 days after the study and included assessment of BP and pulse, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), and laboratory assays. Adverse events (AEs) were also tracked every 4 days beginning on day 5 and 7, 14, and 30 days poststudy by recording responses and follow-up to a nonleading question about how the patient was feeling that day.

Results

Forty-five subjects were enrolled in the study (15 in each group), and 35 subjects completed it. The mean age of study participants was 22 years, 87% were white, and the ratio of women to men was 2:1. There were no marked differences between groups regarding age, sex, or race. Compared with the taperdown group, the abrupt-cessation group did not exhibit a clinically significant elevation of systolic BP (SBP) or diastolic BP (DBP) or other tolerability parameters, including AEs. Significant differences in BP were observed on days 17/18 (first day of abrupt cessation) and 31/32, but the overall means were not statistically different. The SBP decreases were -7.55% (-8.84 mm Hg) in the abrupt-cessation group and -8.33% (-9.69 mm Hg) in the taper-down group. The DBP decreases were -9.14% (-6.17 mm Hg) in the abrupt-cessation group and -9.94% (-6.59 mm Hg) in the taper-down group. There were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in change or percentage change in pulse from baseline to day 31/32 between the taper-down and placebo groups (least squares mean difference, 2.26 bpm). None of the subjects experienced bradycardia. No clinically important treatment related trends were noted in the clinical laboratory, ECG, or physical examination findings, including vital signs. No serious treatment-emergent AEs were reported in this study. Overall, 124 treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 29 (64%) subjects. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 14 (93.3%) of 15 subjects in the abrupt-cessation group, 8 (53.3%) of 15 subjects in the taper-down group, and 7 (46.7%) of 15 subjects in the placebo group. Headache was the most common AE reported in the abrupt-cessation (46.7%) and placebo (13.3%) groups. For the taper down group, it was dry mouth (26.7%). All AEs were classified as mild or moderate.

Conclusion

In this small study group of healthy, young-adult volunteers, guanfacine ER at doses up to 4 mg/d was abruptly discontinued without significant increases in SBP or DBP or other tolerability parameters, including AEs, compared with taper.

Amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use disorder with co-occurring ADHD — methylphenidate (MPH) formulations and safety: In addition to reduction of ATS use, there is evidence that MPH formulations can reduce ADHD symptoms in adults with ATS use disorder and co-occurring ADHD, and the CGC agreed that clinicians could give MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with co-occurring ATS use disorder and ADHD due to the effects of MPH on ADHD symptoms. Clinicians should note the importance of thorough cardiovascular screening at baseline, including baseline assessment of cardiovascular function, and clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular dysfunction during the early phase of treatment.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^b6b2afb9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamine formulations — prescription amphetamine formulations are FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy and increase dopamine and norepinephrine signaling by increasing the release and inhibiting the reuptake of these neurotransmitters; meta-analyses reported that prescription psychostimulants (including modafinil, methylphenidate, MAS-ER, lisdexamfetamine, and dextroamphetamine) were associated with better cocaine-related outcomes, including sustained abstinence and cocaine-negative urine drug results, with no difference noted on treatment retention and similar findings when including non-psychostimulant medications (eg, bupropion). The CGC emphasized the importance of adequate dosing and noted that higher doses of prescription psychostimulants were associated with the best outcomes for cocaine use disorder, while careful monitoring and management of risk of misuse and diversion is important. When prescribing amphetamine formulations, thorough cardiovascular screening (eg, ECG, stress test) at baseline — including baseline assessment of cardiovascular function — should be considered, particularly if the patient has underlying risk factors; clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular dysfunction during the early phase of treatment, and blood pressure effects can be managed by close monitoring and dose adjustments. In addition to reduction of cocaine use, there is evidence that psychostimulant medications can reduce ADHD symptoms in adults with co-occurring ADHD, though a systematic review showed mixed results that may have been impacted by insufficient dosing.

Stimulant intoxication — assessment and hyperadrenergic symptom management — clinicians should assess hyperadrenergic signs and symptoms, including tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and agitation, and ongoing monitoring and management of vital signs — especially heart rate and blood pressure — is critical to prevent complications from sympathomimetic toxicity. GABAergic agents are the primary treatment for stimulant-related hyperadrenergic symptoms, and significant hyperadrenergic symptoms should typically be managed in an acute care setting. For cocaine intoxication with cardiovascular disease, beta blockers are generally contraindicated; many experts recommend alternative medications such as calcium channel blockers, alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilators, noting these classes may be most beneficial for hypertension and vasospasm but may result in poor control of reflex tachycardia. Limited data indicate that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g., dexmedetomidine for more severe symptoms, clonidine for mild to moderate symptoms) are beneficial for stimulant-induced agitation, can be useful for hypertension and tachycardia, and thus should be considered in the management of the hyperadrenergic state of stimulant intoxication; clinicians should monitor for medication side effects with usual care. If considering pharmacotherapy with a beta blocker, one with concomitant alpha-1 antagonism (e.g., labetalol) is preferred due to low risk of unopposed alpha stimulation, and clinicians should consider consulting with a specialist in these instances; additionally, calcium channel blockers may decrease hypertension and vasospasm but not necessarily tachycardia, and benzodiazepines appear safe for non-cardiovascular related symptoms.

### Cardiovascular effects of ADHD Therapies: JACC review topic of the week [^5b5eb27a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been stable over the past 3 decades, prescriptions of sympathomimetic stimulants have steadily increased in the United States. This study consisted of a systematic review of PubMed articles screened for ADHD medications and potential cardiovascular toxicity as well as nondrug strategies for managing ADHD. The cumulative body of data showed that ADHD medications cause modest elevations in resting heart rate and blood pressure. Other adverse effects reported with ADHD stimulants included arrhythmia, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and sudden death. However, such reports did not imply causation, and there was a paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing long-term safety of ADHD medications, particularly among adults. Further studies are essential to clarify the risks and benefits of ADHD stimulant medications and to explore nonpharmacological options, including regular exercise and omega-3 fatty acids, which could be helpful for improving ADHD symptoms.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^646d5474]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

CONCERTA has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of CONCERTA exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. CONCERTA can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including CONCERTA, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing CONCERTA, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store CONCERTA in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give CONCERTA to anyone else.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Methylin has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of Methylin exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Methylin can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including Methylin, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

### The impact of stimulant medications on blood pressure and body mass index in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^117ff4cb]. Academic Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe changes in blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI) associated with stimulant medication fills in children.

Methods

Observational, retrospective matched cohort study of children 6–17.9 years initiating stimulant medication between 7/1/2010–6/30/2017 matched 1:3 by age, race, ethnicity, and sex to children with no stimulant use during this period. All BPs and BMIs recorded during ambulatory visits were identified. Generalized linear models were used to estimate differences in change in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and BMI over time.

Results

The 686 children with stimulant prescription fills and 2048 matched controls did not differ by baseline SBP or BMI. The matched control group (30.5% female, mean age 11.2 ± 3.4 years 79.7% white) was more likely to be publicly insured (35% vs. 21%, P < .01). After adjusting for baseline values, over a mean follow-up of 144 days change in SBP or DBP did not differ significantly between patients with stimulant medication fills and matched controls. Stimulant use was associated with a 4.7 percentile decrease in BMI percentile compared to matched controls (95% CI: 3.69, 5.71; P < .01).

Conclusions

In a pediatric primary care cohort, stimulant prescription fills were associated with marked decreases in BMI but no significant changes in BP over time.

### Frequency and individual severity of arterial blood pressure changes in children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride: a prospective non-interventional study [^07d7a6bf]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

MPH therapy

Because psychiatric treatment was based on the clinical practice of the responsible child and youth psychiatrist, participants were treated with different preparations of the active ingredient MPH. These included the following: Medikinet and Medikinet retard (MEDICE Arzneimittel Pütter GmbH & Co. KG; Iserlohn, Germany); Equasym retard (Shire Deutschland GmbH; Berlin, Germany); Ritalin LA (Novartis Pharma GmbH; Nürnberg, Germany); and Concerta retard (Janssen-Cilag GmbH; Neuss, Germany). As recommended by the patient information sheet, MPH therapy was started with the lowest possible dose, which was usually 5 mg of MPH once or twice per day. Then, the daily dose was increased at weekly intervals by 5–10 mg, depending on the individual participant's response and tolerability. The mean daily MPH dose was 21.16 (11.14) mg and did not exceed 60 mg. MPH was administered as one, two or three doses per day.

Data analysis

For each individual, the measurements of each ABPM session were averaged separately for daytime and night-time. To obtain a more reliable baseline BP, based on the effect of a regression to the middle, averaging of baseline ABPM measurements was performed for cases where two sessions were conducted. Then, ABPM measurements during MPH therapy were compared with baseline values. In service of our aim of identifying the severity of BP changes during MPH therapy, when two ABPM sessions were performed during MPH therapy, the one with the greater BP effect was selected for analysis. Therefore, our analysis approach adequately reflected the potential cardiovascular load on the individual patient, which is crucial because even a single occurrence of a severe BP change can have acute clinical consequences. Because the EU-wide standardised patient information sheet for MPH estimates that BP changes > 10 mm Hg are 'common' (≥ 1% to < 10%), this information served as a comparative size for the study results. Accordingly, a relevant BP change was defined as a > 10 mm Hg change (increase or decrease) in systolic BP or diastolic BP during either daytime or night-time; the 'common' appearance of the adverse effect was defined as stated previously. To improve the comparability of the results with those of other studies, parameters of descriptive statistics were calculated because existing studies of this topic mainly provide these data. For the sensitivity analysis, the 95% CI and 99% CI were calculated.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the athlete: an American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^88a05796]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular considerations for stimulant use in athletes — methylphenidate elevated heart rate by 11 beats per minute in methylphenidate-naïve patients compared to 4 beats per minute with continued use, and the clinical significance of a 1–5 mmHg blood pressure increase is disputed. No clinically significant difference was found in the risk between methylphenidate and amphetamine salts, and sudden cardiac death is rare among athletes. Team Physicians should refrain from prescribing stimulants to children with pre-existing heart disease or symptoms consistent with cardiovascular disease, but because estimated rates of sudden death in stimulant-treated ADHD patients do not exceed those of the general population, team physicians should not refrain from treating athletes with stimulants because of concerns about sudden death. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends monitoring blood pressure and heart rate and obtaining EKGs with nearly all medicine treatments of ADHD — stimulant and nonstimulant, whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not support the routine use of EKGs before initiating stimulant therapy and contends there is no proof of increased rates of SCD in patients taking medications for ADHD. It remains prudent for Team Physicians to periodically monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and exertional symptoms in athletes treated for ADHD.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^f20b1974]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^5ad4d85a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Only after all these aspects have been assessed, the prescriber should consider: (1) second-line medications (atomoxetine – which selectively inhibits the norepinephrine transporter, and guanfacine – that selectively stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, or clonidine, that selectively stimulates alpha-2A adrenergic receptors); (2) augmenting agents (guanfacine or clonidine XR); (3) other agents, under specialistic advice/supervision, for which RCTs provide preliminary evidence of efficacy (e.g. bupropion, a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors).

Does the concomitant use of cannabis impact on the effectiveness and tolerability of psychostimulants?

The evidence on the effectiveness of psychostimulants in marijuana users and the tolerability of the combination psychostimulants–marijuana is limited. In a RCT of OROS-methylphenidate and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in youths with substance use disorder (in the majority of the cases (66%), marijuana), there were no significant differences, in terms of efficacy, between participants assigned to OROS-methylphenidate plus CBT and those in the placebo plus CBT, when considering the primary outcome (scores on the ADHD-RS completed by the clinicians), even though ADHD-RS scores rated by parents were significantly lower in adolescents treated with OROS-MPH + CBT compared to those in the placebo + CBT arm at 8 and 16 weeks. The tolerability of OROS-methylphenidate was not substantially different compared to what it would be expected with OROS-methylphenidate alone. Another RCT showed addictive effects of MPH and tetrahydrocannabinol on heart rate, but not on systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, even though there is no solid evidence, psychostimulants may be overall well tolerated, but their effectiveness may be decreased by the concomitant use of marijuana. This should be discussed with the patient at the initial assessment and during the follow-up visits. If a psychostimulant is prescribed, it is crucial to monitor its possible misuse carefully. The chances of misuse can be decreased by using long-acting as opposed to immediate-release formulations.

It should be noted that a subgroup of youths who use marijuana also tend to misuse other illicit substances, which may further impact on the tolerability of psychostimulants. Therefore, prescribers should comprehensively screen for the use of a variety of illicit drugs.

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with medications used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^707fe568]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We also reported several findings that were not explored in previous meta-analyses. In terms of types of ADHD medication, we found both stimulant and nonstimulant ADHD medications were not statistically significantly associated with any CVD, with similar pooled RRs. These would suggest similar null effects on CVD or similar degree of confounding in studies of both stimulants and nonstimulants. We were unable to compare stimulants vs nonstimulants for the risk of specific CVD due to the limited number of studies that examined nonstimulants. Of note, 1 previous open-label extension of an RCT studycompared the cardiovascular risks of a stimulant ADHD medication (dexmethylphenidate) vs a nonstimulant ADHD medication guanfacine. The study found that dexmethylphenidate was associated with increased systolic blood pressure, while guanfacine was associated with decreased heart rate, but both returned to baseline value during the 1-year open-label extension phase. It suggests that there might be differences in cardiovascular risks between stimulants and nonstimulants, but these differences may attenuate over time, thus not leading to a significant difference in clinically relevant outcomes. Nevertheless, head-to-head comparison studies based on observational data are warranted to compare stimulant vs nonstimulant ADHD medications regarding the risk of specific CVD.

### Risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with medications used in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c407acc1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We found that the risk of cardiovascular events associated with ADHD medications seemed to be higher among those with preexisting CVD compared with no prior CVD, although the findings did not reach the threshold for statistical significance. This coincides with raising concerns that individuals with congenital or acquired CVD are predisposed to additional risk. Despite the lack of data supporting CVD history as a contraindication for ADHD medications, the FDA labeling includes a warning on the use of ADHD medications among individuals with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems. Current treatment guidelines generally recommend carefully assessing patients with ADHD (eg, personal and family history of CVD, physical examination, electrocardiogram) and identifying individuals at risk before initiating ADHD medications. Careful monitoring should also be performed after initiation. Further studies focusing on the potential modifying risk of preexisting CVD, ideally separating risks for congenital or acquired CVD, are warranted. Clinical guidelines on prescribing ADHD medications among high-risk individuals should be updated once further evidence is available. We also found the point estimates for risk of CVD seemed to be higher among female compared with male patients, although only 3 studies have examined the sex-specific association along with high heterogeneity between studies. Previous research has shown that females with ADHD have somewhat different patterns of comorbidities, and response to stimulantsthan males, and additional research is needed to examine this potential sex difference.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^7fde2897]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome — attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) pharmacotherapy often uses psychostimulants, atomoxetine, and alpha-agonists but warrants cardiac caution due to potential increased heart rate, hypertension, and potential association with arrhythmia, with added concern in those with structural cardiac defects or history of QT prolongation. Given these considerations, it is recommended that individuals with TS be referred for cardiac consultation and/or ECG prior to starting pharmacological treatment for ADHD; expert clinical opinion suggests that with appropriate screening and routine subsequent monitoring, traditional medications may benefit selected individuals. Alpha agonists such as long-acting clonidine or guanfacine are often selected in concert with cardiology, and recent data indicate a potential overall decrease in adult height with consistent stimulant use over an extended period, which should be discussed with families to support shared decision-making balancing ADHD symptom control and growth.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medications and long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases [^23f2ef2f]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Use of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications has increased substantially over the past decades. However, the potential risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with long-term ADHD medication use remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the association between long-term use of ADHD medication and the risk of CVD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This case-control study included individuals in Sweden aged 6 to 64 years who received an incident diagnosis of ADHD or ADHD medication dispensation between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2020. Data on ADHD and CVD diagnoses and ADHD medication dispensation were obtained from the Swedish National Inpatient Register and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register, respectively. Cases included individuals with ADHD and an incident CVD diagnosis (ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, and other forms of heart disease). Incidence density sampling was used to match cases with up to 5 controls without CVD based on age, sex, and calendar time. Cases and controls had the same duration of follow-up.

Exposure

Cumulative duration of ADHD medication use up to 14 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was incident CVD. The association between CVD and cumulative duration of ADHD medication use was measured using adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% CIs.

Results

Of 278 027 individuals with ADHD aged 6 to 64 years, 10 388 with CVD were identified (median [IQR] age, 34.6 [20.0–45.7] years; 6154 males [59.2%]) and matched with 51 672 control participants without CVD (median [IQR] age, 34.6 [19.8–45.6] years; 30 601 males [59.2%]). Median (IQR) follow-up time in both groups was 4.1 (1.9–6.8) years. Longer cumulative duration of ADHD medication use was associated with an increased risk of CVD compared with nonuse (0 to ≤ 1 year: AOR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93–1.06]; 1 to ≤ 2 years: AOR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01–1.18]; 2 to ≤ 3 years: AOR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05–1.25]; 3 to ≤ 5 years: AOR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.17–1.39]; and > 5 years: AOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.12–1.36]). Longer cumulative ADHD medication use was associated with an increased risk of hypertension (eg, 3 to ≤ 5 years: AOR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.51–1.97] and > 5 years: AOR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.55–2.08]) and arterial disease (eg, 3 to ≤ 5 years: AOR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.11–2.45] and > 5 years: AOR, 1.49 [95% CI, 0.96–2.32]). Across the 14-year follow-up, each 1-year increase of ADHD medication use was associated with a 4% increased risk of CVD (AOR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.03–1.05]), with a larger increase in risk in the first 3 years of cumulative use (AOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.04–1.11]) and stable risk over the remaining follow-up. Similar patterns were observed in children and youth (aged < 25 years) and adults (aged ≥ 25 years).

Conclusions and Relevance

This case-control study found that long-term exposure to ADHD medications was associated with an increased risk of CVDs, especially hypertension and arterial disease. These findings highlight the importance of carefully weighing potential benefits and risks when making treatment decisions about long-term ADHD medication use. Clinicians should regularly and consistently monitor cardiovascular signs and symptoms throughout the course of treatment.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — medication contributors and secondary causes — Approximately 20% of adults with hypertension reported regular use of over-the-counter or nonprescription medications that may raise blood pressure (BP) or interfere with therapy, and these medications are associated with uncontrolled BP and should be reviewed during evaluation of patients with resistant hypertension. Some prescription drugs are known to elevate BP and should be replaced with alternative agents that avoid hypertensive side effects, if possible; however, in some settings, such as the treatment of malignant diseases, the contributing medication should be continued if hypertension can be controlled. Secondary hypertension is more common among adults with resistant hypertension, particularly primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnea, renal parenchymal disease, and renovascular disease.

α2 adrenergic agonists for the treatment of tics — with or without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Physicians should counsel individuals with tics and comorbid ADHD that α2 adrenergic agonists may provide benefit for both conditions (Level B) and should prescribe α2 adrenergic agonists for the treatment of tics when the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks (Level B). Physicians must counsel patients regarding common side effects of α2 adrenergic agonists, including sedation (Level A) and must monitor heart rate and blood pressure in patients with tics treated with α2 adrenergic agonists (Level A); when prescribing guanfacine extended release, physicians must monitor the QTc interval in patients with a history of cardiac conditions, patients taking other QT-prolonging agents, or patients with a family history of long QT syndrome (Level A). Physicians discontinuing α2 adrenergic agonists must gradually taper them to avoid rebound hypertension (Level A). In children and adolescents, hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation with both agents, and QTc prolongation with guanfacine extended release were demonstrated, and abrupt withdrawal of α2 adrenergic agonists may cause rebound hypertension.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

RELEXXII has a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of RELEXXII exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. RELEXXII can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including RELEXXII, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing RELEXXII, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store RELEXXII in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give RELEXXII to anyone else. Throughout RELEXXII treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were taking CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosage. Avoid RELEXXII use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious cardiac arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac disease.

5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some patients may have larger increases. Monitor all RELEXXII-treated patients for hypertension and tachycardia.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^84b676aa]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, our network meta-analysis represents the most comprehensive comparative synthesis to date on the efficacy and tolerability of medications for children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD. We have addressed the limitations of previous network meta-analyses, which focused selectively on children and adolescents, or adults, or included only published material, non-blinded trials, or non-core ADHD outcomes.,

Overall, all medications, except modafinil in adults, were more efficacious than placebo for the short-term treatment of ADHD, and they were less efficacious and less well tolerated in adults than in children and adolescents. However, the included medications were not equivalent in relation to their mean effect size, which ranged from moderate to high and varied according to the type of rater. Furthermore, even though amphetamines were the most efficacious compounds in children, adolescents, and adults, the effects of medications varied across age groups for several outcomes. With respect to tolerability, in children, only amphetamines and guanfacine were less well tolerated than placebo, whereas in adults, methylphenidate, amphetamines, and atomoxetine were worse than placebo. Additionally, amphetamines significantly increased diastolic blood pressure in children and adolescents, but not in adults. In children and adolescents, methylphenidate was the only drug with better acceptability than placebo; in adults, amphetamines were the only compound with better acceptability than placebo. Atomoxetine had the lowest mean effect size in children and adolescents based on clinicians' ratings, but in adults, its efficacy on ADHD core symptoms was comparable with that of methylphenidate. The large confidence interval in relation to the efficacy and tolerability of bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, and modafinil suggests that caution should be used when interpreting these data. Another relevant finding, which requires replication in head-to-head trials, is the absence of significant differences between amphetamines and methylphenidate on the CGI-I measure.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 278 027 individuals with ADHD aged 6 to 64 years. The incidence rate of CVD was 7.34 per 1000 person-years. After applying exclusion criteria and matching, the analysis included 10 388 cases (median [IQR] age at baseline, 34.6 (20.0–45.7) years; 6154 males [59.2%] and 4234 females [40.8%]) and 51 672 matched controls (median [IQR] age at baseline, 34.6 [19.8–45.6] years; 30 601 males [59.2%] and 21 071 females [40.8%]) (Figure 1 and Table 1). Median (IQR) follow-up in both groups was 4.1 (1.9–6.8) years. Among the controls, 3363 had received a CVD diagnosis after their index dates. The most common types of CVD in cases were hypertension (4210 cases [40.5%]) and arrhythmias (1310 cases [12.6%]; eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Table 1 presents the sociodemographic information and somatic and psychiatric comorbidities in cases and controls. In general, cases had higher rates of somatic and psychiatric comorbidities and a lower level of educational attainment compared with controls.

Discussion

This large, nested case-control study found an increased risk of incident CVD associated with long-term ADHD medication use, and the risk increased with increasing duration of ADHD medication use. This association was statistically significant both for children and youth and for adults, as well as for females and males. The primary contributors to the association between long-term ADHD medication use and CVD risk was an increased risk of hypertension and arterial disease. Increased risk was also associated with stimulant medication use.

We found individuals with long-term ADHD medication use had an increased risk of incident CVD in a dose-response manner in the first 3 years of cumulative ADHD medication use. To our knowledge, few previous studies have investigated the association between long-term ADHD medication use and the risk of CVD with follow-up of more than 2 years. The only 2 prior studies with long-term follow-up (median, 9.5 and 7.9 years,) found an average 2-fold and 3-fold increased risk of CVD with ADHD medication use compared with nonuse during the study period, yet 1 of the studiesincluded only children, and participants in the other studywere not the general population of individuals with ADHD (including those with ADHD and long QT syndrome). Furthermore, both studies were subject to prevalent user bias. Results from the current study suggest that the CVD risk associated with ADHD medication use (23% increased risk for > 5 years of ADHD medication use compared with nonuse) is lower than previously reported. Furthermore, we observed that the increased risk stabilized after the first several years of medication use and persisted throughout the 14-year follow-up period.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^17d4ee4a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of hyperadrenergic symptoms, AAAP/ASAM 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain ongoing monitoring and manage vital signs, especially HR and BP, to prevent potential complications from untreated sympathomimetic toxicity in patients with hyperadrenergic symptoms.
