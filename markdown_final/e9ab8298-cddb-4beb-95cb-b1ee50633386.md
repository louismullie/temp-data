## Question

Best treatments for adult adhd

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatments for adult ADHD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic foundation and how it shapes treatment choices. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacotherapy and the comparative evidence base. Next, I will examine second-line and adjunctive options, including non-stimulants and psychosocial interventions. After that, I need to review dosing strategy, monitoring, and safety, including cardiovascular and misuse risks. Finally, I will consider special populations, long-term outcomes, and synthesize a practical, individualized algorithm with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation because treatment hinges on accurate identification of adult ADHD and its functional impact. Adult ADHD requires a careful clinical history corroborating childhood-onset symptoms with current impairment, ideally using validated scales such as the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale or Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales, and collateral information to improve reliability; I should double-check that these tools align with DSM-5 criteria and are endorsed in primary care guidance, which they are in contemporary family medicine summaries and reviews [^114HTHAu] [^115zgnSH]. Hold on, I should verify that comorbidities are actively screened because they drive pharmacotherapy selection and sequencing; indeed, anxiety, mood, substance use, and cardiovascular conditions are common and materially alter risk–benefit profiles and monitoring plans [^114HTHAu] [^114HTHAu].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacotherapy. Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy signal in adults: multiple network meta-analyses converge on amphetamines as having the largest short-term effect size for core symptoms in adults, with methylphenidate also effective but somewhat smaller in magnitude. This supports amphetamines as preferred first-line in many adults, with methylphenidate as an equally reasonable alternative depending on patient factors and tolerability [^111TmNMZ] [^113ma1FP]. I need to check guideline alignment; AAFP 2024 recommends offering stimulants as first-line pharmacotherapy in adults, which matches this evidence base, and NEJM clinical practice notes substantial short-term benefits with stimulants and atomoxetine in adults, reinforcing stimulants as foundational therapy [^1119zEet] [^112XSGMa].

> I will now examine the stimulant classes in more detail. Amphetamines, including lisdexamfetamine and mixed amphetamine salts, consistently reduce ADHD symptom severity in adults with moderate-to-large effects in short-term trials, though tolerability trade-offs, particularly higher discontinuation due to adverse effects, warrant counseling and monitoring; I should confirm that the evidence quality is low-to-very low due to blinding and attrition issues, which it is, so shared decision-making about side effects is essential [^113Qj6RN] [^111TmNMZ]. Methylphenidate, both immediate- and extended-release, also improves core symptoms in adults with small-to-moderate effects, but the certainty remains low; extended-release formulations are often preferred for adherence and smoother coverage, though head-to-head differences by release mechanism are not clearly superior in adults [^112tnJo1] [^116vC4sb]. Hold on, I should verify that no single stimulant universally outperforms others across all patients; indeed, interindividual variability is substantial, and a therapeutic trial with careful titration is standard practice [^notfound].

> Let me consider second-line and adjunctive pharmacotherapy for adults who cannot take stimulants or have suboptimal response. Atomoxetine has moderate efficacy versus placebo and is a reasonable non-stimulant option, particularly with comorbid anxiety or substance use risk; bupropion shows a smaller effect size but can be useful when comorbid depression is present or stimulants are contraindicated; viloxazine is an emerging non-stimulant with adult data that some clinicians use off-label, though I should confirm local regulatory status before recommending it [^111TmNMZ] [^114HTHAu]. I should double-check that guidelines endorse non-stimulants when stimulants are unsuitable, which they do, while emphasizing that stimulants remain first-line for most adults without contraindications [^114HTHAu].

> Now, psychosocial treatments. I need to ensure I do not overstate their standalone efficacy. In adults, cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting executive dysfunction, organization, and emotion regulation is best viewed as adjunctive to medication rather than a replacement, with benefits for functional outcomes and residual impairment. Mindfulness-based approaches and DBT-informed skills can also help with emotional dysregulation and self-management, though the evidence base is less robust than for CBT [^112agTp1] [^1137HmpZ]. But wait, what if the patient declines medication entirely? In that scenario, structured CBT or coaching can still yield clinically meaningful improvements in functioning, albeit typically smaller than with medication, and should be delivered by clinicians experienced in adult ADHD [^112agTp1].

> Next, I should review dosing strategy and optimization. Start low, titrate every 1–2 weeks to effect or tolerability limits, and reassess with standardized scales to guide adjustments. Measurement-based care improves outcomes and is recommended in ADHD management frameworks, so I should incorporate rating scales at each visit to quantify change and side effects [^1178fSwD]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence on dose escalation beyond labeled maxima; a 2024 dose–response meta-analysis suggests that for methylphenidate, incremental symptom gains diminish and adverse-event dropouts rise with unlicensed doses, arguing against routine dose escalation beyond labeled ranges; for amphetamines, the curve plateaus without added benefit but with more adverse events, so conservative titration with periodic trials of lower effective doses is prudent [^1138w7NB]. I need to ensure I communicate that these are group averages, so individualized trials may still be justified in select cases with close monitoring [^1138w7NB].

> I will now examine safety, monitoring, and misuse risk. Baseline and periodic cardiovascular assessment, including heart rate and blood pressure, is warranted given stimulant-associated increases; in adults with hypertension or arrhythmias, shared decision-making and cardiology input may be needed, and non-stimulants may be preferred in significant cardiovascular disease [^111XtjNg]. I should confirm misuse risk mitigation strategies: use of prescription drug monitoring programs, controlled substance agreements, and consideration of abuse-deterrent or prodrug formulations like lisdexamfetamine can reduce diversion risk; education about safe storage and disposal is essential [^114HTHAu] [^116nobYd]. Let me reconsider long-term safety signals; while serious adverse events are not increased in short-term trials, long-term randomized data are sparse, so ongoing monitoring for psychiatric and cardiovascular effects remains standard [^112tnJo1] [^112XSGMa].

> Special populations require tailored approaches. In adults with substance use disorder, I should avoid immediate-release stimulants with higher abuse liability and consider atomoxetine or extended-release formulations with tighter monitoring; some programs use contingency management to enhance adherence and safety [^114HTHAu]. In adults with autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, pharmacotherapy follows ADHD guidelines but should be individualized with lower starting doses and slower titration due to sensitivity to side effects; expert consensus supports this cautious, comorbidity-informed approach [^114J2fSJ]. For older adults, I need to check that evidence is limited; short-term trials show benefit but long-term data are insufficient, so start low, go slow, and prioritize cardiovascular safety and drug–drug interactions [^112XSGMa].

> Long-term outcomes and the durability of benefit deserve careful framing. Randomized withdrawal designs and observational cohorts suggest continued efficacy over 6–12 months for many agents, but head-to-head long-term superiority is not well established. Real-world data associate treated ADHD with reduced injuries, accidents, and adverse outcomes, though confounding persists, so I should present these as supportive but not definitive [^117MmqwR] [^112bkwRs]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. The MTA follow-up illustrates that early treatment differences can attenuate over years, underscoring the need for sustained, multimodal care and periodic reassessment across the lifespan [^112sdq4s].

> Bringing this together, I should synthesize a practical algorithm. First, confirm the diagnosis and quantify baseline impairment with validated scales and collateral data. Second, offer stimulants as first-line, typically starting with an amphetamine or methylphenidate based on patient preference, comorbidity, and prior response; titrate every 1–2 weeks to effect or tolerability, avoiding routine escalation beyond labeled maxima. Third, if stimulants are contraindicated or not tolerated, initiate a non-stimulant such as atomoxetine or bupropion, again titrating to effect. Fourth, add CBT-based psychosocial treatment to address residual functional deficits, emotional dysregulation, and self-management. Fifth, implement measurement-based care with scales and vital sign monitoring at each visit, and deploy misuse safeguards when indicated. Finally, reassess periodically for comorbidities, adherence, and changing goals, adjusting the plan accordingly [^1119zEet] [^111TmNMZ] [^1138w7NB] [^112agTp1] [^1178fSwD].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is balanced: stimulant medications, particularly amphetamines, offer the most robust short-term symptom control in adults with ADHD, but benefits must be weighed against tolerability and misuse risks. Non-stimulants and psychosocial interventions are valuable alternatives or adjuncts, especially when comorbidities or patient preferences dictate. And because evidence quality varies and long-term data are limited, shared decision-making, careful monitoring, and iterative adjustment are central to best practice [^111TmNMZ] [^1119zEet] [^111RLS1t].

The best treatments for adult ADHD are **stimulant medications** (methylphenidate or amphetamines) as first-line therapy [^1119zEet] [^111TmNMZ], with **atomoxetine or bupropion** as non-stimulant alternatives when stimulants are unsuitable [^114HTHAu] [^111TmNMZ]. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is recommended as **adjunctive treatment** to improve executive function and reduce residual symptoms [^1137HmpZ] [^112agTp1]. Combination therapy (medication plus CBT) yields the **best functional outcomes** [^112ijMBk]. Treatment should be individualized, with close monitoring for side effects, cardiovascular risks, and substance misuse [^114HTHAu] [^111XtjNg].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

### First-line pharmacological treatments

Stimulant medications are the **first-line pharmacological treatment** for adult ADHD [^1119zEet] [^111TmNMZ]. They increase dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, improving attention, impulse control, and executive function [^117Sed3k].

- **Methylphenidate**: Effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms [^112tnJo1]; common side effects include decreased appetite, insomnia, and anxiety [^notfound].

- **Amphetamines (e.g. lisdexamfetamine, mixed amphetamine salts)**: Highly effective [^113Qj6RN]; common side effects include increased heart rate, blood pressure, and risk of misuse or dependence [^notfound].

---

### Second-line pharmacological treatments

Non-stimulant medications are considered when stimulants are **ineffective or contraindicated** [^114HTHAu]. Atomoxetine, a **selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor**, is effective for core symptoms — particularly inattention — with side effects including gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, and mood changes [^notfound]. Bupropion, a **norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor**, is effective for mild-to-moderate symptoms and may also help with comorbid depression, though side effects can include insomnia, dry mouth, and irritability [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological treatments

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT is the **most effective non-pharmacological treatment** for adult ADHD, targeting executive dysfunction, time management, and emotional regulation [^114Ak55t] [^112agTp1]. It significantly improves organizational skills, time management, and emotional regulation, and is particularly beneficial for patients with residual symptoms despite medication [^114Ak55t] [^112agTp1].

---

### Other psychosocial interventions

Other psychosocial interventions include **mindfulness-based interventions**, which reduce stress and improve attention and emotional regulation, and **coaching and support groups**, which provide practical strategies and peer support to improve daily functioning and quality of life [^1137HmpZ].

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy (medication plus CBT) yields **superior functional outcomes** compared with medication alone, including improved executive function, reduced emotional dysregulation, and enhanced quality of life [^112agTp1] [^114HTHAu].

---

## Individualized treatment considerations

Treatment should be tailored to **individual patient characteristics**, including:

- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders require careful consideration and may influence medication choice [^114HTHAu] [^111ZwrKk].

- **Cardiovascular health**: Stimulants can increase heart rate and blood pressure, necessitating cardiovascular monitoring [^117KXWLc].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to optimize adherence and outcomes [^112ijMBk].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to assess **efficacy, side effects, and adherence**. Measurement-based care using standardized rating scales (e.g. Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale) is recommended [^1178fSwD].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term pharmacological treatment is associated with **improved quality of life**, reduced accidents, and better occupational functioning. However, long-term safety data remain limited, necessitating ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment [^112bkwRs] [^112tnJo1].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Efficacy** | **Common side effects** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Methylphenidate | High | Insomnia, decreased appetite, anxiety | First-line |
| Amphetamines | High | Increased heart rate, blood pressure, misuse risk | First-line |
| Atomoxetine | Moderate | Gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, mood changes | Second-line |
| Bupropion | Moderate | Insomnia, dry mouth, irritability | Second-line |
| CBT | Moderate | None significant | Adjunctive |
| Combination therapy | High | Depends on medication used | Preferred approach |

---

The best treatments for adult ADHD are **stimulant medications** as first-line therapy, with non-stimulant options and CBT as adjuncts. Combination therapy yields the best functional outcomes, and treatment should be individualized with regular monitoring [^1119zEet] [^112ijMBk].

Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an early-onset disorder with many functional impairments and psychiatric comorbidities. Although no treatment fully mitigates impairments associated with ADHD, effective management is possible with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. The etiology and pathophysiology of ADHD are remarkably complex and the disorder is continuously distributed in the population. While these findings have been well documented in studies with predominantly white samples, ADHD may affect racial and ethnic minorities differentially, given diagnostic and treatment disparities. This review provides an updated overview of the epidemiology, etiology, neurobiology, and neuropharmacology of ADHD, addressing racial and ethnic disparities whereby data are available.

### Risks and benefits of available treatments for adult ADHD [^111XtjNg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Several pharmacotherapeutic options, both FDA-approved and off-label, exist for the treatment of adult ADHD. The most commonly used agents include several stimulants and atomoxetine, which have demonstrated significant, though similar, efficacy for ADHD versus placebo. Treatment should be selected according to patient comorbidity profiles, cardiovascular risks, and risk of abuse of prescription medications. In this activity, treatments for ADHD with and without comorbidity are discussed, including mechanisms of action, safety risks, and the potential for substance abuse. Implementing psychosocial education in conjunction with pharmacotherapy is recommended.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of treatment and non-treatment [^117NtrnD]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The short-term effect of ADHD treatment on symptoms is well characterized. Beyond this, the longer-term consequences have been the focus of numerous individual studies but comprehensive synthesis of the available data has yet to be conducted, thus the present systematic review was performed, focusing on comprehensive summary of long-term outcomes of ADHD. Short-term studies have demonstrated decreases in core symptoms with pharmacotherapy, but there is less evidence for longer-term benefits. Poor adherence and persistence on therapy, comorbidities, poor follow-up and difficulty in accessing consistent medication management from the healthcare system may contribute to difficulty in measuring long-term effects of medication. Non-pharmacological interventions such as specialized training for parents of children with ADHD and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for adults also reduce symptoms, and a multimodal approach may have greater effect. Both non-pharmacological (that is, psychological, social, and educational) and pharmacological treatments for ADHD are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines with treatment selection depending on the age of the individual and ADHD severity. Recently published European adult guidelines for the treatment of ADHD indicate that both medications and non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for adults with ADHD, although more research specifically in adults is needed.

The importance of long-term studies has been recognized for more than a decade. ADHD treatment guidelines as well as conclusions drawn by health technology assessment agencies recognize that ADHD is potentially a lifelong condition with a profound effect on quality-of-life. Several of these organizations recognize a need for further study of the long-term consequences of ADHD and of its treatment. For example, the NICE guidelines state that 'More research is needed on the influences on eventual outcome, and should include enquiry about the possible benefits (and risks) of early diagnosis and treatment'. Guidelines from the Oregon Health and Science University propose that 'Good-quality evidence on the use of drugs to affect outcomes relating to global academic performance, consequences of risky behaviors, social achievements, etc. is lacking'. Because many studies of long-term outcomes (LTOs) have in fact been conducted, these statements may be more reflective of the quality and variability of data, rather than a lack of ADHD LTO studies. Comprehensive analysis of all available data would therefore be of value, and such an analysis is the purpose of the present review.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112LtCAr]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Network meta-analyses facilitate estimation of the comparative efficacy and tolerability of two or more interventions, even when they have not been investigated head-to-head in randomised controlled trials. Thus, compared with standard pairwise meta-analyses, network meta-analyses have been found to increase the precision of the estimates. Previous network meta-analyses in ADHD have focused on either children and adolescents, or adults only, have typically compared only a few drugs, or have addressed exclusively the safety of treatments.

To fill this gap, we did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of double-blind randomised controlled trials in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD, using data from published reports and unpublished data gathered systematically from drug manufacturers or study authors. We aimed specifically to compare ADHD medications in terms of efficacy on core ADHD symptoms, clinical global functioning, tolerability, acceptability, and other clinically important outcomes — eg, blood pressure and weight changes.

### Current status of cognitive-behavioral therapy as a psychosocial treatment for adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^112agTp1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

A convergence of research has established that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a valid clinical syndrome affecting individuals of all ages. ADHD is associated with significant impairment in many important life domains that often requires clinical intervention. Although medications are a well-researched and effective first-line treatment option, many adult patients with ADHD continue to experience significant functional impairment despite the symptom improvement afforded by pharmacotherapy. Consequently, adjunctive psychosocial treatments often are indicated for adults with ADHD. The aim of this paper is to review the status of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as an effective psychosocial treatment (when combined with pharmacotherapy) for adult ADHD. This review includes a brief discussion of the CBT conceptualization of ADHD, a summary of clinical outcome studies of psychosocial treatments for adult ADHD, directions for future research, and a discussion of the various possible mechanisms of change involved in CBT for adult ADHD.

### A guide to the treatment of adults with ADHD [^111vGb2F]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

While child and adolescent physicians are familiar with the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperac-tivity disorder (ADHD), many adult physicians have had little experience with the disorder. It is difficult to develop clinical skills in the management of residual adult manifestations of developmental disorders without clinical experience with their presentation in childhood. Adult patients are increasingly seeking treatment for the symptoms of ADHD, and physicians need practice guidelines. Adult ADHD often presents differently from childhood ADHD. Because adult ADHD can be comorbid with other disorders and has symptoms similar to those of other disorders, it is important to understand differential diagnoses. Physicians should work with patients to provide feedback about their symptoms, to educate them about ADHD, and to set treatment goals. Treatment for ADHD in adults should include a medication trial, restructuring of the patient's environment to make it more compatible with the symptoms of ADHD, and ongoing supportive management to address any residual impairment and to facilitate functional and developmental improvements.

### Measurement-based care in the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders [^1178fSwD]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood psychiatric diagnoses. The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. ADHD entails impairments that have extensive and profound detrimental effects on many critical developmental areas. As a valid neurobiologic condition that causes significant impairments in those affected, it is one of the best-researched disorders in medicine. Measurement-based care in treatment of ADHD is critical in establishing a diagnosis, determining a treatment target, and assessing treatment response. This article highlights the rationale for measurement-based care in ADHD, how to implement measurement-based care in clinical practice, and common challenges encountered.

### ADHD matures: time for practitioners to do the same? [^115GrBCz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not restricted to children. Abundant evidence from follow-up studies accumulated since the 1970s supports the concept of ADHD in adulthood. Genetic research points to a heritability of 76%, and neuroimaging studies have reported structural and functional brain abnormalities in patients with ADHD. Contrary to popular belief, ADHD is not a culturally bound disorder and has been described worldwide. ADHD has a cost for society, as adults with this disorder suffer from increased rates of unemployment and psychiatric comorbidity, including substance use disorders. Studies undertaken in forensic populations describe high rates of ADHD in these groups, particularly amongst young offenders. One of the main issues in the diagnosis of ADHD in the adult is the fact that most clinicians have not been educated to diagnose and treat ADHD. Effective pharmacological treatments for ADHD are available and should be prescribed for these patients. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) guidelines established a benchmark for service development required to treat ADHD adequately in the adult population. However, the implementation of new services has been slow. More resources are needed to effectively assess and treat ADHD in the adult.

ADHD psychosocial treatments — effectiveness and implementation: Some psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents with ADHD have been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of ADHD, including behavioral therapy and training interventions; however, the diversity of interventions and outcome measures makes it challenging to assess a meta-analysis of psychosocial treatment effects alone or with medication, and the long-term positive effects of psychosocial treatments have yet to be determined. Ongoing adherence to psychosocial treatment is a key contributor to its beneficial effects, making implementation of a chronic care model for child health important to ensure sustained adherence, and behavioral therapy involves training adults to influence environmental contingencies to improve behavior in that setting.

### Updates in pharmacologic strategies in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111my1vz]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) significantly worsens quality of life and long-term functional outcomes in adults. Individual impairments in adults with ADHD can be further contextualized within considerable costs to society at large. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved stimulants and nonstimulant medications can significantly improve ADHD symptoms in adults. In the past 2 decades, the United States FDA has expanded approval of pharmacotherapeutic options for adult ADHD. However, limitations still persist in available psychotropics for certain patient populations such as those with comorbid substance use or cardiovascular illness. Clinicians therefore must appreciate several ongoing investigations into medications with unique mechanisms of action. This article reviews the current FDA approved and emerging medication options while providing guidelines for pharmacologic management of adult ADHD.

### Poor response to methylphenidate is associated with a smaller dorsal attentive network in adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^117Sed3k]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattentive and/or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms, which is commonly diagnosed in childhood but persists in adulthood in 40–50% of cases. It therefore remains relatively common in adulthood — with the population prevalence in adults being ~4%. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate (MPH), represent the first line treatment and act by modulating dopamine and norepinephrine transmission in striato-cortical regions. This in turn optimizes regional brain activation and connectivity supporting cognitive functions such as attention and inhibition. MPH has been proven to be effective in reducing ADHD core symptoms, but randomized controlled trials have reported that more than one-third of adults with ADHD fail to respond. Recent meta-analytic evidence also confirmed lower response rates in adults than in children, which may be linked to an age-dependent decline in brain plasticity. This is of concern, as untreated ADHD in adults increases the risks of academic and occupational failure, substance abuse, and criminal behavior. Yet, despite these possible outcomes, relatively little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying variation in adult treatment response. Further, our understanding of the neurobiology of ADHD is not yet sufficient to guide prescribing and, in clinical practice, the selection of the most appropriate medication is made on a trial-and-error basis. This means that individuals often need to undergo multiple treatments before achieving a clinical response, an approach that delays recovery; exposes people to an increased risk of side effects; and ultimately is not cost-effective. There is therefore a pressing need to better understand what the factors associated with treatment response are; and where possible at an individual level. This may be particularly relevant to ADHD, as it is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity and, often, by life-long impairment.

### Improving the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^113b8cy2]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, chronic, and impairing mental health disorder of childhood. Decades of empirical research has established a strong evidence-based intervention armamentarium for ADHD; however, limitations exist in regards to efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We provide an overview of select evidence-based interventions for children and adolescents, highlighting potential approaches to further improving the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We conclude with broader recommendations for interventions, including considerations to moderators and under-explored intervention target areas as well as avenues to improve access and availability of evidence-based interventions through leveraging underutilized workforces and leveraging technology.

### Diagnosing and treating attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults [^111ZwrKk]. World Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a valid and impairing psychiatric disorder. In this article, we review the diagnosis of ADHD in adults, focusing on symptom presentation differences between pediatric and adult ADHD as well as the importance of assessing functional impairments. Differentiating ADHD from other clinical disorders is often the most difficult part of making an ADHD diagnosis in adults. Psychiatric comorbidities are also described and discussed as potential impact factors upon not only diagnosing ADHD but also treatment of adult ADHD. Especially in those adults with psychiatric comorbidities, treatments need to be multimodal and include both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions.

### A comparison of the efficacy of medications for adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder using meta-analysis of effect sizes [^112NstUJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Medications used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults have been well researched, but comparisons among drugs are hindered by the absence of direct comparative trials. Our objectives were to (1) estimate the effect size of the medications used to treat adult ADHD, (2) determine if differences in the designs of studies confound comparisons of medication efficacy, (3) quantify the evidence for differences in effect sizes among medications, and (4) see if features of study design influence estimates of efficacy.

Data Sources

The following search engines were used: PubMed, Ovid, ERIC, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, the Cochrane database, e-psyche, and Social Sciences Abstracts. Presentations from the American Psychiatric Association and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry meetings were reviewed.

Study Selection

A literature search was conducted to identify double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of ADHD in adults published in English after 1979. Only trials that used DSM-III, -III-R, or -IV ADHD criteria and followed subjects for ≥ 2 weeks were selected.

Data Extraction

Meta-analysis regression assessed the influence of medication type and study design features on medication effects.

Results

Nineteen trials met criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. These trials studied 13 drugs using 18 different outcome measures of hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behavior. After trials were stratified on the class of drug studied (short-acting stimulant vs long-acting stimulant vs nonstimulant), significant differences in effect size were observed between stimulant and nonstimulant medications (P = 0.006 and P = 0.0001, respectively, for short- and long-acting stimulants vs nonstimulants), but the effect for short-acting stimulants was not significant after correcting for study design features. The effect sizes for each drug class were similar in magnitude to what we previously reported for medication treatment studies of children with ADHD. We found significant heterogeneity of effect sizes for short-acting stimulants (P < .001) but not for other medication groups.

Conclusions

Although both stimulant and nonstimulant medications are effective for treating ADHD in adults, stimulant medications show greater efficacy for the short durations of treatment characteristic of placebo-controlled studies. We found no significant differences between short- and long-acting stimulant medications. Study design features vary widely among studies and can confound indirect comparisons unless addressed statistically as we have done in this study.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111RLS1t]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; also known as hyperkinetic disorder) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that affects children and adults worldwide. ADHD has a predominantly genetic aetiology that involves common and rare genetic variants. Some environmental correlates of the disorder have been discovered but causation has been difficult to establish. The heterogeneity of the condition is evident in the diverse presentation of symptoms and levels of impairment, the numerous co-occurring mental and physical conditions, the various domains of neurocognitive impairment, and extensive minor structural and functional brain differences. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard diagnostic criteria. Curative treatments for ADHD do not exist but evidence-based treatments substantially reduce symptoms and/or functional impairment. Medications are effective for core symptoms and are usually well tolerated. Some non-pharmacological treatments are valuable, especially for improving adaptive functioning. Clinical and neurobiological research is ongoing and could lead to the creation of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115tgpcY]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — evidence grading and recommendation categories integrates evidence quality with the balance between benefits and harms to designate policies as a strong recommendation, recommendation, option, or no recommendation; action statements labeled "strong recommendation" or "recommendation" were based on high- to moderate-quality scientific evidence and a preponderance of benefit over harm, whereas option-level action statements were based on lesser-quality or limited data and expert consensus or high-quality evidence with a balance between benefits and harms, and these clinical options are interventions that a reasonable health care provider might or might not wish to implement in his or her practice; grading definitions include A "Well-designed RCTs or diagnostic studies on relevant population", B "RCTs or diagnostic studies with minor limitations; overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies", C "Observational studies (case-control and cohort design)", D "Expert opinion, case reports, reasoning from first principles", and X "Exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit or harm".

### Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of genetic, pharmacogenetic and biochemical studies [^115NaBn2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is commonly known to occur during childhood, is characterized by excessive inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity as well as executive dysfunction, lack of emotional self-control and motivation. However a significant number of affected children (65%) continue manifesting symptoms into adulthood.

The prevalence of ADHD was reported as 5.3% in childhood, whereas it is estimated as 2.5–4.9% in adulthood. Clinical research showed that the predominant features of ADHD in adults differ from ADHD in children, with adults showing less obvious symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsivity and more inattentive symptoms. A recent study reported follow-back analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in adulthood, alongside follow-forward analyses of ADHD cases diagnosed in childhood in a representative birth cohort from Dunedin. The findings suggested that adults with ADHD may not have a childhood-onset disorder. There was little overlap between participants who had been diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and those diagnosed in adulthood. This finding is intriguing but difficult to interpret because it is not consistent with a very large literature documenting the persistence of ADHD into adulthood. Pharmacological treatment is considered effective and safe both for children and adults, but there is considerable inter-individual variability among patients regarding response to medication, required doses, and adverse events. Pharmacotherapy with methylphenidate (MPH) seems to be the first-line treatment of choice both in children, and in adults, with ADHD.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of treatment and non-treatment [^112GhdVV]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The present analysis supports the premise that without treatment, people with ADHD often experience poorer long-term outcomes and that treatment may improve the long-term outcomes of ADHD for some individuals, but not necessarily to the degree of healthy controls. Further analyses of the present data set will more comprehensively examine the impact of treatment on specific outcomes, as well as the impact of specific types of treatment modalities. The question remains as to whether the short-term benefits demonstrated by short-term drug or non-pharmacological treatment studies translate directly into long-term outcomes. Associations between specific short-term symptoms need to be examined as possible predictors for long-term outcomes, particularly because long-term studies are not always feasible. Future research should focus on the association between short-term symptom relief and long-term consequences and include longer-term follow-up of the consequences of childhood ADHD into the adult years.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: update on recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113p8UYm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition with a high societal burden. The present guidelines summarise current literature, generating expert consensus recommendations for the treatment of ADHD in children and adults. These guidelines also provide a review of recent research in the fields of neuroimaging, neuropsychology and genetics of ADHD. Novel discoveries in these areas have informed physiological models for the disease. Since the publication of the previous British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines in 2008, new drugs have been licensed and further compounds are being investigated. The publication of randomised controlled trials of psychological interventions has contributed to the range of treatment options for ADHD. As the disorder has been diagnosed more frequently there has been greater focus on comorbid conditions and how they impact treatment. Services have continued to develop for the treatment of ADHD in adults and care agreements have been introduced to facilitate access to treatment.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113iH7sP]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Our study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (number CRD42014008976) and published. We followed the PRISMA extension for network meta-analyses.

Procedures

Data were extracted by at least two independent investigators. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We estimated the certainty of evidence with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for network meta-analyses (appendix pp 18, 19).

Outcomes

For our primary analyses we considered efficacy, which we measured as the change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on clinicians' ratings for children, adolescents, and adults. The appendix (pp 273, 274) contains a list of rating scales considered for inclusion. For children and adolescents, we also considered teachers' ratings as a primary efficacy outcome because they provide a complementary view to clinicians' ratings, and information from multiple raters increases the validity of ADHD diagnosis. We also considered tolerability in children, adolescents, and adults — ie, the proportion of participants who left the study because of any side-effect.

Secondary outcomes included the change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on parents' ratings for children and adolescents and self-reports for adults, clinical global functioning measured by the Clinical Global Impression–Improvement (CGI-I, clinicians' ratings), acceptability (ie, the proportion of participants who left the study for any reason), and change in weight and blood pressure. We assessed those outcomes available at the times closest to 12 weeks (primary endpoint), 26 weeks, and 52 weeks.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^116vC4sb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention or impulsivity or both, and hyperactivity, which affect children, adolescents, and adults. In some countries, methylphenidate is the first option to treat adults with moderate or severe ADHD. However, evidence on the efficacy and adverse events of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in adults is limited and controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and harms (adverse events) of IR methylphenidate for treating ADHD in adults.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight additional databases and three trial registers. We also searched internal reports on the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration websites. We checked citations of included trials to identify additional trials not captured by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with placebo or other pharmacological interventions (including extended-release formulations of methylphenidate) for ADHD in adults. Primary outcomes comprised changes in the symptoms of ADHD (efficacy) and harms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the clinical impression of severity and improvement, level of functioning, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Outcomes could have been rated by investigators or participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently on the characteristics of the trials, participants, interventions; outcomes and financial conflict of interests. We resolved disagreements by discussion or consulting a third review author. We obtained additional, unpublished information from the authors of one included trial that had reported efficacy data in a graph. We calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized MDs (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data reported on the same or different scales, respectively. We summarized dichotomous variables as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 10 trials published between 2001 and 2016 involving 497 adults with ADHD. Three trials were conducted in Europe and one in Argentina; the remaining trials did not report their location. The RCTs compared IR methylphenidate with placebo, an osmotic-release oral system (OROS) of methylphenidate (an extended-release formulation), an extended-release formulation of bupropion, lithium, and Pycnogenol® (maritime pine bark extract). Participants comprised outpatients, inpatients in addiction treatment, and adults willing to attend an intensive outpatient program for cocaine dependence. The duration of the follow-up ranged from 6 to 18 weeks. IR methylphenidate versus placebo We found very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce symptoms of ADHD when measured with investigator-rated scales (MD -20.70, 95% CI -23.97 to -17.43; 1 trial, 146 participants; end scores; Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS), scored from 0 to 54), but the evidence is uncertain. The effect of IR methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms when measured with participant-rated scales was moderate, but the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.06; I² = 69%; 2 trials, 138 participants; end scores). There is very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce the clinical impression of the severity of ADHD symptoms (MD -0.57, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.28; 2 trials, 139 participants; I² = 0%; change and end scores; Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may slightly impact the clinical impression of an improvement in symptoms of ADHD (MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.51; 1 trial, 49 participants; end scores; CGI-Improvement scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is no clear evidence of an effect on anxiety (MD -0.20, 95% CI -4.84 to 4.44; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A; scored from 0 to 56); very low-certainty evidence) or depression (MD 2.80, 95% CI -0.09 to 5.69; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D; scored from 0 to 52); very low-certainty evidence) in analyses comparing IR methylphenidate with placebo. IR methylphenidate versus lithium Compared with lithium, it is uncertain whether IR methylphenidate increases or decreases symptoms of ADHD (MD 0.60, 95% CI -3.11 to 4.31; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (scored from 0 to 198); very low-certainty evidence); anxiety (MD -0.80, 95% CI -4.49 to 2.89; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-A; very low-certainty evidence); or depression (MD -1.20, 95% CI -3.81 to 1.41, 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-D scale; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed participant-rated changes in symptoms of ADHD, or clinical impression of severity or improvement in participants treated with IR methylphenidate compared with lithium. Adverse events were poorly assessed and reported. We rated all trials at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting of harms and masking of outcome assessors (failure to blind outcome assessor to measure adverse events). Overall, four trials with 203 participants who received IR methylphenidate and 141 participants who received placebo described the occurrence of harms. The use of IR methylphenidate in these trials increased the risk of gastrointestinal complications (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.95) and loss of appetite (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.96). Cardiovascular adverse events were reported inconsistently, preventing a comprehensive analysis. One trial comparing IR methylphenidate to lithium reported five and nine adverse events, respectively. We considered four trials to have notable concerns of vested interests influencing the evidence, and authors from two trials omitted information related to the sources of funding and conflicts of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no certain evidence that IR methylphenidate compared with placebo or lithium can reduce symptoms of ADHD in adults (low- and very low-certainty evidence). Adults treated with IR methylphenidate are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and metabolic-related harms compared with placebo. Clinicians should consider whether it is appropriate to prescribe IR methylphenidate, given its limited efficacy and increased risk of harms. Future RCTs should explore the long-term efficacy and risks of IR methylphenidate, and the influence of conflicts of interest on reported effects.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113SMVrN]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline scope and updates — the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline addresses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in children from age 4 years to their 18th birthday. For this document, preschool-aged refers to children from age 4 years to the sixth birthday. Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians may continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for this guideline. Since 2011 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was released; the new research and DSM-5 do not support dramatic changes, so this guideline includes only incremental updates and adds a key action statement about the diagnosis and treatment of coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, Web of Science Core Collection, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (UK and Ireland), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (abstracts and international), and the WHO International Trials Registry Platform, including, from the date of database inception to April 7, 2017, with no language restrictions. We used the search terms "adhd" OR "hkd" OR "addh" OR "hyperkine" OR "attention deficit" OR "hyper-activ" OR "hyperactiv" OR "overactive" OR "inattentive" OR "impulsiv" combined with a list of ADHD medications (appendix pp 3–15). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and relevant drug manufacturers' websites, and references of previous systematic reviews and guidelines, were hand-searched for additional information. We also contacted study authors and drug manufacturers to gather unpublished information and data (appendix p 15).

We included double-blind randomised controlled trials (parallel group, crossover, or cluster), of at least 1 week's duration, that enrolled children (aged ≥ 5 years and < 12 years), adolescents (aged ≥ 12 years and < 18 years), or adults (≥ 18 years) with a primary diagnosis of ADHD according to DSM-III, DSM III-R, DSM-IV(TR), DSM-5, ICD-9, or ICD-10. We did not restrict our search by ADHD subtype or presentation, gender, intelligence quotient (IQ), socioeconomic status, or comorbidities (except for those needing concomitant pharmacotherapy). We included studies if they assessed any of the following medications, as oral monotherapy, compared with each other or with placebo: amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methyl-phenidate (including dexmethylphenidate), and modafinil. We excluded studies with enrichment designs (eg, trials selecting drug responders only after a run-in phase), because these types of trial can potentially inflate efficacy and tolerability estimates. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are in the appendix (pp 16, 17).

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113hRVVT]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — recommendation grading and clinician use — followed the AAP policy on "Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice Guidelines", is consistent with the University of Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, and used subcommittee consensus to develop key action statements (KASs); when evidence was at least "good" with a preponderance of benefits over harms, the KAS provides a "strong recommendation" or "recommendation", and the guideline states clinicians "should follow a 'strong recommendation' unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present; clinicians are prudent to follow a 'recommendation' but are advised to remain alert to new information and be sensitive to patient preferences"; when evidence was lower-quality or benefits and harms were balanced, the KAS provides an "option", defined as interventions a reasonable provider might or might not implement; the AAP rating figure includes "Strong recommendation", "Moderate recommendation", "Weak recommendation (based on balance of benefit and harm)", and "No recommendation may be made".

Conclusion

Development of robust evidence of the putative effectiveness of the non-mainstream treatments being used should be a priority given that they are being used by carers; paediatric doctors are increasingly turning to more natural treatments; long-term negative outcomes of those with ADHD are not being affected; and currently recommended treatments are palliative and associated with common side effects. Surveying carers is a useful means of identifying which treatments are being used and should subsequently be tested.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adults [^114HTHAu]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder involving functionally disruptive inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive behaviors, such as being easily distracted, regularly failing to follow through on tasks, being restless, or often interrupting others. ADHD diagnosed in childhood often persists into adulthood, with 14.6% of U.S. adults meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., criteria for ADHD. When evaluating for adult ADHD, other mental disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis due to the substantial overlap of symptoms and ADHD concurrence with anxiety/stress, mood, personality, impulse control, and substance use disorders. An ADHD diagnosis requires a comprehensive clinical history and evaluation, patient symptom and function assessment (e.g. Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales), and gathering of collateral information. Clinical guidelines recommend a subset of amphetamine and methylphenidate stimulants as first-line pharmacotherapy, which may be more effective when combined with psychotherapy. For adults unable to take stimulants or with concurrent anxiety/depression, options include atomoxetine, viloxazine, and bupropion. To monitor for patient misuse or diversion of stimulants, physicians should consider employing controlled substance agreements and prescription drug monitoring programs.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111TmNMZ]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods

We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers' and clinicians' ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976.

Findings

133 double-blind randomised controlled trials (81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one in both) were included. The analysis of efficacy closest to 12 weeks was based on 10068 children and adolescents and 8131 adults; the analysis of tolerability was based on 11018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults. The confidence of estimates varied from high or moderate (for some comparisons) to low or very low (for most indirect comparisons). For ADHD core symptoms rated by clinicians in children and adolescents closest to 12 weeks, all included drugs were superior to placebo (eg, SMD -1.02, 95% CI -1.19 to -0.85 for amphetamines, -0.78, -0.93 to -0.62 for methylphenidate, -0.56, -0.66 to -0.45 for atomoxetine). By contrast, for available comparisons based on teachers' ratings, only methylphenidate (SMD -0.82, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.48) and modafinil (-0.76, -1.15 to -0.37) were more efficacious than placebo. In adults (clinicians' ratings), amphetamines (SMD -0.79, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.58), methylphenidate (-0.49, -0.64 to -0.35), bupropion (-0.46, -0.85 to -0.07), and atomoxetine (-0.45, -0.58 to -0.32), but not modafinil (0.16, -0.28 to 0.59), were better than placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were inferior to placebo in both children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.36–3.89) and adults (3.26, 1.54–6.92); guanfacine was inferior to placebo in children and adolescents only (2.64, 1.20–5.81); and atomoxetine (2.33, 1.28–4.25), methylphenidate (2.39, 1.40–4.08), and modafinil (4.01, 1.42–11.33) were less well tolerated than placebo in adults only. In head-to-head comparisons, only differences in efficacy (clinicians' ratings) were found, favouring amphetamines over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in both children and adolescents (SMDs -0.46 to -0.24) and adults (-0.94 to -0.29). We did not find sufficient data for the 26-week and 52-week timepoints.

Interpretation

Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this meta-analysis supports methylphenidate in children and adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-choice medications for the short-term treatment of ADHD. New research should be funded urgently to assess long-term effects of these drugs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114GzDjp]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) outlines that ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood affecting academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions, and situates this update within prior AAP guidance, which first provided evaluation and diagnosis recommendations in 2000 with treatment recommendations in 2001, and a 2011 revision that included a process of care algorithm (PoCA). Since the release of the 2011 guideline and the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to the fifth edition, the current revision makes only incremental updates, adds a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD, and updates the PoCA to assist in implementing the recommendations. The guideline also notes identification of numerous systemic barriers to adoption and a companion article in the Supplemental Information addressing systemic barriers and presenting recommendations to address those barriers, with this article supporting the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and PoCA.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, handsearched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' 'generalisability'; exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity; responder selection based on previous experience with CNS stimulants; and risk of withdrawal effects. Our prespecified primary outcomes were functional outcomes, self-rated ADHD symptoms, and serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, ADHD symptoms rated by investigators and by peers such as family members, cardiovascular variables, severe psychiatric adverse events, and other adverse events.

Main Results

We included 24 trials (5066 participants), of which 21 reported outcome data for this review. We also identified one ongoing study. We included documents from six drug regulatory agencies covering eight trials. Twenty-one trials had an outpatient setting and three were conducted in prisons. They were primarily conducted in North America and Europe. The median participant age was 36 years. Twelve trials (76% of participants) were industry-sponsored, four (14% of participants) were publicly funded with industry involvement, seven (10% of participants) were publicly funded, and one had unclear funding. The median trial duration was eight weeks. One trial was rated at overall unclear risk of bias and 20 trials were rated at overall high risk of bias, primarily due to unclear blinding of participants and investigators, attrition bias, and selective outcome reporting. All trials were impaired in at least one of the three design characteristics related to 'generalisability'; for example, they excluded participants with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety, or included participants only with a previous positive response to methylphenidate, or similar drugs. This may limit the trials' usefulness for clinical practice, as they may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms. Extended-release methylphenidate versus placebo (up to 26 weeks) For the primary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' at 13-week follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.15 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.11 to 1.81; 1 trial, 409 participants) or serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, CI 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 14 trials, 4078 participants), whereas methylphenidate improved self-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.30; 16 trials, 3799 participants). For secondary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate improved self-rated quality of life (small effect; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 6 trials, 1888 participants), investigator-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.36; 18 trials, 4183 participants), ADHD symptoms rated by peers such as family members (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14; 3 trials, 1005 participants), and increased the risk of experiencing any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.37; 14 trials, 4214 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, primarily due to high risk of bias and 'indirectness of the evidence'. One trial (419 participants) had follow-up at 52 weeks and two trials (314 participants) included active comparators, hence long-term and comparative evidence is limited.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-certainty evidence that extended-release methylphenidate compared to placebo improved ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effects) measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers such as family members. Methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' or serious adverse events, the effect on quality of life was small, and it increased the risk of several adverse effects. We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, due to high risk of bias, short trial durations, and limitations to the generalisability of the results. The benefits and harms of extended-release methylphenidate therefore remain uncertain.

### Treatments for ADHD in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^114G8Uzz]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Effective treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is essential to improving youth outcomes.

Objectives

This systematic review provides an overview of the available treatment options.

Data Sources

We identified controlled treatment evaluations in 12 databases published from 1980 to June 2023; treatments were not restricted by intervention content.

Study Selection

Studies in children and adolescents with clinically diagnosed ADHD, reporting patient health and psychosocial outcomes, were eligible. Publications were screened by trained reviewers, supported by machine learning.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted and critically appraised by 1 reviewer and checked by a methodologist. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Strength of evidence and applicability assessments followed Evidence-based Practice Center standards.

Results

In total, 312 studies reported in 540 publications were included. We grouped evidence for medication, psychosocial interventions, parent support, nutrition and supplements, neurofeedback, neurostimulation, physical exercise, complementary medicine, school interventions, and provider approaches. Several treatments improved ADHD symptoms. Medications had the strongest evidence base for improving outcomes, including disruptive behaviors and broadband measures, but were associated with adverse events.

Limitations

We found limited evidence of studies comparing alternative treatments directly and indirect analyses identified few systematic differences across stimulants and nonstimulants. Identified combination of medication with youth-directed psychosocial interventions did not systematically produce better results than monotherapy, though few combinations have been evaluated.

Conclusions

A growing number of treatments are available that improve ADHD symptoms and other outcomes, in particular for school-aged youth. Medication therapies remain important treatment options but are associated with adverse events.

### ADHD treatment across the life cycle [^114sersk]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Since attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is usually diagnosed in children, evidence from the studies of pharmacologic treatments for children with ADHD is used to inform pharmacologic treatment recommendations for adults. A large percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD have symptoms that persist into adolescence and adulthood. Evidence shows that pharmacologic treatments improve functional outcomes in children with ADHD, and studies using similar pharmacologic treatments show positive results in adults with ADHD. This article reviews the use of long-acting methylphenidate, mixed amphetamine salts, desipramine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, bupropion, and atomoxetine in studies of children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD.

### Systematic review of national and international guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^115YcDv3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2012). Low credibility.

During the last few years several clinical guidelines on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been published by national and international medical societies. To systematically review and compare recommendations of selected ADHD guidelines, we performed a systematic search in online guideline databases and PubMed in order to retrieve guideline texts. Guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed and recommendations on assessment and treatment extracted. The AGREE instrument was used to assess methodological quality. Of the 26 guidelines identified, 13 were selected for further analysis: 11 guidelines deal with ADHD in childhood and adolescence and 5 guidelines cover transitional patients and/or ADHD in adults. The methodological quality of ADHD guidelines is moderate to good. They reflect similarities and differences of healthcare systems. Diagnosis throughout the lifespan is based on a detailed clinical history. There is greater agreement on evidence-based pharmacological treatment than on psychosocial interventions, reflecting the strength of evidence.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors including two review authors from the original publication participated in the update in 2022. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Data from parallel-group trials and first-period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses. We undertook separate analyses using end-of-last period data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA) to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 212 trials (16,302 participants randomised); 55 parallel-group trials (8104 participants randomised), and 156 cross-over trials (8033 participants randomised) as well as one trial with a parallel phase (114 participants randomised) and a cross-over phase (165 participants randomised). The mean age of participants was 9.8 years ranging from 3 to 18 years (two trials from 3 to 21 years). The male-female ratio was 3:1. Most trials were carried out in high-income countries, and 86/212 included trials (41%) were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Methylphenidate treatment duration ranged from 1 to 425 days, with a mean duration of 28.8 days. Trials compared methylphenidate with placebo (200 trials) and with no intervention (12 trials). Only 165/212 trials included usable data on one or more outcomes from 14,271 participants. Of the 212 trials, we assessed 191 at high risk of bias and 21 at low risk of bias. If, however, deblinding of methylphenidate due to typical adverse events is considered, then all 212 trials were at high risk of bias.

Primary Outcomes

methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.88 to -0.61; I² = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -10.58 (95% CI -12.58 to -8.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I² = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68).

Secondary Outcomes

methylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non-serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I² = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33; I² = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83; I² = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no-intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non-serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116jUPyw]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) chronic care management — KAS 4 states that ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and adolescents with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with special health care needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (Table 5), and this is a Grade B: strong recommendation. The rationale provided is that for many individuals, ADHD causes symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time, even into adulthood, and that available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative.

Pharmacological treatment for ADHD and ASD in children and adults

A summary of the consensus reached regarding pharmacological interventions for ADHD and ASD when these conditions present as a comorbid diagnosis (in both children and adults) is presented in Table 10.

The pharmacological treatment for co-occurring ASD and ADHD in children and adults is no different from the treatment of each disorder separately. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines should be followed for the pharmacological treatment of ADHD as a separate condition; medication is commonly offered to treat ADHD symptoms (usually stimulant and non-stimulant medications) in both people with ADHD and those with co-occurring ADHD and ASD. ADHD medications should not be offered to treat people with ASD (without co-occurring ADHD) as there is no evidence for a positive effect in this population.

Table 10
Practice recommendations for children and adults with comorbid ADHD and ASD: pharmacological interventions

Indeed, there is no orthodox pharmacological treatment for ASD in either children or adults that has an evidence base for treatment effect. Antipsychotic medication for core ASD symptoms has been used widely in certain countries; however, the evidence base supporting its use in this population is negligible and the risk of adverse effects is high. The second-generation antipsychotics, particularly risperidone and aripiprazole, have been used for the short-term treatment of angry outbursts in children and adolescents with ASD, some of whom will have ADHD. Low doses, regular reviews and short-term use are advised. However, there are variable degrees of official approval for their use between countries and behavioural and environmental interventions are first-line treatments. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications are not clearly helpful for treating repetitive behaviours in children and adults with comorbid ASD and ADHD.

### Treatment outcomes with licensed and unlicensed stimulant doses for adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138w7NB]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) are often prescribed at unlicensed doses for adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Whether dose escalation beyond US Food and Drug Administration recommendations is associated with positive risk benefits is unclear.

Objective

To investigate the impact, based on averages, of stimulant doses on treatment outcomes in adults with ADHD and to determine, based on averages, whether unlicensed doses are associated with positive risk benefits compared with licensed doses.

Data Sources

Twelve databases, including published (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Sciences) and unpublished (ClinicalTrials.gov) literature, up to February 22, 2023, without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Two researchers independently screened records to identify double-blinded randomized clinical trials of stimulants against placebo in adults (18 years and older) with ADHD.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Aggregate data were extracted and synthesized in random-effects dose-response meta-analyses and network meta-analyses.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in ADHD symptoms and discontinuations due to adverse events.

Results

A total of 47 randomized clinical trials (7714 participants; mean age, 35 (SD, 11) years; 4204 male [56%]) were included. For methylphenidate, dose-response curves indicated additional reductions of symptoms with increments in doses, but the gains were progressively smaller and accompanied by continued additional risk of adverse events dropouts. Network meta-analyses showed that unlicensed doses were associated with greater reductions of symptoms compared with licensed doses (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.23; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.02; very low certainty of evidence), but the additional gain was small and accompanied by increased risk of adverse event dropouts (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.19–3.43; moderate certainty of evidence). For amphetamines, the dose-response curve approached a plateau and increments in doses did not indicate additional reductions of symptoms, but there were continued increments in the risk of adverse event dropouts. Network meta-analysis did not identify differences between unlicensed and licensed doses for reductions of symptoms (SMD, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.08; very low certainty of evidence).

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on group averages, unlicensed doses of stimulants may not have positive risk benefits compared with licensed doses for adults with ADHD. In general, practitioners should consider unlicensed doses cautiously. Practitioners may trial unlicensed doses if needed and tolerated but should be aware that there may not be large gains in the response to the medication with those further increments in dose. However, the findings are averages and will not generalize to every patient.

### Efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: an integrated analysis of the complete database of multicenter placebo-controlled trials [^111Ws6tP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Access to clinical resources for ADHD in adults remains limited in many countries, in part because of the traditional perspective that ADHD is a problem restricted to childhood and due to the lack of approved treatments in many countries. However, awareness of ADHD in adults is growing rapidly and there is now an urgent need to broaden understanding of the condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of available therapeutic interventions.

Based on current evidence, national and international guidelines recommend drug treatments as the first-line of clinical management for ADHD in adults, particularly where the disorder is associated with moderate-to-severe levels of impairment. In the USA a wide range of pharmacological treatments are approved for use in adults, including atomoxetine (ATX), methylphenidate (MPH), dexmethylphenidate, and various amphetamines. ATX was approved in the EU in May 2013 for initiation in adults to treat ADHD. No other medications are approved in Europe to be initiated for treatment of ADHD in adults, except in Germany only, where a long-acting form of MPH is approved since 2011.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114Wtt3J]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

AHRQ research questions for ADHD diagnosis and treatment — The subcommittee developed research questions for an evidence-based review sponsored by 1 of the Evidence-based Practice Centers of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); these questions assessed 4 diagnostic areas and 3 treatment areas on the basis of research published in 2011 through 2016, guided by key clinical questions for children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age. Diagnostic questions addressed the comparative diagnostic accuracy of approaches usable in primary care or by specialists among children younger than 7 years of age; the comparative diagnostic accuracy of EEG, imaging, or executive function approaches among individuals aged 7 to their 18th birthday; the adverse effects associated with being labeled correctly or incorrectly as having ADHD; and whether more formal neuropsychological, imaging, or genetic tests improve the diagnostic process. Treatment questions addressed the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments of ADHD; the risk of diversion of pharmacologic treatment; and the comparative safety and effectiveness of different monitoring strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or changes in ADHD status.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for adult ADHD [^113KSPhL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders of adulthood. Although clinical guidelines recommend monotherapy with stimulants or atomoxetine, combination pharmacotherapy is a common practice among clinicians. There are four main situations in which combination medications may be necessary: partial response, dose-limiting side effects, associated disorders, and comorbid diagnoses. We present data from two chart reviews that support existing research on combination pharmacotherapy. Adjunct treatment of d-methylphenidate to stimulant medications extended the duration of therapeutic effect. Adjunct treatment of mirtazapine to stimulant medications reduced associated insomnia. These data support previous research that validates the use of combination pharmacotherapy for adults with ADHD.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: effects of pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder on quality of life [^115VwrFn]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effect of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication on quality of life (QoL), and to understand whether this effect differs between stimulants and nonstimulants.

Method

From the dataset of a published network meta-analysis (Cortese et al., 2018 1), updated on 27 th February 2023 (https://med-adhd.org/), we identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ADHD medications for individuals aged 6 years or more with a diagnosis of ADHD based on the DSM (from third to fifth editions) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD; ninth or tenth revision), reporting data on QoL (measured with a validated scale). The risk of bias for each RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2. Multilevel meta-analytic models were conducted with R 4.3.1.

Results

We included 17 RCTs (5,388 participants in total; 56% randomized to active medication) in the meta-analyses. We found that amphetamines (Hedge's g = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.08, 0.94), methylphenidate (0.38; 0.23, 0.54), and atomoxetine (0.30; 0.19, 0.40) were significantly more efficacious than placebo in improving QoL in people with ADHD, with moderate effect size. For atomoxetine, these effects were not moderated by the length of intervention, and did not differ between children/adolescents and adults.

Conclusion

In addition to being efficacious in reducing ADHD core symptom severity, both stimulant and nonstimulant medications are efficacious in improving QoL in people with ADHD, albeit with lower effect sizes. Future research should explore whether, and to what degree, combining pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions is likely to further improve QoL in people with ADHD.

Plain Language Summary

From a prior dataset of a network meta-analysis, 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in a meta-analysis to investigate if attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication improves quality of life (QoL) in people with ADHD. The analysis showed that medications such as amphetamines, methylphenidate, and atomoxetine improved QoL compared to placebo, with moderate effect sizes. This study underscores the importance of ADHD medications, both stimulants and nonstimulants, not only in alleviating core ADHD symptoms but also in enhancing overall QoL for individuals with ADHD.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116jhZQG]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

We planned to do analyses for outcomes closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks, but few data were available for 26 weeks and 52 weeks and analyses at these timepoints were, therefore, not possible. This scarcity of data reflects ethical issues associated with doing long-term, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trials of effective treatments. Thus, our findings can inform only the choice of short-term medication treatment for ADHD. Moreover, because of a paucity of data, we were unable to properly undertake all the planned sensitivity analyses. Finally, we did not include studies of antipsychotic or tricyclic antidepressant compounds because, although commonly prescribed for patients with ADHD, they are not used routinely to treat ADHD core symptoms, and their inclusion would, therefore, violate the assumption of transitivity in the networks.

Notwithstanding these caveats, our findings represent the best currently available evidence base (not constrained by local costs and licencing) to inform future guidelines internationally and shared decision-making between patients, carers, and clinicians, when a balance has to be made between efficacy and tolerability of ADHD medications.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111856Kf]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by age-inappropriate and impairing levels of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, or a combination. It is estimated to affect around 5% of school-age children (aged ≤ 18 years)and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Annual incremental costs for ADHD have been estimated at US$143–266 billion in the USAand are substantial in other countries. Available pharmacological treatments for ADHD include psychostimulants (eg, methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-psychostimulant medications (eg, atomoxetine and α2-agonists). In the past few decades, prescriptions for ADHD drugs have increased significantly both in the USAand other countries. However, even though recommended in clinical guidelines, the efficacy and safety of ADHD medications remains controversial. Furthermore, current guidelines are inconsistent in their treatment recommendations. Although some guidelines rank methylphenidate over amphetamines (eg, in children), others recommend psychostimulants as first-line treatment without any distinction between methylphenidate and amphetamines being made. Additionally, the non-psychostimulant atomoxetine is variously recommended by available guidelines as third-line, second-line, and potentially first-line treatment. The methods used for sequencing these recommendations are not always specified and most commonly — including the 2018 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines — incorporate national drug licencing regulatory approval and cost-effectiveness with expert opinion in conjunction with the few head-to-head comparisons that are available.

### Evidence-based guidelines for management of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in adolescents in transition to adult services and in adults: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^111WAv4F]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an established diagnosis in children, associated with a large body of evidence on the benefits of treatment. Adolescents with ADHD are now leaving children's services often with no readily identifiable adult service to support them, which presents problems as local pharmacy regulations often preclude the prescription of stimulant drugs by general practitioners (GPs). In addition, adults with ADHD symptoms are now starting to present to primary care and psychiatry services requesting assessment and treatment. For these reasons, the British Association for Psychopharmacology (BAP) thought it timely to hold a consensus conference to review the body of evidence on childhood ADHD and the growing literature on ADHD in older age groups. Much of this initial guidance on managing ADHD in adolescents in transition and in adults is based on expert opinion derived from childhood evidence. We hope that, by the time these guidelines are updated, much evidence will be available to address the many directions for future research that are detailed here.

### Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^113Qj6RN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset disorder characterised by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD can persist into adulthood and can affects individuals' social and occupational functioning, as well as their quality of life and health. ADHD is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as substance use disorders and anxiety and affective disorders. Amphetamines are used to treat adults with ADHD, but uncertainties about their efficacy and safety remain.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for adults with ADHD.

Search Methods

In August 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, 10 other databases, and two trials registers, and we ran citation searches for included studies. We also contacted the corresponding authors of all included studies, other experts in the field, and the pharmaceutical company, Shire, and we searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews for other published, unpublished, or ongoing studies. For each included study, we performed a citation search in Web of Science to identify any later studies that may have cited it.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of amphetamines (at any dose) for ADHD in adults aged 18 years and over against placebo or an active intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data from each included study. We used the standardised mean difference (SMD) and the risk ratio (RR) to assess continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We conducted a stratified analysis to determine the influence of moderating variables. We assessed trials for risk of bias and drew a funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach, which yielded high, moderate, low, or very low quality ratings based on evaluation of within-trial risk of bias, directness of evidence, heterogeneity of data; precision of effect estimates, and risk of publication bias.

Main Results

We included 19 studies that investigated three types of amphetamines: dexamphetamine (10.2 mg/d to 21.8 mg/d), lisdexamfetamine (30 mg/d to 70 mg/d), and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS; 12.5 mg/d to 80 mg/d). These studies enrolled 2521 participants; most were middle-aged (35.3 years), Caucasian males (57.2%), with a combined type of ADHD (78.8%). Eighteen studies were conducted in the USA, and one study was conducted in both Canada and the USA. Ten were multi-site studies. All studies were placebo-controlled, and three also included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil, or paroxetine. Most studies had short-term follow-up and a mean study length of 5.3 weeks. We found no studies that had low risk of bias in all domains of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, mainly because amphetamines have powerful subjective effects that may reveal the assigned treatment, but also because we noted attrition bias, and because we could not rule out the possibility of a carry-over effect in studies that used a cross-over design. Sixteen studies were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, one study was publicly funded, and two studies did not report their funding sources. Amphetamines versus placeboSeverity of ADHD symptoms: we found low- to very low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians (SMD -0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.04 to -0.75; 13 studies, 2028 participants) and patients (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.28; six studies, 120 participants). Retention: overall, we found low-quality evidence suggesting that amphetamines did not improve retention in treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; 17 studies, 2323 participants). Adverse events: we found that amphetamines were associated with an increased proportion of patients who withdrew because of adverse events (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.63 to 4.45; 17 studies, 2409 participants). Type of amphetamine: we found differences between amphetamines for the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by clinicians. Both lisdexamfetamine (SMD -1.06, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.85; seven studies, 896 participants; low-quality evidence) and MAS (SMD -0.80, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.66; five studies, 1083 participants; low-quality evidence) reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms. In contrast, we found no evidence to suggest that dexamphetamine reduced the severity of ADHD symptoms (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.32; one study, 49 participants; very low-quality evidence). In addition, all amphetamines were efficacious in reducing the severity of ADHD symptoms as rated by patients (dexamphetamine: SMD -0.77, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.40; two studies, 35 participants; low-quality evidence; lisdexamfetamine: SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.01; three studies, 67 participants; low-quality evidence; MAS: SMD -0.45, 95% CI -1.02 to 0.12; one study, 18 participants; very low-quality evidence). Dose at study completion: different doses of amphetamines did not appear to be associated with differences in efficacy. Type of drug-release formulation: we investigated immediate- and sustained-release formulations but found no differences between them for any outcome. Amphetamines versus other drugsWe found no evidence that amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity compared to other drug interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Amphetamines improved the severity of ADHD symptoms, as assessed by clinicians or patients, in the short term but did not improve retention to treatment. Amphetamines were associated with higher attrition due to adverse events. The short duration of studies coupled with their restrictive inclusion criteria limits the external validity of these findings. Furthermore, none of the included studies had an overall low risk of bias. Overall, the evidence generated by this review is of low or very low quality.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113RrqKf]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research

Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Because of the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, "nocebo tablet" controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. Such trials ought first to be conducted in adults with ADHD. We also acknowledge that investigators can directly carry out nocebo controlled trials in children and adolescents if they can argue that young people with ADHD are different from adults with the disorder.

Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to sex, age, type of ADHD, presence of co-morbidities and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large randomised trials of non-pharmacological treatments.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate use in children and adolescents may improve the symptoms of ADHD, general behaviour, and quality of life. It does not seem to cause an increased risk of serious adverse events in the short term but was associated with a relatively high risks of non-serious adverse events. These findings should be interpreted in the light of several limitations, including the lack of blinding, outcome reporting bias, heterogeneity, and the consequent very low quality of evidence for all outcomes. More long term randomised nocebo tablet (active placebo) controlled clinical trials without risks of bias are necessary to allow firm decisions on methylphenidate treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. We believe that nocebo controlled trials should be conducted first in adults with ADHD.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias.

Main Results

The studies. We included 38 parallel-group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries. The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). Risk of Bias. All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.90 to -0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low-quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -9.6 points (95% CI -13.75 to -6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2).

Secondary Outcomes

Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non-serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non-serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non-serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. Teacher-rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low-quality evidence). A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent-reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events. Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Given the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed consent. Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments.

### Debate: are stimulant medications for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder effective in the long term? (for) [^117MmqwR]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Long-term effectiveness studies for ADHD medications are complicated to design well, and no single study design will capture the entire picture. Although randomized controlled trials are the highest level of evidence, most authorities agree that, when you have treatments as efficacious as the ADHD medications (methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives and prodrugs, atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine), it is neither practical nor ethical to conduct long-term placebo-controlled RCTs. As a consequence, almost all of the RCT evidence for ADHD medications relates to short-term studies. Although these provide strong evidence for short-term efficacy, 1 they do not speak to long-term effectiveness. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recognized the need for additional evidence of long-term effects before granting licenses for medications that will usually be required to be taken for several years. They therefore introduced a requirement for companies to demonstrate longer-term efficacy. This has generally been done through the use of randomized withdrawal designs that are designed to demonstrate continued efficacy over a period of 6 to 12 months. Several of these have been completed and published, all of which, as expected, demonstrate continued efficacy. 2 The EMA also insisted that all new ADHD medications demonstrate continued effectiveness, and that adverse effects and safety be assessed up to 2 years. Again the studies completed so far support continued effectiveness, and, although highlighting the presence of common, expected adverse effects, have not identified any new safety signals or unexpected problems in targeted areas such as growth and cognition. 3.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113Ei3Ai]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study question Is methylphenidate beneficial or harmful for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents?

Methods Electronic databases were searched up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) were conducted. Quality was assessed using GRADE. Teachers, parents, and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour.

Study answer and limitations The analyses included 38 parallel group trials (n = 5111, median treatment duration 49 days) and 147 crossover trials (n = 7134, 14 days). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in 19 parallel group trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.77, n = 1698), corresponding to a mean difference of −9.6 points on the ADHD rating scale. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, nine trials, n = 1532; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91). Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (1.29, 21 trials, n = 3132; TSA adjusted RR 1.29). Teacher rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD −0.87, five trials, n = 668) A change of 7 points on the child health questionnaire (CHQ) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ (range 0–100 points), which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, three trials, n = 514). 96.8% of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines. All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE.

What this study adds The results suggest that among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, methylphenidate may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life. However, given the risk of bias in the included studies, and the very low quality of outcomes, the magnitude of the effects is uncertain. Methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious but not serious adverse events.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^111CM8AN]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is hoped that this consensus will support healthcare and allied professionals across a range of disciplines to effectively identify and treat individuals with ADHD and ASD. Accurate and timely diagnoses and appropriate interventions will undoubtedly increase positive outcomes across the lifespan. There is a dearth of research on ADHD and ASD as co-occurring conditions, including gender differences and long-term outcomes (both with and without treatment). In particular, further research is needed to establish an evidence base for the most effective treatments for children and adults, both males and females, who have both conditions.

### The use of antidepressants to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults [^115yKXkZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that children continue to experience attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms into adult life. The two main treatments for ADHD are antidepressants and stimulants. Here, the effectiveness data relating to the use of antidepressants in adults with ADHD are reviewed. Four controlled and six open studies were identified. Although, there is only limited data currently available, antidepressants may offer an effective therapy for adult ADHD. Controlled trials have studied desipramine, atomoxetine and bupropion, with most evidence supporting the efficacy of desipramine. The initial data indicate that atomoxetine is less effective than desipramine. The efficacy of bupropion is unclear. Initial published open data suggest a response rate of 50–78% with venlafaxine. Controlled studies are required to confirm this efficacy. Most of the present data are short-term, therefore long-term effectiveness data are required.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115fgAZ5]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 1 of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and can profoundly affect children's academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by which clinicians could fulfill the clinical guideline's recommendations. Since the release of the 2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has been revised to the fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates have been made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations. Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, numerous systemic barriers were identified that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians' ability to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created a companion article (available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD, which identifies the major systemic-level barriers and presents recommendations to address those barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.

### Long-term treatment of children and adolescents with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^112orBzs]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Only 7% to 50% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder actually are treated. Of those who begin treatment, only 18% to 50% persist in the treatment for any length of time (eg, 2 to 3 years). Thus, available data on effects of long-term medication and psychosocial treatment are sparse and problematic. This article reviews available data on long-term effects of medication (stimulant and nonstimulant) and psychosocial treatment.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and can profoundly affect the academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions of children; the American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD in children in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^116ecRc4]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline conclusions state that evidence is clear with regard to the legitimacy of the diagnosis of ADHD and the appropriate diagnostic criteria and procedures required to establish a diagnosis, identify comorbid conditions, and effectively treat with both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions. The steps required to sustain appropriate treatments and achieve successful long-term outcomes remain challenging, however. As noted, this clinical practice guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents available in the Supplemental Information: the process of care algorithm (PoCA) and the article on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD. Full implementation of the guideline's key action statements (KASs), the PoCA, and the recommendations to address barriers to care may require changes in office procedures and the identification of community resources. The page lists development of standardized and documented tools to help primary care providers identify comorbid conditions; development of effective electronic and Web-based systems to help gather information to diagnose and monitor children and adolescents with ADHD; improvements to systems for communicating with schools, mental health professionals, and other community agencies to provide effective collaborative care; development of more objective measures of performance to more objectively monitor aspects of severity, disability, or impairment; assessment of long-term outcomes for children in whom ADHD was first diagnosed at preschool ages; and identification and implementation of ideas to address the barriers that hamper the implementation of these guidelines and the PoCA.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder among adolescents: a review of the diagnosis, treatment, and clinical implications [^116MwoyJ]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common mental disorder in childhood, and primary care clinicians provide a major component of the care for children with ADHD. However, because of limited available evidence, the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines did not include adolescents and young adults. Contrary to previous beliefs, it has become clear that, in most cases, ADHD does not resolve once children enter puberty. This article reviews the current evidence about the diagnosis and treatment of adolescents and young adults with ADHD and describes how the information informs practice. It describes some of the unique characteristics observed among adolescents, as well as how the core symptoms change with maturity. The diagnostic process is discussed, as well as approaches to the care of adolescents to improve adherences. Both psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions are reviewed, and there is a discussion of these patients' transition into young adulthood. The article also indicates that research is needed to identify the unique adolescent characteristics of ADHD and effective psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113ma1FP]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

Our study, based on advanced methodology for network meta-analyses, represents the most comprehensive synthesis to date on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for ADHD across age groups. Unlike previous network meta-analyses of ADHD treatments, we have included unpublished data, which were gathered systematically from study authors, the websites of regulatory agencies, and drug manufacturers, using a common set of inclusion criteria for trials in children, adolescents, and adults. We focused on a series of clinically relevant outcomes — namely, efficacy on ADHD core symptoms, global clinical functioning, tolerability, effects on weight and blood pressure, and acceptability. We also investigated important effect-modifiers (eg, dose and comorbidities). We retained only a few studies with outcomes beyond 12 weeks. All medications we included in our study (except modafinil in adults) were more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of ADHD. Medications for ADHD were less efficacious and less well tolerated in adults than in children and adolescents. However, included drugs were not equivalent, and their profile in terms of efficacy, tolerability, and acceptability varied across age groups.

Implications of all the available evidence

Evidence from our network meta-analysis supports methylphenidate (in children and adolescents) and amphetamines (in adults) as the preferred first pharmacological choice for short-term pharmacological treatment of ADHD. This network meta-analysis should inform future guidelines and daily clinical decision-making on the choice of medications for ADHD across age ranges, along with available evidence on cost-effectiveness and considering patients' preferences. The paucity of trials with randomised outcomes beyond 12 weeks highlights the need to fund studies to assess long-term effects of these drugs. Furthermore, future research should include individual patient data in network meta-analyses of ADHD medications, which will allow a more reliable estimation of predictors of individual response.

### Amphetamines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^117KWrvV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a childhood onset disorder that can persist into adulthood. Amphetamines are used to treat adult ADHD, but uncertainties persist about their efficacy and safety.

Objectives

To examine the efficacy and safety of amphetamines for adults with ADHD, as well as the influence of dose, drug type and release formulation type.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, UK Clinical Trials Gateway and references obtained from articles and experts in the field. We conducted the electronic searches on 25 February 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of amphetamine derivatives against placebo or an active intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors extracted data from each included study. We used the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the risk ratio (RR) to assess continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. We conducted a stratified analysis to determine the influence of moderating variables. We assessed the trials for risk of bias and drew a funnel plot to investigate the possibility of publication bias.

Main Results

We included seven studies, which enrolled 1091 participants. All studies were placebo-controlled and three included an active comparator: guanfacine, modafinil and paroxetine. Most studies had short-term follow-up, with a mean study length of 8.1 weeks. Amphetamines improved ADHD symptom severity (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI -0.87 to -0.57) but did not improve retention in treatment overall and were associated with increased dropout due to adverse events (RR 3.03; 95% CI 1.52 to 6.05). The three amphetamine derivatives investigated (dextroamphetamine, lisdexamphetamine and mixed amphetamine salts (MAS)) were all efficacious for reducing ADHD symptoms, but MAS also increased retention in treatment. Different doses did not appear associated with differences in efficacy. We investigated immediate and sustained drug release formulations but found no difference between them on any outcome. When amphetamines were compared to other drug interventions, no differences were found. We did not find any study to be at low risk of bias overall, mainly because amphetamines have powerful subjective effects that may reveal the assigned treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Amphetamines improved short-term ADHD symptom severity. MAS also increased retention in treatment. Amphetamines were associated with higher attrition due to adverse events. The short study length and the restrictive inclusion criteria limit the external validity of these findings. Furthermore, the possibility that the results of the included studies were biased was high, which could have led to an overestimation of amphetamine efficacy.

### A review of the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^113HGfmF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Data Sources and Data Extraction

A literature search was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE using the terms attention deficit hyperactive disorder, ADHD, pathophysiology, etiology, and neurobiology. Limits applied were the following: published in the past 10 years (January 2003 to August 2013), humans, review, meta-analysis, and English language. These yielded 63 articles in PubMed and 74 in EMBASE. After removing duplicate/irrelevant articles, 86 articles and their relevant reference citations were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

ADHD is a neurological disorder that affects children, but symptoms may persist into adulthood. Individuals suffering from this disorder exhibit hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, and problems in social interaction and academic performance. Medications used to treat ADHD such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine indicate a dopamine/norepinephrine deficit as the neurochemical basis of ADHD, but the etiology is more complex. Moreover, these agents have poor adverse effect profiles and a multitude of drug interactions. Because these drugs are also dispensed to adults who may have concomitant conditions or medications, a pharmacist needs to be aware of these adverse events and drug interactions. This review, therefore, focuses on the pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of ADHD and details the adverse effects and drug interaction profiles of the drugs used to treat it.

Conclusions

Published research shows the benefit of drug therapy for ADHD in children, but given the poor adverse effect and drug interaction profiles, these must be dispensed with caution.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [^114G2y2v]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of 1.4–3.0%. It is more common in boys than girls. Comorbidity with childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric disorders is substantial. ADHD is highly heritable and multifactorial; multiple genes and non-inherited factors contribute to the disorder. Prenatal and perinatal factors have been implicated as risks, but definite causes remain unknown. Most guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment, beginning with non-drug interventions and then moving to pharmacological treatment in those most severely affected. Randomised controlled trials show short-term benefits of stimulant medication and atomoxetine. Meta-analyses of blinded trials of non-drug treatments have not yet proven the efficacy of such interventions. Longitudinal studies of ADHD show heightened risk of multiple mental health and social difficulties as well as premature mortality in adult life.

### Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111Fh5KW]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic disorder requiring developmentally sensitive interventions across the lifespan. Although pharmacotherapy traditionally has been considered the first-line treatment for ADHD, many individuals continue to experience significant functional impairment or choose not to pursue pharmacotherapy. Thus, evidence-based alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacologic treatment for individuals with ADHD are needed. Behavioral parent training and behavioral school interventions are the only empirically supported nonpharmacologic interventions for children and adolescents with ADHD. This article reviews recent additions to the ADHD literature, including evaluations of behavioral interventions in traditional clinical practice and schools, treatment efficacy for preschool-aged children and adults, and the investigation of a novel treatment for individuals with the predominantly inattentive subtype of ADHD.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114Mn6DG]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) comorbid conditions — primary care clinician (PCC) initiation and referral (KAS 7) states that the PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate treatment of such conditions or refer to an appropriate subspecialist, and if not trained or experienced in making the diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be referred to an appropriate subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment; this is a Grade C recommendation. Benefits, risks, and preferences are summarized as follows: clinicians are most effective when they know the limits of their practice and local resources; under-identification or inappropriate identification of comorbidities can lead to inadequate or inappropriate treatments; the importance of adequately identifying and addressing comorbidities outweighs the risk of inappropriate referrals or treatments; the families' preferences and comfort need to be taken into consideration; exclusions are none and the strength is recommendation.

### Psychosocial treatments for adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^114Ak55t]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

This article discussed some ways in which a history of failure experiences can enhance negative affect and cognitive avoidance and further impair attentional and organizational abilities associated with ADHD. Accordingly, psychosocial interventions have two targets: providing training in organizational and attentional skills while addressing patterns that motivate demand-related distress and avoidance of these skills. The authors conceptualized these interventions as creating the conditions where patients best can use existing abilities and the benefits offered by medication treatment. As rep-resented by a small but growing literature, there are encouraging signs that structured skill-building treatments of this kind offer benefit to adults with ADHD. Further research on these strategies in the context of well-controlled trials is an essential step for helping reduce disability and distress among this cohort of patients.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^114Q2b2E]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study Question

Is methylphenidate beneficial or harmful for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents?

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) were conducted. Quality was assessed using GRADE. Teachers, parents, and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour.

Study Answer and Limitations

The analyses included 38 parallel group trials (n = 5111, median treatment duration 49 days) and 147 crossover trials (n = 7134, 14 days). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in 19 parallel group trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, n = 1698), corresponding to a mean difference of -9.6 points on the ADHD rating scale. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, nine trials, n = 1532; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91). Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (1.29, 21 trials, n = 3132; TSA adjusted RR 1.29). Teacher rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, five trials, n = 668) A change of 7 points on the child health questionnaire (CHQ) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ (range 0–100 points), which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, three trials, n = 514). 96.8% of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines. All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE.

What This Study Adds

The results suggest that among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, methylphenidate may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life. However, given the risk of bias in the included studies, and the very low quality of outcomes, the magnitude of the effects is uncertain. Methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious but not serious adverse events.

### Performance improvement CME: adult ADHD [^1114B9qe]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders and is now understood to be a lifelong condition for most individuals. Unfortunately, many adults with ADHD are not being diagnosed, possibly due to insufficient diagnostic criteria, the complex presentation of the disorder, and a reluctance by physicians to diagnose the disorder in adults. Additionally, many of those who have been diagnosed with ADHD do not receive adequate treatment despite the availability of established and effective agents. Performance Improvement CME (PI CME) is an educational activity in which clinicians retrospectively assess their current clinical practice, choose areas for improvement and implement interventions based on treatment guidelines and health care standards, and then re-evaluate their clinical practice to assess the improvements made. This PI CME activity focuses on improving the diagnosis and treatment of adult ADHD.

### A systematic review and analysis of long-term outcomes in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: effects of treatment and non-treatment [^112sdq4s]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Health in the US funded the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA); this is one of the largest independent trials examining the effects on ADHD symptoms and long-term outcomes of different ADHD treatments including: intensive behavioral intervention, medication, these two treatments combined, or routine community care. In the primary intent-to-treat analyses, outcomes in this study were not significantly different for pharmacological treatment alone versus combined treatment after correction for multiple tests, but the combined group allowed as good a result with significantly lower dose of medication (methylphenidate). In two secondary analyses compositing several outcome measures, combined treatment was significantly better than pharmacological treatment alone. An 8-year follow-up for this trial failed to differentiate the four treatment groups, demonstrating that regardless of treatment, participants showed improved outcomes (delinquency rating, reading and overall academic performance, and social skills) compared with baseline (pretreatment). The reasons why the original differences between groups disappeared after 8 years has been extensively debated, with arguments on opposite sides that medication was no longer effective or that all participants improved from treatment and the improvement was sustained or that the natural course of the disorder accounted for the improvement. The best interpretation may be that the data were confounded and conclusions difficult to draw. The MTA study is the best-known study of the long-term outcomes of ADHD, including the early impact of treatment on later outcomes.

Rationale

Based on the potential for long-term persistence of ADHD into adulthood and equivocal reports on treatment, we initiated this evidence-based systematic review to understand the long-term outcomes of ADHD with emphasis on a comprehensive synthesis of published data. Given the large differences in study design and measurements used, we decided that using a binary feature common to all the studies ('significantly different' and 'not significantly different') to define outcome results for LTOs would allow us to summarize all the included studies in a non-statistical fashion. Binary variables are used to simplify data in clinical trials for ADHD quite frequently (for example, Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS) responder analyses). 'Long term' was defined as 2 years or more and 'outcomes' were defined as life consequences, distinct from symptoms.

Objectives

Our analysis sought to answer the research question: what are the long-term outcomes in participants with ADHD compared to baseline or controls and do long-term outcomes of ADHD improve with treatment (including pharmacological, non-pharmacological and multimodal)?

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112VUTHE]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

We found significant statistical heterogeneity in the pairwise meta-analyses, and the study population in our review included participants with different previous exposures and responses to ADHD medications. These characteristics were quite evenly distributed across the included studies and across the different nodes in the network, therefore, even if they contributed to statistical heterogeneity, it is unlikely that they have implications in terms of clinical heterogeneity and affected the validity of our results. On the contrary, heterogeneity can be seen as increasing the external validity of our findings, because the patients seen in real-world clinical practice tend to have similar variations. Although we included studies that used different rating scales to assess the core symptoms of ADHD, we selected carefully only validated scales that measure exclusively the same triad of symptoms — ie, inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Our results should also consider the risk of bias of individual studies and GRADE quality ratings. After gathering additional unpublished information, the overall number of unclear items — across all items of the risk of bias — decreased from 63.5% to 35.2%. This reduction points to an urgent need for complete and open reporting in this research area. Additionally, the confidence of estimate for primary outcomes was low or very low in multiple comparisons, reducing the certainty of the findings. Most very low ratings were for indirect comparisons, suggesting the need for additional well designed head-to-head studies. Whereas previous pairwise, or network meta-analysesof ADHD medications rated all comparisons as low or very low quality, attributable in part to unpublished information that we gathered and a more nuanced assessment, we could rate some comparisons as high or moderate quality. Of note, these comparisons included the most commonly used drugs for ADHD (ie, methylphenidate and amphetamines). Additionally, our stringent criteria for the risk of bias (ie, a study was assessed at overall low risk only when all individual items were at low risk) could have contributed to downgrade the final GRADE ratings.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^117KXWLc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), diagnosed mainly in children, often persist into adulthood. Adults in this group have a high rate of other psychiatric problems and functional difficulties in a number of key areas such as academic achievement, interpersonal relationships, and employment. Although the usefulness of immediate-release methylphenidate in children has been extensively studied, studies in adults, which are few, demonstrate varying results.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in the treatment of adults with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases in November 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), and two trials registers. Biosis was searched in December 2013. We inspected references of all relevant papers to identify more studies and contacted authors of recently published trials.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized trials comparing immediate-release methylphenidate versus placebo in participants aged 18 years or older with ADHD. We excluded trials conducted on subpopulations of adults with ADHD such as adults with both ADHD and substance dependence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trial risk of bias. We contacted authors of trials to ask for additional and missing data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs.

Main Results

Results from the 11 randomized controlled trials (474 participants, counting participants from cross-over studies as a single arm, and counting both arms from parallel studies) included in the review demonstrated improvement in core clinical ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and overall improvement. We were able to pool results from 10 studies, which included 466 participants. Most included studies were judged to have unclear risk of bias for most categories. However, as all studies were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled and, in general, did not contain factors that significantly decreased the quality of the body of evidence, the quality of evidence was assessed as "high" for most outcomes according to the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For one outcome-inattentiveness-most information came from studies at unclear risk of bias, and so the quality of evidence for this outcome was judged as "moderate". Results are given as SMD for each of the core clinical symptoms of ADHD. In all cases, participant numbers were calculated by counting participants in a single arm from cross-over studies and in both arms from parallel studies. The SMD for the outcome of hyperactivity was -0.60 (95% CI -1.11 to -0.09, 6 studies, number of participants (n) = 245, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; the SMD for impulsivity was -0.62 (95% CI -1.08 to -0.17, 5 studies, n = 207, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate; and the SMD for inattentiveness was -0.66 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.30, 7 studies, n = 391, moderate-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. Moderate to extreme statistical heterogeneity was detected for all outcomes. Subgroup analysis comparing high versus low doses did not indicate that higher doses of immediate-release methylphenidate were associated with greater efficacy. For overall change, the SMD was -0.72 (95% CI -1.12 to -0.32, 9 studies, n = 455, high-quality evidence) in favor of immediate-release methylphenidate. The effects of immediate-release methylphenidate on anxiety and depression as parameters of general changes in mental state were equivocal. Some trials reported reduction in depression and anxiety, others detailed no change, and still others described an increase in depressive and anxious symptoms. The most common adverse effect was loss of appetite, in some cases with weight loss. Although no study reported either of these effects as problematic or severe, the included studies were of short duration; thus clinical significance could not be properly assessed. Five studies reported changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, and three reported increases in heart rate. None of these results were judged to present cause for concern. No study reported clinically significant adverse effects-cardiovascular or other. Three studies did not mention adverse effects. We were unable to determine whether adverse effects were not discussed by study authors because none occurred, or because no data on adverse effects were collected.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that immediate-release methylphenidate is efficacious for treating adults with ADHD with symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentiveness, and for improving their overall clinical condition. Trial data suggest that adverse effects from immediate-release methylphenidate for adults with ADHD are not of serious clinical significance, although this conclusion may be limited, certainly in the case of weight loss, by the short duration of published studies.

### Treatment strategies for ADHD: an evidence-based guide to select optimal treatment [^112ijMBk]. Molecular Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and impairing disorder affecting children, adolescents, and adults. Several treatment strategies are available that can successfully ameliorate symptoms, ranging from pharmacological to dietary interventions. Due to the increasing range of available options, an informed selection or prioritization of treatments is becoming harder for clinicians. This review aims to provide an evidence-based appraisal of the literature on ADHD treatment, supplemented by expert opinion on plausibility. We outline proposed mechanisms of action of established pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments, and we review targets of novel treatments. The most relevant evidence supporting efficacy and safety of each treatment strategy is discussed. We review the individualized features of the patient that should guide the selection of treatments in a shared decision-making continuum. We provide guidance for optimizing initiation of treatment and follow-up of patients in clinical settings.

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^116nobYd]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurocognitive behavioral developmental disorder most commonly seen in childhood and adolescence, which often extends to the adult years. Relative to a decade ago, there has been extensive research into understanding the factors underlying ADHD, leading to far more treatment options available for both adolescents and adults with this disorder. Novel stimulant formulations have made it possible to tailor treatment to the duration of efficacy required by patients, and to help mitigate the potential for abuse, misuse and diversion. Several new non-stimulant options have also emerged in the past few years. Among these, cognitive behavioral interventions have proven popular in the treatment of adult ADHD, especially within the adult population who cannot or will not use medications, along with the many medication-treated patients who continue to show residual disability.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, with a worldwide population prevalence in epidemiological studies of around 7.2% in children and 2.5% in adults. The diagnosis of ADHD is based on the presence of pervasive, developmentally inappropriate, and impairing levels of hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and impulsivity. When untreated, individuals with ADHD are prone to a wide range of poor outcomes such as defiant, disruptive, and antisocial behaviours, emotional problems, self-harm, substance misuse, educational underachievement and exclusion from school, difficulties with employment and relationships, and criminality. Therefore, timely recognition and appropriate treatment of ADHD are essential to enhance long-term well-beings of individuals with the condition. Current guidelines often recommend a combination of non-pharmacological (e.g. behavioural or cognitive therapy) and pharmacological treatment, depending on the patient's age, levels of impairment, and comorbidities.

### Clinical recommendations in current practice guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults [^113ABjvw]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder in which approximately two thirds of patients experience impairment in adulthood. Although some adults with ADHD were diagnosed as children, many are first diagnosed as adults. This poses particular challenges given the limited familiarity with ADHD of many adult mental health services. As a result, several organizations, including the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the National Institutes of Health, and the British Association for Psychopharmacology, have developed practice guidelines for the assessment and treatment of adults with ADHD. This article reviews those guidelines in order to examine current best practices in adult ADHD. There is considerable agreement among these guidelines, which should be a critical part of moving from emerging knowledge to patient care, although both empirical evaluation and ongoing updates as new knowledge emerges will be important for their future development.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^112bkwRs]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 5.3% of youths and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD present increased risks for a wide array of psychiatric and somatic conditions, serious functional outcomes, and premature death. This makes the delivery of safe and effective treatments, that improve both the core symptoms and related impairments, a key public health issue. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that ADHD medications are effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms and large observational studies further indicate they are associated with lower risks of real-world outcomes, including injuries, crime, transport crashes, suicide attempts, and unnatural-cause mortality.

Until recent years, in many countries, the administrative prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was much lower than the estimated epidemiological prevalence. However, the diagnosis of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication has increased substantially worldwide over the last decade. A recent study reported an annual rise of 9.7% in ADHD medication use across 64 countries between 2015 and 2019. Sweden has seen a particularly sharp increase in ADHD medication use over the years. From 2006 to 2020, ADHD medication use in children increased nearly 5-fold, from 0.6% to 2.8%, and more than 10-fold in adults, from 0.1% to 1.3% during this period, positioning Sweden among countries with the highest rates of ADHD medication prescription globally. Similar trends are seen in other European countries. Research suggests that these increases in prescription are not a response to actual increases in ADHD prevalence, but rather reflect changes in diagnostic criteria and the way that these are interpreted, changes in parental perception of impairment, and increased clinician and community awareness of ADHD. These increases in ADHD medication prescriptions have been particularly pronounced in adults and females. In the US, while the overall prevalence in adults receiving ADHD medication increased from 0.5% to 2.0% from 2001 to 2015, the prevalence in women aged 15 to 44 years increased from 0.9% in 2003 to 4.0% in 2015. These significant shifts highlight a critical question: do those receiving ADHD medication today benefit from the treatment in the same way as those who received it a decade ago? Understanding these evolving dynamics is essential for optimizing treatment strategies across diverse patient populations, as well as for informing treatment guidelines and recommendations for both children and adults.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114EvqPx]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

The benefits and safety of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remain controversial, and guidelines are inconsistent on which medications are preferred across different age groups. We aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of oral medications for ADHD in children, adolescents, and adults.

Methods

We did a literature search for published and unpublished double-blind randomised controlled trials comparing amphetamines (including lisdexamfetamine), atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil with each other or placebo. We systematically contacted study authors and drug manufacturers for additional information. Primary outcomes were efficacy (change in severity of ADHD core symptoms based on teachers' and clinicians' ratings) and tolerability (proportion of patients who dropped out of studies because of side-effects) at timepoints closest to 12 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. We assessed the risk of bias of individual studies with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and confidence of estimates with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach for network meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42014008976.

Findings

133 double-blind randomised controlled trials (81 in children and adolescents, 51 in adults, and one in both) were included. The analysis of efficacy closest to 12 weeks was based on 10 068 children and adolescents and 8131 adults; the analysis of tolerability was based on 11 018 children and adolescents and 5362 adults. The confidence of estimates varied from high or moderate (for some comparisons) to low or very low (for most indirect comparisons). For ADHD core symptoms rated by clinicians in children and adolescents closest to 12 weeks, all included drugs were superior to placebo (eg, SMD −1.02, 95% CI −1.19 to −0.85 for amphetamines, −0.78, −0.93 to −0.62 for methylphenidate, −0.56, −0.66 to −0.45 for atomoxetine). By contrast, for available comparisons based on teachers' ratings, only methylphenidate (SMD −0.82, 95% CI −1.16 to −0.48) and modafinil (−0.76, −1.15 to −0.37) were more efficacious than placebo. In adults (clinicians' ratings), amphetamines (SMD −0.79, 95% CI −0.99 to −0.58), methylphenidate (−0.49, −0.64 to −0.35), bupropion (−0.46, −0.85 to −0.07), and atomoxetine (−0.45, −0.58 to −0.32), but not modafinil (0.16, −0.28 to 0.59), were better than placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were inferior to placebo in both children and adolescents (odds ratio [OR] 2.30, 95% CI 1.36–3.89) and adults (3.26, 1.54–6.92); guanfacine was inferior to placebo in children and adolescents only (2.64, 1.20–5.81); and atomoxetine (2.33, 1.28–4.25), methylphenidate (2.39, 1.40–4.08), and modafinil (4.01, 1.42–11.33) were less well tolerated than placebo in adults only. In head-to-head comparisons, only differences in efficacy (clinicians' ratings) were found, favouring amphetamines over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in both children and adolescents (SMDs −0.46 to −0.24) and adults (−0.94 to −0.29). We did not find sufficient data for the 26-week and 52-week timepoints.

Interpretation

Our findings represent the most comprehensive available evidence base to inform patients, families, clinicians, guideline developers, and policymakers on the choice of ADHD medications across age groups. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, evidence from this meta-analysis supports methylphenidate in children and adolescents, and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-choice medications for the short-term treatment of ADHD. New research should be funded urgently to assess long-term effects of these drugs.

### A review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^117WR9Pv]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. CPGs have evolved during the last 2 decades from general consensus statements by prominent practitioners in the field to highly structured instruments. The Institute of Medicine has laid out specific standards for selecting the experts who develop a CPG and the process by which CPGs are developed. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been the focus of more than 20 CPGs created by governments and professional societies, both in the United States and internationally. There is a good deal of consensus across these CPGs regarding the principles of the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. Drawing on the rich research base in ADHD, all CPGs emphasize the need for screening, a diagnosis based on history and standardized rating scales, as well as the use of evidence-based psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments. They vary in terms of their emphasis on the role of psychosocial treatment and the degree to which they address comorbid disorders in ADHD. Although limited research has shown ADHG CPGs do change provider practice, there is no research examining if the changes in practice brought about by CPGs impact patient outcomes.
