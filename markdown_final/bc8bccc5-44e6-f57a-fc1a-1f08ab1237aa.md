## Question

Can you combine compazine and zofran

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether compazine (prochlorperazine) and zofran (ondansetron) can be combined safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanisms of action to assess synergy. Then, I should verify the major safety concern, which I suspect is QT prolongation. Next, I will review clinical evidence for combination use in relevant settings. After that, I need to check guideline positions and labeled contraindications. Finally, I will outline practical precautions, monitoring, and when the combination is reasonable versus when to avoid it, anchoring to high-quality sources like FDA labeling, consensus guidelines, and drug–drug interaction databases.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Prochlorperazine is a dopamine D2 antagonist with antiemetic effects via the chemoreceptor trigger zone, while ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist acting peripherally and centrally; mechanistically, they target different pathways, which supports potential additive antiemetic benefit rather than redundancy, and this complementary mechanism is precisely why multimodal antiemetic strategies are standard in high-risk scenarios [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the primary safety signal. The most critical interaction is QT prolongation: both prochlorperazine and ondansetron can prolong the QT interval, and coadministration increases the risk of torsades de pointes, particularly in patients with congenital long QT, electrolyte disturbances, bradyarrhythmias, heart failure, or other QT-prolonging drugs; this is explicitly flagged in ondansetron labeling and drug–drug interaction summaries, and it is the reason ECG monitoring is advised in at-risk patients [^111BFkMa] [^113yQTAc] [^112fNZtV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review whether there is clinical evidence supporting combination use despite the QT risk. In perioperative care, contemporary consensus guidelines endorse multimodal prophylaxis with two or more antiemetics for patients at risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, commonly pairing a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron with a dopamine antagonist such as prochlorperazine or dexamethasone, reflecting established additive benefit; similarly, in cyclic vomiting syndrome, expert guidance supports combining ondansetron with phenothiazines for abortive therapy, again balancing efficacy with QT cautions [^115htHX8] [^1118LRdt].

> I need to check labeled contraindications to ensure we are not missing a formal prohibition. Ondansetron carries a contraindication with apomorphine due to profound hypotension and loss of consciousness, but there is no labeled contraindication specifically for prochlorperazine; the main concern is additive QT effects rather than a direct pharmacodynamic clash, which means the combination is not absolutely contraindicated but warrants risk mitigation [^116wpcDi] [^1134Kv1L] [^112fNZtV].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, both agents are used for nausea and vomiting, but combining them may increase QT risk; ACOG notes the potential cardiac risk of ondansetron with phenothiazines and advises individualized risk–benefit assessment and counseling, which argues for caution and baseline ECG in higher-risk patients rather than a blanket prohibition [^111Jy6wh] [^116ZkN6i]. In pediatrics, ondansetron is commonly used for gastroenteritis and procedural nausea, and while QT risk is generally lower, vigilance for family history of sudden cardiac death and electrolyte status remains prudent before combining with a phenothiazine [^113FsTzT] [^111ZWmev].

> Next, I should review practical precautions if combination is chosen. I should confirm electrolytes, especially potassium and magnesium, correct any abnormalities, and consider a baseline ECG in patients with cardiac risk factors or when cumulative QT risk is present; I will also avoid other QT-prolonging agents when possible and monitor for symptoms such as palpitations or syncope, aligning with ondansetron labeling and prehospital guidance that highlight ECG monitoring in at-risk patients [^111BFkMa] [^112GSeKt] [^115si17P].

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is low risk and monotherapy suffices? I should double-check that guidelines still prioritize risk-stratified prophylaxis: for PONV, patients with 0–1 risk factors may do well with a single agent, whereas those with 2 or more risk factors benefit from combination therapy; thus, I should tailor whether to combine compazine and zofran to the patient's intrinsic risk and the severity of nausea and vomiting, rather than using combination therapy indiscriminately [^1144VwZ3] [^112PxgSf].

> In summary, yes, compazine and zofran can be combined when clinically indicated, particularly for moderate-to-high risk PONV, refractory nausea and vomiting, or cyclic vomiting attacks, because their different mechanisms yield additive antiemetic benefit; however, I need to ensure QT risk is mitigated through electrolyte correction, avoidance of other QT-prolonging drugs, and ECG monitoring in at-risk patients, and I should document the rationale and counsel patients about rare but serious arrhythmia risk [^1144VwZ3] [^112PxgSf] [^111BFkMa] [^112fNZtV].

Compazine (prochlorperazine) and Zofran (ondansetron) can be combined for **refractory nausea and vomiting** because they act on different receptors (D2 vs 5-HT3) and have complementary mechanisms [^1144VwZ3]. The main risk is **additive QT prolongation** [^112fNZtV]; use caution in patients with cardiac disease, electrolyte disturbances, or other QT-prolonging drugs, and consider ECG monitoring in high-risk cases [^111BFkMa]. The combination is commonly used in perioperative and chemotherapy settings, and guidelines support multimodal antiemetic therapy when monotherapy fails [^1144VwZ3] [^111rfzKz].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and complementary effects

Prochlorperazine is a **dopamine D2 antagonist** that blocks dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, reducing nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron is a **selective 5-HT3 antagonist** that blocks serotonin receptors in the gut and CNS, providing antiemetic effects. Together, they target different pathways, offering additive or synergistic antiemetic effects, especially in refractory cases [^1144VwZ3].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Although direct head-to-head trials are limited, clinical practice and guidelines support combining prochlorperazine and ondansetron for refractory nausea and vomiting, particularly in **postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)** [^1144VwZ3] [^116Q69Z3]. Multimodal antiemetic regimens are recommended for high-risk patients or when single-agent therapy fails [^1144VwZ3] [^112PxgSf].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

The primary concern with combining prochlorperazine and ondansetron is **additive QT interval prolongation**, which can increase the risk of torsades de pointes and other serious arrhythmias [^112fNZtV]. Both drugs independently prolong the QT interval, and their combination can further increase this risk, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), or concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications [^111BFkMa].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of individualized risk assessment when combining antiemetics with potential QT prolongation risk. The following precautions are recommended:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate patients for cardiac risk factors, electrolyte disturbances, and concomitant QT-prolonging medications before initiating combination therapy [^111BFkMa].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring**: Consider baseline and follow-up ECG monitoring in high-risk patients or when using multiple QT-prolonging agents [^111BFkMa].

- **Dose adjustments**: Use the lowest effective doses of both medications to minimize QT prolongation risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy is beneficial

Combination therapy with prochlorperazine and ondansetron is particularly beneficial in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Refractory nausea and vomiting**: Patients who do not respond adequately to single-agent antiemetic therapy [^1144VwZ3].

- **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)**: High-risk patients undergoing surgery, where multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis is recommended [^1144VwZ3] [^112PxgSf].

- **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)**: Patients experiencing breakthrough nausea and vomiting despite standard prophylactic regimens [^116Q69Z3].

---

## Alternative antiemetic combinations

If the combination of prochlorperazine and ondansetron is contraindicated or not tolerated, alternative antiemetic combinations may be considered, including:

- **Ondansetron with dexamethasone**: Commonly used for PONV and CINV, with a favorable safety profile [^1144VwZ3] [^116Q69Z3].

- **Ondansetron with metoclopramide**: Useful for gastroparesis-related nausea and vomiting, though metoclopramide carries a risk of extrapyramidal symptoms [^115aAKqs].

- **Ondansetron with promethazine**: Effective for refractory cases, but promethazine has significant sedative and anticholinergic effects [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Combination therapy recommended?** | **Precautions** |
|-|-|-|
| Refractory nausea and vomiting | Yes | - Risk assessment <br/> - ECG monitoring <br/> - Electrolyte correction |
| Postoperative nausea and vomiting (high-risk patients) | Yes | - Risk assessment <br/> - ECG monitoring <br/> - Lowest effective doses |
| Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (breakthrough) | Yes | - Risk assessment <br/> - ECG monitoring <br/> - Electrolyte correction |
| Patients with cardiac disease or electrolyte imbalances | No (unless benefits outweigh risks) | - ECG monitoring <br/> - Electrolyte correction <br/> - Close monitoring |

---

Compazine (prochlorperazine) and Zofran (ondansetron) can be combined for refractory nausea and vomiting, leveraging complementary mechanisms [^1144VwZ3]. The main risk is **QT prolongation** [^112fNZtV]; use caution with risk assessment, ECG monitoring, and electrolyte correction. This strategy is supported in perioperative and chemotherapy settings when monotherapy fails [^116Q69Z3].

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1950-March 2010) and Google Scholar were performed. Key search terms included ondansetron, Zofran, serotonin antagonists, 5-HT(3) serotonin receptor, and schizophrenia.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles published in English identified from the data sources were evaluated. All studies and case reports evaluating ondansetron for the treatment of schizophrenia were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Six clinical trials, including 3 double-blind, randomized trials, and 2 case reports pertinent to ondansetron use in schizophrenia, were identified. Ondansetron daily doses ranged from 4 to 16 mg, with doses administered once or twice daily. Ondansetron was used as monotherapy in 3 trials and as an adjunct to therapy with clozapine, haloperidol, or risperidone, respectively, in 3 trials. Studies were of varying durations, ranging from a single-dose study with a 3-hour follow-up to three 12-week studies. Most studies evaluated ondansetron's efficacy in treating schizophrenia as measured with changes in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Clinical Global Impression scale scores. In the 2 largest trials, with a combined patient population of 151, treatment with adjunctive ondansetron resulted in statistically significant improvement in negative symptoms as assessed with PANSS. In all studies, ondansetron was well tolerated, with no severe adverse reactions reported.

Conclusions

Ondansetron may be effective as an adjunct to antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia, specifically negative symptoms, as assessed with PANSS. Due to the variation in concurrent therapies and dosing regimens, it is difficult to establish an optimal dose from the reviewed trials. Further large, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies would be helpful in determining the role of ondansetron in the treatment of schizophrenia.

### A randomized clinical trial comparing oral ondansetron with placebo in children with vomiting from acute gastroenteritis [^112dPChz]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Vomiting in children suffering from acute gastroenteritis interferes with the oral rehydration process and equally frustrates parents and health care providers. Adjuncts such as promethazine and metoclopramide are less than optimally effective and are associated with side effects. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist marketed as Zofran, is a safe and effective antiemetic used extensively in oncology and postoperative patients. We evaluate the effect of the antiemetic ondansetron versus placebo on the clinical outcome of patients with vomiting from gastroenteritis in a pediatric emergency department.

Methods

This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial in a university-affiliated children's hospital ED. Children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years who had vomited at least 5 times during the preceding 24 hours were randomized to receive either oral ondansetron or a taste- and color-matched placebo. Oral rehydration was commenced 15 minutes later at 5 mL/min per standard oral rehydration protocols. Patients were discharged after they voided and continued standard oral rehydration at home with the introduction of a bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT) diet after the first 24 hours. Any patient requiring admission was considered a treatment failure, and no further doses were given. Discharged patients were given 5 additional doses to be used every 8 hours, and they were contacted by telephone 24 and 48 hours after discharge to record the number of episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. The parents were also required to complete a diary of the same information, which was mailed to the investigators for confirmation of the telephone data.

Results

One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 51% (n = 74) were randomized to ondansetron. At baseline, age distribution, sex, and severity of illness did not differ between the ondansetron and placebo groups. During the observation period in the ED, the median number of episodes of vomiting was 0 in both groups, but the rank sum of vomiting episodes was significantly lower in the ondansetron group (P = 0.001). The number of episodes of emesis in the ED after enrollment ranged from 0 to 7 in the placebo group and 0 to 2 in the ondansetron group. During the 48 hours of follow-up, the median number of episodes of vomiting remained 0, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the rank sum of episodes of diarrhea in the ED between the groups (P = 0.622); however, during the next 48 hours, the patients in the ondansetron group had significantly more diarrhea than the placebo group. A lower proportion of patients receiving ondansetron compared with placebo required intravenous fluid therapy (P = 0.015). The admission rate was also lower in patients receiving ondansetron (P = 0.007). The revisit rate was higher in the ondansetron group compared with the placebo group (P = 0.047).

Conclusion

Ondansetron was effective in reducing the emesis from gastroenteritis during the ED phase of oral rehydration and in lowering the rates of intravenous fluid administration and hospital admission.

### Translational utility of rodent hippocampal auditory gating in schizophrenia research: a review and evaluation [^111pvxNJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Ondansetron (Zofran) is perhaps the pharmacologically 'cleanest' example of a serotinergic drug with pro-gating effects across animal and human studies. It is not classified as an antipsychotic, as it is a selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist and therefore does not block D2 receptors. Its selectivity for the 5-HT(3) receptor allows researchers to isolate pro-gating effects due to blockade of this particular serotonin receptor subtype.

Consistent with the demonstrated ability of 5-HT(3) receptor blockade to indirectly activate nicotinic receptors by increasing ACh release, ondansetron improved gating in DBA/2 miceand schizophrenia patientsin a manner similar to nicotinic agonists (Table 1 c). These effects were driven by increased S1 amplitude and decreased S2 amplitudes in mice, but only decreased S2 amplitude in patients. The dual effect observed in animals may be due to the ability of ondansetron to induce activation of α7 nicotinic receptors on inhibitory interneurons as well as α4β2-receptor on excitatory pyramidal cells (Figure 2). The discrepancy between human and animal studies may be due to the antipsychotic medications that the patients were taking at the time of the study (six of the eight subjects were taking typical antipsychotics), as these drugs have been shown to increase S1 amplitude (Table 1 b). A ceiling effect on S1 amplitude may have therefore been reached, preventing any further increase by ondansetron.

### Should antiemetics be given prophylactically with intravenous opioids while treating acute pain in the emergency department? clinical practice paper approved by American academy of emergency medicine clinical guidelines committee [^116cS8G9]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Use of prophylactic antiemetic with parenteral opioids — retrospective hospitalized cohort data showed no prophylactic benefit: among 619 hospitalized patients receiving oral opioid analgesics, 435 received prophylactic antiemetics with nausea and vomiting incidences of 23.0% and 15.9% versus 25.5% and 12.5% without prophylaxis, with OR 0.870; 95% CI 0.584–1.298; p = 0.495 for nausea and OR 1.320; 95% CI 0.795–2.191; p = 0.283 for vomiting; the most frequently used antiemetics were prochlorperazine (15 mg/d; 88.7%), compazine (30 mg/d; 6.4%), and metoclopramide (15 mg/d; 3.4%); these findings do not support routine use of prophylactic antiemetic administration when combined with opioid analgesia.

### Comparative efficacy of acustimulation (reliefBand) versus ondansetron (zofran) in combination with droperidol for preventing nausea and vomiting [^11716S6C]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Antiemetic drugs are costly, are associated with variable efficacy, and can produce unwanted side effects when used for prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting. This clinical study was designed to compare the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation using a ReliefBand to ondansetron (Zofran) when utilized alone or in combination for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting after plastic surgery.

Methods

A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and sham-controlled study design was conducted to compare three prophylactic antiemetic treatment regimens in 120 outpatients undergoing plastic surgery procedures with routine low-dose droperidol prophylaxis: (1) ondansetron (n = 40), 4 mg intravenous ondansetron and a sham ReliefBand; (2) acustimulation (n = 40), 2 mL intravenous saline and an active ReliefBand; and (3) combination (n = 40), 4 mg intravenous ondansetron and an active ReliefBand. The incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting, as well as the need for "rescue" antiemetics, were determined at specific time intervals for up to 72 h after surgery. The outcome variables assessed included recovery times, quality of recovery score, time to resumption of normal diet, and patient satisfaction with the prophylactic antiemetic therapy.

Results

Use of the ReliefBand in combination with ondansetron significantly reduced nausea (20 vs. 50%), vomiting (0 vs. 20%), and the need for rescue antiemetics (10 vs. 37%) compared with ondansetron alone at 24 h after surgery. Furthermore, the ability to resume a normal diet (74 vs. 35%) within 24 h after surgery was significantly improved when the ReliefBand was used to supplement ondansetron (vs. ondansetron alone). Finally, the quality of recovery (90 ± 10 vs.70 ± 20) and patient satisfaction (94 ± 10 vs. 75 ± 22) scores were significantly higher in the combination group the ondansetron group. There were no significant differences between the ReliefBand and ondansetron when administered as adjuvants to droperidol for antiemetic prophylaxis.

Conclusions

The ReliefBand compared favorably to ondansetron (4 mg intravenously) when used for prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting. Furthermore, the acustimulation device enhanced the antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron after plastic surgery.

### Ondansetron hydrochloride (ondansetron) [^1157Xr6S]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In the same trial, 56% of patients receiving a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron experienced no nausea during the 24-hour trial period, compared with 36% of patients in the oral ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group (P = 0.001) and 50% in the oral ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group. Dosage regimens of ondansetron 8 mg twice daily and 32 mg once daily are not recommended for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

In a second trial, efficacy of a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2, was confirmed.

Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy

A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in the U.S. in 67 patients receiving a cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy regimen containing doxorubicin. The first 8 mg dose of ondansetron was administered 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, with a subsequent dose 8 hours after the first dose, followed by 8 mg of ondansetron twice a day for 2 days after the completion of chemotherapy. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing vomiting. Treatment response was based on the total number of emetic episodes over the 3-day trial period. The results of this trial are summarized in Table 7.

14.1 Prevention of Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy

In 2 randomized, double-blind, monotherapy trials, a single 24 mg oral dose of ondansetron was superior to a relevant historical placebo control in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2. Steroid administration was excluded from these clinical trials. More than 90% of patients receiving a cisplatin dose greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2in the historical-placebo comparator, experienced vomiting in the absence of antiemetic therapy.

The first trial compared oral doses of ondansetron 24 mg as a single dose, 8 mg every 8 hours for 2 doses, and 32 mg as a single dose in 357 adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens containing cisplatin greater than or equal to 50 mg/m2. The first or single dose was administered 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. A total of 66% of patients in the ondansetron 24 mg once-a-day group, 55% in the ondansetron 8 mg twice-a-day group, and 55% in the ondansetron 32 mg once-a-day group, completed the 24-hour trial period with 0 emetic episodes and no rescue antiemetic medications, the primary endpoint of efficacy. Each of the 3 treatment groups was shown to be statistically significantly superior to a historical placebo control.

Study intervention

Ondansetron

Ondansetron oral syrup (Zofran: Aspen Pharmacare Australia) is stored below 30°C in the original bottle at room temperature in the RCH clinical trials pharmacy. It is transferred into labelled oral syringes (5 and 10 mL) by a trial pharmacist and stored in a designated secured study box in the PED.

Placebo

The placebo syrup has the same appearance, taste and smell to match the ondansetron oral syrup. The placebo is manufactured by the RCH clinical trials pharmacy using water, strawberry flavour, sucrose and compound hydroxybenzoate solution. It is transferred into labelled matching oral syringes (5 and 10 mL) by a trial pharmacist and stored in the same designated secured study box in the PED.

Administration

In the PED, there are two secured study boxes, one designated for the 4 mg (5 mL) doses and the second box with 8 mg (10 mL) doses. The syringe kits are stored in order of administration and protected from light. Each syringe kit contains a sticker with a randomisation number to attach to the participant's case report form (CRF).

Following randomisation, participants receive a single dose of the study drug according to their weight; patients weighing 15–30 kg are administered a 4 mg dose and patients weighing > 30 kg are given an 8 mg dose. In the event of vomiting or spitting out of the study drug, the dose is not repeated. In the rare event of persistent vomiting following PSA, treating clinicians have the discretion to provide a dose of ondansetron to the participant.

Implications

Ondansetron can rarely induce extrapyramidal reactions in susceptible individuals. Our patient had a history of drug-induced dystonic reaction; therefore, these patients may be susceptible to extrapyramidal adverse reactions after ondansetron.

### Prior authorization, quantity limits, and step therapy for patient-administered antiemetics [^1148c7fK]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

We used 2024 Ideon formulary data for all available ACA and Medicaid plans (including Medicaid managed care and state plans), obtained through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's noncommercial researcher initiative. Ideon provides data sharing services for insurance carriers, technology platforms, and researchers. We identified drugs using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) National Drug Codes (NDC) database and linked brand and generic drug names to the formulary files. This study was approved by the Harvard Faculty of Medicine institutional review board, and informed consent was not required given that no human participants were involved. We followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines for cross-sectional studies.

We classified drugs as antiemetics using previously established methodsand review of clinical guidelines. We excluded controlled substances (cannabinoids, benzodiazepines) and diversion risks (steroids) given the complexity of coverage restrictions in those groups (eAppendix in Supplement 1). We further excluded drugs that did not appear in both the ACA and Medicaid formularies. Of note, some drugs included in this study (eg, olanzapine, haloperidol, scopolamine) may have additional benefits beyond CINV prophylaxis and cancer-related nausea treatment but were included given their inclusion in guidelines for patients with cancer.

The formulary files contained binary indicators for prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits for each drug at the NDC package code level as well as ordinal indicators for tier (eTable 7 in Supplement 1). We treated each drug-dose-plan combination as a unique observation. For example, a plan might cover several formulations of the medication ondansetron, such as ondansetron 4-mg tab (generic), ondansetron 4-mg tab (brand-name [Zofran]), ondansetron 4-mg oral disintegrating tablet, and ondansetron 4-mg injection. UM indicators for every unique drug-dose-formulation covered by each plan were captured. This level of specificity allowed us to include only routes typically filled at a retail pharmacy and self-administered at home (oral, sublingual, transdermal) and exclude routes administered in a clinical setting (intravenous). However, since we do not have utilization data, some of the included drugs may also be used in clinical settings and are not necessarily limited to patient self-administration.

### Postoperative nausea and vomiting in the plastic surgery patient [^113jpKgg]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Despite great advances in modern medicine, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) continue to be a significant problem without a definitive cure. This article describes a prospective study conducted with 143 plastic surgery patients at a single institution between 1998 and 2000 to identify preoperative risk factors for PONV that may be specific to plastic surgery patients. In addition, a prophylactic regimen was identified that demonstrated a decrease in the incidence of PONV from the published incidence of 22% to 3%. The regimen includes the use of multiple antiemetic agents including ondansetron (Zofran) promethazine (Phenergan), and metoclopramide (Reglan), with the addition of dexamethasone (Decadron) in selected cases

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Myocardial Ischemia

Myocardial ischemia has been reported in patients treated with ondansetron. In some cases, predominantly during intravenous administration, the symptoms appeared immediately after administration but resolved with prompt treatment. Coronary artery spasm appears to be the most common underlying cause. Therefore, monitor or advise patients for signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia after oral administration of ondansetron [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

5.5 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.

Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

### The efficacy of postoperative ondansetron (zofran) orally disintegrating tablets for preventing nausea and vomiting after acoustic neuroma surgery [^116KFuJ1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a frequent complication of craniotomy. We evaluated the ability of intraoperative IV ondansetron followed by postoperative ondansetron in an orally disintegrating tablet formulation to reduce the frequency and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial of 60 patients undergoing acoustic neuroma resection. Each patient received intraoperative ondansetron (4 mg IV) or placebo 30 min before case end. Postoperatively, patients received ondansetron in an orally disintegrating tablet formulation (8 mg BID) or placebo twice a day for up to 72 h. Metoclopramide was available as rescue therapy for both groups. Severity of nausea (as measured on a 10-cm visual scale), number of emetic episodes, and requirement for rescue therapy were recorded. In the immediate postoperative period, nausea severity was less in patients treated with ondansetron than placebo (3.3 ± 4.1 versus 7.3 ± 4.2; P < 0.001) and fewer patients experienced vomiting (3 of 28 versus 11 of 32; chi2 P < 0.01). More patients required some form of rescue treatment in the placebo group on the first postoperative day (26 of 32 versus 16 of 28; chi2 P < 0.01). We conclude that after acoustic neuroma surgery IV ondansetron treatment prevents immediate postoperative nausea and vomiting. Postoperative treatment with ondansetron in an orally disintegrating tablet formulation was associated with less frequent rescue therapy as compared with placebo on the first postoperative day.

### Obtundation and seizure following ondansetron overdose in an infant [^116aLS2L]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ondansetron, an increasingly prescribed 5-HT(3) antagonist used in the management of nausea and vomiting of various etiologies, has a well-established safety profile in therapeutic use. However, little is known about its effects in the setting of an overdose. We describe the first case of severe toxicity in an infant who unintentionally ingested a large quantity of ondansetron.

Case Report

A 12-month-old infant who ingested seven to eight tablets of his mother's Zofran (ondansetron) ODT 8 mg rapidly developed obtundation and myoclonic movements. While treated by health care providers, he developed seizures, hepatotoxicity, QTc prolongation, and a serotonin syndrome that required endotracheal intubation and intensive care unit management. His clinical status improved over the course of 24 h with supportive care, and he was discharged to home with no sequelae.

Discussion

With the increasing popularity of ondansetron among health care providers, particularly for the control of nausea in pregnant women, toddlers in the household may become inadvertently exposed to ondansetron toxicity. This case portrays that, despite the safety of this agent in therapeutic dosage, severe toxicity may be seen in excessive amounts, particularly in infants.

Conclusion

Health care providers should recognize the risk for acute toxicity following ondansetron overdose, particularly in infants and toddlers.

### Oral perphenazine 8 mg: a low-cost, efficacious antiemetic option [^111qDHp7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

We congratulate and thank the Fourth Consensus Conference addressing Guidelines for the Management of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV). We wholeheartedly agree with its "one major change in this iteration of the guideline… that in adults, the panel consensus is now to implement multimodal PONV prophylaxis in patients with 1 or 2 risk factors, in an attempt to reduce risk of inadequate prophylaxis". However, since patients with 0 risk factors still have a 10% PONV risk, and because at least 3 nonsedating off-patent inexpensive antiemetics are easily available with minimal side effect burden, we endorse 2 integrated approaches that differ from those presented by the current or previous Consensus Guidelines. First, and principally, we endorse that oral perphenazine 8 mg (OP8) is a low-cost and efficacious tool for prevention of PONV. Second, we will demonstrate the theoretical value of "the perphenazine-dexamethasone-ondansetron (P-D-O) technique" (OP8, dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous [IV], and ondansetron 4 mg IV), applied to every PONV risk category in such a way that the patient may receive a greater number of PONV-prophylactic agents than what the Consensus Guidelines recommend. Specifically, Consensus "wait and see" patients get 3 antiemetics (P-D-O); those for whom 2 agents are recommended receive 3 agents (P-D-O); and those for whom 3 or 4 agents are recommended all get 4 (P-D-O and an neurokinin-1 receptor-antagonist such as aprepitant [40 mg orally, per os]).

### By what mechanism does ondansetron inhibit colonic migrating motor complexes: does it require endogenous serotonin in the gut wall? [^111RaFqr]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Background

5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron (Zofran), retard colonic transit and provide effective relief of symptoms of chronic diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but the mechanism by which ondansetron retards transit is unclear. What is clear is that the frequency of colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs) is reduced by ondansetron, which could account for reduced transit. Our aim was to determine whether an acute depletion of 5-HT from enteric neurons would inhibit spontaneous CMMCs; and determine whether the sensitivity of ondansetron to reduce CMMC frequency would change in a 5-HT-depleted preparation.

Methods

Mice were injected with reserpine, 24 h prior to euthanasia to deplete neuronally synthesized 5-HT. Mechanical recordings were made from proximal and mid-distal regions of isolated whole mouse colon. Immunohistochemical staining for 5-HT was used to detect neuronal 5-HT.

Key Results

Reserpine depleted all detectable 5-HT from enteric nerves. In whole colons, with mucosa and submucosal plexus removed, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous CMMCs was not different between groups treated with or without reserpine. Surprisingly, in mucosa and submucosal plexus-free preparations, ondansetron was equally or significantly more effective at inhibiting CMMC frequency compared with control preparations (containing 5-HT). Reserpine pretreatment had no effect on the sensitivity of ondansetron to inhibit CMMCs.

Conclusions & Inferences

Endogenous 5-HT in enteric neurons (or the mucosa) is not required for the spontaneous generation or propagation of CMMCs. Furthermore, the primary mechanism by which ondansetron inhibits CMMC frequency is not mediated via the mucosa, submucosal plexus or 5-HT in myenteric neurons.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) rescue after failed prophylaxis — The more important findings of the review were from trials where prophylaxis was given but failed. For patients failing ondansetron prophylaxis, redosing with ondansetron or other 5-HT3 antagonists did not provide further benefits (A3, low certainty). Promethazine 6.25 mg and higher shows to be more effective in patients who failed ondansetron prophylaxis over the redosing of ondansetron (B1, low certainty). For promethazine, there is not an apparent dose response in the range of 6.25–25 mg, hence the lowest dose is recommended. The higher doses of promethazine in this range have been associated with sedation.

### Drugs for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in adults in the emergency department setting [^114HVDuz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nausea and vomiting is a common and distressing presenting complaint in emergency departments (ED). The aetiology of nausea and vomiting in EDs is diverse and drugs are commonly prescribed. There is currently no consensus as to the optimum drug treatment of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Objectives

To provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of antiemetic medications in the management of nausea and vomiting in the adult ED setting.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1966 to August 2014), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1980 to August 2014) and ISI Web of Science (January 1955 to August 2014). We also searched relevant clinical trial registries and conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any drug in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the treatment of adults in the ED. Study eligibility was not restricted by language or publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias in included studies. We contacted authors of studies to obtain missing information if required.

Main Results

We included eight trials, involving 952 participants, of which 64% were women. Included trials were generally of adequate quality, with six trials at low risk of bias, and two trials at high risk of bias. Three trials with 518 participants compared five different drugs with placebo; all reported the primary outcome as mean change in visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 to 100) for nausea severity from baseline to 30 minutes. Trials did not routinely report other primary outcomes of the change in nausea VAS at 60 minutes or number of vomiting episodes. Differences in mean VAS change from baseline to 30 minutes between placebo and the drugs evaluated were: metoclopramide (three trials, 301 participants; mean difference (MD) -5.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -11.33 to 0.80), ondansetron (two trials, 250 participants; MD -4.32, 95% CI -11.20 to 2.56), prochlorperazine (one trial, 50 participants; MD -1.80, 95% CI -14.40 to 10.80), promethazine (one trial, 82 participants; MD -8.47, 95% CI -19.79 to 2.85) and droperidol (one trial, 48 participants; MD -15.8, 95% CI -26.98 to -4.62). The only statistically significant change in baseline VAS to 30 minutes was for droperidol, in a single trial of 48 participants. No other drug was statistically significantly superior to placebo. Other included trials evaluated a drug compared to "active controls" (alternative antiemetic). There was no convincing evidence of superiority of any particular drug compared to active control. All trials included in this review reported adverse events, but they were variably reported precluding meaningful pooling of results. Adverse events were generally mild, there were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low, mainly because there were not enough data.

Authors' Conclusions

In an ED population, there is no definite evidence to support the superiority of any one drug over any other drug, or the superiority of any drug over placebo. Participants receiving placebo often reported clinically significant improvement in nausea, implying general supportive treatment such as intravenous fluids may be sufficient for the majority of people. If a drug is considered necessary, choice of drug may be dictated by other considerations such as a person's preference, adverse-effect profile and cost. The review was limited by the paucity of clinical trials in this setting. Future research should include the use of placebo and consider focusing on specific diagnostic groups and controlling for factors such as intravenous fluid administered.

### Antiemetic use in oncology: updated guideline recommendations from ASCO… [^111rfzKz]. ASCO (2012). Low credibility.

3receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and an NK 1receptor antagonist. A large trial validated the equivalency of fosaprepitant, a single-day intravenous formulation, with aprepitant; either therapy is appropriate. Preferential use of palonosetron is recommended for moderate emetic risk regimens, combined with dexamethasone. |Fludarabine| List is not exhaustive. These anthracyclines, when combined with cyclophosphamide, are now designated as high emetic risk. Recommendation 1. The three-drug combination of an NK 1receptor antagonist, a 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. This recommendation is unchanged since the 2006 update, but reworded for clarification. The Update Committee also recommended reclassification of the combined anthracycline and cyclophosphamide regimen as highly emetogenic.

Clinical Question 2. What is the optimal treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting from moderately emetogenic antineoplastic agents. Recommendation 2. The two-drug combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. If palonosetron is not available, clinicians may substitute a first-generation 5-HT 3receptor antagonist, preferably granisetron or ondansetron. Limited evidence also supports adding aprepitant to the combination. Should clinicians opt to add aprepitant in patients receiving moderate-risk chemotherapy, any one of the 5-HT 3receptor antagonists is appropriate. Recommendation 11. Language from the 2006 guideline was reformatted for clarity. Clinicians should:

1. Re-evaluate emetic risk, disease status, concurrent illnesses, and medications
2. Ascertain that the best regimen Is being administered for the emetic risk 3.

Consider adding lorazepam or alprazolam to the regimen
4. Consider adding olanzapine to the regimen or substituting high-dose intravenous metoclopramide for the 5-HT 3receptor antagonist or adding a dopamine antagonist to the regimen.

### A patterned human primitive heart organoid model generated by pluripotent stem cell self-organization [^1179s3mG]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac organogenesis is a highly organized and carefully orchestrated process involving the interplay of millions of cells, and perturbations to this process can lead to congenital heart defects. Heart organoids represent a new avenue to explore heart development and congenital heart defects directly in humans and could be instrumental for disease modeling and pharmacological studies. For these reasons, we decided to investigate the effects of ondansetron (Zofran), a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist and antiemetic used for treating nausea and vomitingand the most common prescription medication for preventing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, with up to 25% of pregnant women taking it off-label during this period. Ondansetron has been epidemiologically linked to congenital heart defects (particularly ventricular septal defects) and orofacial defects –, although consensus in the field is dividedand well-designed studies to thoroughly investigate its safety are lacking. We investigated the effects of ondansetron treatment during heart organoid development and found that ondansetron exposure causes electrophysiological alterations as expected due to its chemistry as a serotonin inhibitor. More interestingly, however, ondansetron also directly and strongly inhibited ventricular cardiomyocyte differentiation or maturation, even at low doses, by an unknown mechanism. This phenotype corresponds with epidemiological clinical findings which associate ondansetron use during pregnancy with ventricular septal defects. This finding is important as it has significant implications in the clinic and suggests ondansetron should be administered with caution during pregnancy.

While our maturated human heart organoid technology opens exciting avenues for modeling the human heart in vitro, important limitations remain. First, further investigation is necessary to clarify the role of other important cellular populations, such as conductance cells and endothelial/coronary vasculature. EMM2/1 conditions had seemingly negative effects on organoid vascularization, a topic that deserves more attention as conditions can be further refined. Second, the lack of circulation constitutes a significant drawback that needs to be addressed, possibly through using microfluidic devices. Third, further developmental steps need to be introduced to continue increasing the physiological relevance of the organoids. This includes correcting the lack of embryonic tissue-resident macrophage populations or the contributions of the neural crest. Finally, more anatomical events need to be modeled, such as outflow tract and atrioventricular canal formation, heart looping, and chamber septation.

Perphenazine, a phenothiazine with antihistamine properties, at 5 mg IV, was included in the Consensus manuscript's Table 4, but the IV preparation has not been commercially available in the United States since the early 2000s. We have had extensive experience with OP8 in adults as part of a multimodal antiemetic plan, with its cost at the undersigned authors' institutions ranging from 50 cents to 2 dollars per dose (US currency). For this low cost per patient, we have previously reporteda 27.2% reduction in the need for IV ondansetron rescue in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in nearly 9500 patients from 2002 to 2006.

The implications of a routinely applied P-D-O technique, including for "zero risk factor" patients, is illustrated in a scenario analysis given in the Table. In the classic factorial trial by Apfel et al, ondansetron 4 mg, dexamethasone 4 mg, and droperidol 1.25 mg each reduced the risk of PONV by approximately 25%. Based on our 2002–2006 aforementioned~25% reduction in need-for-rescue when OP8 was used preoperatively, the Table illustrates that the 3-drug low-cost P-D-O reduces the theoretical risk from 20/200 (10%) to 8/200 (4%) in patients that the Consensus-recommended prophylaxis plan would entail rescue-only without prophylaxis. With the sequential 25% risk reduction per each prophylactic drug, OP8 reduces 20/200 to 15/200, dexamethasone reduces 15/200 to 11/200, and ondansetron reduces 11/200 to 8/200. For patients with 20%–40% risk, we assume 2-agent antiemetic prophylaxis in the Consensus-treated group with ondansetron-dexamethasone (4 mg each IV), and the P-D-O technique-treated group having a 25% further risk reduction than the Consensus-treated group. Finally, for the 60%–80% risk groups where the Consensus guideline is for 3 or 4 antiemetics, we assume half of the Consensus-treated group gets ondansetron-dexamethasone-droperidol 1.25 mg IV for "3 antiemetics", and the other half of the Consensus-treated group gets ondansetron-dexamethasone-droperidol-aprepitant 40 mg po for "4 antiemetics"; meanwhile, we recommend that P-D-O-aprepitant be given for the 60%–80% risk P-D-O–treated groups.

Ondansetron treatment during heart organoid development captures congenital heart disease phenotypes associated with its use in the clinic

Organoids possess the unique capacity to better model and investigate human development, organogenesis, and disease at an unprecedented scale and with greater precision compared to existing platforms. However, in the contexts of organogenesis and disease modeling, until now, human heart organoids have only been used to model developmental perturbations in diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy during pregnancy, gene knockout studies, and developmental cryoinjuries. Therefore, while heart organoids show promise towards unraveling unanswered questions surrounding cardiogenesis and pathology, critical areas such as investigating developmental drug toxicity and broader morphological perturbations in cardiac pathologies remain ripe for discovery.

We sought to investigate the effects of ondansetron during human heart organoid development (Fig. 8). Ondansetron is a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist and antiemetic used for treating nausea and vomiting. Despite the lack of safety studies during pregnancy, ondansetron (also known as Zofran) is also the most common prescription medication for preventing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, with up to 25% of pregnant women taking it off-label during this period. Ondansetron has been epidemiologically linked to congenital heart defects (particularly ventricular septal defects) and orofacial defects, although consensus in the field is divided. While the electrophysiological effects of ondansetron have been studied in vivo using animal models, and on cardiomyocytes in vitro, well-designed studies to thoroughly and directly investigate its safety as it relates to the development of the human heart are lacking. We used clinical data on ondansetron dosing strategies to determine relevant concentrations for heart organoid studies. We applied ondansetron at three different concentrations to heart organoids from day 9 until day 30 in the EMM2/1 strategy and noticed stark differences in beating behavior and gross morphology at day 30, with organoids in the 10 μM and 100 μM conditions exhibiting a marked decrease in beating frequency (Supplementary Movies 17–20). Due to ondansetron's chemistry as a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, the electrophysiological effects in this respect were expected. We then assessed organoid morphology for atrial and ventricular cells, using MYL7 and MYL2 markers respectively (Fig. 8a), at day 30. A clear dose-dependent reduction in MYL2 + ventricular cells was found when ondansetron was applied (Fig. 8a). We quantified these results and showed that MYL2 + area decreased to 0.55-fold and 0.18-fold in organoids in the 10 μM and 100 μM conditions, respectively, relative to Untreated organoids (Fig. 8b), while MYL7 + area remained unchanged across all conditions (Fig. 8c). Furthermore, organoids in the 100 μM condition also appeared to be structurally less organized with less defined chamber walls and loose chamber separation compared to Untreated. To support these results, we performed qRT-PCR on organoids in all conditions and show that MYL2 expression decreased to 0.58-fold and 0.40-fold in the 10 and 100 μM conditions, respectively, relative to Untreated (Fig. 8d). Together, these data suggest that ondansetron perturbs critical steps of ventricular heart development reminiscent of clinical phenotypes epidemiologically associated with its use, namely, ventricular septal defects.

### Getting through the day: a pilot qualitative study of U.S. women's experiences making decisions about anti-nausea medication during pregnancy [^112sLqpz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Pathways to prescription

While participants were selected into our focus group because they had all filled a prescription for anti-nausea medication, their pathways to getting a prescription varied. Women who participated in our study described experiencing nausea during their first trimester, during which time prenatal visits with providers occur less frequently than later in pregnancy. We learned that decision-making about taking anti-nausea medication began before being given a prescription as women made choices about scheduling early appointments to discuss nausea or ask for help in dealing with nausea. Several women visited a provider in the first trimester for nausea and vomiting and were offered a prescription. Some women requested a prescription as a result of the severity of their symptoms and/or recommendations from friends and family members. Providers often initially recommended non-prescription treatment options such as over the counter vitamin B12 (pyridoxine) with or without doxylamine and then provided a prescription for a medication if the initial treatment approach did not provide relief (in keeping with current clinical guidelines). The prescription medication women most often talked about using was ondansetron (brand name Zofran).

Focus Group 2, Participant 8: I asked my doctor [for the medication]. Back then, I was just worried all the time how my baby was going to survive, because I lost 15 pounds in a month.

Focus Group 2, Participant 6: I didn't even know to ask for the medicine until my friend who's a doctor and his wife had had twins. He suggested it.

Some of the participants did not discuss their nausea and vomiting with their providers because they thought their experience was a normal part of pregnancy. These women often did not get prescribed medication until later in their first trimester or when they ended up in the emergency department with dehydration.

Focus Group 2, Participant 10: I never mentioned my nausea to my provider originally because I assumed this is what everybody goes through. I ended up getting it prescribed at Urgent Care because it got to that point.

### Are all 5-HT ₃ receptor antagonists the same? [^112wmxZz]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists have become the cornerstone for preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Four 5-HT3 antagonists are commercially available in the United States, and numerous reports have been published comparing 2 or more agents. The studies ranged from randomized, double-blinded to open-label or retrospective trials; included chemotherapy-naïve and -non-naïve patients; and covered a range of doses and routes of administration with and without concomitant steroids, for preventing and treating nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy. With few exceptions, the studies uniformly show an equivalent efficacy rate and side effect profile among the various agents at equivalent doses. This article reviews the pharmacology of the class for insight into minor differences among the agents that could possibly influence drug selection for certain patients, and considers data on the absorption, half-life, metabolism, and receptor activity. Clinical trials support the claim of various guidelines that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are therapeutically similar in safety and efficacy, particularly because the current best practice for preventing nausea and vomiting after highly and moderately high emetogenic chemotherapy is a combination of a 5-HT3 antagonist, steroids, and aprepitant.

Motion sickness — pharmacologic countermeasures: Drugs are useful when habituation is impractical, such as single or infrequent journeys, and individuals should be advised that medication is most effective when taken before exposure rather than after symptom onset. Drug categories include antimuscarinics (e.g., scopolamine), antihistamines (e.g., dimenhydrinate), and sympathomimetics (e.g., amphetamine), and all effective agents penetrate the blood–brain barrier and act centrally. The newer "minimally sedating" antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine) are not effective for treatment of motion sickness, and amphetamine or combinations of amphetamine plus scopolamine (or promethazine) are not available due to legal and drug abuse reasons. Other antiemetics such as ondansetron and granisetron are not effective against motion sickness because their sites of action are not at the central vestibular centers of the brain. Cannabis and constituents such as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, but not cannabidiol (CBD), have shown anti-motion-sickness properties in animals, but controlled human trials are lacking so no firm recommendations can be made. All medications have side effects and possible specific contraindications, and the most common side effect is drowsiness or sedation.

### Apomorphine hydrochloride (Onapgo) [^114bpwfU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Information

ONAPGO is indicated for subcutaneous use by infusion only [see Warnings & Precautions (5.1)].
Patients selected for treatment with ONAPGO should be capable of understanding and trained on using the delivery system, either themselves or with the assistance of a caregiver [see Healthcare Provider Instructions for Use and Patient Instructions for Use].
ONAPGO initiation and dose titrations should be done under medical supervision.
The prescribed dose of ONAPGO should be expressed in "mg/hr" for the continuous dosage and "mg" for an extra dose.

2.2 Premedication and Concomitant Medication

Because of the incidence of nausea and vomiting with ONAPGO, it is recommended that treatment with trimethobenzamide 300 mg three times a day start 3 days prior to the initial dose of ONAPGO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Alternatively, consider starting ONAPGO therapy, without antiemetics, at 1 mg/hour and titrate based upon effectiveness and tolerance.

If trimethobenzamide is used, it should be continued only as long as necessary to control nausea and vomiting, and generally no longer than two months after initiation of treatment with ONAPGO, as trimethobenzamide increases the incidence of somnolence, dizziness, and falls in patients treated with ONAPGO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with drugs of the 5HT3antagonist class including antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron) and alosetron are contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

After starting ONAPGO, adjustment of concomitant anti-Parkinson's disease medications may be necessary.

### Consensus recommendations for the prevention of vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112DPBwz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

In this update of our 2005 document, we used an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents for the prevention of emesis and nausea following anticancer chemotherapies of high emetic risk. A three-drug combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor (5-HT(3)) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and aprepitant beginning before chemotherapy and continuing for up to 4 days remains the standard of care. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists. We conclude that, for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. In trials designed to prove the equivalence of palonosetron to ondansetron and granisetron, palonosetron proved superior in emesis prevention, while adverse effects were comparable. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration.

### Efficacy of perphenazine to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting: a quantitative systematic review [^112B2gZe]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

despite the introduction of newer antiemetics in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), perphenazine is recommended in current guidelines, as the concept of multimodal management of PONV in high-risk patients requires more than two drugs to be combined. The aim of this quantitative systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of perphenazine in the prophylaxis of PONV in adults and children.

Methods

randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of perphenazine in the prevention of PONV in comparison with any other drug or placebo were systematically searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. Dichotomous data on the efficacy and adverse effects were combined and relative risks (RRs) as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

eleven trials published between 1965 and 1999 including a total of 2081 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were further analysed. In children, perphenazine 0.07 mg kg was effective in preventing vomiting (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18–0.54), whereas in adults, a dose of about 5 mg was effective for the prevention of PONV (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37–0.67). When compared with established newer drugs, for example, ondansetron, dexamethasone or droperidol, no significant differences were observed in the pooled analysis with limited data. Reporting of adverse events was poor. Transient sedation was reported in three eligible trials (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.40–2.05).

Conclusion

there is evidence that perphenazine is effective in the prevention of PONV in children and adults without serious adverse effects compared with placebo.

### Benefit-risk assessment of off-label drug use in children: the bravo framework [^113FsTzT]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

TRADE‐OFFS: BALANCING BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ONDANSETRON

The assessment has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary editorial board of the DPF consisting of pediatricians, pharmacists, and clinical pharmacologists.

Benefits clinically relevant?

Improved efficacy of oral rehydration preventing hospital admission is considered clinically relevant. Drug therapy should only be considered if the child is at high risk for dehydration and oral rehydration is not successful.

Residual risks acceptable?

The multidisciplinary board discussed if pre‐emptive ECG testing is indicated for use in gastroenteritis. Daily practice is quite pragmatic: parents are asked for their family history of cardiac events and comedications. If negative, ondansetron is prescribed without ECG. Domperidone may also induce a prolonged QT interval. For domperidone, an ECG is only recommended when listed risk factors (hypokalemia/ poor renal function/ diabetes mellitus/ QT prolonging or comedication resulting in increased blood levels/ high doses/ pre‐existent prolonged QT time or long QT syndrome) are present. The same approach is considered acceptable to mitigate the risk of QT prolongation in ondansetron. Caution is needed in infants < 3 months old, as clinical monitoring of the drug effect is indicated.

Comparison with alternatives

Metoclopramide and domperidone are contraindicated due to the high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, especially in infants. Hence, domperidone and metoclopramide are still considered to be unsuitable. Ondansetron is considered a safer alternative.

Conclusion on balance

The benefits only outweigh the risks when oral rehydration therapy alone is insufficient and the child is at risk of dehydration. Ondansetron should not be used to treat nausea and vomiting symptoms without (imminent) dehydration.

### Beneficial adjunctive effects of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron on symptoms, function and cognition in early phase schizophrenia in a double-blind, 2 × 2 factorial design, randomised controlled comparison with simvastatin [^116wXvbm]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

We conducted a small, placebo-controlled, rater-blind 12-week pilot study adding ondansetron or simvastatin to TAU in 36 patients with chronic schizophrenia. Both agents were well tolerated with no serious side effects. In the present study, the primary prediction was that the addition of ondansetron and/or simvastatin to TAU would improve negative symptoms. Secondary outcomes were improvements in positive symptoms, social functioning and cognitive functions. A preliminary analysis of this study was published in abstract form reporting small positive effects of both drugs versus placebo on negative symptom ratings when given alone but not when given in combination. Here we present a full report together with our recent analyses revealing the mechanism of the negative interaction and the enhanced benefit of ondansetron in those with less than 5 years of drug treatment.

Table.
Scenario Analysis of Side-by-Side Estimated Incidences of PONV When the Consensus Guidelines Are Followed Versus the Proposed P-D-O Technique

We previouslyencouraged prospective, randomized research with OP8, especially in light of nonsedating benefits in the setting of ambulatory anesthesia fast-tracking and phase 1 PACU bypass, but (13 years after that recommendation) do not anticipate the costs of this research to be underwritten by industry sponsors due to its long-standing availability as a generic preparation, and the implications of a generic medication showing equal efficacy to branded medications. We have found OP8 useful as follows: (1) as a nonsedating antiemetic; (2) as a preventative measure similar to the antihistamine promethazineagainst ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects; and (3) as a safe single-dose drug (only 1.3 extrapyramidal events per 10,000 patients receiving 4–8 mg oral dose, with all events easily treated). We have published a case series/reviewand a randomized trialof emetic outcomes after the use of OP8 and dexamethasone, withor not necessarily withondansetron (ie, before ondansetron became available as a generic medication).

Additionally, we evaluated the efficacy of single-dose OP8 to a single 40 mg dose of aprepitant given preoperatively in colorectal surgery patients at our academic center within an enhanced recovery protocol, which was designed to mitigate opioid utilization, reduce PONV, and optimize patient recovery. In this retrospective study, no differences were noted in antiemetic requirement on postoperative days 0 and 1 between patients receiving OP8 versus aprepitant. In addition, when patients were matched for preoperative, procedural, and anesthesia characteristics, no differences were noted in late PONV between patients receiving OP8 versus aprepitant. As enhanced recovery protocols become more widespread and continue to be applied to other surgical specialties, effective PONV prevention is imperative for improving patient outcomes. OP8 deserves to be properly evaluated (by clinical study, and/or in routine clinical practice) as a part of a cost-effective multimodal enhanced recovery strategy.

As a reminder, metoclopramide should be considered contraindicated for perioperative use if perphenazine is used preoperatively, due to drug interaction risk. According to the Consensus Guideline, "Metoclopramide may be useful in institutions where other dopamine antagonists are not available, but otherwise may not be very efficacious".

5.3 Serotonin Syndrome

The development of serotonin syndrome has been reported with 5-HT3receptor antagonists alone. Most reports have been associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, mirtazapine, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, and intravenous methylene blue). Some of the reported cases were fatal. Serotonin syndrome occurring with overdose of ondansetron tablets alone has also been reported. The majority of reports of serotonin syndrome related to 5-HT3receptor antagonist use occurred in a post-anesthesia care unit or an infusion center.

Symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome may include the following combination of signs and symptoms: mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome, especially with concomitant use of ondansetron tablets and other serotonergic drugs. If symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur, discontinue ondansetron tablets and initiate supportive treatment. Patients should be informed of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome, especially if ondansetron tablets is used concomitantly with other serotonergic drugs [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Overdosage (10)].

5.4 Masking of Progressive Ileus and Gastric Distension

The use of ondansetron tablets in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and/or gastric distension. Monitor for decreased bowel activity, particularly in patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal obstruction.

Ondansetron tablets are not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis. It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^117BgFxg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Ondansetron — Ondansetron was the first 5-HT3 RA on the market and commonly used as the preferred antiemetic for PONV prophylaxis; the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recommended dose was 4 mg by slow IV injection or 16 mg of the oral formulation (oral disintegrating tablets, given 1 hour before induction). The IV drug has a mean elimination half-life of 3.1–5.8 hours in adults and is extensively metabolized by the liver, and CYP 2D6 ultrametabolizers are significantly more likely to develop PONV despite ondansetron prophylaxis. In a 2021 Cochrane network meta-analysis (NMA) on drugs for PONV prophylaxis in adults after general anesthesia, 585 randomized trials enrolling 97,516 patients were included to evaluate 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations, and ondansetron was the most investigated single drug followed by dexamethasone. Since the 2020 PONV Guideline, several studies have compared ondansetron 4 mg with dexamethasone 8 mg and concluded that ondansetron 4 mg is more effective for PONV prophylaxis; ondansetron 4 mg is comparable to prochlorperazine 10 mg for PONV prophylaxis, with a trend towards greater risk of side effects in the prochlorperazine group.

RISK TOLERANCE FOR THE USE OF ONDANSETRON FOR GASTROENTERITIS‐INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING

The assessment has been reviewed by the DPF's editorial board. The board concluded that in cases where prolonged nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea leads to (risk of) dehydration, drug treatment can be considered to prevent hospital admission and to improve the success rate of oral rehydration. Vomiting and diarrhea are uncomfortable symptoms for both the child and parent, but do not need treatment in general. Editorial board members do not have conflicts of interest (as author of any of the papers included or as consultant to pharmaceutical industry). Some board members are familiar with using ondansetron for gastroenteritis. QT prolongation is rare and not conceived as a frequent or serious problem in children in daily practice and is sufficiently covered by — pragmatically — assessing family history on cardiac events and other risk factors. Serious side effects are not observed. This may bias their opinion favoring the use of ondansetron. There is a relevant medical need to treat children in whom oral rehydration alone is not successful, in both university hospitals and regular pediatric clinics.

### Beneficial adjunctive effects of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron on symptoms, function and cognition in early phase schizophrenia in a double-blind, 2 × 2 factorial design, randomised controlled comparison with simvastatin [^115cQWQ7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study examined the potential benefits of two novel agents in the treatment of schizophrenia. Both drugs caused statistically significant but clinically unimportant reductions in negative symptoms, the primary outcome variable. Although it was hypothesised that the two agents could have additive effects, when taken in combination, their effects were lessened by the emergence of depressive symptoms and increased side effects. An exploratory analysis revealed a full spectrum of symptomatic, functional and cognitive improvement in patients with less than 5 years of treatment when exposed to ondansetron whether alone or in combination with simvastatin. However, the benefits of ondansetron were not clinically transformative in this stable population and although there might be greater benefit on persistent symptoms, the latter are best treated early with clozapine. We suggest that ondansetron might most usefully be evaluated in help-seeking patients with the prodromal at-risk mental state prior to the need for antipsychotic medication. Such patients have a broad range of perceptual, affective and cognitive symptoms, and functional impairment for which there is no indicated medical treatment and which we found benefitted from ondansetron, a well-tolerated and safe drug.

4.2 Recommendation 7. We conditionally recommend using serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron to abort symptoms of a CVS episode

Vote: 100% agreement

Ondansetron is a selective 5‐hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5‐HT 3) receptor antagonist. 67 It acts by blocking afferent 5‐HT 3 receptors on the vagus peripherally and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) of the area postrema within the medulla oblongata. These actions result in decreased circulating serotonin at the CTZ level, reducing symptoms of nausea and vomiting in affected patients. 67, 68 Ondansetron is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 and is excreted renally. 69

Despite its wide use in CVS, there is a lack of clinical trials of 5‐HT 3 antagonists in this condition. However, there are ample data demonstrating the efficacy of these agents in CINV and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in treating acute, delayed, and anticipatory nausea and vomiting. 70, 71 Studies indicate that ondansetron is as effective as other 5‐HT 3 receptor antagonists in the treatment of CINV. 72

The committee recommends ondansetron as a first‐line agent in aborting an episode of CVS. Based on clinical experience, combining 5‐HT 3 receptor antagonists with other abortive agents such as anxiolytics and phenothiazines for sedation may be more effective in aborting an episode than monotherapy. We note that there is a wide variability of responses with a few patients having a complete abortive response while the majority experience attenuation but not cessation of the episode. Adverse effects are uncommon and may include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, diarrhea, constipation, and infrequently extrapyramidal reactions. 73 A baseline EKG to check for QTc prolongation is recommended in adults prior to initiating this medication. We recommend using 8 mg of ondansetron as a sublingual preparation or rectally (reformulated) at the onset of the prodrome in combination with other abortive medications like triptans, and anxiolytics to abort an episode of CVS. The oral route should be avoided as patients are usually unable to tolerate oral preparations during an episode and also due to the unpredictable absorption of medications during an episode of vomiting.

### Ondansetron has similar clinical efficacy against both nausea and vomiting [^114MyZ6G]. Anaesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Ondansetron is widely believed to prevent postoperative vomiting more effectively than nausea. We analysed data from 5161 patients undergoing general anaesthesia who were randomly stratified to receive a combination of six interventions, one of which was 4 mg ondansetron vs placebo. For the purpose of this study a 20% difference in the relative risks for the two outcomes was considered clinically relevant. Nausea was reduced from 38% (969/2585) in the control to 28% (715/2576) in the ondansetron group, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.74, or a relative risk reduction of 26%. Vomiting was reduced from 17% (441/2585) to 11% (293/2576), corresponding to a relative risk of 0.67, or a relative risk reduction of 33%. The relative risks of 0.67 and 0.74 were clinically similar and the difference between them did not reach statistical significance. We thus conclude that ondansetron prevents postoperative nausea and postoperative vomiting equally well.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ondansetron, metoclopramide, and promethazine in adults [^111rDwkY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of the study was to assess whether ondansetron has superior nausea reduction compared with metoclopramide, promethazine, or saline placebo in emergency department (ED) adults.

Methods

This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded superiority trial was intended to enroll a convenience sample of 600 patients. Nausea was evaluated on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) at baseline and 30 minutes after treatment. Patients with a minimum preenrollment VAS of 40 mm were randomized to intravenous ondansetron 4 mg, metoclopramide 10 mg, promethazine 12.5 mg, or saline placebo. A 12-mm VAS improvement in nausea severity was deemed clinically important. We measured potential drug adverse effects at baseline and 30 minutes. Patients received approximately 500 mL of saline hydration during the initial 30 minutes.

Results

Of 180 subjects who consented, 163 completed the study. The median age was 32 years (interquartile range, 23–47), and 68% were female. The median 30-minute VAS reductions (95% confidence intervals) and saline volume given for ondansetron, metoclopramide, promethazine, and saline were -22 (-32 to -15), -30 (-38 to -25.5), -29 (-40 to -21), and -16 (-25 to -3), and 500, 500, 500, and 450, respectively. The median 30-minute VAS differences (95% confidence intervals) between ondansetron and metoclopramide, promethazine, and saline were -8 (-18.5 to 3), -7 (-21 to -5.5), and 6 (-7 to 20), respectively. We compared the antiemetic efficacy across all treatments with the Kruskal-Wallis test (P = 0.16).

Conclusions

Our study shows no evidence that ondansetron is superior to metoclopramide and promethazine in reducing nausea in ED adults. Early study termination may have limited detection of ondansetron's superior nausea reduction over saline.

### No more than necessary: safety and efficacy of low-dose promethazine [^111rGENn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Limitations in antiemetic options have resulted in increased use of intravenous promethazine. However, this drug has significant sedative effects with its standard dosage of 25 mg, especially when used in conjunction with narcotic analgesics. While studies have revealed the bioavailability of enteric promethazine to be 25%, current dosing references suggest identical dosing regardless of the route of administration.

Objective

To compare the antiemetic efficacy and sedative effects of low-dose intravenous promethazine (6.25 or 12.5 mg) with intravenous ondansetron 4 mg.

Methods

We assessed inpatients with noncritical conditions at Anne Arundel Medical Center who were treated for nausea or vomiting from any cause except chemotherapy or pregnancy. Forty-six patients received low-dose promethazine and 41 received ondansetron. Statistical analysis was carried out for significant differences in efficacy and sedation.

Results

For patients who received intravenous promethazine 6.25 or 12.5 mg, nausea and vomiting were relieved at one hour in 74% and 68%, respectively, compared with 59% for intravenous ondansetron 4 mg. Results at 3 hours were 67% and 80% for promethazine and 71% for ondansetron. Median sedation scores at one hour were equal at 3 for promethazine and ondansetron (4 = fully awake); at 3 hours, the median scores were 4 and 3.5, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences among any of these results.

Conclusions

Low-dose (6.25 mg) intravenous promethazine relieves nausea and vomiting as effectively as intravenous ondansetron 4 mg.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 189: nausea and vomiting of pregnancy [^116ZkN6i]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) — comparative efficacy, safety, dosing limits, and pregnancy risk are described as follows: randomized trials reported that intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide had similar efficacy with fewer adverse symptoms at 24 hours on ondansetron, oral ondansetron was better at controlling vomiting with similar nausea control, and ondansetron was more effective than doxylamine plus vitamin B6 in a small double-blind RCT of 36 women. Common adverse effects include headache, drowsiness, fatigue, and constipation, and ondansetron can prolong the QT interval. In December 2012, the FDA removed the 32-mg single intravenous dose because of QT prolongation leading to torsade de pointes, and recommends ondansetron not be given intravenously in doses greater than 16 mg; electrolyte and electrocardiogram monitoring are recommended for patients with arrhythmia risk factors. There are insufficient fetal safety data; a possible first-trimester association with cleft palate has limited evidence, and a systematic review found eight studies with a small increase in cardiac defects in two studies (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI; 1.3–3.1 and OR, 1.62; 95% CI; 1.04–2.14) but no increase in overall malformations. Women should be counseled regarding the available data, and the use of ondansetron before 10 weeks of gestation should be individualized weighing the risks and benefits.

### Consensus proposals for the prevention of acute and delayed vomiting and nausea following high-emetic-risk chemotherapy [^112f6GBS]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

This paper uses an evidence-based approach whenever possible to formulate recommendations, emphasizing the results of controlled trials concerning the best use of antiemetic agents. We address issues of dose, schedule, and route of administration of five selective 5-HT(3) antagonists. We conclude that for each of these five drugs, there is a plateau in therapeutic efficacy above which further dose escalation does not improve outcome. Furthermore, for all classes of antiemetic agents, a single dose is as effective as multiple doses or a continuous infusion. The oral route is as efficacious as the intravenous route of administration, even with chemotherapy of high emetic risk. Selective antagonists of the type 3 serotonin receptor (5-HT(3)) in combination with dexamethasone and aprepitant are the standard of care for the prevention of emesis following chemotherapy of high emetic risk.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^1123wASS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) multi-drug prophylaxis beyond two agents: Since then, there have been several studies that introduced a third or a fourth antiemetic and demonstrated clinical benefits. Aprepitant 40 mg PO before surgery as a fourth prophylactic intervention (in addition to ondansetron, dexamethasone and propofol TIVA) significantly reduced the incidence of PONV. Olanzapine 10 mg PO before surgery in addition to ondansetron 8 mg and dexamethasone 8 mg also resulted in lower PONV incidence. Haloperidol in addition to ondansetron and dexamethasone was more effective than promethazine plus ondansetron and dexamethasone. In an RCT of patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, patients received ondansetron plus dexamethasone, with or without aprepitant 80 mg, scopolamine patch, and propofol TIVA. The combination of the 5 antiemetic interventions resulted in significantly lower PONV severity, but it is not clear whether the three additional interventions all contributed to the clinical benefit. More research is required on the efficacy of adding a third or fourth antiemetic in high-risk patients. Since the last consensus guideline, there has been an exponential increase in the number of different antiemetic combinations reported within the literature; however, not all combination antiemetic studies adequately addressed the question of whether the additional antiemetic led to clinical benefit, and they offer limited insight into the efficacy of the additional antiemetic.

### Beneficial effects of ondansetron as an adjunct to haloperidol for chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^11275jkS]. Schizophrenia Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies suggest that the serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist ondansetron possesses the therapeutic potential for schizophrenia. This study was designed to determine whether ondansetron as an adjunct to haloperidol could enhance the clinical efficacy and reduce the adverse side effects in chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Methods

Under double-blind, randomized conditions, 121 treatment-resistant inpatients with chronic DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia received haloperidol (4–30 mg/day) combined with either placebo (N = 63) or a fixed dose of 8 mg/day of ondansetron (N = 58) for 12 weeks. Efficacy was defined as the change from baseline to endpoint in score on overall scale and subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S). Side effects were evaluated using the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale.

Results

Ondansetron combined with haloperidol produced a significantly greater improvement on PANSS overall scale and subscales for negative symptoms, general psychopathology, and cognition at endpoint compared to placebo with haloperidol, but no between-treatment group difference was observed on the subscale for positive symptoms and CGI-S. The ondansetron-treated group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a 30% or greater baseline-to-endpoint reduction in PANSS total score than placebo. Patients in adjunctive ondansetron therapy also experienced significantly lower incidence and severity of parkinsonism and akathisia as well as fewer behavioral hyperactivity, cardiac, and gastrointestinal side effects.

Conclusions

Ondansetron is an effective adjunctive agent in enhancing the effectiveness and reducing some adverse side effects of antipsychotic therapy for chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, particularly for negative and cognitive symptoms.

Before the advent of the 5HT 3 antagonists, nausea and vomiting were ranked as the two most distressing side effects of systemic chemotherapy. The use of 5HT 3 antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron) has provided complete acute emesis protection in 50–70% of patients receiving a first cycle of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The addition of dexamethasone to 5HT 3 antagonists has improved the complete protection rate by a further 10–15%, resulting in a total complete acute emesis protection in 65–80% of patients.

### Antiemetic guidelines: creating a more practical treatment approach [^114LmNLR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Antiemetic guidelines from a variety of professional organizations have been available for several years. It is unclear just how often these guidelines have been used, however; data indicate that some practitioners still do not treat their patients according to the recommendations. Some of those involved in the creation of the original guidelines convened to try to create a simpler, more practical approach to the use of antiemetics in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The group's intention was to clarify available guidelines and produce a practical document, based on evidence, that could be used in everyday practice. The group created four consensus statements that would serve as a basis for their recommendations. One primary strategy used was to have chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting viewed as a single process that can occur throughout a treatment cycle, and not so much as an acute and a delayed process, as is usual in clinical trials. Patients' management should be considered over a 4- to 5-day period, rather than primarily dealing with the day of treatment only. The group created three tables: emetic risk of chemotherapy; treatment options based on emetic category; and antiemetic dosing recommendations. Use of these tables should make appropriate antiemetic selection more straightforward and easier for the practitioner in an everyday setting. Although this document alone may not solve all the challenges with appropriate antiemetic management, it will hopefully prove to be a step in the right direction.
