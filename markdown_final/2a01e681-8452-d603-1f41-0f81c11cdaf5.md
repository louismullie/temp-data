## Question

Do Litterature review on pharmacologic PDA closure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a literature review on pharmacologic PDA closure in preterm infants. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and why pharmacologic closure is controversial. Then, I should appraise the evidence hierarchy and extract PICO elements. Next, I will review prophylactic strategies, followed by treatment of symptomatic PDA, including head-to-head comparisons and dose/route nuances. After that, I should examine acetaminophen as an alternative and combination therapy. I will then consider invasive options and conservative management, including fluid restriction. Finally, I will synthesize the strength of evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and translate this into practical, risk-stratified recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why this remains contentious. Persistent PDA in preterm infants is common and associated with pulmonary overcirculation, systemic hypoperfusion, and major morbidities such as BPD, IVH, NEC, and mortality, yet multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses have failed to show that pharmacologic closure improves hard outcomes, creating a persistent evidence-practice gap and fueling calls for more selective, risk-based approaches rather than routine treatment of all PDAs [^ddf40815] [^cd7939e8] [^7302a71a].

> I need to check the evidence hierarchy and frame the PICO precisely. The highest-quality evidence comes from Cochrane systematic reviews and meta-analyses, followed by large RCTs and network meta-analyses, with observational studies providing hypothesis-generating signals; the PICO is preterm infants (< 37 weeks or < 2500 g) with PDA, comparing pharmacologic closure (indomethacin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) versus placebo/no treatment or each other, with outcomes including ductal closure, mortality, BPD, IVH, NEC, and need for surgical ligation [^5ff784ff] [^eb0097be] [^27f3f8dd].

> Now, let me review prophylactic strategies, and I should double-check the magnitude and certainty of benefits. Prophylactic indomethacin within 24 hours reduces severe IVH and the need for surgical ligation but does not improve death or neurodevelopmental disability, and it increases oliguria; prophylactic ibuprofen reduces PDA incidence and need for ligation and may marginally reduce severe IVH, but again without improving mortality or neurodevelopment, and it increases oliguria and GI hemorrhage, so routine prophylaxis is not recommended outside of research or highly selected contexts [^5ff784ff] [^79c236eb] [^99f1a154].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating symptomatic PDA; I should verify closure rates and clinical outcomes separately. High-certainty evidence shows indomethacin and moderate-certainty evidence shows ibuprofen increase ductal closure compared with placebo, with indomethacin achieving roughly 70–80% closure and ibuprofen around 60–70% in pooled analyses; however, these closure benefits have not translated into consistent reductions in mortality, BPD, IVH, or NEC in RCTs, likely due to heterogeneity of PDA definitions, crossover in controls, and inclusion of infants with low-risk PDAs that close spontaneously [^d6db5b39] [^27f3f8dd] [^eb0097be] [^cd7939e8].

> Wait, let me verify head-to-head comparisons and dose/route nuances because these often change practice even when outcomes are equivocal. Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin for closure but is associated with less oliguria and less NEC, supporting ibuprofen as the preferred first-line NSAID when treatment is indicated; oral ibuprofen appears more effective than IV ibuprofen for closure, and high-dose oral ibuprofen outperforms standard-dose IV regimens, though optimal dosing in extremely preterm infants remains uncertain and warrants caution given renal and GI risks [^27f3f8dd] [^eb0097be] [^ed741468].

> I should confirm acetaminophen's role and not overstate its equivalence. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests acetaminophen has closure rates similar to ibuprofen and indomethacin in many studies, with a favorable renal profile, but concerns persist about pulmonary toxicity in extremely preterm infants due to CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress; thus, acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative when NSAIDs are contraindicated or as rescue, yet high-quality, adequately powered trials in ELBW infants are still needed before routine first-line use [^ff6e7d13] [^e7f60849] [^164b04ce].

> Let me consider combination therapy, and I need to ensure I don't extrapolate beyond limited data. The rationale for ibuprofen plus acetaminophen is additive prostaglandin inhibition via COX and alternative pathways, and small RCTs and observational studies suggest higher closure rates than monotherapy in some cohorts, particularly ELGANs; however, evidence quality is low and there is no demonstrated outcome benefit yet, so combination therapy should remain investigational pending larger, rigorously designed trials [^24479a1d] [^ff6e7d13].

> Next, I should review invasive options and conservative management, and I must be careful to distinguish feasibility from benefit. Surgical ligation achieves high immediate closure but is associated with increased pneumothorax, ROP, and neurodevelopmental impairment in observational datasets; transcatheter occlusion is increasingly feasible in infants under 4 kg with improving devices and outcomes, yet randomized data comparing it with medical or surgical strategies are sparse, so patient selection and center expertise are critical while we await definitive trials [^871e31db] [^e7e51df6] [^5e3e6912].

> I will now examine conservative management and fluid restriction, and I should double-check whether any RCTs exist. Expectant management is increasingly adopted given high spontaneous closure rates and the lack of outcome benefit from routine pharmacotherapy; however, a Cochrane review found no completed RCTs evaluating fluid restriction specifically for symptomatic PDA, so while fluid restriction is commonly used, its efficacy and safety in this context remain unproven and should be individualized [^ac3eab50] [^ddf40815].

> But wait, what if timing is the key modifier of benefit; I should review early versus expectant strategies. Early or very early pharmacologic treatment within 7 days, including within 72 hours, has not reduced mortality, BPD, IVH, or NEC compared with expectant management in pooled RCTs, and may increase NSAID exposure without clear benefit; a large, high-quality NEJM RCT of early targeted ibuprofen in extreme preterms likewise showed no reduction in death or moderate/severe BPD, reinforcing that routine early treatment is not justified outside trials [^4ffab5a3] [^e68123fc].

> Let me synthesize the strength of evidence and be explicit about certainty. High-certainty evidence supports pharmacologic closure of symptomatic PDA with indomethacin and moderate-certainty evidence supports ibuprofen, but the certainty that closure improves patient-important outcomes is low to very low due to imprecision, inconsistency, and risk of bias; thus, the net clinical benefit of routine pharmacologic closure remains unproven, and shared decision-making with families is essential when considering therapy [^5ff784ff] [^cd7939e8] [^eb0097be].

> I should identify knowledge gaps and future directions, and I need to ensure they are actionable. Key gaps include validated, early risk stratification tools to identify infants most likely to benefit from closure, standardized echocardiographic criteria for hemodynamic significance, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies to optimize dosing in ELGANs, and adequately powered RCTs targeting high-risk phenotypes and using minimal crossover; emerging signals from observational risk-stratified approaches are hypothesis-generating but require prospective validation [^f77f4764] [^0c8503ae] [^4ec0e01a].

> Finally, I will translate this into practical recommendations, and I should confirm each point against the evidence. For prophylaxis, do not routinely use indomethacin or ibuprofen unless part of a protocolized approach for IVH prevention in extremely preterm infants, given lack of long-term benefit and adverse effects; for symptomatic PDA, consider pharmacologic closure when there is clear hemodynamic compromise or evolving organ dysfunction, prefer ibuprofen over indomethacin when treating, consider acetaminophen when NSAIDs are contraindicated or as rescue, avoid prolonged indomethacin courses due to increased NEC, and reserve invasive closure for refractory cases or when medical therapy is contraindicated; throughout, integrate conservative support and reassess frequently for spontaneous closure to avoid overtreatment [^5ff784ff] [^27f3f8dd] [^1c5dfc51] [^5e3e6912] [^ac3eab50].

Pharmacologic PDA closure in preterm infants is primarily achieved with **NSAIDs** (indomethacin, ibuprofen) and **acetaminophen**, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis to promote ductal constriction [^ed741468] [^164b04ce]. NSAIDs are **first-line** due to robust efficacy, with indomethacin and ibuprofen achieving closure rates of 70–80% [^eb0097be] and 67–75%, respectively [^eb0097be] [^27f3f8dd]. Ibuprofen is preferred over indomethacin because it has fewer renal and gastrointestinal side effects [^27f3f8dd] [^5ff784ff]. Acetaminophen is a **reasonable alternative** when NSAIDs are contraindicated or fail, with similar closure rates and a favorable safety profile [^ff6e7d13] [^164b04ce]. Early treatment does not consistently improve long-term outcomes, so management should be individualized based on hemodynamic significance and patient factors [^4ffab5a3] [^e68123fc] [^ddf40815].

## Pharmacologic agents for PDA closure

Key characteristics of NSAIDs and acetaminophen:

| **Aspect** | **Indomethacin** | **Ibuprofen** | **Acetaminophen** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Non-selective COX inhibitor reducing prostaglandin E2, promoting ductal constriction [^d6db5b39] | Non-selective COX inhibitor with similar efficacy and fewer side effects than indomethacin [^27f3f8dd] | Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis via COX-2 and peroxidase pathways; alternative when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^164b04ce] |
| Efficacy | Closure rates of 70–80% after one course [^notfound] | Closure rates of 67–75% [^eb0097be]; oral ibuprofen may be more effective than IV [^eb0097be] | Similar closure rates to ibuprofen in RCTs and meta-analyses [^ff6e7d13] [^eb0097be] |
| Safety profile | Renal impairment, oliguria, GI bleeding, and NEC are concerns [^d6db5b39] | Lower risk of renal impairment and GI bleeding vs indomethacin [^27f3f8dd]; transient renal effects may occur [^27f3f8dd] | Favorable safety; hepatotoxicity is rare at therapeutic doses; pulmonary toxicity remains theoretical [^e7f60849] [^164b04ce] |
| Clinical considerations | First-line in many settings; monitor renal function and bleeding [^d6db5b39] | Preferred first-line due to better safety; monitor renal function [^27f3f8dd] | Useful when NSAIDs are contraindicated or fail; monitor liver function with prolonged use [^ff6e7d13] |

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety

- **Indomethacin vs ibuprofen**: Similar closure rates, but ibuprofen has fewer renal and GI side effects [^27f3f8dd] [^5ff784ff].
- **Ibuprofen vs acetaminophen**: Similar closure rates; acetaminophen has fewer renal and GI effects but theoretical pulmonary risks in ELBW infants [^ff6e7d13] [^e7f60849].
- **Combination therapy**: Ibuprofen plus acetaminophen may increase closure rates in refractory cases, but evidence is limited [^24479a1d] [^ff6e7d13].

---

## Timing and duration of therapy

Early treatment within the first week of life increases closure rates but **does not consistently improve long-term outcomes** (BPD, mortality, neurodevelopment) [^4ffab5a3] [^e68123fc]. Standard courses are typically 3 doses for indomethacin or ibuprofen, with a second course considered if the ductus remains patent [^27f3f8dd]. Prolonged indomethacin courses increase NEC risk without added benefit and are not recommended [^1c5dfc51].

---

## Clinical outcomes and long-term consequences

Pharmacologic closure reduces pulmonary hemorrhage and the need for surgical ligation but **does not consistently reduce BPD, mortality, or neurodevelopmental impairment** [^5ff784ff] [^e68123fc]. Persistent PDA is associated with increased risks of BPD, IVH, NEC, and mortality, but causality remains debated [^825d02ef] [^7302a71a].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **individualized management** based on hemodynamic significance, gestational age, and comorbidities [^f01f1706]. Routine prophylactic closure is not recommended; treat symptomatic or hemodynamically significant PDAs, and consider acetaminophen when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^f01f1706] [^ff6e7d13]. Close monitoring for adverse effects is essential during therapy [^27f3f8dd].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Lack of long-term benefit**: Despite high closure rates, long-term outcomes often do not improve [^5ff784ff] [^e68123fc].
- **Heterogeneity of studies**: Variability in definitions, timing, and populations limits comparability [^cd7939e8].
- **Overtreatment**: Many PDAs close spontaneously, raising concerns about unnecessary interventions [^825d02ef] [^7302a71a].

---

## Future directions and ongoing research

- **Risk stratification**: Developing tools to identify infants most likely to benefit from closure [^f77f4764] [^0c8503ae].
- **Combination therapy**: Larger RCTs to evaluate ibuprofen plus acetaminophen [^24479a1d].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Studies focusing on neurodevelopmental and respiratory outcomes [^4ffab5a3] [^e68123fc].

---

Pharmacologic PDA closure is effective for ductal closure, but **long-term benefits remain uncertain**. Ibuprofen is preferred for its safety, acetaminophen is a viable alternative, and therapy should be individualized based on hemodynamic significance and patient factors [^27f3f8dd] [^ff6e7d13] [^ddf40815].

### Patent ductus arteriosus in the preterm infant: to treat or not to treat? [^fbdb95f7]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacological and/or surgical closure of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the very preterm infant has been the standard of care over the past few decades. However, the rationale for closure of PDA has recently been challenged. In this article, the factors that have fueled the controversy of the approach to the management of PDA and the gap in our knowledge are reviewed in detail. In addition, the pros and cons of the different treatment strategies applied in clinical care are evaluated with a focus on discussing the available evidence in the literature.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: to treat or not to treat? [^7302a71a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus in the preterm infant is associated with numerous morbidities, including higher rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and increased mortality. These strong associations have led to widespread use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors and surgical ligation to achieve ductal closure in the expectation that closing the ductus will reduce these complications. Each of these interventions has its own associated adverse effects. Neither individual randomised controlled trials nor meta-analyses of those trials have been able to demonstrate long-term benefits of these treatments despite their efficacy in inducing ductal closure and reducing the need for ductal ligation. Despite the potential shortcomings of those trials, they provide substantial cumulative evidence that early, routine treatment to close a persistently patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants does not improve outcomes and should therefore be abandoned. Future trials of these interventions for patent ductus management should address different questions. Persistence of ductal patency should be considered a sign of rather than a direct cause of the several morbidities with which it is clearly associated. Practitioners should tolerate ductal patency and learn to manage its causes and consequences rather than focusing on achievement of ductal closure.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: are current neonatal treatment options better or worse than no treatment at all? [^2c531e2b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Although a moderate-sized patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) needs to be closed by the time a child is 1–2 years old, there is great uncertainty about whether it needs to be closed during the neonatal period. Although 95% of neonatologists believe that a moderate-sized PDA should be closed if it persists in infants (born before 28 weeks) who still require mechanical ventilation, the number of neonatologists who treat a PDA when it occurs in infants who do not require mechanical ventilation varies widely. Both the high likelihood of spontaneous ductus closure and the absence of randomized controlled trials, specifically addressing the risks and benefits of neonatal ductus closure, add to the current uncertainty. New information suggests that early pharmacologic treatment has several important short-term benefits for the preterm newborn. By contrast, ductus ligation, while eliminating the detrimental effects of a PDA on lung development, may create its own set of morbidities that counteract many of the benefits derived from ductus closure.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates [^ddf40815]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) poses a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for clinicians. Diagnosis of persistent PDA and determination of its clinical and hemodynamic significance are challenging. Although the condition has been associated with substantial neonatal morbidities such as intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis, most therapeutic approaches have failed to show improvement in these outcomes. As such, clinicians have tended toward conservative management strategies; however, the benefits and risks of such an approach are unclear. In this review, we explore various clinical diagnostic modalities, echocardiographic parameters for assessment of shunt presence, shunt volume and its effect on cardiovascular and hemodynamic status, and challenges in determining if a PDA is hemodynamically significant and clinically relevant. From the therapeutic aspect, we review current evidence on conservative, pharmacological, and mechanical (surgical or nonsurgical ligation) approaches to PDA closure. Dose, route, duration, and comparison of pharmacological strategies are reviewed, with implications for future research.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for patent ductus arteriosus: rationale and evidence [^24479a1d]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

While cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been the most common medications used to facilitate earlier closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, adverse effects and low efficacy in extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs) have highlighted a need for alternative options. Combination therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen is a novel strategy for PDA treatment in ELGANs, as it may facilitate higher ductal closure rates via additive action on two separate pathways inhibiting prostaglandin production. Initial small observational studies and pilot randomized clinical trials indicate potentially higher efficacy of the combination regime to induce ductal closure in comparison to treatment with ibuprofen alone. In this review, we examine the potential clinical impact of treatment failure in ELGANs with significant PDA, highlight the biological rationale in support of studying combination therapy, and review the randomized and non-randomized studies to date. With the rising number of ELGANs receiving neonatal intensive care, who are vulnerable to PDA-related morbidities, there is an urgent need for adequately powered clinical trials to systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy for PDA treatment.

### Nonintervention vs oral ibuprofen for patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants… [^938ed51b]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

anti-inflammatory drugs are known to accelerate PDA closure, they have remained ineffective in improving mortality, long-term respiratory outcomes, or neurodevelopment, irrespective of the NSAIDs used. 1, 4–18 Multicenter cohort studies have reported substantial decreases in the rates of medical and surgical treatments of PDA in very low-birth-weight infants. 19–22 However, it is unclear whether the conservative nonintervention approaches for PDA are associated with reduced BPD or death in preterm infants. 11, 14, 19–21, 23–27. Regarding the hemodynamically significant PDA outcome, although the ductal closure rate at 1 week after randomization was significantly higher in the oral ibuprofen group than in the nonintervention group among infants with GA 27 to 30 weeks, this result was not observed for those with GA 23 to 26 weeks; 62 infants in the oral ibuprofen group and 59 infants in the nonintervention groups underwent PDA closure before hospital discharge. As prolonged exposure to hemodynamically significant PDA for more than 7 to 13 days increases the incidence of BPD or death in very preterm infants, 35 our results of nonsignificant reduction in BPD or death with oral ibuprofen compared with nonintervention might be attributable to the low therapeutic efficacy of oral ibuprofen for closing PDA, leading to no substantial difference in the duration of exposure to hemodynamically significant PDA between the groups. However, our data showed that 89% and 82% PDA closure rates at hospital discharge with limited or no backup treatment in the oral ibuprofen and nonintervention groups, respectively, were relatively higher than the previously known overall PDA closure rate of 67% after NSAID treatment in preterm infants. 36 In.

contrast to our trial, the PDA-TOLERATE randomized clinical trial showed the rates of ligation or persistent PDA at discharge as 32% and 39% in the early-rescue and conservative treatment groups, respectively. 4 Furthermore, our data of 44% and 50% BPD or death rates in the nonintervention and oral ibuprofen groups, respectively, were lower than those in the PDA-TOLERATE trial.

### Patent ductus arteriosus, its treatments, and the risks of pulmonary morbidity [^7c156f6b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of hydrostatic fluid filtration into the lung's interstitium, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure leads to improved alveolarization and minimizes the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although routine prophylactic treatment of a PDA on the day of birth does not appear to offer any more protection against BPD than delaying treatment for 2–3 days, recent evidence from quality improvement trials suggests that early pharmacologic treatment decreases the incidence of BPD compared with a treatment approach that exposes infants to a moderate-to-large PDA shunt for the first 7–10 days after birth. After the first week, routine pharmacologic treatment (compared with continued PDA exposure) no longer appears to alter the course of BPD development. Evidence from epidemiologic, preclinical, and randomized controlled trials demonstrate that early ductus ligation is an independent risk factor for the development of BPD.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: lack of evidence for common treatments [^eb3967a0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2007). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common diagnosis among extremely premature infants, especially in those with lung disease. Treatments are often used to close the PDA. Despite nearly three decades of research, the question of whether the benefits of treatments to prevent ductal patency or promote closure outweigh the risks of these treatments remains unanswered. The authors rarely use treatments designed to close the PDA. This article reviews three considerations in support of this restrained approach: rates of spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus; adverse effect of persistent ductal patency; and benefits and risks of treatments for closure.

### Treatment of persistent patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: time to accept the null hypothesis? [^3ff8b2dd]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Medical and surgical interventions are widely used to close a persistently patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. Objective evidence to support these practices is lacking, causing some to question their usage. Emerging evidence suggests that treatments that close the patent ductus may be detrimental. This review examines the history of and evidence underlying these treatments. Neither individual trials, pooled data from groups of randomized-controlled trials, nor critical examination of the immediate consequences of treatment provide evidence that medical or surgical closure of the ductus is beneficial in preterm infants. These conclusions are supported by sufficient evidence. Neither continued routine use of these treatments nor additional clinical trials using similar designs seems to be justified. A definitive trial, comparing current standard management with novel strategies not primarily intended to achieve ductal closure, may be necessary to resolve doubts regarding the quality or conduct of prior studies.

### Percutaneous closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in very-low-weight infants [^7a93b897]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

In view of the known complications of drug therapy and open surgical ligation, and the potential for prolonged patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exposure to be harmful, health care practitioners have sought new approaches to achieve definitive ductal closure. Interest in percutaneous (catheter-based) PDA closure has emerged within the neonatal community as a viable treatment option, because it has been fueled by recent procedural and device modifications, as well as mounting feasibility and safety data. Herein, we provide a contemporary review of percutaneous PDA closure among infants at the crux of the medical debate-very-low-weight infants (≤ 1,500 g), including: 1) characterization of traditional PDA treatments (drug therapy, open surgical ligation) and conservative (nonintervention) management options; 2) a general overview of the major procedural steps of percutaneous ductal closure, including efforts to reduce thrombotic complications and the emergence of a novel US Food and Drug Administration-approved device; 3) a systematic review and meta-analysis to better understand risk profiles of percutaneous PDA closure in this population; and 4) discussion of current gaps in our understanding of optimal PDA care, including the critical need for well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials.

### Catheter-based closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in lower weight infants [^8e083156]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Risks associated with drug therapy and surgical ligation have led health care providers to consider alternative strategies for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure. Catheter-based PDA closure is the procedure of choice for ductal closure in adults, children, and infants ≥ 6kg. Given evidence among older counterparts, interest in catheter-based closure of the PDA in lower weight (< 6kg) infants is growing. Among these smaller infants, the goals of this review are to: (1) provide an overview of the procedure; (2) review the types of PDA closure devices; (3) review the technical success (feasibility); (4) review the risks (safety profile); (5) discuss the quality of evidence on procedural efficacy; (6) consider areas for future research. The review provided herein suggests that catheter-based PDA closure is technically feasible, but the lack of comparative trials precludes determination of the optimal strategy for ductal closure in this subgroup of infants.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: time to grasp the nettle? [^02585493]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2013). Low credibility.

The management of patent ductus arteriosus is controversial, and there are diverse approaches to treatment, ranging from very conservative management through to early and aggressive securing of ductus closure, either pharmacologically or surgically. This lack of consensus on best management reflects a paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials, with many published studies focusing on establishing points of treatment, rather than looking for benefits of intervention over more conservative management. Despite this lack of good evidence views on ductus management can be entrenched, with accompanying loss of equipoise. This review looks at our current situation with regard to ductus arteriosus management and the need for good quality trials especially in the light of other published studies, concerning postnatal steroids, caffeine and oxygen which have demonstrated unexpected benefits - or sometimes unexpected harm - from long-familiar drugs.

### Current approaches to the patent ductus arteriosus: implications for pulmonary morbidities [^fa0910cf]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

The natural closure of the ductus arteriosus is often delayed in premature newborns, especially in the most immature ones, and a significant left-to-right shunt volume raises concerns about pulmonary overcirculation, steal of systemic blood flow, and its potential contribution to neonatal respiratory morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Extremely low gestational age and long duration of mechanical ventilation may influence the relationship between the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and BPD. Decades of research has employed various pharmacologic approaches including NSAIDs and acetaminophen administered based on diverse criteria and using various timing, dose, and route combinations. Unfortunately, none of these interventions has consistently demonstrated meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes. Instead, these treatments inconsistently achieve PDA closure or restriction of flow through the ductus and are often associated with adverse effects. Thus, the lack of clear benefit from available treatments, coupled with the potential for harm, has prompted many centers to adopt conservative or expectant management of the PDA while awaiting novel strategies that could offer improved efficacy and safety. This review explores the associations between PDA and pulmonary outcomes of prematurity, reflecting on past research and outlining potential future directions.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^cd7939e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

With respect to treatment of asymptomatic or symptomatic PDA, the availability of RCT evidence is substantially variable, depending on the intervention used. Overall, RCT evidence consistently demonstrates that the use of prostaglandin inhibitor drugs is effective in closing a PDA. Despite effective PDA closure, current evidence fails to demonstrate a benefit of prostaglandin inhibitor drugs for patient‐important clinical outcomes, such as need for invasive PDA closure, CLD, or mortality. However, several study limitations prevent us from drawing firm conclusions on the lack of efficacy of the prostaglandin inhibitor drugs for clinical outcomes. First, there was wide variation in PDA definitions in the included trials, especially the trials for treatment of symptomatic PDA. Symptomatic PDA was defined in most trials based on characteristic clinical signs, along with echocardiographic evidence of an increased PDA shunt volume. However, the trials did not have consistent eligibility criteria, from either a clinical or an echocardiographic standpoint. Further, the most used echocardiographic criteria, the PDA size, and the left atrium to aortic root ratio, have been shown to have poor inter‐rater reliability, and therefore, may represent suboptimal inclusion criteria (de Freitas Martins 2018; Zonnenberg 2012). In addition, the trials did not attempt to differentiate between PDAs with moderate versus high shunt volume, based on any clinical or echocardiographic criteria. These drawbacks of existing RCTs may have led us to include a highly heterogeneous population in the meta‐analyses, especially, more mature infants with smaller PDA shunt volumes, in whom spontaneous PDA closure was highly likely to occur. Second, as evident from their wide confidence intervals, the effect estimates for the most important clinical outcomes were imprecise, which failed to provide convincing evidence for an absence of effect on such outcomes. Third, a substantial proportion of infants in the placebo or no treatment group ended up receiving open‐label medical therapy, thereby, likely pulling the effect estimate towards the null. The latter, especially, might be an important reason why effective PDA closure did not necessarily translate into improved longer‐term clinical benefit.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^3545c221]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

The need for subsequent open‐label therapy, including definitive surgical PDA closure, also highlights the fact that medical therapy, though better than placebo, is by no means a highly effective option for PDA closure. Therefore, most RCTs of medical treatment were essentially trials of drug therapy, rather than the elimination of the PDA shunt. Therefore, despite growing calls for accepting the null hypothesis and abandoning further clinical trials on PDA management, the current evidence underscores the need to clearly establish which PDA shunts, if any, are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and pursue further clinical trials that include only those infants at the highest risk of PDA‐attributable morbidities, and explore highly effective and safe shunt elimination strategies for such clinically important PDA shunts.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^73032bfc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in newborns is challenging. Options are in particular restricted by risk–benefit considerations. Severe forms of ductus malfunction, causing circulatory failure, require heart surgery or vascular intervention to correct the structural defect. Development of lower‐risk alternatives is warranted. Deconvolution of underlying pathobiology would inform proactive promotion of innate ductus closure with the prospect of identifying druggable targets that address a current unmet need in vulnerable populations.

### Diagnosis and management of patent ductus arteriosus [^1ec98297]. NeoReviews (2018). Low credibility.

Preterm infants are at increased risk for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Prolonged exposure to PDA may be deleterious and has been associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of postnatal ductus arteriosus closure are not fully understood, clinical experience and research trials have informed recent changes in PDA management strategies and refocused treatment strategies on smaller subsets of infants who require intervention. This review examines current diagnostic and management approaches to PDA in preterm neonates.

### Association of patent ductus arteriosus with fetal factors and endotypes of prematurity [^2bf4b788]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

During fetal life, the ductus arteriosus (DA) acquires the mechanisms for its postnatal closure following a thorough developmental program. This program can be interrupted by preterm birth and is also susceptible to alteration during fetal life by numerous physiological and pathological stimuli. In this review, we aim to summarize the evidence on how physiological and pathological factors affect DA development, eventually leading to patent DA (PDA). Specifically, we reviewed the associations of sex, race, and pathophysiological pathways leading to very preterm birth (endotypes) with PDA incidence and pharmacological closure. Summary of evidence suggests that there are no male-female differences in the incidence of PDA among very preterm infants. In contrast, risk of developing PDA appears to be higher in infants exposed to chorioamnionitis or who are small for gestational age. Finally, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may be associated with a better response to pharmacological treatment of PDA. All of this evidence comes from observational studies and therefore associations do not imply causation. The current trend for many neonatologists is to wait for the natural evolution of preterm PDA. Continued research is needed to identify which fetal and perinatal factors modulate the eventual late closure of PDA in very and extremely preterm infants.

### Reflections of the changes in patent ductus arteriosus management during the last 10 years [^09d9bf01]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a large body of scientific evidence on the management of premature infants with a patent ductus arteriosus controversy remains and neonatologists remain challenged for knowing which patient to treat, what is the most optimal timing of treatment and which treatments have a positive impact on both short-term and long-term outcomes. In this review article we discuss the increased body of evidence over the past 10years, much of which questions the role of treatment and suggests the need to reconsider how haemodynamic significance is adjudicated. In addition, we discuss novel approaches to assessment and diagnosis, and highlight areas for future investigation.

### Does crossover treatment of control subjects invalidate results of randomized trials of patent ductus arteriosus treatment? [^f42df33c]. Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Optimal management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in extremely preterm infants remains controversial. There is paucity of evidence on the benefits of PDA treatment in reducing mortality and morbidities in extremely preterm infants. Failure of randomized clinical trials to demonstrate beneficial effects of PDA treatment on outcomes has often been attributed to open treatment of control subjects. This perspective examines the PDA treatment trials to date, with specific focus on rates of and ages of subjects at open rescue treatment. Although these trials demonstrate that ductal closure is significantly increased with treatment, that does not translate to a significant decrease in major morbidities or mortality in premature infants, even when trials with high rates of rescue treatment of controls are excluded. Trials in which enrollment occurred after 7 days of age include insufficient numbers of subjects to evaluate this relationship.

### The role of patent ductus arteriosus and its treatments in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia [^2b388636]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of hydrostatic fluid filtration into the lung's interstitium, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for mechanical ventilation. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure leads to improved alveolarization and minimizes the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of the "new bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)". Although early pharmacologic closure of the PDA decreases the incidence of pulmonary hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and the need for PDA ligation, there is little evidence from controlled, clinical trials to support or refute a causal role for the PDA in the development of BPD. However, evidence from epidemiologic, preclinical, and randomized controlled clinical trials demonstrate that early ductus ligation is an independent risk factor for the development of BPD and may directly contribute to the neonatal morbidities it is trying to prevent.

### Paracetamol to induce ductus arteriosus closure: is it valid? [^766044e3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

There remains a need for alternative medical treatments for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure in extreme preterm neonates because of therapeutic failure and adverse effects associated with non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors. Reports of an association between paracetamol exposure and PDA closure in a limited number of extreme preterm neonates have been published. However, causality cannot be taken for granted because a link between the current knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of paracetamol and (patho)physiology of ductal closure is not known. In contrast to non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, paracetamol has limited effects at peripheral sites, is a poor antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory drug and exerts its effects primarily within the central nervous system. Although paracetamol appears an effective and safe analgesic in term and near term neonates, its effectiveness and safety for PDA closure are uncertain because the drug is administered in high doses and there remain a limited number of observations in this specific subpopulation so far. Prospective comparative trials are reasonable and are urgently needed to establish both the effectiveness and safety data of paracetamol when used for this indication.

### Patent ductus arteriosus of the preterm infant [^346b186e]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

A persistently patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants can have significant clinical consequences, particularly during the recovery period from respiratory distress syndrome. With improvement of ventilation and oxygenation, the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases early and rapidly, especially in very immature infants with extremely low birth weight (< 1000 g). Subsequently, the left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus (DA) is augmented, thereby increasing pulmonary blood flow, which leads to pulmonary edema and overall worsening of cardiopulmonary status. Prolonged ventilation, with the potential risks of volutrauma, barotrauma, and hyperoxygenation, is strongly associated with the development and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia/chronic lung disease. Substantial left-to-right shunting through the ductus may also increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death. Postnatal ductal closure is regulated by exposure to oxygen and vasodilators; the ensuing vascular responses, mediated by potassium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species, and endothelin 1, depend on gestational age. Platelets are recruited to the luminal aspect of the DA during closure and probably promote thrombotic sealing of the constricted DA. Currently, it is unclear whether and when a conservative, pharmacologic, or surgical approach for PDA closure may be advantageous. Furthermore, it is unknown if prophylactic and/or symptomatic PDA therapy will cause substantive improvements in outcome. In this article we review the mechanisms underlying DA closure, risk factors and comorbidities of significant DA shunting, and current clinical evidence and areas of uncertainty in the diagnosis and treatment of PDA of the preterm infant.

Treatment Gaps

Vulnerable pediatric populations demand rigorous benefit–risk assessment in clinical decision making. 3 Echocardiography is the first‐line modality to quantify PDA‐associated shunt and its impact on the cardiopulmonary system. Patients with PDA with hemodynamic overload and organ failure symptomatology face the prospect of a poor outcome, requiring implementation of consensus‐based advanced therapy. In premature babies with no contraindications, an attempt to close a symptomatic PDA is initiated using pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitors that modulate ductus contraction. Yet, the average 68% success rate of 14 widely used clinical protocols mandates escalation in therapy through invasive correction or additional rounds of treatment in initial nonresponders 2 that could result from an inadequate management regimen and/or a diverse recalcitrant disease pathobiology. Pharmacotherapy for preterm PDA relies on 5 decades of clinical experience yet has not reached standardization. Selection of most effective timing, best agent, dose, and delivery means have all been central to the quest for best practice.

Clinical experience indicates an age‐dependent response to pharmacological ductus closure. 3 There is consensus that prostaglandin inhibitors are contraindicated for PDA in babies born at full term. The principle of "do no harm" in the setting of full‐term PDA was established more than 3 decades ago, and further clinical trials have been discouraged. Nonpharmacological management, i.e. catheter‐based PDA occlusion or surgical ligation necessitating thoracotomy, is the standard of care for full‐term PDA.

Prophylactic PDA closure is not supported by ongoing clinical studies. Accordingly, nonsymptomatic PDA, which may or may not be diagnosed during infancy, is conservatively managed until disease progression qualifies for invasive closure. 1 This "wait for surgery" schedule contributes to the growing number of adults with PDA, estimated at a quarter of a million living Americans. Thus, development of alternative therapeutic strategies aimed at early rescue is warranted, capturing the disease process in its evolution.

### Genetics of patent ductus arteriosus susceptibility and treatment [^d1b5dc0e]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

The ductus arteriosus is a vital fetal structure designed to close shortly after birth. Although many physiologic and pharmacologic investigations have characterized the closure of this structure, genetic studies of persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus (patent ductus arteriosus, PDA) are relatively recent. Progress in the identification of specific genes associated with PDA is well behind that of many adult-onset diseases because of several reasons ranging from the lack of large biorepositories for this unique population to the belief that any genetic contribution to PDA is minimal. Viewing the PDA as a complex, developmentally influenced disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors has resulted in initial successes in some genetic studies. We will introduce several genetic approaches, which have been or are currently being applied to the study of PDA, that have been successful in identifying polymorphisms associated with adult diseases. Genetic investigations of PDA will be discussed with respect to heritability, in general, and to specific risk genes. Several animal models that have been used to study PDA-related genes will also be presented. Further advances in discovering genetic variation causing PDA will drive the more rational use of current therapies, and may help identify currently unknown targets for future therapeutic manipulation.

### Does early-targeted risk-based management of a patent ductus arteriosus improve outcomes in preterm infants? Insights from an observational study [^96c0ece9]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

The potential benefit of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure in high-risk infants

A compelling argument for the benefit of achieving PDA closure lies in the distinct differences in outcomes between high-risk infants with successful and failed ductal closure shown in this study. Treatment-failure infants retained high morbidity levels, with respiratory outcomes similar to the high-risk reference cohort who did not receive early-targeted treatment. It is important to bear in mind that the initial risk profile for respiratory morbidity and mortality in high-risk infants is likely to be destined to be similar for all infants in this group. The change in risk profile comes about depending on whether the infant goes on to become a treatment responder or non-responder. This suggests that the persistent haemodynamic burden of an open ductus contributes to suboptimal outcomes. While alternative explanations for differences in outcomes, such as subtle baseline differences, cannot be completely ruled out, the consistent pattern of improved outcomes in treatment-success infants does demonstrate the potential value of achieving early ductal closure in this population. This aligns with the hypothesis that high-risk infants, as identified by severity scores like the PDAsc, may derive the most benefit from targeted intervention. Furthermore, PDA reopening after initial pharmacological closure was uncommon in our study, occurring in only two out of 58 infants (approximately 3%) in the early-targeted treatment-success group. Given this low reopening rate, PDA reopening likely did not substantially influence observed respiratory outcomes.

Paracetamol and chronic lung disease: a complex association

Our findings revealed an association between paracetamol exposure and increased rates of CLD in high-risk infants, raising concerns about its impact on pulmonary outcomes. This association may reflect underlying illness severity, as paracetamol was often administered to infants with contraindications to ibuprofen, who are inherently at higher risk of morbidity. Alternatively, preclinical evidence suggests that paracetamol may alter pulmonary vascular tone by shifting arachidonic acid metabolism and contributing to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Additionally, the significantly higher rate of paracetamol treatment observed in the treatment-failure group compared with the treatment-success and reference groups likely reflects clinical decision-making, wherein paracetamol is preferentially administered to infants unable to receive ibuprofen due to contraindications. Consequently, the relationship between increased paracetamol usage and poorer respiratory outcomes may primarily represent underlying infant morbidity or clinical severity rather than a direct pharmacological effect. Despite this, the lack of an association between paracetamol or ibuprofen exposure and mortality is reassuring. This finding emphasises the need for the careful selection of pharmacological agents and closer monitoring of their potential long-term pulmonary effects.

### Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary morbidity: can early targeted pharmacologic PDA treatment decrease the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia? [^16c5b88a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

A persistent left-to-right shunt through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) increases the rate of pulmonary hydrostatic fluid filtration, impairs pulmonary mechanics, and prolongs the need for respiratory support. Infants with a moderate/large PDA shunt that persists for more than 7–14 days are at increased risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) if they also require invasive ventilation for more than 10 days. In contrast, infants who require invasive ventilation for less than 10 days have similar rates of BPD no matter how long they are exposed to a moderate/large PDA shunt. Although pharmacologic PDA closure decreases the risk of abnormal early alveolar development in preterm baboons that are ventilated for 2 weeks, the findings from recent randomized controlled trials, as well as a quality improvement project, suggest that routine early targeted pharmacologic treatments, as currently employed, do not appear to alter the incidence of BPD in human infants.

### Managing the patent ductus arteriosus: current treatment options [^f2ab7d4c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2014). Low credibility.

Optimal management of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the premature infant remains controversial. Despite considerable historical and physiological data indicating that a persistent PDA may be harmful, robust evidence of long-term benefits or harms from treatment is lacking. This has been equated to a lack of benefit but is also a reflection of the fact that most clinical trials were designed to assess the effects of short-term (2-8days) rather than prolonged exposure to a PDA. No clinical trials have been designed to assess the effects of prolonged exposure of persistent PDA on morbidity and mortality of very premature infants in the era of antenatal corticosteroids, surfactant and non-invasive respiratory support. Further research is required, but new insights and novel therapies are evolving, which will allow greater individual patient assessment, understanding of risk and optimisation of treatment. In this paper, we review the current literature, evidence for treatment options, including a non-interventional approach, and research directions for infants < 28weeks' gestational age.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^f01f1706]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, our findings generally support the current recommendations from the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS (Mitra 2022a)), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP (Hamrick 2020)), that include: considering prophylactic indomethacin to prevent severe IVH in high risk extremely preterm infants, and refraining from pharmacotherapy for PDA closure in clinically stable preterm infants, given the lack of clear evidence for benefit, while judiciously weighing the benefits and harms of PDA treatment in clinically unstable, extremely preterm infants, given the overall lack of RCT evidence in this vulnerable population. However, it is important to note that both the CPS and AAP statements suggest considering invasive PDA closure (surgical ligation or percutaneous transcatheter closure) if the PDA remains persistently symptomatic, despite limited RCT evidence on the benefit of invasive PDA closure on clinically relevant outcomes.

### Managing the patent ductus arteriosus in the premature neonate: a new look at what we thought we knew [^0e1bf9a9]. Seminars in Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

Over recent years, the clinical approach to patency of the ductus arteriosus in the premature neonate has been the subject of intensive reevaluation. What had once been considered inherently obvious is no longer to be taken for granted. In this review we will focus on some of the controversies surrounding various aspects of the pharmacologic treatment regimens for patent ductus arteriosus closure. The pros and cons of prophylactic vs therapeutic indomethacin, of early vs late therapy, of high- vs low-dose indomethacin, of single vs multiple courses of treatment, and of ibuprofen vs indomethacin will be considered. In addition, the possibility that patency of the ductus arteriosus is merely a physiological manifestation of extreme prematurity, and thus does not necessarily need to be therapeutically closed, has become a viable approach in some cases. As such, we will examine echocardiographic and biochemical criteria aimed at determining the clinical and hemodynamic significance of ductal shunting, and thereby of the need to treat. Finally, we speculate on potential therapeutic directions for the future, including individualized treatment regimens and multidrug treatment cocktails for those who fail initial monodrug therapy.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^2071ad37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types of interventions

In this overview, we specifically included reviews of therapies primarily intended to prevent or manage a PDA.

For objective 1 (prevention of PDA)

Interventions included prophylactic (not guided by knowledge of PDA status) pharmacological or surgical treatment of PDA within 24 hours of birth. Pharmacological treatments included indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen compared against each other, or placebo, or no treatment. There were no restrictions on dose, route, or duration of treatment. Surgical interventions included surgical or transcatheter PDA closure compared against medical treatment, or placebo, or no treatment.

For objective 2 (management of PDA)

Interventions included pharmacological and surgical treatments for an asymptomatic or a symptomatic PDA. Pharmacological treatments included indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen compared against each other, or placebo, or no treatment. There were no restrictions on dose, route, or duration of treatment. Surgical interventions included surgical or transcatheter PDA closure compared against medical treatment, or placebo, or no treatment.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^825d02ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the most commonly diagnosed cardiovascular condition in preterm infants, is associated with an eight-fold increase in mortality and multiple, harmful longer-term outcomes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intestinal injury, brain damage, cerebral volume loss, and congestive heart failure. PDA results in an enduring blood flow in preterm infants between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The ductus, an essential component of fetal circulation, normally closes shortly after birth in term infants, but remains open (patent) at one-month of age in approximately 70% of < 30-weeks gestation preterm infants. PDA-associated symptoms including mesenteric, renal, and cerebral hypoperfusion and pulmonary edema secondary to pulmonary overcirculation develop in 60% of those with persistent PDA.

Despite association with worsened outcomes in preterm infants, PDA closure has become increasingly controversial among cardiologists and neonatologists, with treatment strategies varying markedly between institutions and individual providers. Within the first postnatal month, the majority of neonatal providers still routinely administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or less commonly acetaminophen, to at least some infants with PDA with the expectation of increased early ductal closure. Because the majority of PDAs in preterm infants close spontaneously by 44-weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) when left untreated, the frequencies of both early medication treatment and surgical or catheter-based closure ligation for persistent PDA have declined over the last decade. Given a lack of validated evidence to identify which subset of preterm infants is most likely to benefit from PDA closure, the decision to treat PDA remains subjective. Randomized clinical trials and innovative observational studies have not demonstrated net improvement in death, BPD, or neurodevelopmental impairment following routine medical or interventional treatments (surgical ligation, catheter-based closure) of all preterm infants with PDA. However, the effectiveness of more selective PDA treatment closure strategies remains unclear.

### Study protocol: baby-OSCAR trial: outcome after selective early treatment for closure of patent ductus ARteriosus in preterm babies, a multicentre, masked, randomised placebo-controlled parallel group trial [^a73fefd9]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

It is now suggested that large PDA on echocardiography in first 72 h (those with a diameter of ≥ 1.5 mm) through which blood flow is pulsatile and unrestricted are less likely to close spontaneously. Targeted early treatment of a large PDA whilst asymptomatic has the potential to overcome the disadvantages of both the prophylactic and symptomatic approaches. Although clinical detection of PDA whilst asymptomatic is challenging, it can be assessed using bedside echocardiography.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially indomethacin and ibuprofen have been widely used for the treatment of PDA. Short term efficacy of indomethacin and ibuprofen are equivalent in the treatment of PDA. Ibuprofen however appears to reduce the risk of NEC and is associated with fewer clinical gastrointestinal and renal side effects compared to indomethacin; hence it is the drug of choice for this trial. Paracetamol has also been recently reported in case studies for closure of symptomatic PDA but further research needs to be done to establish its safety & effectiveness for early treatment of PDA.

The current literature falls short of providing substantive evidence on the management of PDA among extreme preterm babies leading to uncertainty and heterogeneity in clinical practices.

A recent cohort study reported the presence of a large PDA (defined as a PDA dimension of ≥ 1.5 mm) on day 3 in babies born before 28 weeks' gestation was associated with a threefold increase in odds of death or severe morbidity compared with neonates without PDA (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.1 to 11.0). Neonates with a large PDA were also reported to have increased odds of IVH (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 14.0) and BPD (OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.0 to 14.0) compared with neonates with no PDA. In preclinical trials, pharmacologic PDA closure is reported to improve alveolarisation and minimise the impaired postnatal alveolar development that is the pathologic hallmark of "new bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)". An early selective treatment approach for closure of a PDA is suggested to trial its effect on BPD and mortality, which is the hypothesis of this trial.

We aim to determine if the selective treatment of echocardiographically confirmed large PDA in extremely preterm babies with ibuprofen within 72 h of birth reduces the incidence of death by 36 weeks postmenstrual age, or moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight (or both) infants [^27f3f8dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared with indomethacin, other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor(s), placebo, or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm, low-birth-weight, or preterm and low-birth-weight infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 30 November 2017), Embase (1980 to 30 November 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 30 November 2017). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in preterm, low birth weight, or both preterm and low-birth-weight newborn infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 studies enrolling 2843 infants. Ibuprofen (IV) versus placebo: IV Ibuprofen (3 doses) reduced the failure to close a PDA compared with placebo (typical relative risk (RR); 0.62 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.86); typical risk difference (RD); -0.18 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.06); NNTB 6 (95% CI 3 to 17); I² = 65% for RR and I² = 0% for RD; 2 studies, 206 infants; moderate-quality the evidence). One study reported decreased failure to close a PDA after single or three doses of oral ibuprofen compared with placebo (64 infants; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.62; RD -0.44, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.23; NNTB 2, 95% CI 2 to 4; I 2 test not applicable). Ibuprofen (IV or oral) compared with indomethacin (IV or oral): Twenty-four studies (1590 infants) comparing ibuprofen (IV or oral) with indomethacin (IV or oral) found no significant differences in failure rates for PDA closure (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.24; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06; I² = 0% for both RR and RD; moderate-quality evidence). A reduction in NEC (necrotising enterocolitis) was noted in the ibuprofen (IV or oral) group (18 studies, 1292 infants; typical RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; NNTB 25, 95% CI 14 to 100; I² = 0% for both RR and RD; moderate-quality evidence). There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infants with oliguria in the ibuprofen group (6 studies, 576 infants; typical RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; typical RD -0.09, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.05; NNTB 11, 95% CI 7 to 20; I² = 24% for RR and I² = 69% for RD; moderate-quality evidence). The serum/plasma creatinine levels 72 hours after initiation of treatment were statistically significantly lower in the ibuprofen group (11 studies, 918 infants; MD -8.12 µmol/L, 95% CI -10.81 to -5.43). For this comparison, there was high between-study heterogeneity (I 2 = 83%) and low-quality evidence. Ibuprofen (oral) compared with indomethacin (IV or oral): Eight studies (272 infants) reported on failure rates for PDA closure in a subgroup of the above studies comparing oral ibuprofen with indomethacin (IV or oral). There was no significant difference between the groups (typical RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.09; I² = 0% for both RR and RD). The risk of NEC was reduced with oral ibuprofen compared with indomethacin (IV or oral) (7 studies, 249 infants; typical RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; typical RD -0.13, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.05; NNTB 8, 95% CI 5 to 20; I² = 0% for both RR and RD). There was low-quality evidence for these two outcomes. There was a decreased risk of failure to close a PDA with oral ibuprofen compared with IV ibuprofen (5 studies, 406 infants; typical RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; typical RD -0.22, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.14; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 7; moderate-quality evidence). There was a decreased risk of failure to close a PDA with high-dose versus standard-dose of IV ibuprofen (3 studies 190 infants; typical RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61; typical RD - 0.26, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.15; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 7); I² = 4% for RR and 0% for RD); moderate-quality evidence). Early versus expectant administration of IV ibuprofen, echocardiographically-guided IV ibuprofen treatment versus standard IV ibuprofen treatment, continuous infusion of ibuprofen versus intermittent boluses of ibuprofen, and rectal ibuprofen versus oral ibuprofen were studied in too few trials to allow for precise estimates of any clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA. Ibuprofen reduces the risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency. Therefore, of these two drugs, ibuprofen appears to be the drug of choice. The effectiveness of ibuprofen versus paracetamol is assessed in a separate review. Oro-gastric administration of ibuprofen appears as effective as IV administration. To make further recommendations, studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose ibuprofen, early versus expectant administration of ibuprofen, echocardiographically-guided versus standard IV ibuprofen, and continuous infusion versus intermittent boluses of ibuprofen. Studies are lacking evaluating the effect of ibuprofen on longer-term outcomes in infants with PDA.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^5ff784ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Several non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches have been explored to prevent or treat a PDA.

Objectives

To summarise Cochrane Neonatal evidence on interventions (pharmacological or surgical) for the prevention of PDA and related complications, and interventions for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic PDA in preterm infants.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 20 October 2022 for ongoing and published Cochrane Reviews on the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) or low birthweight (< 2500 g) infants. We included all published Cochrane Reviews assessing the following categories of interventions: pharmacological therapy using prostaglandin inhibitor drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen), adjunctive pharmacological interventions, invasive PDA closure procedures, and non-pharmacological interventions. Two overview authors independently checked the eligibility of the reviews retrieved by the search, and extracted data from the included reviews using a predefined data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third overview author. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) tool. We reported the GRADE certainty of evidence as assessed by the respective review authors using summary of findings tables.

Main Results

We included 16 Cochrane Reviews, corresponding to 138 randomised clinical trials (RCT) and 11,856 preterm infants, on the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm infants. One of the 16 reviews had no included studies, and therefore, did not contribute to the results. Six reviews reported on prophylactic interventions for the prevention of PDA and included pharmacological prophylaxis with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs, prophylactic surgical PDA ligation, and non-pharmacologic interventions (chest shielding during phototherapy and restriction of fluid intake); one review reported on the use of indomethacin for the management of asymptomatic PDA; nine reviews reported on interventions for the management of symptomatic PDA, and included pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs in various routes and dosages, surgical PDA ligation, and adjunct therapies (use of furosemide and dopamine in conjunction with indomethacin). The quality of reviews varied. Two reviews were assessed to be high quality, seven reviews were of moderate quality, five of low quality, while two reviews were deemed to be of critically low quality. For prevention of PDA, prophylactic indomethacin reduces severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH; relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.82; 14 RCTs, 2588 infants), and the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 8 RCTs, 1791 infants), but it does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; 3 RCTs, 1491 infants). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; 7 RCTs, 925 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; 7 RCTs, 925 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.39; 1 RCT, 48 infants). Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) was lower with both prophylactic surgical ligation (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83; 1 RCT, 84 infants), and fluid restriction (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87; 4 RCTs, 526 infants). For treatment of asymptomatic PDA, indomethacin appears to reduce the development of symptomatic PDA post-treatment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.68; 3 RCTs, 97 infants; quality of source review: critically low). For treatment of symptomatic PDA, all available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be more effective in closing a PDA than placebo or no treatment (indomethacin: RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.38; 10 RCTs, 654 infants; high-certainty evidence; ibuprofen: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.86; 2 RCTs, 206 infants; moderate-certainty evidence; early administration of acetaminophen: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53; 2 RCTs, 127 infants; low-certainty evidence). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than intravenous (IV) ibuprofen (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; 5 RCTs, 406 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). High-dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than standard-dose ibuprofen (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61; 3 RCTs, 190 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). With respect to adverse outcomes, compared to indomethacin administration, NEC appears to be lower with ibuprofen (any route; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; 18 RCTs, 1292 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), oral ibuprofen (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; 7 RCTs, 249 infants; low-certainty evidence), and with acetaminophen (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; 4 RCTs, 384 infants; low-certainty evidence). However, NEC appears to be increased with a prolonged course of indomethacin versus a shorter course (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.27; 4 RCTs, 310 infants).

Authors' Conclusions

This overview summarised the evidence from 16 Cochrane Reviews of RCTs regarding the effects of interventions for the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm infants. Prophylactic indomethacin reduces severe IVH, but does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (moderate-certainty evidence), while the evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH. All available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be effective in symptomatic PDA closure compared to no treatment (high-certainty evidence for indomethacin; moderate-certainty evidence for ibuprofen; low-certainty evidence for early administration of acetaminophen). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than IV ibuprofen (moderate-certainty evidence). High dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than standard-dose ibuprofen (moderate-certainty evidence). There are currently two ongoing reviews, one on fluid restriction for symptomatic PDA, and the other on invasive management of PDA in preterm infants.

### Path toward proactive therapy for patent ductus arteriosus [^41ef7a11]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Outlook

In conclusion, PDA is a common cardiac anomaly with newly acquired knowledge expanding the understanding of underlying disease mechanisms. The ensuing development of proactive therapeutic approaches that target identified pathways, specific to the diseased neonatal organ system, would benefit vulnerable populations with PDA, in particular those in whom current pharmacological options are ineffective or contraindicated. Science‐informed therapy at birth is at the vanguard of next‐generation solutions in childcare. This evolving landscape heralds an evolution in pediatric clinical pharmacology that integrates the young patient within a causative care regimen.

The abstract reports "US Food and Drug Administration approval of the first device for transcatheter PDA occlusion device for low birth weight infants in 2019" and that "successful outcomes are highly dependent on proper patient selection, awareness of key procedural considerations, appropriately trained operators, and institutions meeting a standard of required infrastructural requirements," with "A multidisciplinary approach involving neonatologists and cardiologists is beneficial, as well as shared decision-making with the patient's family." For hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA), "Closure of a hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) may benefit certain preterm infants," and "Historically, pharmacotherapy treatment has been the first-line intervention for premature infants selected to undergo PDA closure," noting "Ibuprofen, indomethacin, and acetaminophen have all been shown to be effective, without clear evidence for superiority of any individual agent." A meta-analysis "demonstrated a 67% rate of PDA closure in response to medical therapy vs 38% of those who did not receive treatment," while "Definitive closure for a hsPDA is typically indicated after conservative and/or pharmacological failure; if there is a contraindication to pharmacotherapy, or if there is a severe decline in clinical status with end-organ dysfunction," and "Surgical ligation was historically the definitive therapy in premature infants weighing less than 5 kg who failed medical closure."

### Association of placebo, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen with closure of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^eb0097be]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Despite increasing emphasis on conservative management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants, different pharmacotherapeutic interventions are used to treat those developing a hemodynamically significant PDA.

Objectives

To estimate the relative likelihood of hemodynamically significant PDA closure with common pharmacotherapeutic interventions and to compare adverse event rates.

Data Sources and Study Selection

The databases of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception until August 15, 2015, and updated on December 31, 2017, along with conference proceedings up to December 2017. Randomized clinical trials that enrolled preterm infants with a gestational age younger than 37 weeks treated with intravenous or oral indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen vs each other, placebo, or no treatment for a clinically or echocardiographically diagnosed hemodynamically significant PDA.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted in pairs by 6 reviewers and synthesized with Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome: hemodynamically significant PDA closure; secondary: included surgical closure, mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Results

In 68 randomized clinical trials of 4802 infants, 14 different variations of indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen were used as treatment modalities. The overall PDA closure rate was 67.4% (2867 of 4256 infants). A high dose of oral ibuprofen was associated with a significantly higher odds of PDA closure vs a standard dose of intravenous ibuprofen (odds ratio [OR], 3.59; 95% credible interval [CrI], 1.64–8.17; absolute risk difference, 199 [95% CrI, 95–258] more per 1000 infants) and a standard dose of intravenous indomethacin (OR, 2.35 [95% CrI, 1.08–5.31]; absolute risk difference, 124 [95% CrI, 14–188] more per 1000 infants). Based on the ranking statistics, a high dose of oral ibuprofen ranked as the best pharmacotherapeutic option for PDA closure (mean surface under the cumulative ranking [SUCRA] curve, 0.89 [SD, 0.12]) and to prevent surgical PDA ligation (mean SUCRA, 0.98 [SD, 0.08]). There was no significant difference in the odds of mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, or intraventricular hemorrhage with use of placebo or no treatment compared with any of the other treatment modalities.

Conclusions and Relevance

A high dose of oral ibuprofen was associated with a higher likelihood of hemodynamically significant PDA closure vs standard doses of intravenous ibuprofen or intravenous indomethacin; placebo or no treatment did not significantly change the likelihood of mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, or intraventricular hemorrhage.

### Paracetamol for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3f4172df]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all the available evidence to assess the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in neonates, and to explore the effects of clinical variables on the risk of closure.

Data Source

MEDLINE, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, using the following medical subject headings and terms: paracetamol, acetaminophen and patent ductus arteriosus. Electronic and manual screening of conference abstracts from international meetings of relevant organisations. Manual search of the reference lists of all eligible articles.

Study Selection

Studies comparing paracetamol versus ibuprofen, indomethacin, placebo or no intervention for the treatment of PDA.

Data Extraction

Data regarding efficacy and safety were collected and analysed.

Results

Sixteen studies were included: 2 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 uncontrolled studies. Quality of selected studies is poor. A meta-analysis of RCTs does not demonstrate any difference in the risk of ductal closure (Mantel-Haenszel model, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33 and RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.16, after 3 and 6days of treatment, respectively). Proportion meta-analysis of uncontrolled studies demonstrates a pooled ductal closure rate of 49% (95% CI 29% to 69%) and 76% (95% CI 61% to 88%) after 3 and 6days of treatment with paracetamol, respectively. Safety profiles of paracetamol and ibuprofen are similar.

Conclusions

Efficacy and safety of paracetamol appear to be comparable with those of ibuprofen. These results should be interpreted with caution, taking into account the non-optimal quality of the studies analysed and the limited number of neonates treated with paracetamol so far.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^891857db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Several non‐pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches have been explored to prevent or treat a PDA.

Objectives

To summarise Cochrane Neonatal evidence on interventions (pharmacological or surgical) for the prevention of PDA and related complications, and interventions for the management of asymptomatic and symptomatic PDA in preterm infants.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 20 October 2022 for ongoing and published Cochrane Reviews on the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) or low birthweight (< 2500 g) infants. We included all published Cochrane Reviews assessing the following categories of interventions: pharmacological therapy using prostaglandin inhibitor drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen), adjunctive pharmacological interventions, invasive PDA closure procedures, and non‐pharmacological interventions. Two overview authors independently checked the eligibility of the reviews retrieved by the search, and extracted data from the included reviews using a predefined data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third overview author. Two overview authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) tool. We reported the GRADE certainty of evidence as assessed by the respective review authors using summary of findings tables.

Main results

We included 16 Cochrane Reviews, corresponding to 138 randomised clinical trials (RCT) and 11,856 preterm infants, on the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm infants. One of the 16 reviews had no included studies, and therefore, did not contribute to the results. Six reviews reported on prophylactic interventions for the prevention of PDA and included pharmacological prophylaxis with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs, prophylactic surgical PDA ligation, and non‐pharmacologic interventions (chest shielding during phototherapy and restriction of fluid intake); one review reported on the use of indomethacin for the management of asymptomatic PDA; nine reviews reported on interventions for the management of symptomatic PDA, and included pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs in various routes and dosages, surgical PDA ligation, and adjunct therapies (use of furosemide and dopamine in conjunction with indomethacin). The quality of reviews varied. Two reviews were assessed to be high quality, seven reviews were of moderate quality, five of low quality, while two reviews were deemed to be of critically low quality.

For prevention of PDA, prophylactic indomethacin reduces severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH; relative risk (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.82; 14 RCTs, 2588 infants), and the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; 8 RCTs, 1791 infants), but it does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.15; 3 RCTs, 1491 infants). Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; 7 RCTs, 925 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence), and the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; 7 RCTs, 925 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.39; 1 RCT, 48 infants). Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) was lower with both prophylactic surgical ligation (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83; 1 RCT, 84 infants), and fluid restriction (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87; 4 RCTs, 526 infants).

For treatment of asymptomatic PDA, indomethacin appears to reduce the development of symptomatic PDA post‐treatment (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.68; 3 RCTs, 97 infants; quality of source review: critically low).

For treatment of symptomatic PDA, all available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be more effective in closing a PDA than placebo or no treatment (indomethacin: RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.38; 10 RCTs, 654 infants; high‐certainty evidence; ibuprofen: RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.86; 2 RCTs, 206 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence; early administration of acetaminophen: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53; 2 RCTs, 127 infants; low‐certainty evidence). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than intravenous (IV) ibuprofen (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.56; 5 RCTs, 406 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). High‐dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than standard‐dose ibuprofen (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61; 3 RCTs, 190 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). With respect to adverse outcomes, compared to indomethacin administration, NEC appears to be lower with ibuprofen (any route; RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94; 18 RCTs, 1292 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence), oral ibuprofen (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.73; 7 RCTs, 249 infants; low‐certainty evidence), and with acetaminophen (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; 4 RCTs, 384 infants; low‐certainty evidence). However, NEC appears to be increased with a prolonged course of indomethacin versus a shorter course (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.27; 4 RCTs, 310 infants).

Authors' conclusions

This overview summarised the evidence from 16 Cochrane Reviews of RCTs regarding the effects of interventions for the prevention and treatment of PDA in preterm infants.

Prophylactic indomethacin reduces severe IVH, but does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (moderate‐certainty evidence), while the evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH. All available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be effective in symptomatic PDA closure compared to no treatment (high‐certainty evidence for indomethacin; moderate‐certainty evidence for ibuprofen; low‐certainty evidence for early administration of acetaminophen). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than IV ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence). High dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure than standard‐dose ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence).

There are currently two ongoing reviews, one on fluid restriction for symptomatic PDA, and the other on invasive management of PDA in preterm infants.

### Ductal closure with paracetamol: a surprising new approach to patent ductus arteriosus treatment [^e3302465]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Standard pharmacologic closure of the patent ductus arteriosus currently involves the administration of 1 of 2 cyclooxygenase inhibitors: either indomethacin or ibuprofen. However, both of these drugs can be associated with potentially significant adverse effects. We present here the cases of 5 preterm infants (gestational age: 26–32 weeks; postnatal age: 3–35 days) with large, hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus who had either failed or had contraindications to ibuprofen therapy. Each of these infants was treated with off-label oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours). Ductal closure was achieved within 48 hours in all the treated infants. No toxicity was observed.

### Surgical versus medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^871e31db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with significant left to right shunt increases morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Early closure of the ductus arteriosus may be achieved pharmacologically or by surgery. The preferred initial treatment of a symptomatic PDA, surgical ligation or treatment with indomethacin, is not clear.

Objectives

To compare the effect of surgical ligation of PDA versus medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin, ibuprofen or mefenamic acid), each used as the initial treatment, on neonatal mortality in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA.

Search Methods

For this update we searched The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 2, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Clinicaltrials.gov, Controlled-trials.com, Proceedings of the Annual Meetings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (2000 to 2011) (Abstracts2View(TM)) and Web of Science on 8 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials in preterm or low birth weight neonates with symptomatic PDA and comparing surgical ligation with medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, each used as the initial treatment for closure of PDA.

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently assessed methodological quality and extracted data for the included trial. We used RevMan 5.1 for analyses of the data.

Main Results

One study reporting on 154 neonates was found eligible. No significant difference between surgical closure and indomethacin treatment was found for in-hospital mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, creatinine level or intraventricular haemorrhage. There was a significant increase in the surgical group in the incidence of pneumothorax (risk ratio (RR) 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.45 to 4.93; risk difference (RD) 0.25; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 4 (95% CI 3 to 9)) and retinopathy of prematurity stage III and IV (RR 3.80; 95% CI 1.12 to 12.93; RD 0.11; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20; NNTH 9 (95% CI 5 to 50)) compared to the indomethacin group. There was a statistically significant decrease in failure of ductal closure rate in the surgical group as compared to the indomethacin group (RR 0.04; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.27; RD -0.32; 95% CI -0.43 to -0.21, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 3 (95% CI 2 to 4)). No new trials were identified for inclusion in the 2012 update.

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data to conclude whether surgical ligation or medical treatment with indomethacin is preferred as the initial treatment for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants.

### Oral paracetamol versus oral ibuprofen for closure of haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus in preterm neonates [^2e44c368]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Ibuprofen and indomethacin are the current standard drugs for closure of a haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) apart from surgical ligation.
These drugs have many adverse effects involving the gut, kidneys and the pulmonary vasculature.
Few case reports and two clinical trials have reported about use of oral paracetamol for closure of PDA.

What this study hopes to add?

We intend to compare oral paracetamol with oral ibuprofen to demonstrate that paracetamol is not inferior in efficacy and is safer in comparison to ibuprofen.
Being one of the largest multisite, non-inferiority trial where the investigators, treating team, laboratory personnel and the outcome assessors would be blinded to the intervention is a major strength of this study.

### Indomethacin for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^d6db5b39]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. In these infants, prophylactic use of indomethacin, a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, has demonstrated short-term clinical benefits. The effect of indomethacin in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA remains unexplored.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of indomethacin (given by any route) compared to placebo or no treatment in reducing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 7), in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions(R); and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), on 31 July 2020. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared indomethacin (any dose, any route) versus placebo or no treatment in preterm infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by at least two review authors. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: failure of PDA closure within one week of administration of the first dose of indomethacin; bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 28 days' postnatal age and at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age; proportion of infants requiring surgical ligation or transcatheter occlusion; all-cause neonatal mortality; necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (≥ Bell stage 2); and mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Main Results

We included 14 RCTs (880 preterm infants). Four out of the 14 included studies were judged to have high risk of bias in one or more domains. Indomethacin administration was associated with a large reduction in failure of PDA closure within one week of administration of the first dose (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.38; risk difference (RD) -0.52, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.45; 10 studies, 654 infants; high-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in the incidence of BPD (BPD defined as supplemental oxygen need at 28 days' postnatal age: RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.51; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence; BPD defined as supplemental oxygen need at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age: RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.55; 1 study, 92 infants; low-certainty evidence) and probably little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.33; 8 studies, 314 infants; moderate-certainty evidence) with use of indomethacin for symptomatic PDA. No differences were demonstrated in the need for surgical PDA ligation (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.29; 7 studies, 275 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), in NEC (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.55; 2 studies, 147 infants; low-certainty evidence), or in mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.58; 2 studies, 119 infants; low-certainty evidence) with use of indomethacin compared to placebo or no treatment. Certainty of evidence for BPD, surgical PDA ligation, NEC, and mucocutaneous or gastrointestinal bleeding was downgraded for very serious or serious imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

High-certainty evidence shows that indomethacin is effective in closing a symptomatic PDA compared to placebo or no treatment in preterm infants. Evidence is insufficient regarding effects of indomethacin on other clinically relevant outcomes and medication-related adverse effects.

### Evidence-based use of acetaminophen for hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^164b04ce]. Seminars in Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

While cyclooxygenase inhibitors have been the most common medications used to facilitate earlier closure of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, adverse effects and variable efficacy have highlighted a need for alternative options. Acetaminophen facilitates ductal closure via an alternate pathway of prostaglandin inhibition. Despite treatment with high doses, toxicity is uncommon in preterm infants, possibly due to immature hepatic metabolism. Pooled data from randomized clinical trials of early treatment demonstrate that acetaminophen has similar efficacy as cyclooxygenase inhibitors for PDA closure with a favorable side effect profile and without any apparent increase in adverse neonatal outcomes. Acetaminophen may therefore be an ideal first-line agent among moderately and extremely preterm infants, though there is a paucity of data from controlled trials regarding its use in infants at the border of viability (gestation age ≤ 25 weeks). Evidence from clinical studies of limited quality supports acetaminophen treatment as rescue therapy for infants with persistent PDA after unsuccessful cyclooxygenase inhibitor treatment, including those being considered for surgical ligation.

How the intervention might work

Prevention and treatment of a PDA via the most effective modality may help to avoid clinical complications associated with persistent PDA, such as mortality, CLD, NEC, and renal failure. Prevention of PDA includes prophylactic medical or surgical closure of the PDA within the first 24 hours after birth, before the development of clinical symptoms (Benitz 2016). Although one of the earliest randomised trials on PDA management used prophylactic surgical PDA ligation, this is no longer a preferred modality in the current clinical context, given its associated risks and the availability of pharmacotherapeutic options (Cassady 1989). Hence, prophylactic management of the PDA essentially involves the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents within the first 24 hours of life, without knowledge of PDA status. Prophylactic use of intravenous indomethacin has been shown to reduce the incidence of symptomatic PDA, surgical PDA ligation, and the incidence of severe intraventricular haemorrhage, but has no effect on mortality, nor on a composite of death or severe neurodevelopmental disability, compared to placebo or no treatment (Fowlie 2010). Prophylactic ibuprofen, compared to placebo or no intervention, has also been shown to reduce the need for rescue treatment with COX inhibitors, and for surgical PDA closure (Ohlsson 2020a). However, both prophylactic indomethacin and prophylactic ibuprofen have been shown to be associated with increased risk of oliguria (Fowlie 2010; Ohlsson 2020a). Prophylactic ibuprofen is further associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (Ohlsson 2020a). Therefore, interest in expectant management of the PDA in preterm infants is growing, and the safety of this approach remains to be established through large randomised controlled trials (Hundscheid 2018).

On the other hand, treatment of PDA entails pharmacotherapeutic or surgical closure of a PDA, the diagnosis of which was based on characteristic clinical symptoms, echocardiographic findings, or both. NSAIDs and acetaminophen have been shown to be more effective in closing a symptomatic PDA compared to placebo (Mitra 2018). Ibuprofen appears to be as effective as indomethacin in closing a symptomatic PDA, while reducing the risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency (Ohlsson 2020b). Moderate‐quality evidence shows that acetaminophen is as effective as ibuprofen, and low‐quality evidence suggests that acetaminophen is as effective as indomethacin in closing a symptomatic PDA (Ohlsson 2020). Data are inconclusive regarding the efficacy and safety of surgery as the initial modality of treatment for a symptomatic PDA in a preterm infant compared to pharmacotherapeutic management (Malviya 2013).

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^f28f6031]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Interventions for management of asymptomatic PDA in preterm infants

Overall evidence is limited (3 RCTs, 97 infants) for the management of asymptomatic PDA. Treatment of asymptomatic PDA with indomethacin appears to reduce the development of symptomatic PDA post‐treatment. There is no evidence on the effect of asymptomatic PDA treatment on the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability.

Interventions for management of symptomatic PDA in preterm infants

All available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs appear to be more effective in PDA closure when compared to placebo or no treatment (high‐certainty evidence for indomethacin; moderate‐certainty evidence for ibuprofen; low‐certainty evidence for early administration of acetaminophen). Oral ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure compared to ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence); and high‐dose ibuprofen appears to be more effective in PDA closure compared to standard‐dose ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of any difference in PDA closure effectiveness between the three available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs (low‐ to moderate‐certainty evidence). There is no evidence on the effect of treatment of symptomatic PDA on the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability.

From a safety perspective, compared to indomethacin administration, NEC appears to be lower with ibuprofen (any route; moderate‐certainty evidence), exclusive oral administration of ibuprofen (low‐certainty evidence), and with acetaminophen (low‐certainty evidence). On the contrary, NEC appears to be more common with a prolonged course of indomethacin versus a shorter course. Oliguria is also higher with use of indomethacin versus ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence), the use of ibuprofen versus either placebo or acetaminophen, and with early pharmacological treatment of PDA, initiated within the first seven days of life versus later treatment.

### Early treatment versus expectative management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: a multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial in Europe (beNeDuctus trial) [^31b88700]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists about the optimal management of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants, especially in those born at a gestational age (GA) less than 28 weeks, due to a lack of evidence for any specific treatment including non-intervention. There is also no consensus about the diagnostic criteria of a haemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA). The reported incidence of a PDA in preterm infants is 30–60%, depending on the used definition, the timing of the diagnosis and the studied population.

PDA has been associated with mortality and major morbidities, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), pulmonary haemorrhage (PH), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of this might be that a PDA with significant left-to-right shunting results in pulmonary hyperperfusion and systemic hypoperfusion, although any evidence for a causal relationship is lacking.

There is a large variation in the management of a PDA between centres. Pharmacological closure of the PDA is most often attempted by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis with non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors (COXi), such as indomethacin (INDO) or ibuprofen (IBU). By postponing the start of treatment of a PDA, the risk of redundant adverse effects of COXi is decreasing as the postnatal age (PNA) at which COXi is started increases, while the time of exposure to a hsPDA might be prolonged. Some reports suggest that a high dose of IBU might be more effective in ductal closure in preterm infants, especially in those less than 27 weeks' gestation. However, in a recent systematic review Ohlsson et al. refrained from recommendations regarding high dose IBU because of the limited number of patients enrolled in the studies. Use of paracetamol has been associated with closure of a PDA in studies with only a limited number of preterm infants. Moreover, the high dose of paracetamol (60 mg/kg/day) that is used to close the PDA gives rise to concerns about safety in preterm infants. Standard ligation after failure of medical closure resulted in an increased incidence of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment in comparison with delayed ligation in a selected population. Of interest, an expectative approach after failure of treatment was followed by 'spontaneous' closure in 67–86% of the patients.

### Active treatment vs expectant management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: a meta-analysis [^55cffebf]. JAMA Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

For decades, the conventional management approach to hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants has been to attempt closure with prostaglandin (PG) inhibitors, failing which surgical ligation is usually carried out. The rationale for PDA closure is to avoid cardiac failure and pulmonary overperfusion from a left-to-right shunt, which may minimize various PDA-associated morbidities, such as intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), for which PDA is thought to be an important causative factor.

Since the 2000s, however, there has been a shift toward less aggressive treatment for PDA because despite some success with pharmacologic closure, no other benefit could be conclusively demonstrated. The pharmacologic agents used also have some serious adverse effects. In addition, rates of spontaneous PDA closure in infants with a birth weight of 1000 g or more were very high in previous studies. Surgical ligation of PDA is accompanied by substantial risks and does not guarantee a good outcome. Nevertheless, in the majority of neonatal intensive care units, infants with a birth weight of less than 1000 g are still being routinely treated for hemodynamically significant PDA, despite reports of noninferiority of an expectant management approach. Sung et alcompared outcomes between 2 historical cohorts of infants with a gestational age (GA) of 23 to 26 weeks. During the earlier period, the protocol was mandatory PDA closure, with 82% of infants undergoing PDA ligation at a mean (SD) age of 12 (7) days. In the later period, no infant received indomethacin or underwent PDA ligation. Rates of BPD were notably higher in the mandatory PDA closure cohort.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing active treatment vs expectant management of PDA are challenging to conduct because there is often insufficient clinician equipoise, resulting in difficulty in patient recruitment. Sosenko et aland Kluckow et alwere the first to conduct trials using an echocardiography-guided targeted approach to the treatment of the PDA. Clyman et alconducted the largest RCT of pharmacologic treatment vs expectant management of PDA for preterm infants. Their results did not show better outcomes for the active treatment group. Instead, active treatment demonstrated harm in a certain subgroup of infants. Two similar large trials were completed in 2023 and 2024. The results of these large trials could potentially affect the way we manage PDA in preterm infants. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing active treatment vs expectant management of PDA.

### Paracetamol (acetaminophen) for patent ductus arteriosus in preterm or low birth weight infants [^ff6e7d13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The different management strategies for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants are expectant management, surgery, or medical treatment with non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that paracetamol may be an effective and safe agent for the closure of a PDA.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of paracetamol as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy via any route of administration, compared with placebo, no intervention, or another prostaglandin inhibitor, for prophylaxis or treatment of an echocardiographically-diagnosed PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trials registers on 13 October 2021, and one other database on 1 March 2022. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs in which paracetamol (single-agent or combination therapy) was compared to no intervention, placebo, or other agents used for closure of PDA, irrespective of dose, duration, and mode of administration in preterm infants. Two independent authors reviewed the search results and made a final selection of potentially eligible articles through discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: failure of ductal closure after the first course of treatment; all-cause mortality during initial hospital stay; and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Main Results

For this update, we included 27 studies enrolling 2278 infants. We considered the overall risk of bias in the 27 studies to vary from low to unclear. We identified 24 ongoing studies. Paracetamol versus ibuprofen There was probably little to no difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for failure of ductal closure after the first course (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.18; 18 studies, 1535 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was likely little to no difference between paracetamol and ibuprofen for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.48; 8 studies, 734 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and for NEC (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.94; 10 studies, 1015 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Paracetamol versus indomethacin There was little to no difference between paracetamol and indomethacin for failure of ductal closure after the first course (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.33; 4 studies, 380 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between paracetamol and indomethacin for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.92; 2 studies, 114 infants; low-certainty evidence). The rate of NEC may be lower in the paracetamol group (3.7%) versus the indomethacin group(9.2%) (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.96; 4 studies, 384 infants; low-certainty evidence). Prophylactic paracetamol versus placebo/no intervention Prophylactic paracetamol (17%) compared to placebo/no intervention (61%) may reduce failure of ductal closure after one course (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.42; 3 studies, 240 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between prophylactic paracetamol and placebo/no intervention for all-cause mortality during hospital stay (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.44; 3 studies, 240 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on NEC. Early paracetamol treatment versus placebo/no intervention Early paracetamol treatment (28%) compared to placebo/no intervention (79%) may reduce failure of ductal closure after one course when used before 14 days' postnatal age (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53; 2 studies, 127 infants; low-certainty evidence). No studies reported on all-cause mortality during hospital stay or NEC. Late paracetamol treatment versus placebo/no intervention There was little to no difference between late paracetamol and placebo for failure of ductal closure after one course of treatment when used at or after 14 days' postnatal age (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence) or NEC (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.76; 1 study, 55 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for all-cause mortality during hospital stay. Paracetamol combined with ibuprofen versus ibuprofen combined with placebo or no intervention There was little to no difference between paracetamol plus ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen plus placebo or no intervention for failure of ductal closure after the first course (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.36; 2 studies, 111 infants; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between paracetamol plus ibuprofen compared to ibuprofen plus placebo or no intervention for NEC (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.45; 1 study, 24 infants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for all-cause mortality during hospital stay. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and ibuprofen; low-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference in effectiveness between paracetamol and indomethacin; low-certainty evidence suggests that prophylactic paracetamol may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; low-certainty evidence suggests that early paracetamol treatment may be more effective than placebo/no intervention; low-certainty evidence suggests that there is probably little or no difference between late paracetamol treatment and placebo, and probably little or no difference in effectiveness between the combination of paracetamol plus ibuprofen versus ibuprofen alone for the closure of PDA after the first course of treatment. The majority of neonates included in these studies were of moderate preterm gestation. Thus, establishing the efficacy and safety of paracetamol for PDA treatment in extremely low birth weight (ELBW: birth weight < 1000 grams) and extremely low gestational age neonates (ELGANs < 28 weeks' gestation) requires further studies.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^f77f4764]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The strengths of this investigation include a prospective cohort design within a unique population of untreated infants with PDA, and innovative modeling using advanced echocardiography, biomarkers, and clinical measures to accurately predict not only spontaneous PDA closure timing, but which infants with persistent PDA are at the highest risk for worsened PDA-associated outcomes (mortality, CLD, neurodevelopmental impairment). This novel approach will fulfill a critical American Academy of Pediatrics clinical research objective by determining the relative added contribution of echocardiography and biomarkers at specific weekly intervals over measurable clinical risk factors alone. Following optimization of our prediction models using 10-fold cross validation and penalized regression, all prediction models will be independently validated in a second cohort of patients.

The results from this study will immediately inform clinical decision-making and, as a critical step to designing trials that will enroll appropriate participants in randomized trials, will ultimately lead to improved outcomes for preterm infants with PDA. Our weekly prediction models for the first postnatal month, the period when pharmacologic and early interventional closure decisions must be made, will aid practicing clinicians to avoid pharmacologically treating infants unlikely to benefit, and randomized-trial planners to develop evidence-based trial designs to determine whether pharmacologic and interventional PDA closure is beneficial in specific prenatal infant populations, and when PDA treatment is most effective. Because of our diverse population of < 30-weeks gestation preterm infants within both delivery and referral hospitals' NICUs in one of the largest allied NICU networks in the United States, we anticipate findings will be applicable to similar preterm infants with PDA throughout the U.S. and developed world.

Although this study uses a prospective cohort and rigorously designed observational study design to answer proposed questions that cannot be answered with a randomized trial, but that are crucial to future PDA trial development, confounding is a potential problem. We will carefully control for known confounders using clinical markers that are validated predictors of our primary outcomes.

Early mortality precludes PDA-closure and development of PDA-associated outcomes. Our team has experience in applying composite outcomes and guarding against mortality-associated biases, such as for immortal-time bias, in the preterm infant population. For Aim 2 we will employ a primary mortality or CLD composite outcome at 36-weeks PMA, the accepted practice among neonatal randomized trialists. For Aim 1 (spontaneous closure) outcomes we will employ Fine and Gray subdistribution hazards models, which will allow us to account for competing mortality risks and limit the analysis to observed follow-up time. In Aim 3 (neurodevelopmental outcomes at 22 to 26-months) we will explore using joint models to account for drop out and potential death.

### Acetaminophen for the patent ductus arteriosus: has safety been adequately demonstrated? [^e7f60849]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular condition diagnosed in premature infants. Acetaminophen was first proposed as a potential treatment for PDA in 2011. Since that time acetaminophen use among extremely preterm neonates has increased substantially. The limited available data demonstrate that acetaminophen reduces PDA without evident hepatotoxicity. These findings have led some to suggest that acetaminophen is a safe and effective therapy for PDA closure. However, the lack of apparent hepatoxicity is predictable. Acetaminophen induced cellular injury is due to CYP2E1 derived metabolites; and hepatocyte CYP2E1 expression is low in the fetal and neonatal period. Here, we review preclinical and clinical data that support the hypothesis that the lung, which expresses high levels of CYP2E1 during fetal and early postnatal development, may be particularly susceptible to acetaminophen induced toxicity. Despite these emerging data, the true potential pulmonary risks and benefits of acetaminophen for PDA closure are largely unknown. The available clinical studies in are marked by significant weakness including low sample sizes and minimal evaluation of extremely preterm infants who are typically at highest risk of pulmonary morbidity. We propose that studies interrogating mechanisms linking developmentally regulated, cell-specific CYP2E1 expression and acetaminophen-induced toxicity as well as robust assessment of pulmonary outcomes in large trials that evaluate the safety and efficacy of acetaminophen in extremely preterm infants are needed.

### Oral ibuprofen versus intravenous ibuprofen or intravenous indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed7adaa0]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacological closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is commonly achieved by intravenous (IV) administration of ibuprofen or indomethacin. Occasionally, oral ibuprofen is used for PDA treatment although its efficacy and safety are unclear.

Objectives

To systematically review randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing oral ibuprofen with IV ibuprofen or IV indomethacin for closure of PDA in preterm infants.

Methods

The standard search methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were used.

Results

We identified two studies (n = 166) of good methodological quality comparing oral ibuprofen with IV ibuprofen and three small trials (n = 92) of moderate methodological quality comparing oral ibuprofen to IV indomethacin. Meta-analysis showed higher PDA closure rate of oral ibuprofen versus IV ibuprofen but no difference between oral ibuprofen and IV indomethacin. Meta-analysis did not indicate a significant difference in adverse effects.

Conclusion

Oral ibuprofen for PDA closure appears to be as effective as IV ibuprofen and IV indomethacin. Due to small sample size, lack of data in extremely preterm neonates, and methodological limitations of reviewed trials, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn. Randomized trials with a low risk of bias and adequate sample size in extremely preterm infants are urgently needed.

### Fluid restriction for treatment of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^ac3eab50]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel connecting the main pulmonary artery and the proximal descending aorta. After birth, the ductus arteriosus usually closes completely. However, sometimes it remains patent in the neonate, which is called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). If a PDA is clinically symptomatic, it can lead to overcirculation in the lungs, and reduced perfusion to the gut and kidneys. Most clinical practice guidelines suggest fluid restriction as a conservative management strategy for the treatment of symptomatic PDA. Restricting fluid has been shown to reduce the incidence of PDA in older preterm infants. However, aggressive restriction of fluids may affect systemic blood flow in extremely preterm infants. Given the potential adverse effects, it is important to systematically evaluate the evidence on the use of fluid restriction to treat symptomatic PDA to inform clinical decisions.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluid restriction on morbidity and mortality for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in October 2023. We also searched Clinicaltrials.gov, ICTRP, ANZCTR, and Epistemonikos. We planned to search the reference list of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for studies not identified by the database searches, but did not identify any.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs, and cross-over RCTs. We planned to include neonates who were born preterm (less than 37 weeks' gestational age), or with low birth weight (less than 2500 g), with a symptomatic PDA, diagnosed either clinically or by echocardiographic criteria, in the neonatal period. We planned to include studies that compared therapeutic restriction of parenteral or enteral fluids, or both, with or without diuretics, with control groups that received standard fluid intake, defined as no parenteral or enteral restriction, with or without diuretic use.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was closure of PDA. Other relevant outcomes were all-cause mortality by 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, need for interventional closure of the PDA, need for treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, and duration of hospitalization. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We did not identify any completed or ongoing RCTs that met our inclusion criteria and explored the effectiveness and safety of fluid restriction to treat symptomatic PDA.

Authors' Conclusions

No evidence from RCTs is currently available to evaluate the benefits and harms of fluid restriction for the treatment of symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants. We identified no ongoing studies. Evidence from sufficiently powered RCTs evaluating fluid restriction for treatment of symptomatic PDA in preterm neonates is needed to inform clinical decisions.

### At a crossroads for early medical treatment of persistent patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^4ec0e01a]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Administration of early medical therapy for the patent ductus arteriosus has ebbed and flowed through the years, with a multitude of studies failing to demonstrate a reduction in morbidity or mortality from ductal closure in the preterm population. Concerningly, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated an increase in morbidity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and mortality with the use of early medical therapy to close the ductus. Considering information regarding potential risk without clear benefit in an overall cohort of preterm patients with a patent ductus, use of early medical therapy is increasingly challenging to justify and necessitates studies that will aid in identifying a patient population that would benefit from ductal closure and timing of therapy.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: a contemporary perspective for the pediatric and adult cardiac care provider [^6c96af9a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The burden of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) continues to be significant. In view of marked differences in preterm infants versus more mature, term counterparts (viewed on a continuum with adolescent and adult patients), mechanisms regulating ductal patency, genetic contributions, clinical consequences, and diagnostic and treatment thresholds are discussed separately, when appropriate. Among both preterm infants and older children and adults, a range of hemodynamic profiles highlighting the markedly variable consequences of the PDA are provided. In most contemporary settings, transcatheter closure is preferable over surgical ligation, but data on longer‐term outcomes, particularly among preterm infants, are lacking. The present review provides recommendations to identify gaps in PDA diagnosis, management, and treatment on which subsequent research can be developed. Ultimately, the combination of refined diagnostic thresholds and expanded treatment options provides the best opportunities to address the burden of PDA. Although fundamental gaps remain unanswered, the present review provides pediatric and adult cardiac care providers with a contemporary framework in PDA care to support the practice of evidence‐based medicine.

### Does early-targeted risk-based management of a patent ductus arteriosus improve outcomes in preterm infants? Insights from an observational study [^0c8503ae]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study provides hypothesis-generating evidence suggesting that a stratified, risk-based approach to PDA management may improve outcomes in high-risk infants who achieve successful ductal closure while simultaneously minimising unnecessary interventions in low-risk infants. However, the findings also highlight the high rate of treatment failure in high-risk infants, emphasising the need to refine strategies to improve ductal closure rates in this vulnerable subgroup. The potential value of tools such as the EL-Khuffash PDAsc in guiding early-targeted management in preterm infants is promising, despite the fact that the limitations of this observational study preclude definitive conclusions. Further research, including well-designed RCTs that focus specifically on high-risk subgroups, are needed to validate the important observations seen in this study, elucidate the mechanisms behind treatment success or treatment failure and explore the long-term impact of PDA management strategies.

### Ibuprofen for the prevention of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and / or low birth weight infants [^99f1a154]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants and increases the risk of adverse outcomes. Indomethacin has been the standard treatment to close a PDA but is associated with renal, gastrointestinal, and cerebral side effects. Ibuprofen has less effect on blood flow velocity to important organs.

Objectives

Primary objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo/no intervention, or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs in the prevention of PDA in preterm infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 17 October 2018), Embase (1980 to 17 October 2018), and CINAHL; 1982 to 17 October 2018). We searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing ibuprofen with placebo/no intervention or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor drugs to prevent PDA in preterm or low birth weight infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted outcomes data including presence of PDA on day three or four of life (after 72 hours of treatment), need for surgical ligation or rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, mortality, cerebral, renal, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal complications. We performed meta-analyses and reported treatment estimates as typical mean difference (MD), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and, if statistically significant, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) or to harm (NNTH), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed between-study heterogeneity by the I-squared test (I²). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

In this updated analysis, we included nine trials (N = 1070 infants) comparing prophylactic ibuprofen (IV or oral) with placebo/no intervention or indomethacin. Ibuprofen (IV or oral) probably decreases the risk of PDA on day 3 or 4 (typical RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.48; typical RD -0.26, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.21; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 9 trials; N = 1029) (moderate-quality evidence). In the control group, the spontaneous closure rate was 58% by day 3 to 4 of age. In addition, ibuprofen probably decreases the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (typical RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.26; typical RD -0.27, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.22; NNTB 4; 95% CI 3 to 5), and the need for surgical ductal ligation (typical RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.96; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.05 to -0.00; NNTB 33, 95% CI 20 to infinity; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). There was a possible decrease in the risk of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) in infants receiving prophylactic ibuprofen (typical RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00; I² = 34%; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to- 0.00; I² = 60%; 7 trials; N = 925) (moderate-quality evidence). High quality evidence showed increased risk for oliguria (typical RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.02; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11; NNTH 17, 95% CI 9 to 100; 4 trials; N = 747). Low quality results from four studies (N = 202) showed that administering oral ibuprofen may decrease the risk of PDA (typical RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74) and may increase risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (NNTH 7, 95% CI 4 to 25). No evidence of a difference was identified for mortality, any intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), or chronic lung disease.

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that prophylactic use of ibuprofen, compared to placebo or no intervention, probably decreases the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, the need for rescue treatment with cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, and for surgical ductal closure. Adverse effects associated with ibuprofen (IV or oral) included increased risks for oliguria, increase in serum creatinine levels, and increased risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. There was a reduced risk for intraventricular haemorrhage (grade III - IV) but no evidence of a difference in mortality, chronic lung disease, necrotising enterocolitis, or time to reach full feeds. In the control group, the patent ductus arteriosus had closed spontaneously by day 3 or 4 in 58% of neonates. Prophylactic treatment exposes a large proportion of infants unnecessarily to a drug that has important side effects without conferring any important short-term benefits. Current evidence does not support the use of ibuprofen for prevention of patent ductus arteriosus. Until long-term follow-up results of the trials included in this review have been published, no further trials of prophylactic ibuprofen are recommended. A new approach to patent ductus arteriosus management is an early targeted treatment based on echocardiographic criteria within the first 72 hours of life, that have a high sensitivity for diagnosing a patent ductus arteriosus that is unlikely to close spontaneously. Such trials are currently ongoing in many parts of the world. Results of such trials will be included in updates of our "Ibuprofen for treatment of PDA" review.

### Early treatment versus expectant management of hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus for preterm infants [^4ffab5a3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to prevent or treat a PDA. There are concerns regarding adverse effects of NSAIDs in preterm infants. Controversy exists on whether early targeted treatment of a hemodynamically significant (hs) PDA improves clinical outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of early treatment strategies versus expectant management for an hs-PDA in reducing mortality and morbidity in preterm infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 6) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 31 May 2019), Embase (1980 to 31 May 2019), and CINAHL (1982 to 31 May 2019). An updated search was run on 2 October 2020 in the following databases: CENTRAL via CRS Web and MEDLINE via Ovid. We searched clinical trial databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomized trials.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs in which early pharmacological treatment, defined as treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth, was compared to no intervention, placebo or other non-pharmacological expectant management strategies for treatment of an hs-PDA in preterm (< 37 weeks' postmenstrual age) or low birth weight (< 2500 grams) infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed data collection and analyses in accordance with the methods of Cochrane Neonatal. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospital stay. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for selected clinical outcomes.

Main Results

We included 14 RCTs that enrolled 910 infants. Seven RCTs compared early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by seven days of age) versus expectant management and seven RCTs compared very early treatment (defined as treatment initiated by 72 hours of age) versus expectant management. No difference was demonstrated between early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first seven days after birth) for an hs-PDA for the primary outcome of 'all-cause mortality' (6 studies; 500 infants; typical RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; typical RD -0.02; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence), or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (4 studies; 432 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.80; typical RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.03; very low-certainty evidence), chronic lung disease (CLD) (4 studies; 339 infants; typical RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.29; typical RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence), severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (2 studies; 171 infants; typical RR 0.83,95% CI 0.32 to 2.16; typical RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.08 to 0.06; low-certainty evidence), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (5 studies; 473 infants; typical RR 2.34,95% CI 0.86 to 6.41; typical RD 0.04; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08; low-certainty evidence). Infants receiving early treatment in the first seven days after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (2 studies; 232 infants; typical RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.86 to 2.83; typical RD 0.57; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.66; low-certainty evidence). No difference was demonstrated between very early treatment versus expectant management (no treatment initiated within the first 72 hours after birth) for an hs-PDA for the primary outcome of 'all-cause mortality' (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.53; typical RD -0.03; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; moderate-certainty evidence) or other important outcomes such as surgical PDA ligation (5 studies; 293 infants; typical RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.17; typical RD -0.01; 95% CI -0.05 to 0.02; moderate-certainty evidence), CLD (7 studies; 384 infants; typical RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.08; typical RD -0.05; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.04; low-certainty evidence), severe IVH (4 studies, 240 infants; typical RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.93; typical RD -0.02; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04; moderate-certainty evidence), NEC (5 studies; 332 infants; typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.21; typical RD 0.01; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.06; moderate-certainty evidence) and neurodevelopmental impairment (1 study; 79 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.31 for moderate/severe cognitive delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.71 for moderate/severe motor delay at 18 to 24 months; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.78 for moderate/severe language delay at 18 to 24 months; low-certainty evidence). Infants receiving very early treatment in the first 72 hours after birth were more likely to receive any PDA pharmacotherapy compared to expectant management (4 studies; 156 infants; typical RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.05; typical RD 0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79; very low-certainty evidence). Very early treatment, however, shortened the duration of hospitalization compared to expectant management (4 studies; 260 infants; MD -5.35 days; 95% CI -9.23 to -1.47; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Early or very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of an hs-PDA probably does not reduce mortality in preterm infants (moderate-certainty evidence). Early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs-PDA may increase NSAID exposure (low-certainty evidence) without likely reducing CLD (moderate-certainty evidence), severe IVH or NEC (low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether very early pharmacotherapeutic treatment of hs-PDA also increases NSAID exposure (very low-certainty evidence). Very early treatment probably does not reduce surgical PDA ligation, severe IVH or NEC (moderate-certainty evidence), and may not reduce CLD or neurodevelopmental impairment (low-certainty evidence). Additional large trials that specifically include preterm infants at the highest risk of PDA-attributable morbidity, are adequately powered for patient-important outcomes and are minimally contaminated by open-label treatment are required to explore if early targeted treatment of hs-PDA improves clinical outcomes. There are currently two trials awaiting classification and two ongoing trials exploring this question.

### Percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure in very preterm infants: feasibility and complications [^9c5affe0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with morbidity 1 and mortality. 2 Closure of the ductus occurs within hours in the majority (> 95%) of term infants (≥ 37 weeks of gestation). 3 In contrast, a persistent PDA, defined as failure of the ductus to close within 72 hours postnatal age, is seen in ≈50% of very preterm infants (born at < 32 weeks of gestation). 2 Although a cause‐and‐effect relationship between PDAs and adverse outcomes has not been established, 4 odds for death are sixfold higher in premature infants with a persistent PDA (failure of spontaneous or pharmacological closure) than with a closed ductus. 5 Moreover, PDAs are considered precursors to respiratory morbidity, including prolonged ventilator dependency. 2, 6

Treatment of PDAs remains a subject of tremendous controversy and debate. 4 General consensus is that a PDA should be closed by 2 years of age to avoid the risks of pulmonary hypertension or bacterial endocarditis, 7 but disagreement remains about the thresholds and strategies for PDA closure among premature infants earlier in life. 8 Until recently, the only alternatives to close a PDA were drug therapy or surgical ligation. However, recent data showing drug therapy and surgical ligation to be independent risk factors for moderate‐to‐severe functional disability, developmental delay, and motor impairment 9 have led healthcare providers to consider alternative strategies of PDA closure.

Catheter‐based closure of the PDA is among the safest of interventional cardiac procedures and is considered the procedure of choice among infants ≥ 4 kg. 10 Although an exact lower weight limit for the safe closure of a PDA has not been established, previous studies have excluded preterm infants < 4 kg or reported no cases of percutaneous PDA closure below this weight threshold. 11, 12, 13, 14 While recent case reports suggest catheter‐based PDA closure is feasible among infants < 4 kg, 15, 16 data on the safety of the procedure, including adverse events beyond the immediate catheterization period (eg, posthospitalization), are lacking. 17 Since very premature infants < 4 kg are more complex and medically fragile than are their more mature counterparts, 18 a separate consideration of the short‐ and long‐term risks and benefits of percutaneous PDA closure in this unique subgroup is needed.

### Trial of selective early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with ibuprofen [^e68123fc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of extreme preterm infants with a large PDA, there was no evidence that early treatment with ibuprofen was associated with an improvement in the composite outcome of death or moderate or severe BPD at 36 weeks' post-menstrual age. There were no apparent between-group differences in death or moderate or severe BPD.

Our results are broadly consistent with other studies of early targeted treatment of PDA with ibuprofen that have not demonstrated a convincing benefit in clinical outcomes. – Although these studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of pulmonary hemorrhage and patient symptoms attributable to the PDA, intervention with ibuprofen is not associated with a reduction in the incidence of BPD, mortality or neurodisability. –

Approximately half of the infants we enrolled were less than 26 weeks' gestation, the cohort at greatest risk of developing a hemodynamically significant PDA. We enrolled infants with a large PDA based on a combination of echocardiographic parameters, including the diameter of the PDA and ductal flow characteristics. – The rates of death or moderate or severe BPD in our study were high, but comparable to other randomized trials of early pharmacological treatment of PDA.

A single early course of ibuprofen resulted in a closed or small PDA (confirmed by echocardiography at 3 weeks of age) in only 55.5% of infants randomized to ibuprofen. Although previous studies have reported variable closure rates with early intravenous ibuprofen therapy, our findings are consistent with recent studies in similar patient populations. Variation in the rate of PDA closure among studies is likely explained by differences in the timing of the intervention, an open-label treatment study design, the route of administration of the ibuprofen and the dosing regimen used. Intravenous ibuprofen using a standard dosing regimen was chosen as the intervention in our study because higher doses are usually only used when an infant is 7 days of age or older, and it was the most common treatment schedule for infants with a PDA in the United Kingdom at the time the study was designed. Similarly, most units did not routinely repeat echocardiographic assessment after ibuprofen therapy with the intention of offering a second course if the PDA remained patent.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^4f658637]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

We included 16 Cochrane Reviews (138 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 11,856 preterm infants) on the management of patent ductus arteriosis (PDA) in preterm infants. The number of trials included in each review ranged from none to 39. Six reviews (N = 4976) reported on prophylactic interventions for the prevention of PDA, and included pharmacological prophylaxis with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen) and prophylactic surgical PDA ligation and non‐pharmacologic interventions (chest shielding during phototherapy and restriction of fluid intake). One review (N = 97) reported on the use of indomethacin for the management of asymptomatic PDA. Nine reviews (N = 6783) reported on interventions for the management of symptomatic PDA, and included pharmacotherapy with prostaglandin inhibitor drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen) in various routes and dosages; surgical PDA ligation; and adjunct therapies (use of furosemide and dopamine in conjunction with indomethacin). The certainty of the evidence, when reported by the respective reviews for the primary outcomes for prevention of PDA, ranged from moderate to low, while those for the primary outcomes for treatment of PDA, ranged from high to low.

Interventions for prevention of PDA and related complications in preterm infants

Prophylactic indomethacin probably reduces severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), while it does not appear to affect the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability. Prophylactic ibuprofen probably marginally reduces severe IVH (moderate‐certainty evidence), while the evidence is very uncertain on the effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on severe IVH. There is no evidence on the effect of either prophylactic ibuprofen or acetaminophen on the composite outcome of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability. There is a paucity of evidence for any other prophylactic intervention on the primary outcomes of severe IVH and the composite of death or moderate/severe neurodevelopmental disability.

With respect to other patient‐important outcomes, both prophylactic indomethacin and ibuprofen (moderate‐certainty evidence) reduced the need for invasive PDA closure. Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) appeared to be lower with both prophylactic surgical ligation and fluid restriction. There was no effect of the other prophylactic interventions on any other clinically relevant outcomes, such as mortality or chronic lung disease (CLD).

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials evaluating PDA treatment

We searched for all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PDA treatment in the US National Library of Medicine (Medline), Cochrane Library, EMBASE anddatabase, using the Mesh terms: 'infant, newborn' AND 'ductus arteriosus, patent', combined with 'indomethacin' OR 'ibuprofen' OR 'cyclooxygenase inhibitors' OR 'paracetamol'. This search revealed a total of 787 hits. We excluded non-randomised studies and RCTs that are not placebo-controlled. Some eligible studies had to be excluded due to language (non-English) or unavailable full text. A total of 32 RCTs were included in a systematic review. Data on the outcome parameters were extracted independently by two reviewers (WO and WdB) and entered into Review Manager Software for meta-analysis (Revman version 5.3 Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Random effects meta-analysis of the 32 included studies showed that, when compared with placebo, COXi are effective in ductal closure on the short term, since the risk ratio for failure of ductal closure is 0.44 (0.38–0.50). However, this was not associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity (Table 1).

CI, Confidence interval; BPD, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia; PNA, Postnatal age; PMA, Postmenstrual age; NEC, Necrotising enterocolitis (any grade); IVH, Intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade)

Based on these data, it has been assumed that PDA treatment, although it does lead to a higher rate of ductal closure, does not lead to a significant better outcome. However, critical analysis of the data shows that a substantial part (up to 85%) of the control group was actually treated for PDA (Fig. 1). So, instead of concluding that PDA treatment does not lead to a better outcome it can only be concluded that there is no significant difference in early versus later or delayed treatment, due to the high amount of treated infants in the control group.

Quality of the evidence

The quality of reviews as assessed by the AMSTAR 2 criteria was variable. We only judged two reviews to be of high quality, while five were of low quality, and two of critically low quality (Table 2). Reviews that we judged as critically low quality failed to use a satisfactory technique for assessing the risk of bias in individual studies, in addition to omissions in other critical domains of the AMSTAR 2 criteria. Of note, none of the included reviews provided a rationale for including only randomised controlled trials in their review. This may be associated with Cochrane Neonatal's approach of traditionally including only RCTs in reviews of interventions to obtain the most unbiased estimates of treatment effects. However, in the absence of well‐done RCTs, other study designs, such as large observational studies, may be an important source of evidence, especially related to the safety of the interventions. Further, the majority of the reviews did not explicitly include information on funding sources for the trials. This did have an impact on the quality of the reviews as per the AMSTAR 2 criteria, as full disclosure of any funding is important to ensure that no financial incentive introduced bias (Lundh 2017).

Only five of the Cochrane Reviews assessed the overall certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology (Evans 2021; Jasani 2022; Mitra 2020a; Ohlsson 2020a; Ohlsson 2020b). We did not reassess the certainty of evidence, but summarised the certainty assessed by the respective review authors. With regard to the primary outcomes defined in this overview, the certainty of the evidence was not reported for all available interventions. For PDA prevention, the certainty of the evidence, which was available only for prophylactic ibuprofen for the primary outcome of severe IVH, was deemed to be moderate. The certainty of the evidence was not assessed for interventions for the management of asymptomatic PDA. While for symptomatic PDA treatment, the certainty of the evidence for the primary outcome of failure of PDA closure was available for all available prostaglandin inhibitor drugs. The overall certainty for symptomatic PDA closure was high for indomethacin, moderate for ibuprofen, and moderate‐low for acetaminophen. The most common reason for downgrading the certainty of the evidence was serious risk of bias, followed by imprecision in effect estimates.

### The effect of ibuprofen exposure and patient characteristics on the closure of the patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^ed741468]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The ductus arteriosus usually closes within hours after birth of a term born infant, but in prematurely born neonates closure is often delayed or does not occur spontaneously, resulting in a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The consequent ductal left‐to‐right shunt can result in increased pulmonary blood flow and systemic hypoperfusion, which in turn can lead to comorbidities, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and renal failure.

Spontaneous closure of the ductus is an effect of multiple complex physiological mechanisms. A drop in prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) levels due to lost supply by the placenta after birth is one of these mechanisms. Because of higher sensitivity to PGE 2 earlier in pregnancy, this mechanism of ductus closure may be less effective in preterm infants. Cyclo‐oxygenase (COX) inhibitors can be used to pharmacologically stimulate closure of the ductus by decreasing PGE 2 production. Other suggested mechanisms that make preterm infants more prone for PDA are an increased nitric oxide sensitivity in combination with decreased expression of ion channels in the ductus that induce vasodilation, and an immature anatomy of the ductus that postpones anatomic closure.

Besides other drugs, such as acetaminophen and indomethacin, the COX‐inhibitor ibuprofen is the most frequently used for the treatment of PDA. The effects of ibuprofen have been compared with placebo or to alternative treatments, such as indomethacin. In a meta‐analysis of all currently studied treatment strategies, oral ibuprofen treatment with 20 mg/kg on the first day of treatment, followed by 10 mg/kg daily on days 2 and 3, was shown to be the most effective for PDA closure. This analysis did not identify patient characteristics, such as gestational age (GA) or postnatal age (PNA) as confounding factors, but might have been limited by the fact that these characteristics were not always reported in the examined studies. The probability of spontaneous closure increases with GA, and as a result the effectiveness of ibuprofen may appear higher in infants with a lower GA compared with studies in infants with a higher GA. Moreover, most studies reported on scenarios in which ibuprofen treatment is started within the first few days of life. The clearance of ibuprofen increases with PNA, resulting in a lower exposure to ibuprofen. These factors should be considered simultaneously for the evaluation of the efficacy of ibuprofen.

### Prolonged versus short course of indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^1c5dfc51]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Indomethacin is a prostaglandin inhibitor used to treat patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants. Although indomethacin produces ductal closure in the majority of cases, it is ineffective in up to 40% of patients. Furthermore, the ductus will re-open in up to 35% of infants who initially respond to the drug. Prolonging the course of indomethacin has the potential to achieve higher rates of ductal closure.

Objectives

To determine the effect of a prolonged course of indomethacin (compared to a short course) on the rate of treatment failure without unwanted side-effects in preterm infants with PDA.

Search Strategy

The search included review of personal files, abstracts of conferences, and the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006), EMBASE (1974 to December 2006), and Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials including preterm infants with PDA, diagnosed on clinical and/or echocardiographic examination that evaluated indomethacin treatment by any route given as a long course (four or more doses) vs. a short course (three or fewer doses) were included in the review. Trials needed to report on at least one of the following outcomes: failure of PDA to close, need for re-treatment, PDA re-opening, PDA ligation, mortality, duration of assisted ventilation, chronic lung disease (CLD), duration of supplemental oxygen dependence, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (all and severe), diminished urine output, increased serum creatinine, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bleeding diathesis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and duration of hospital stay.

Data Collection and Analysis

The three review authors independently abstracted data from each study. Relative risk (RR) and Risk Difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed effect model for meta-analysis are reported. When a statistically significant RD was found, the number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) was also calculated with 95% CIs. The I squared statistic was used to test for heterogeneity of results among included trials.

Main Results

Five trials met inclusion criteria and included 431 infants. Prolonged indomethacin treatment when compared to the short course did not result in a statistically significant difference in PDA closure, re-treatment, re-opening, or ligation rates. The prolonged course was associated with an increased risk of NEC [typical RR 1.87 (95% CI 1.07, 3.27); typical RD 0.08 (95% CI 0.01, 0.15); NNH 13 (7, 100)] and a decreased incidence of renal function impairment, as evidenced by a lower proportion of infants having diminished urine output [typical RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.13, 0.6); typical RD -0.19 (95% CI -0.28, -0.09); NNT 5 (4, 11)] and increased serum creatinine level [typical RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.33, 0.77); typical RD -0.14 (95% CI -0.23, -0.06); NNT 7 (4, 16)].

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceProlonged indomethacin course does not appear to have a significant effect on improving important outcomes, such as PDA treatment failure, CLD, IVH, or mortality. The reduction of transient renal impairment does not outweigh the increased risk of NEC associated with the prolonged course. Based on these results, a prolonged course of indomethacin cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of PDA in preterm infants. Implications for researchThere is a paucity of data on optimal dosing and duration of indomethacin therapy for the treatment of PDA, in particular for extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) premature infants. It is likely that a single standard indomethacin regime is not the ideal for every premature infant. Therefore, individual patient response should be considered and evaluated, in particular in ELBW infants. Future randomized clinical trials should include this high risk population and investigate the effect of tailoring dose and duration of therapy to individual response in terms of echocardiographic findings and/or prostaglandin levels, focusing on clinically significant outcomes, including long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. In addition, factors that may influence treatment effect, such as birth weight, gestational age, age at the time of randomization, total fluid intake, feeding practice, and severity of PDA, need to be taken into account when designing such studies.

### Platelets and ductus arteriosus closure in neonates [^26574bb8]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Platelet plug formation is critically involved in murine ductus arteriosus closure and thrombocytopenia in preterm infants seems to negatively affect spontaneous and pharmacologically induced ductal closure. Furthermore, platelet dysfunction may contribute to ductal patency, especially in extremely immature infants. Neonatal platelets likely have multifaceted roles during ductal closure, such as secretion of several signaling molecules and facilitation of specific cell-cell interactions. The only available randomized-controlled trial on platelet transfusions in preterm infants with patent ductus arteriosus demonstrated that a liberal transfusion regimen did not promote ductal closure, but was associated with an increased rate of intraventricular hemorrhage. Herein, we discuss the available mechanistic evidence on the role of platelets in ductus arteriosus closure and their potential clinical implications in preterm infants. We further briefly outline future research directions aimed at a better understanding of platelet-endothelial interactions in neonatal health and disease.

Acetaminophen

Recent reports have suggested that acetaminophen (paracetamol) might be a less toxic, but similarly effective, alternative to indomethacin or ibuprofen for inducing ductal closure. Most reports are anecdotal, without controls, and there are few randomized trials. The 2 randomized trials comparing acetaminophen with placeboor no treatmentenrolled a combined total of 80 subjects and found that treatment reduced the RR of ductal patency after 4 to 5 days of treatment by 51% (RD, −0.21; RR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.24–1.00]). No differences in mortality, oxygen use at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, or other outcomes were observed. Several small trials comparing acetaminophen with ibuprofen or indomethacin found no differences in rates of ductal closure between the treatments, suggesting therapeutic equivalence. However, prospective nonrandomized data from the Early Treatment Versus Delayed Conservative Treatment of the Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA‐TOLERATE) trial indicate that acetaminophen is no more effective than conservative treatment and is less effective than indomethacin in inducing ductal closure.

Pharmacogenetics of Drug Treatment for PDA

Recent evidence has shown that unpredictable responses to pharmacological PDA treatments (eg, indomethacin and ibuprofen) may reflect differences in developmental trajectory (ontogeny), genetic variability of drug‐metabolizing enzymes, and drug targets. For example, current weight‐based dosing of indomethacin leads to variable drug exposures, with up to 14‐fold variation in drug concentrations 24 hours after identical intravenous drug dosing. To that end, genetic variability in indomethacin metabolism may explain the variability observed in drug exposures. Indomethacin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, primarily CYP2C9, and uridine 5'‐diphospho‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. Infants have low expression levels of CYP2C9 in fetal and early neonatal life, and UGT enzymes are also expressed at relatively low levels. For both enzymes, expression matures rapidly during infancy.

In addition, CYP2C9 genotype has been associated with response to indomethacin in preterm infants with PDA. The G allele of rs2153628 was associated with increased odds of response to indomethacin in the case‐control analysis (OR, 1.918 [95% CI, 1.056–3.483]). Moreover, the polymorphism CYP2C92 was associated with drug failure in a multicenter cohort study of preterm infants receiving indomethacin for PDA. The mechanisms by which variants in these and other genes alter NSAID responses have not been established, but may relate to the complex molecular network regulating ductal patency before and after birth.

Persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants is associated with increased mortality and worsened respiratory outcomes, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD),; however, data supporting the causal association between PDA and these outcomes are lacking. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to accelerate PDA closure, they have remained ineffective in improving mortality, long-term respiratory outcomes, or neurodevelopment, irrespective of the NSAIDs used. Multicenter cohort studies have reported substantial decreases in the rates of medical and surgical treatments of PDA in very low-birth-weight infants. However, it is unclear whether the conservative nonintervention approaches for PDA are associated with reduced BPD or death in preterm infants.,

In the recently conducted PDA — To Leave It Alone or Respond and Treat Early (PDA-TOLERATE) randomized clinical trial, early, routine pharmacologic treatment did not improve respiratory outcomes compared with conservative management. However, this study could have had a selection bias owing to the low enrollment rate of eligible infants, and the high rate of backup medical and surgical treatment of PDA might be another limitation. Therefore, in the present double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled noninferiority trial, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of exclusive pharmacologic treatment with oral ibuprofen vs nonintervention placebo therapy, with few backup treatments for closing PDA and thereby reducing BPD or death in very preterm infants.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^dd77c59e]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment is linked to nephrotoxicity, acute renal failure, decreased cerebral and intestinal blood flow, intestinal perforation when co-administered with glucocorticoids, and failure to close the PDA in one-third of infants, and costs between $1458 to $1875 per three-dose treatment course. Acetaminophen, a less studied medical option, is associated with neurologic impairment. Surgical ligation via thoracotomy requires exposure to general anesthesia. Vocal-cord paralysis and post-operative hemodynamic instability are also potential risks. PDA closure via heart catheterization is potentially less-invasive; however, it remains understudied and carries potential complications including arterial injury. Since all forms of PDA closure are expensive and associated with adverse effects, treatment harms may outweigh benefits, especially for the majority of infants destined for early, spontaneous PDA closure.

Still, treatment of some infants with symptomatic PDA is necessary. A subset of preterm infants with persistent PDA continues to display PDA-associated symptoms, including volume overloading of their immature heart and lungs, and worsening respiratory failure. Chronic PDA exposure is associated with congestive heart failure and death.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and experts on PDA in preterm infants agree that future outcomes-based randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effectiveness of selective pharmacological and/or interventional treatments for "high-risk" infants with PDA. The goal is to eventually deliver prompt, personalized PDA treatment to only those infants most likely to benefit, thereby reducing the side-effects and costs associated with unnecessary and potentially harmful PDA overtreatment. Unfortunately, no validated prediction models currently exist to permit early identification of those infants with increased probabilities of persistent PDA and PDA-associated harm. As a first step in trial design, the American Academy of Pediatrics has called for the development of comprehensive, echocardiographic- and biomarker-based PDA risk-stratification tools.

The objectives of this study are to use a prospective cohort of untreated preterm infants with PDA to accurately predict the timing of spontaneous ductal closure (and conversely, long-term ductal patency) in preterm infants with PDA, and the identification of measurable echocardiographic predictors and biomarkers that are present in the first postnatal month that are associated with mortality, chronic lung disease (CLD), and long-term neurological impairment. These results will ultimately improve neonatal patient care by informing the design of outcomes-focused randomized clinical trials that will examine the effectiveness and timing of PDA closure in those "high-risk" infants most likely to receive benefit.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and / or low birth weight infants [^c148665b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants, increasing their risks of developing chronic lung disease (CLD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a PDA, but is associated with reduced blood flow to the brain, kidneys and gut. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective with fewer side effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo or no intervention for closing a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (including indomethacin, mefenamic acid) for closing a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.

Search Strategy

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ibuprofen to placebo or indomethacin or mefenamic acid for therapy of PDA were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2005), MEDLINE (1996 - July 2005), CINAHL (1982 - July 2005), EMBASE (1980 - July 2005), reference lists of published RCTs and abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies and the European Society for Pediatric Research meetings published in Pediatric Research (1991 - April 2005). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

1) DESIGN: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials 2) POPULATION: Preterm (< 37 weeks gestational age) or low birth weight infants (< 2500 grams) with a clinically or echocardiographically diagnosed PDA 3) INTERVENTION: Administration of ibuprofen for the closure of PDA 4) OUTCOMES: At least one of the following outcomes were reported: failure to close a PDA, mortality, surgical ligation, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), NEC, decreased urine output, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), chronic lung disease (CLD), sepsis, days on supplementary oxygen.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two authors worked independently at each step of the original review, then compared results and resolved differences. The current update was conducted by one author (AO). Methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed according to blinding of randomization, of intervention and of outcome assessment, and completeness of follow up. Weighted treatment effects, calculated using RevMan 4.2, included typical relative risk (RR), typical risk difference (RD), number needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH), and weighted mean difference (WMD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed effect model was used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests including I(2)were performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data.

Main Results

No study using mefenamic acid was identified. One study compared ibuprofen to placebo but results were not reported unblinded to group. Eleven studies including 620 patients compared the effectiveness of ibuprofen to indomethacin for the closure of a PDA. There was no statistically significant heterogeneity of treatment effect for any of the outcomes. For the primary outcome (failure of ductal closure), there was no statistically significant difference between ibuprofen and indomethacin groups [typical RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.74, 1.25)]. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality, surgical duct ligation, duration of ventilator support, IVH, PVL, NEC, time to full enteral feeds, ROP, sepsis, duration of hospital stay or gastrointestinal bleed. For many of these outcomes the sample size was small and the estimates imprecise. The incidence of decreased urine output (< 1cc/kg/hr) was lower in the ibuprofen group as compared to the indomethacin group [NNT 9 (95% CI 5–14)]. This was the only statistically significant clinical finding favouring ibuprofen. CLD defined as oxygen requirement at 28 days post-natally was statistically significantly more likely to occur in the ibuprofen group [typical RR 1.37 (95% CI 1.01, 1.86); NNH 7 (95% CI 3–100)]. There was a similar trend for CLD at 36 weeks corrected gestational age.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin in closing the PDA. Ibuprofen reduces the risk of oliguria. However, ibuprofen may increase the risk for CLD, and pulmonary hypertension has been observed in three infants after prophylactic use of ibuprofen. Based on currently available information ibuprofen does not appear to confer a net benefit over indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA. We conclude that indomethacin should remain the drug of choice for the treatment of a PDA. The most urgent research question to be answered is weather ibuprofen compared to indomethacin confers an improved rate of intact survival (survival without impairment) at 18 months corrected age.

### Patent ductus arteriosus: pathophysiology and management [^b0437f0c]. Journal of Perinatology (2006). Low credibility.

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm newborns prior to 28 weeks of gestation has led to many challenges regarding the type and timing of treatment regimens. A PDA results in increased pulmonary blood flow and redistribution of flow to other organs. Several co-morbidities (i.e., necrotizing enterocolitis, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and retinopathy) are associated with the presence of a PDA, but whether or not a PDA is responsible for their development is still unclear. The prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, is effective in the treatment of PDA. Questions regarding the optimal timing of the intervention — early prophylaxis or treatment, once signs and symptoms become evident — have challenged physicians for decades. Both evidence and experience are explored in this article. Comparative physiology between the full-term and preterm newborn and the barriers preventing the necessary cascade of events leading to permanent constriction of the PDA are reviewed.

### Surgical versus medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors for symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^e8310214]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with significant left to right shunt in preterm infants increases morbidity and mortality. Early closure of the ductus arteriosus may be achieved pharmacologically using cyclooxygenase inhibitors or by surgery. The efficacy of both treatment modalities is well established. However, the preferred initial treatment of a symptomatic PDA in a preterm infant, surgical ligation or treatment with indomethacin, has not been well established.

Objectives

To compare the effect of surgical ligation of PDA vs. medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (using indomethacin, ibuprofen, or mefenamic acid), each used as the initial treatment, on neonatal mortality in preterm infants with a symptomatic PDA.

Search Strategy

The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included search of electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - July 2007), CINAHL (1982 - July 2007), EMBASE (1980 - July 2007); and hand search of abstracts of Pediatric Academic Societies annual meetings published in Pediatric Research (1990 - April 2002) or on line from May 2002 -July 2007. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

All trials 1) using randomized or quasi-randomized patient allocation, 2) in preterm infants < 37 weeks gestational age or low-birth-weight infants (< 2500 grams) with symptomatic PDA in the neonatal period (< 28 days) and 3) comparing surgical ligation with medical treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors, each used as the initial treatment for closure of PDA.

Data Collection and Analysis

Assessment of methodological quality and extraction of data for included trials was undertaken independently by the authors. RevMan 4.1 was used for analysis of the data.

Main Results

Only one study, trial B in the report of Gersony 1983, was found eligible. No additional studies were identified in the literature searches performed in July 2007. The trial compared the effect of surgical ligation of PDA vs. medical treatment with indomethacin, each used as the primary treatment. No trials comparing surgery to other cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ibuprofen, mefenamic acid) were found. Trial B of Gersony 1983 enrolled 154 infants. The study found no statistically significant difference between surgical closure and indomethacin treatment in mortality during hospital stay, chronic lung disease, other bleeding, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, creatinine level, or intraventricular hemorrhage. There was a statistically significant increase in the surgical group in incidence of pneumothorax [RR 2.68 (95% CI 1.45, 4.93); RD 0.25 (95% CI 0.11, 0.38); NNH 4 (95% CI 3, 9)] and retinopathy of prematurity stage III and IV [RR 3.80 (95% CI 1.12, 12.93); RD 0.11 (95% CI 0.02, 0.20), NNH 9 (95% CI 5, 50] compared to the indomethacin group. There was as expected a statistically significant decrease in failure of ductal closure rate in the surgical group as compared to the indomethacin group: [RR 0.04 (95% CI 0.01, 0.27); RD -0.32 (95% CI -0.43, -0.21), NNT 3 (95% CI 2, 4)].

Authors' Conclusions

The data regarding net benefit/harm are insufficient to make a conclusion as to whether surgical ligation or medical treatment with indomethacin is preferred as initial treatment for symptomatic PDA in preterm infants. It should be noted that three recent observational studies indicated an increased risk for one or more of the following outcomes associated with PDA ligation; chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity and neurosensory impairment. It is possible that the duration of the "waiting-time" and transport to another facility with surgical capacity to have the PDA ligated could adversely affect outcomes, as could the perioperative care.

### Efficacy and tolerability of enteral formulations of ibuprofen in the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^66b7a755]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The persistence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants complicates their clinical course and may contribute to increased morbidity. Intravenous preparations of ibuprofen constitute one of the standard therapies for closure of a PDA. However, the unavailability of intravenous ibuprofen in certain regions of the world and the availability of inexpensive oral preparations has led to off-label nasogastric administration of oral ibuprofen in preterm infants with PDA.

Objective

This article reviews and comments on the evidence for the enteral use of oral formulations of racemic ibuprofen for PDA closure in preterm infants, with a focus on the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

Methods

MEDLINE, Current Contents, and Google Scholar were searched in April 2010 for trials of enteral ibuprofen in the treatment of PDA in preterm or low-birth-weight infants using the terms treatment, pharmacokinetics, ibuprofen, oral, enteral, patent ductus arteriosus, PDA, preterm, premature, low birth weight, infant, and newborn. Relevant congress Web sites were also searched for relevant abstracts.

Results

The literature search identified 2 pharmacokinetic studies involving 32 infants and 13 clinical efficacy studies involving 306 infants treated with enteral ibuprofen. The clinical studies reported some benefit for enteral ibuprofen relative to the comparators. However, these studies had methodologic limitations, including small numbers of subjects, lack of blinding, inclusion of preterm infants with a higher gestational age, customized treatment regimens, and second-order statistical error that prevented conduct of a systematic review. When the results of all studies were pooled, NEC was reported in a total of 46 of 281 infants (16%) receiving enteral ibuprofen and 21 of 83 infants (25%) receiving indomethacin. This rate of NEC with enteral ibuprofen was twice that reported for intravenous ibuprofen in a recent meta-analysis (27/356 [8%]).

Conclusions

The evidence supporting the off-label use of enteral ibuprofen for PDA in preterm infants is weak. Well-designed, appropriately powered pharmacologic and controlled clinical studies are needed before use of enteral ibuprofen can be recommended. In countries where an intravenous formulation of racemic ibuprofen is approved, off-label use of enteral racemic ibuprofen cannot be supported.

### Early prediction of spontaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure and PDA-associated outcomes: a prospective cohort investigation [^95bdefe5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the most commonly diagnosed cardiovascular condition in preterm infants, is associated with increased mortality and harmful long-term outcomes (chronic lung disease, neurodevelopmental delay). Although pharmacologic and/or interventional treatments to close PDA likely benefit some infants, widespread routine treatment of all preterm infants with PDA may not improve outcomes. Most PDAs close spontaneously by 44-weeks postmenstrual age; treatment is increasingly controversial, varying markedly between institutions and providers. Because treatment detriments may outweigh benefits, especially in infants destined for early, spontaneous PDA closure, the relevant unanswered clinical question is not whether to treat all preterm infants with PDA, but whom to treat (and when). Clinicians cannot currently predict in the first month which infants are at highest risk for persistent PDA, nor which combination of clinical risk factors, echocardiographic measurements, and biomarkers best predict PDA-associated harm.

Methods

Prospective cohort of untreated infants with PDA (n = 450) will be used to predict spontaneous ductal closure timing. Clinical measures, serum (brain natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) and urine (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein) biomarkers, and echocardiographic variables collected during each of first 4 postnatal weeks will be analyzed to identify those associated with long-term impairment. Myocardial deformation imaging and tissue Doppler imaging, innovative echocardiographic techniques, will facilitate quantitative evaluation of myocardial performance. Aim1 will estimate probability of spontaneous PDA closure and predict timing of ductal closure using echocardiographic, biomarker, and clinical predictors. Aim2 will specify which echocardiographic predictors and biomarkers are associated with mortality and respiratory illness severity at 36-weeks postmenstrual age. Aim3 will identify which echocardiographic predictors and biomarkers are associated with 22 to 26-month neurodevelopmental delay. Models will be validated in a separate cohort of infants (n = 225) enrolled subsequent to primary study cohort.

Discussion

The current study will make significant contributions to scientific knowledge and effective PDA management. Study results will reduce unnecessary and harmful overtreatment of infants with a high probability of early spontaneous PDA closure and facilitate development of outcomes-focused trials to examine effectiveness of PDA closure in "high-risk" infants most likely to receive benefit.

### Ibuprofen for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and / or low birth weight infants [^edd9d72a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) but is associated with reduced blood flow to several organs. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin with fewer side effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo or no intervention for closing a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants. To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors for closing a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, the reference lists of identified studies, meta-analyses and personal files were searched in December 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of ibuprofen for the treatment of a PDA in newborn infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data collection and analysis conformed to the methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

Main Results

Twenty studies are included in this review (6 studies added in this update). One study (n = 136) compared ibuprofen to placebo. Ibuprofen reduced the composite outcome of infant deaths, infants who dropped out or required rescue treatment [RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.38, 0.89); RD -0.22 (95% CI -0.38, -06); NNTB 5 (95% CI 3,17)]. Failure rates for PDA closure with ibuprofen compared to indomethacin was reported in 19 studies (n = 956 infants). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups [typical RR 0.94 (95% CI 0.76, 1.17)]; typical RD -0.02 (95% CI -0.07, 0.04); I(2) = 0%]. The risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was reduced for ibuprofen [15 studies (n = 865); typical RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.47, 0.99); typical RD -0.04 (95% CI -0.08, -0.00; (p = 0.04); NNTB 25 (95% CI 13, infinity); I(2) = 0%]. There is less evidence of transient renal insufficiency in infants who receive ibuprofen compared to indomethacin. No other important differences were noted for common neonatal morbidities. Oro-gastric administration of ibuprofen appears as effective as i.v. administration.

Authors' Conclusions

Ibuprofen is effective in closing a PDA. Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA and reduces the risk of NEC and transient renal insufficiency. Given the reduction in NEC noted in this update, ibuprofen currently appears to be the drug of choice. Studies are needed to evaluate the effect of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin treatment on longer term outcomes in infants with PDA.

### Percutaneous patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure in very preterm infants: feasibility and complications [^e7e51df6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence on the risks of drug therapy or surgical PDA ligation 26, 27 has led to growing interest in the use of percutaneous closure in premature infants. 10, 15, 16, 28, 29, 30 The main finding of our 10‐year study is that, among a large cohort of infants born very premature and referred for percutaneous closure at weights < 4 kg, the majority are successfully closed in the catheterization suite with evidence of improved pulmonary status following closure, but risk of arterial injury in these infants is noteworthy. The present study adds to a growing body of evidence on the potential value of percutaneous PDA closure in preterm infants. 10, 16, 31 However, to address adequately the central question of whether the benefits of catheter‐based PDA closure outweigh the risks, 4, 32 randomized, controlled trials comparing percutaneous PDA closure versus alternative treatment strategies (surgical ligation, nonintervention/conservative management approaches) are needed.

Although investigators have reported that percutaneous closure of the PDA is the procedure of choice among infants ≥ 4 kg, 10 the lower limit for safe closure remains unknown. While 4 kg as a weight‐cutoff is not evidence based, previous studies have excluded preterm infants < 4 kg or reported no cases of percutaneous PDA closure below this weight threshold. 11, 12, 13, 14 Since very premature infants < 4 kg are more complex and medically fragile than are older counterparts, 18 our working premise was that more immature infants would represent a separate population with a unique risk/benefit profile. To address fundamental questions regarding the use of weight‐based thresholds for percutaneous PDA closure, large, multicenter studies with sufficient power to detect clinically meaningful differences in outcomes across a range of weight categories are needed. Furthermore, consideration of patient‐specific factors beyond weight (premature birth, congenital anomalies) that underlie risk is imperative for developing risk‐stratification models to inform the practice of evidence‐based medicine.

### Prophylactic surgical ligation of patent ductus arteriosus for prevention of mortality and morbidity in extremely low birth weight infants [^f6dc0222]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in preterm infants. Prophylactic indomethacin results in favorable intermediate outcomes such as reduction of significant PDA, need for surgical ligation, severe intraventricular hemorrhage and serious pulmonary hemorrhage without modifying long-term neurosensory outcomes. Little is known about the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic surgical closure of the PDA in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants.

Objectives

To identify and summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA on mortality and morbidities of preterm infants less than 1000 g at birth as compared to no prophylaxis or prophylactic cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

Search Strategy

The standard search strategy for the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was performed by two review authors. Searches were made of MEDLINE (1966 to December 2006), EMBASE (1980 to December 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006), and abstracts of annual meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research (1995–2006). Contacts were made with the authors of published articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quazi-randomized controlled trials that enrolled infants less than 28 weeks gestation or less than 1000 g at birth who are on assisted ventilation and/or supplemental oxygen without clinical signs of hemodynamic significance of the ductus arteriosus were considered. Trials addressing prophylactic surgical ligation of the patent ducts arteriosus (i.e. procedure done during the first 72 hours of life) versus no intervention or cyclooxygenase inhibitor prophylaxis were included. The primary outcome was bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Other important short and long-term neonatal outcomes were also considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Review Group were used to assess the methodologic quality of the trials. Retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and data was abstracted independently by two reviewer authors. Where data were incomplete, the primary investigators were contacted for further information and clarifications. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) and its associated confidence interval were calculated. For continuous outcomes, treatment effect was expressed as mean difference and its calculated standard deviation. When appropriate, meta-analysis of pooled data was performed assuming a fixed effect model

Main Results

Only one eligible study that enrolled 84 ELBW infants was identified. The prophylactic group had ductal ligation performed within 24 hours of life following a pre-specified protocol, while the control group received standard care without indomethacin. Prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA resulted in a statistically significant reduction of severe stage II or III necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), [RR 0.25, 95% CI (0.08,0.83), p value 0.02, NNT 5]. The study found no statistically significant difference in mortality, severe grade III and IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), BPD, and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Of note, the study was unblinded and underpowered to detect clinically important differences in the above mentioned outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic surgical ligation of the PDA did not decrease mortality or BPD in ELBW infants. A significant reduction of stage II or III NEC was noted. Based on the current evidence, the high rate of spontaneous closure, availability of effective safe medical therapies, and the potential short and long-term complications of surgical ligation, the use such prophylactic surgical therapy is not indicated in the management of the preterm infants.

### Interventions for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^2e2553ff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

With respect to prophylactic therapies, the results of this overview largely align with the recently published Cochrane network meta‐analysis by Mitra 2022. Both the overview and the network meta‐analysis showed that prophylactic indomethacin reduces the risk of severe IVH and the need for surgical PDA closure, increases the risk of oliguria, and likely does not increase the risk of NEC or gastrointestinal perforation. In addition, both the overview and the network meta‐analysis demonstrated that prophylactic ibuprofen also reduces the need for surgical PDA closure, and likely does not increase the risk of NEC or gastrointestinal perforation. However, the network meta‐analysis by Mitra 2022 failed to demonstrate a difference for severe IVH and oliguria with prophylactic ibuprofen, unlike the Ohlsson 2020a review, which showed a marginal reduction in severe IVH, in addition to a definite increase in oliguria. These observed differences in results may be related to corresponding differences in the datasets analysed in the two reviews, as the search for the Ohlsson 2020a review was updated in October 2018, while the search for the Mitra 2022 review was updated in December 2021. However, given the considerable overlap of studies included in the network meta‐analysis by Mitra 2022 and the Ohlsson 2020a review, the more likely rationale for the observed differences in results could be related to differences in analytical methods. While the Ohlsson 2020a review used the traditional Cochrane Neonatal approach of using fixed‐effect meta‐analysis, thereby, generally obtaining more precise estimate of effects, the network meta‐analysis used a Bayesian random‐effects model, which was likely to produce more conservative estimates, especially in the absence of a substantial contribution from the indirect comparisons, thereby, failing to establish differences for the said outcomes. With respect to prophylactic acetaminophen, both reviews failed to draw meaningful conclusions due to overall paucity of evidence. With regard to treatment of symptomatic PDA, the results of this overview align with two previous network meta‐analyses, which both demonstrated that prostaglandin inhibitor drugs were effective in closing a PDA, which however, failed to translate into a clinically meaningful benefit (Jones 2011; Mitra 2018).

Identify clinical signs of a hemodynamically significant PDA. Identify known risk factors for PDA in the preterm population. Describe the characteristic echocardiographic features associated with a PDA and their sensitivity and specificity. Shin et al stopped treatment with ibuprofen in infants with a PDA when BNP concentration dropped to less than 600 pg/mL, resulting in fewer doses of ibuprofen in the group whose treatment was tailored based on BNP. Because hemodynamically significant PDA has been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, NEC, CLD, and death, more substantial studies are required before nonintervention approaches can be widely adopted.

In patients of more than 1, 000 g birthweight with few risk factors, a PDA can generally be successfully managed conservatively, with modest fluid restriction and use of positive end expiratory pressure to treat pulmonary edema. Certain diuretics, such as furosemide, can prevent a ductus from closing and are not recommended in the first 1 to 3 weeks, when the greatest decrease in ductus diameter occurs spontaneously. Conservative measures also include avoidance of other drugs that promote ductus arteriosus relaxation and proactive use of agents like caffeine that are associated with lower rates of PDA. Early use of indomethacin to close a PDA soon after birth, compared with waiting 3 to 4 days after diagnosis, decreases the risk for pulmonary hemorrhage and IVH, and need for ligation. Although PDA is associated with CLD, there is limited evidence to suggest that early pharmacologic closure improves incidence of CLD.

Pharmacologic closure is associated with decreased pulmonary edema and improved alveolarization. This may be due at least in part to a direct effect on the lung. Use of ibuprofen or indomethacin is associated with increased amiloride-sensitive alveolar epithelial sodium channels, increased lung water clearance, and improved lung compliance.

### Patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants [^496a9102]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Despite a large body of basic science and clinical research and clinical experience with thousands of infants over nearly 6 decades,(1) there is still uncertainty and controversy about the significance, evaluation, and management of patent ductus arteriosus in preterm infants, resulting in substantial heterogeneity in clinical practice. The purpose of this clinical report is to summarize the evidence available to guide evaluation and treatment of preterm infants with prolonged ductal patency in the first few weeks after birth.

### Trial of selective early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with ibuprofen [^45fb2fe0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The rate of open-label medical therapy for patients with a symptomatic PDA in this trial appeared lower than that reported in other similar trialsand occurred almost twice as frequently in the placebo group compared to the ibuprofen group. Although a recent non-inferiority trial of early ibuprofen in the management of patients with a PDA achieved a very low rate of open-label medical therapy of 0.7% in the expectant management arm, there was frequent use of acetaminophen as an analgesic after randomization in both arms.

Accordingly, exposure to any pharmacological agent with the potential for ductal closure was approximately 25% in babies managed expectantly, representing a contamination rate comparable to ours.

The median time from randomization to open-label medical therapy in our study was 11 to 12 days, well-beyond when the infant received the trial intervention (up to 7 days). This was much later than the timing of rescue treatment in a French study(median 4 days) that overlapped with the trial intervention. The low effective closure rate in our ibuprofen group combined with the relatively late timing of open-label medical therapy suggests that a large proportion of treated infants may have been exposed to the potentially damaging effects of the ductal shunt for a prolonged time period. Combined with the relatively high incidence of open-label medical therapy in the placebo group (30%), this resulted in poor discrimination between our two study groups with respect to ductal patency (55.5% versus 37.0%) and probably also in prolonged exposure to a ductal shunt. The absence of data from serial echocardiograms precludes detailed analysis and limits interpretation of the impact of shunt duration on outcomes between the two groups. Nevertheless, one might reasonably conclude that an early, echo-targeted, course of ibuprofen results in an additional closure or constriction rate of 18% without impacting clinical outcomes.

### Management of patent ductus arteriosus in very preterm infants in england and wales: a retrospective cohort study [^d30af1ff]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

The optimal management of PDA remains an unanswered question even after numerous randomised trials, and systematic reviews. Despite the limitations of observational study design, real-world evidence from large clinical databases with longer term follow-up may be the most pragmatic and efficient research strategy to address this controversy that remains unresolved despite numerous RCTs.

Acetaminophen

Acetaminophen versus ibuprofen: the review by Jasani 2022 showed that there was no evidence of a difference between acetaminophen and ibuprofen on the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.08; 6 RCTs, 603 infants).

Acetaminophen versus indomethacin: the review by Jasani 2022 showed that there was no evidence of a difference between acetaminophen and indomethacin on the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.38; 2 RCTs, 237 infants).

Late acetaminophen (initiated on day 14 or later) versus placebo: the review by Jasani 2022 showed that there was no evidence of a difference between late acetaminophen and placebo on the need for invasive PDA closure (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.11; 1 RCT, 55 infants).

Utility of the EL-Khuffash patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Severity Score

The EL-Khuffash PDAsc demonstrated significant utility in stratifying infants by risk, effectively identifying high-risk infants warranting treatment and low-risk infants who could safely avoid intervention. This stratification minimises unnecessary exposure to pharmacologic agents in low-risk infants while targeting those most likely to benefit from early closure. The outcomes of low-risk infants, which were favourable and consistent, regardless of treatment epoch, support the score's accuracy in identifying infants likely to achieve spontaneous closure without intervention.

Limitations of the study

This study has several limitations inherent to its observational design. First, the comparison between epochs is susceptible to confounding due to evolving clinical practices, advancements in neonatal care and baseline population differences. Although statistical adjustments were made for several confounders, unmeasured variables may still have unknowingly influenced the findings. Second, the lack of long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up limits the ability to assess whether improvements in short-term respiratory outcomes translate into meaningful developmental benefits. Furthermore, the small sample size in the subgroups, particularly the treatment-failure cohort, reduces statistical power and the generalisability of the findings. Additionally, while the EL-Khuffash PDAsc effectively identifies high-risk infants whose ductus arteriosus is unlikely to close spontaneously and who are at higher risk for adverse outcomes such as CLD or death, it does not currently predict which infants will respond successfully to pharmacological treatment. The observed overlap in scores between treatment responders and non-responders highlights this limitation. Future research is required to identify additional clinical or echocardiographic predictors that could enhance the score's ability to discriminate between treatment responders and non-responders. Finally, our findings are based on a single-centre observational cohort, potentially limiting the generalisability of our results to other settings. The use of an external validation cohort would significantly enhance the external validity and generalisability of the EL-Khuffash PDAsc. Future studies involving multicentre external validation are necessary to confirm and further refine the applicability of our risk-stratified PDA management approach.

Introduction

Optimal management of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants remains an unresolved controversy. Impaired haemodynamics due to persistent PDA is associated with adverse outcomes. Large left-to-right shunt with pulmonary over circulation and diastolic steal of systemic blood flow can affect cerebral, gut and renal perfusion and is associated with risk of adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH) and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC).PDA closure may be induced by medical and/or surgical interventions. Pharmacological treatment of PDA includes inducing closure with prostaglandin inhibitors, of which indomethacin and ibuprofen are the most widely used agents. Additionally, paracetamol has emerged as an alternative, with evidence to suggest it may be as efficacious as indomethacin or ibuprofen in inducing ductal closure.

Despite evidence that interventions are effective in inducing PDA closure, management strategies are evolving with greater acceptance of conservative management or no treatment because of accumulating evidence that inducing PDA closure does not improve outcomes. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that routine early treatment does not reduce PDA ligation or risk of adverse clinical outcomes and may be associated with higher rates of adverse events. A network meta-analysis with 68 RCTs including 4802 infants showed that despite ranking the worst in terms of PDA closure, no treatment was not associated with significantly higher odds of death, NEC, or IVH. Similarly, although surgical closure can be achieved by ligation or transcatheter occlusion and is associated with reduced mortality, surviving infants have increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment.

These uncertainties lead to wide variations in practice. In a retrospective study of Canadian practice, Lokku et al reported that from 2006 to 2012 the rate of both pharmacotherapy and surgical ligation of PDA decreased. In a larger international study of PDA treatment rates across 139 neonatal units, Isayama et al, reported overall treatment rates ranging from 36% in Israel to 52% in Japan (ranging from 13% to 77% among the included neonatal units) for very low birth weight infants (< 1500 g birth weight) who survived at least 3 days after birth. In this study, we aim to describe the use of PDA treatments in infants born at < 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) in England and Wales and the change in prevalence of use of pharmacological agents and surgery from 2010 to 2017.
