## Question

Is omalizumab an appropriate treatment for pertussis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether omalizumab is an appropriate treatment for pertussis (whooping cough). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what pertussis is and what current evidence-based management entails. Then, I should verify omalizumab's mechanism of action and approved indications. Next, I will check whether any trials or guidelines support omalizumab in pertussis and consider mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should review potential safety issues and weigh benefit versus risk. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and outline appropriate alternatives for pertussis care [^111i5URA] [^113BpZox].

> Let me first confirm the disease context and standard of care. Pertussis is a bacterial respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis, with clinical illness driven largely by toxin-mediated effects and characterized by a prolonged paroxysmal cough; early macrolide antibiotics reduce transmission, and otherwise management is supportive, not anti-IgE based, which I need to keep in mind as I evaluate any proposed biologic therapies [^111i5URA]. Wait, let me verify symptomatic management options that have actually been studied for pertussis cough: Cochrane reviews have assessed corticosteroids, beta-agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, and omalizumab does not appear among evaluated interventions, which already raises a red flag about its relevance here [^1165sC9Y] [^1153ojYo] [^116hqVme].

> Next, I should review omalizumab's mechanism and labeled uses to ensure I'm not missing a rationale. Omalizumab is a humanized IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that binds free IgE, down-regulates FcεRI on mast cells and basophils, and suppresses IgE-driven inflammation; it is approved for moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and more recently IgE-mediated food allergy, which underscores its role as an anti-allergic, not antimicrobial, therapy [^113BpZox] [^114HNZK9] [^113CUYJv] [^114XQZJz]. Hold on, I should verify that none of these indications overlap with bacterial toxin-driven diseases like pertussis; they do not, which makes an antimicrobial or anti-toxin effect from omalizumab unlikely [^113BpZox].

> Now I will examine whether there is any direct evidence linking omalizumab to pertussis outcomes. I need to check systematic reviews and interventional studies: the Cochrane reviews on pertussis cough management do not include omalizumab, and I cannot find trials, case series, or guideline endorsements for omalizumab in pertussis. By contrast, an investigational cocktail of humanized anti–pertussis toxin antibodies has shown benefit in animal models, but that is mechanistically distinct from anti-IgE therapy and should not be conflated with omalizumab [^1165sC9Y] [^1153ojYo] [^116hqVme] [^11225szA]. Wait, let me double-check that there aren't isolated case reports suggesting a role; none are evident in the provided corpus, which aligns with the absence from guideline discussions [^1165sC9Y] [^1153ojYo].

> But wait, what if there is a theoretical immunomodulatory benefit? Let me think about the pathophysiology. Pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylates G proteins, driving leukocytosis, immunosuppression, and paroxysmal cough; these processes are not mediated by IgE-driven mast cell degranulation, so anti-IgE blockade would not be expected to neutralize toxin, clear bacteria, or meaningfully alter the core inflammatory cascade of pertussis, which suggests poor mechanistic plausibility for omalizumab in this setting [^111i5URA]. I should confirm that omalizumab's downstream effects center on IgE and Type 2 pathways; they do, which further weakens the rationale for a bacterial toxin-mediated disease like pertussis [^113BpZox].

> Next, I should review safety and practical considerations to ensure the risk profile is appropriate even if off-label use were contemplated. I need to check key warnings and precautions: omalizumab carries risks of anaphylaxis, serum sickness-like reactions, eosinophilic complications, helminth infection susceptibility, and guidance to avoid abrupt steroid withdrawal; initial doses warrant observation for hypersensitivity, especially early in therapy, which would add risk and monitoring burden without clear benefit in pertussis [^113i9nJm] [^1134dZ9H]. Hold on, I should verify guideline concordance: major discussions of pertussis management emphasize antibiotics and supportive care and do not mention anti-IgE therapy at all, reinforcing that omalizumab would be off-label and unsupported here [^111i5URA].

> I will now weigh benefits and risks. Potential benefit is at best theoretical and not aligned with disease biology; no antimicrobial or anti-toxin activity is expected, and no clinical signal has been demonstrated, whereas known risks and monitoring requirements are real and could distract from evidence-based care such as timely macrolides and supportive measures; if immunotherapy is considered, only pertussis toxin–specific antibodies have shown promise preclinically, and even those remain investigational in humans [^111i5URA] [^11225szA]. Let me reconsider whether symptomatic antitussive strategies studied in Cochrane might offer alternatives; even those show limited and inconsistent benefit, underscoring that biologics like omalizumab should not be extrapolated into pertussis without data [^1165sC9Y] [^1153ojYo] [^116hqVme].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I should confirm the final position before advising. There is no direct evidence of efficacy, no mechanistic plausibility in a toxin-driven bacterial disease, no guideline endorsement, and a nontrivial safety and monitoring burden; therefore, omalizumab is not an appropriate treatment for pertussis and should not be used for this indication outside a clinical trial, whereas recommended care remains early macrolide therapy to reduce transmission plus supportive management of respiratory symptoms [^111i5URA] [^1165sC9Y] [^113BpZox].

For whooping cough, use of omalizumab is **not recommended**; it is not indicated or supported [^114HNZK9]. There is **no evidence** that omalizumab reduces pertussis cough severity or duration, and its mechanism [^113BpZox] does not target pertussis pathophysiology [^11225szA]. Standard care remains macrolide antibiotics [^112tJfz6] and supportive measures; omalizumab should not be used for pertussis outside a clinical trial.

---

## Mechanism of action of omalizumab

Omalizumab is a humanized IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that **binds free IgE**, preventing its interaction with FcεRI on mast cells and basophils, which downregulates FcεRI and reduces IgE-mediated inflammation [^113BpZox]. This mechanism is effective for IgE-mediated allergic diseases, such as asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and food allergy [^1125jG9f] [^113CUYJv] [^113BpZox].

---

## Pathophysiology of whooping cough

Whooping cough is caused by Bordetella pertussis [^111i5URA], which produces pertussis toxin and other virulence factors that damage the respiratory epithelium, impair mucociliary clearance, and cause severe paroxysmal cough [^11225szA]. The cough is driven primarily by bacterial toxins and inflammation, **not IgE-mediated mechanisms** [^112tJfz6].

---

## Evidence for omalizumab in whooping cough

There is currently **no clinical evidence** supporting omalizumab for whooping cough [^1153ojYo]. No randomized controlled trials or observational studies have evaluated its efficacy or safety in pertussis. The only related evidence involves monoclonal antibodies targeting pertussis toxin, which have shown promise in animal models but are not clinically available [^11225szA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines **do not recommend** omalizumab for whooping cough. Standard treatment includes macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin) to reduce transmission, along with supportive care for symptom management. Omalizumab is not mentioned in any guideline for pertussis management.

---

## Safety considerations

Omalizumab is generally well tolerated, but adverse reactions include injection site reactions, headache, fatigue, and **rare anaphylaxis**. Its use in infectious diseases such as pertussis is not established, and potential immunomodulatory effects could theoretically impact infection outcomes, although this remains speculative [^113i9nJm].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Omalizumab is expensive and typically reserved for severe allergic conditions refractory to standard therapy [^112c2zHF]. Its use in pertussis — a self-limited infectious disease — would **not be cost-effective** given the lack of evidence of benefit and the availability of effective antibiotics [^112tJfz6].

---

## Alternative treatments for whooping cough

Effective treatments for whooping cough include the following:

- **Macrolide antibiotics**: Azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin to reduce transmission and bacterial load.
- **Supportive care**: Hydration, oxygen therapy, and monitoring for complications [^112tJfz6].
- **Vaccination**: Prevention through vaccination remains the most effective strategy [^117R1TCx].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Omalizumab is **not indicated** for whooping cough [^114HNZK9]. There is no evidence supporting its use, and its mechanism does not address pertussis pathophysiology [^11225szA]. Standard treatment with antibiotics and supportive care remains the recommended approach. Omalizumab should not be used for pertussis outside clinical trials [^112tJfz6].

### Xolair [^113BpZox]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells, resulting in FcεRI down-regulation on these cells. In allergic asthmatics, treatment with omalizumab inhibits IgE-mediated inflammation, as evidenced by reduced blood and tissue eosinophils and reduced inflammatory mediators, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.

- **Chronic spontaneous urticaria**: Omalizumab binds to IgE and lowers free IgE levels. Subsequently, IgE receptors (FcεRI) on cells down-regulate. The mechanism by which these effects of omalizumab result in an improvement of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) symptoms is unknown.

- **Asthma**: In clinical studies, serum free IgE levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner within 1 hour following the first dose and maintained between doses. The mean serum free IgE decrease was greater than 96% using recommended doses. Serum total IgE levels (i.e. bound and unbound) increased after the first dose due to the formation of omalizumab:IgE complexes, which have a slower elimination rate compared with free IgE. At 16 weeks after the first dose, average serum total IgE levels were five-fold higher compared with pre-treatment when using standard assays.

After discontinuation of Xolair dosing, the increase in total IgE and decrease in free IgE induced by Xolair were reversible, with no observed rebound in IgE levels after drug washout. Total IgE levels did not return to pre-treatment levels.

### A cocktail of humanized anti-pertussis toxin antibodies limits disease in murine and baboon models of whooping cough [^11225szA]. Science Translational Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Despite widespread vaccination, pertussis rates are rising in industrialized countries and remain high worldwide. With no specific therapeutics to treat the disease, pertussis continues to cause considerable infant morbidity and mortality. The pertussis toxin is a major contributor to the disease, responsible for local and systemic effects, including leukocytosis and immunosuppression.

We humanized two murine monoclonal antibodies that neutralize pertussis toxin and expressed them as human immunoglobulin G1 molecules with no loss of affinity or in vitro neutralization activity. When administered prophylactically to mice as a binary cocktail, antibody treatment completely mitigated the Bordetella pertussis-induced rise in white blood cell counts and decreased bacterial colonization. When administered therapeutically to baboons, antibody-treated, but not untreated control animals experienced a blunted rise in white blood cell counts and accelerated bacterial clearance rates.

These preliminary findings support further investigation into the use of these antibodies to treat human neonatal pertussis in conjunction with antibiotics and supportive care.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^1165sC9Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The worldwide incidence of whooping cough (pertussis) is estimated at 48.5 million cases and nearly 295,000 deaths per year. In low-income countries, the case-fatality rate among infants may be as high as 4%. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of paroxysmal cough. Proposed treatments include corticosteroids, beta 2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines, and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.

- **Search Methods**: We updated searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL Issue 2, 2012), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE Issue 2, 2012) accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), AMED (1985 to January 2012), CINAHL (1980 to January 2012), and LILACS (January 2012). We searched Controlled Trials to identify trials in progress.

- **Selection Criteria**: We selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.

- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the quality of each trial for this review in 2009. Two review authors independently reviewed the data.

### SPL drug information for omalizumab [^113i9nJm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of omalizumab SC (also known as Xolair, Omlyclo):

- **Corticosteroid withdrawal, acute exacerbation of asthma, and acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis**: Use caution in patients receiving systemic or inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Do not discontinue systemic or ICSs abruptly upon initiation of omalizumab for asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Taper corticosteroids gradually.

- **Eosinophilia and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as omalizumab has been associated with rare cases of serious systemic eosinophilia and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

- **Helminthiasis**: Use caution in patients at high risk of geohelminth infection.

- **Increased serum IgE**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as serum IgE levels increase after administration of omalizumab due to the formation of omalizumab:IgE complexes. Do not use serum total IgE levels obtained less than one year after discontinuation for reassessing the dosing regimen.

- **Malignancies**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as rare cases of various malignancies, including breast cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, and parotid cancer, have been reported with omalizumab treatment.

- **Serum sickness-like reaction**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as omalizumab has been associated with cases of serum sickness-like reactions presenting with arthritis/arthralgia, skin rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy with an onset one to five days after the first or subsequent doses.

### Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs in the MHC class II loci that are associated with self-reported history of whooping cough [^1116F8LA]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Whooping cough is currently seeing a resurgence in countries despite high vaccine coverage. There is considerable variation in subject-specific response to infection and vaccine efficacy, but little is known about the role of human genetics. We carried out a case–control genome-wide association study of adult or parent-reported history of whooping cough in two cohorts from the UK: the ALSPAC cohort and the 1958 British Birth Cohort (815/758 cases and 6341/4308 controls, respectively). We also imputed HLA alleles using dense SNP data in the MHC region, conducted gene-based and gene-set tests of association, and estimated the amount of additive genetic variation explained by common SNPs.

We observed a novel association at SNPs in the MHC class II region in both cohorts [lead SNP rs9271768 after meta-analysis, odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) 1.47 (1.35, 1.6), P-value 1.21E−18]. Multiple strong associations were also observed at alleles at the HLA class II loci. The majority of these associations were explained by the lead SNP rs9271768. Gene-based and gene-set tests and estimates of explainable common genetic variation could not establish the presence of additional associations in our sample.

Genetic variation at the MHC class II region plays a role in susceptibility to whooping cough. These findings provide additional perspective on mechanisms of whooping cough infection and vaccine efficacy.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111MYp4V]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

- **Key point**: Cyclosporine may be considered as an off-label therapeutic option for controlling chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in patients who are refractory to antihistamines and omalizumab.

- **What is the role of oral antileukotrienes in the treatment of CSU?** The efficacy of antileukotrienes has been reported in small randomized double-blind studies, with inconsistent results. Monotherapy with antileukotrienes is not advisable.

- **Key point**: The evidence supporting leukotriene inhibitors as a therapeutic option in CSU is weak, and their use in CSU is not recommended.

- **Which patients with CSU should be treated with omalizumab?** The efficacy and safety of omalizumab have been demonstrated in two randomized, placebo-controlled phase III studies in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite H1-antihistamine therapy at the approved dose. A third study primarily evaluated the safety of omalizumab in patients with CSU who remained symptomatic despite treatment with H1-antihistamines at up to four times the approved dose, and with H2-antihistamine and/or leukotriene inhibitors treatment. Omalizumab is the only drug indicated in Europe and the United States as an add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU in adult and adolescent (12 years and older) patients with an inadequate response to H1-antihistamine treatment.

### Xolair [^117VQG9v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clearance of omalizumab involved IgG clearance processes as well as clearance via specific binding and complex formation with its target ligand, IgE. Liver elimination of IgG included degradation in the liver reticuloendothelial system (RES) and endothelial cells. Intact IgG was also excreted in bile. In studies with mice and monkeys, omalizumab:IgE complexes were eliminated by interactions with Fcγ receptors within the RES at rates that were generally faster than IgG clearance. In asthma patients, omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 26 days, with apparent clearance averaging 2.4 ± 1.1 mL/kg/day. Doubling body weight approximately doubled apparent clearance. In CSU patients, at steady state, based on population pharmacokinetics, omalizumab serum elimination half-life averaged 24 days and apparent clearance averaged 240 mL/day (corresponding to 3.0 mL/kg/day for an 80 kg patient).

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^113GyiAM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Whooping cough is an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. There are 20 to 40 million cases of whooping cough annually worldwide, 90% of which occur in developing countries, resulting in an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 fatalities each year. Much of the morbidity is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Corticosteroids, salbutamol (a beta 2-adrenergic stimulant), and pertussis-specific immunoglobulin have been proposed as standard treatment for the cough. Antihistamines have also been administered. No systematic review of the effectiveness of any of these interventions or others has been performed.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions used to reduce the severity of the coughing paroxysms in whooping cough in children and adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 2, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to June 2003); EMBASE (1990 to June 2003), and LILACS (1982 to November 2001). We also scanned reference lists of identified trials and contacted authors of identified trials and relevant pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any intervention aimed at suppressing the cough in whooping cough, excluding antibiotics and vaccines.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data. Our primary outcome was the frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were the frequency of vomiting, the frequency of whoop, the frequency of cyanosis, and the development of serious complications.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^111i5URA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a respiratory infection caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria. Classic pertussis is a cough illness that may last for many weeks and is marked by paroxysms of repeated coughs that end with a gasping "whoop". Historical records describing a pertussis-like disease go back approximately 1000 years [1], and genetic analyses suggest that the bacterium has been associated with humans for millions of years [2]. Outbreaks of pertussis were recorded in Persia in the 15th century [3], and an outbreak that resulted in many deaths among infants and young children was documented in Paris in the summer of 1578 [4]. British records from the early 16th century and the 1701 London Bills of Mortality reported whooping cough [5]. (Please note that the complete references are available as online Supplemental Materials.)

Pertussis is endemic worldwide, with epidemic peaks every 2–5 years, and is highly contagious. Up to 90% of household contacts and 50% to 80% of schoolroom contacts will become infected after exposure.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^1153ojYo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Around 16 million cases of whooping cough (pertussis) occur worldwide each year, mostly in low-income countries. Much of the morbidity associated with whooping cough in both children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Proposed treatments for the cough include corticosteroids, beta2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines, and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions aimed at reducing the severity of paroxysmal cough in cases of whooping cough in children and adults.

- **Search methods**: We updated searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2014, Issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE 2014, Issue 2) accessed from The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1950 to 30 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 30 January 2014), AMED (1985 to 30 January 2014), CINAHL (1980 to 30 January 2014), and LILACS (30 January 2014). Additionally, we searched for Controlled Trials to identify any trials in progress.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) aimed at suppressing the cough in whooping cough.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the quality of each trial for this review initially in 2009. Further studies identified by the updated searches in 2012 and 2014 were independently reviewed by two other authors.

### Use of omalizumab for management of idiopathic anaphylaxis: A systematic review and retrospective case series [^112DKzBq]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis (IA) may fail to respond to a combination of high-dose H1 and H2 antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers. Treatment options for these patients are currently limited.

- **Objective**: To describe the clinical experience of omalizumab use for the treatment of patients with IA with no evidence of underlying clonal mast cell disorders.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review at two separate institutions of medical records of patients with a diagnosis of IA without evidence of mast cell clonality who had received treatment with omalizumab. We searched PubMed for studies describing omalizumab use in similar patients. Information on symptoms and omalizumab therapy was compiled, and response pattern of anaphylaxis was determined.

- **Results**: A total of 35 patients with IA and no evidence of mast cell clonality who received omalizumab were identified. The median age was 36 years at the start of omalizumab (range, 11–54 years; n = 29). The frequency of anaphylaxis episodes before omalizumab treatment varied from 2 total episodes to several episodes per month. The most often used initial omalizumab dose was 300 mg every 4 weeks (n = 16). Most patients ultimately achieved clinical response after starting omalizumab: complete response (63%, n = 22), partial response (28.5%, n = 10), with 3 nonresponders.

- **Conclusion**: Omalizumab may be an effective treatment option for patients with IA who do not have evidence of mast cell clonality and fail to respond to antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers.

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: A Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^1134dZ9H]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of severe asthma phenotypes, particularly with respect to omalizumab, the CTS 2017 guidelines recommend closely monitoring patients for allergic reactions after omalizumab administration. It is advised to observe patients for 2 hours after the first three injections and for 30 minutes after subsequent injections.

### Treatment of chronic cough [^115GyEHD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic cough remains a challenging condition, especially in cases where it persists despite comprehensive medical management. For these particular patients, there appears to be an emerging role for behavior modification therapy. We report a series of patients with refractory chronic cough to assess if there is any benefit to adding behavioral therapy to their treatment regimen.

- **Study design**: A case series with a planned chart review of patients treated for chronic cough.
- **Setting**: The review was performed with an outpatient electronic health record system at a tertiary care center.
- **Subjects and methods**: The charts of all patients treated for chronic cough by a single laryngologist over a 30-month period were analyzed. Patients' responses to treatment and the rate of cough improvement were assessed for those with refractory chronic cough who underwent behavior modification therapy.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight patients with chronic cough were initially treated empirically for the most common causes of cough, of which 32% experienced improvement. Nineteen patients who did not significantly improve with medical management underwent behavior modification therapy with a speech-language pathologist; 84% of these patients experienced resolution or marked improvement of their symptoms.

Behavioral therapy may be underutilized in practice and could lead to improvement of otherwise recalcitrant cough.

### Reply to Weinberger [^1128MMkG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Nonpharmacological approaches have been shown to play a role in treating RCC; randomized controlled trial evidence supports the efficacy of cough control therapy, which comprises various measures such as trigger identification, laryngeal hydration, treatment of breathing pattern disorders, cough suppression techniques, and lifestyle advice. Whether suggestion plays a role in altering patient expectations in chronic cough trials remains to be determined. Although any disease has psychological elements, we caution against labeling RCC as a habit disorder susceptible entirely to suggestion therapy. Indeed, suggestion therapy's effect on treating cough has yet to be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with validated endpoints.

In contrast, in each randomized controlled phase II and phase III cough trial performed at the time of writing, gefapixant has demonstrated statistically significant efficacy, consistently outperforming placebo and, as shown in our recent contribution to the Journal, providing a durable treatment benefit.

### The role of allergen-specific IgE, IgG and IgA in allergic disease [^1125jG9f]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Two anti-IgE antibodies, omalizumab and ligelizumab, have been advanced as therapeutics for the treatment of allergic diseases, including allergic asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic rhinosinusitis, and food allergies. However, other anti-IgE antibodies are in clinical development (e.g. Xmab7195, UB221, omalizumab biosimilars). Omalizumab and ligelizumab highlight the impressive impact that anti-IgE can have in allergy treatment. Omalizumab was the first anti-IgE developed as a therapeutic, initially for the treatment of severe allergic asthma in 2003. Since then, omalizumab has shown efficacy in treating chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), food allergy, and chronic rhinosinusitis. As discussed elsewhere in this review, omalizumab enhanced oral immunotherapy (OIT) treatment in food allergy clinical trials, reducing allergen challenge reactions and enabling a more rapid increase in allergen dosing and simultaneous tolerization for multiple allergens. Ligelizumab is a next-generation, higher affinity anti-IgE that shows an improved ability to suppress free IgE in patients. Despite having an approximately 100-fold higher affinity for IgE, ligelizumab surprisingly did not show improved efficacy in treating allergic asthma patients. However, in phase II clinical studies, ligelizumab showed improved efficacy over omalizumab for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). It remains to be established whether ligelizumab will have a significant benefit in OIT or allergen immunotherapy (AIT) relative to omalizumab.

### Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs in the MHC class II loci that are associated with self-reported history of whooping cough [^1142G9nt]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract. It is transmitted from person to person by coughing or sneezing and caused primarily by the gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Without intervention, it is a highly morbid infection in infants, and in the pre-vaccine era, it was responsible for 10,000 deaths per year in the UK. Where vaccination is not routine, whooping cough is still a major source of mortality, leading to 195,000 deaths in 2008.

In developed countries, the incidence of whooping cough has been effectively controlled by vaccination. However, it remains endemic with periodic epidemics every three to four years. Improving vaccination efficacy represents a sustained goal to enhance the control of whooping cough and thereby reduce associated mortality, morbidity, and economic costs. Vaccination does not provide complete protection, and immunity wanes over time. Furthermore, there is a requirement to combine multiple strategies to improve coverage among the most vulnerable, including an accelerated schedule and preschool booster, cocooning, and immunization of expectant mothers.

There is also growing evidence of a recent increase in the number of cases, particularly in infants and among adolescents and adults. Among the latter group, this increase may be partly due to better surveillance and reporting, but among very young infants, notifications are already well established and less likely to explain the increase. These factors have led to a re-evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.

### Whooping cough in 2014 and beyond: an update and review [^112tJfz6]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, has experienced a dramatic resurgence in recent years and is recognized as the most common vaccine-preventable disease worldwide. In 2012, the United States reported the highest number of cases in over 50 years, with large outbreaks occurring in multiple states. The increase in infant deaths has captured the attention of both healthcare providers and the media. Although vaccination theoretically provides a preventive measure against the disease, controlling it remains a challenge. New vaccination strategies have been introduced for different age groups and patient populations, yet vaccine coverage remains discouragingly low.

Acellular vaccines, while safe, do not offer the same long-lasting immunity as the previously used whole-cell vaccines. Thus, advancements in vaccine development and improvements in vaccination coverage are crucial to reducing the societal burden of pertussis. This article provides a comprehensive review of pertussis infection, discussing advances in epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention as well as ongoing areas of uncertainty.

### Mapping the intellectual structure of the research of omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria: A bibliometric analysis [^112c2zHF]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Overall, these clusters provide a comprehensive overview of the direction of research related to the use of omalizumab in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), emphasizing clinical research, exploration of the application of biologic agents, study of biologic mechanisms, and exploration of safety and biomarkers. These findings can guide and inform future research related to CSU.

In addition, we conducted an analysis of the keyword trend over time to identify changes in the research of omalizumab for the treatment of CSU. We have roughly divided the 25 trending topics into germination, development, and explosion periods according to time. The germination period was largely limited to the years 2005–2013. As early as 2005, Vaishali S. Mankad et al. began focusing on and summarizing other indications for omalizumab, such as food allergy, latex allergy, atopic dermatitis, and CSU. Notably, it was clearly stated that omalizumab was an effective treatment for CSU. Also, Vaishali S. Mankad et al. argued that the potential benefits of omalizumab need to be considered in the context of the cost of treatment and whether it is cost-effective compared with the effects of treatment. Until 2013, however, the effectiveness of omalizumab was still somewhat controversial and its deeper mechanism of action remained poorly understood, with more exploratory studies and case data still needed. Since the FDA's 2014 approval of omalizumab for the treatment of CSU in adults and adolescents (aged ≥ 12 years) who remain symptomatic after H1-antihistamine therapy, research has shifted toward investigating different aspects of its application.

### Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs in the MHC class II loci that are associated with self-reported history of whooping cough [^116HLrF5]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

- **Manhattan and QQ plots**: Manhattan plots with markers P < 1.E − 5 in green and P < 5.E − 8 in red indicate a strong signal on chromosome 6. QQ plots of test statistics show inflation of associations at lower P-values. A grey line indicates a straight line relationship. The genomic inflation factor (λ) is shown in text above the QQ plot. Removal of the extended MHC region resulted in a genomic inflation factor of 1.007. A dashed line indicates P = 5.E − 8.

- **Regional plot of lead association signal**: P-values (on a −log10 scale) after meta-analysis are shown over the MHC class II region. Each SNP is coloured according to the degree of linkage disequilibrium with the lead SNP rs9271768 (shown as a purple diamond). Linkage disequilibrium values are from the 1000 Genomes (March 2012 release) European population.

We split participants in each data set into groups based on region of birth and re-examined an association between SNP rs9271768 and the risk of a history of whooping cough because alleles at the HLA region exhibit geographical variation, which could correlate with the risk of exposure to pertussis. While in ALSPAC there was evidence of a weak association between history of whooping cough and region of birth (P = 0.06), no strong evidence of stratification by rs9271768 genotype was found (P = 0.175), and adjustment for region of birth had little or no effect on the strength of the original principal component-corrected association between rs9271768 and the history of whooping cough (P = 1.4E − 13 after adjustment).

### Vaccine-induced anti-IgE antibodies neutralize free IgE but fail to bind and activate mast cell-displayed IgE [^111KEekq]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Recent advancements have focused on the creation of specific anti‐IgE monoclonal antibodies such as omalizumab that do not cross‐link FcεRI‐bound IgE, thus preventing degranulation and anaphylaxis caused by antibody therapy. However, an active immunization approach against IgE could offer even greater potential due to its vastly better cost‐effectiveness and broader applications compared to passive immunization methods.

An important element to the success of omalizumab is its excellent safety profile, as it does not appear to cause immunodeficiency and susceptibility to cancer or parasite infection, which should translate to the active vaccination approach presented here as well. A potential reason for the safety of anti‐IgE therapy is that the regulation by IgE via anti‐IgE antibodies appears to be a natural physiological process.

We have shown that natural anti‐IgE antibodies are continuously present at surprisingly high levels in normal mice and in healthy humans. Our findings could explain why these natural anti‐IgE autoantibodies do not cause anaphylaxis in healthy individuals. Of note, human natural anti‐IgE autoantibodies and omalizumab depend on the same conserved mannose regions as the mouse anti‐IgE antibodies.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate that active immunization against IgE is a viable therapeutic approach. Most likely, this VLP‐based anti‐IgE approach could also be applied in companion animals, as we have shown for other targets. The VLP platform employed here offers a distinct advantage due to its robust immunogenicity and lack of need for adjuvants.

### Covid-19 in a patient with severe asthma treated with omalizumab [^114op1wi]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

On March 16th, the patient's clinical condition started to improve, although the loss of smell persisted for another 12 days. On the same day, the local physician contacted our asthma treatment center about the further administration of omalizumab, which was scheduled for March 17th. It was arbitrarily decided to postpone this administration for another two days. Following further clinical improvement, omalizumab was self-administered at home on March 19th. The patient remained symptom-free since March 29th and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 the following day. The patient was reassessed in our outpatient clinic on April 9th, where he remained free of symptoms, and there were no significant differences in asthma control or biomarkers compared to November 2019. There was a small decrease in FEV1 (-300 mL; -7% predicted) after COVID-19, compared to November 2019, which might reflect the normal variability of lung function in this patient. However, a minor deterioration in lung function after COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

There is evidence that patients with asthma might generally be at a lower risk for severe forms of COVID-19. It has been reported that the proportion of patients with asthma among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is low and that hospitalized patients with asthma are not at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease. This is supported by data showing that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for the uptake of SARS-CoV-2.

### Food allergy yardstick: Where does omalizumab fit [^114XQZJz]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). High credibility.

Food allergy management has greatly evolved in the last several years, moving from passive approaches, such as strict food allergen avoidance, to more active treatments, including regulatory approval of the first specifically indicated immunotherapy product for peanut in 2020. In 2024, a second therapy, omalizumab, received regulatory approval for the treatment of one or more IgE-mediated food allergies, providing clinicians with multiple treatment options to offer patients and families.

With this expanded armamentarium of food allergy treatment options, the practicing clinician requires detailed knowledge of the benefits and risks of omalizumab, how omalizumab fits into the management landscape, and how to use shared decision-making to optimize therapy.

This yardstick aims to provide the clinician with a review of data leading to omalizumab's food allergy indication and an evidence-based expert opinion approach regarding how best to use this and other therapies available to optimize patient management.

### Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs in the MHC class II loci that are associated with self-reported history of whooping cough [^111NkALh]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Studies suggest a genetic component exists for susceptibility to whooping cough. A twin study in The Gambia indicated that interferon-gamma and interleukin-13 responses to B. pertussis antigens are heritable. Murine models of pertussis infection show that mice with a functional mutation in the TLR4 gene are more susceptible to infection, and a candidate gene approach has indicated that variation in the human TLR-4 gene influences antibody response to the pertussis vaccine.

Although these studies are promising, they have been limited in replicating initial associations due to small sample sizes. For other infectious diseases, the genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been successful in discovering and replicating several genetic associations. A difficulty in examining a role for common genetic variants in causing whooping cough is the accurate identification of a large enough number of cases to robustly identify associations of small to moderate effect expected from common variant analysis. This leads to the dilemma of using measures of whooping cough collected in large prospective cohorts, which may rely on historic data or retrospectively self-reported history of whooping cough from a time when it was more common. Self-reported measures, in particular, can suffer from recall bias on the exact nature of the outcome, introducing unwanted heterogeneity into the analysis, leading to a loss of power and difficulties in interpretation of the nature of an observational association.

Despite these potential difficulties, genome-wide analysis is a potentially powerful approach.

### From dream to REALITI-A and beyond: Mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophil-driven diseases [^112YQF21]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Further insights into the cost-effectiveness of biologic treatments in asthma and other eosinophilic diseases are also needed. In asthma, it is suggested that biologic therapy should be directed to those patients most likely to respond, in order to improve cost-effectiveness. This would involve using biomarkers to identify such patients prior to treatment, as well as close monitoring of individuals following treatment initiation to assess their response. As work to identify useful biomarkers is ongoing, continued assessment of cost-effectiveness is needed to support treatment decision-making.

Eosinophil biology is known to be complex, with roles in both maintaining health and contributing to disease. In a healthy population, the blood eosinophil count can vary; however, the "normal" blood eosinophil count in healthy individuals is lower than generally perceived, as several highly prevalent factors, such as atopy, allergic rhinitis, and smoking, can elevate counts. There is now convincing and consistent evidence that, even in patients with mild asthma, high blood eosinophil counts are associated with increased exacerbation risk, even if they initially present with mild symptoms and normal lung function. Additionally, an association between blood eosinophilia and lung function decline has been identified, independent of asthma and smoking, indicating that eosinophilia is a risk factor for airflow obstruction even in individuals without disease symptoms. Whether reducing eosinophils in these healthy individuals may be beneficial is an interesting consideration.

### Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs in the MHC class II loci that are associated with self-reported history of whooping cough [^116eFNe2]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Genome-wide association studies can be biased by population stratification and errors in phenotype definition. To address potential bias due to population substructure, we applied two corrective methods. The first method was principal component analysis of genome-wide data, a standard approach in GWAS that adjusts cases and controls for differences in ancestry genetic variation. The second method involved traditional epidemiological tests of confounding. Both methods indicated a similar strength of association between SNP rs9271768 and self-reported history of whooping cough. This suggests that population stratification is unlikely to have led to a spurious association in these samples.

We carefully described our phenotype as a self-reported history of whooping cough to acknowledge its potential heterogeneity. Obtaining a sufficient number of cases to robustly determine a common genetic association was complicated by the widespread and effective control of pertussis in developed countries. Consequently, we were limited to cohorts with historical data. Data were collected either by self-retrospective report or parent-reported questionnaire. While a proportion of these would have been doctor-diagnosed cases, some cases of whooping cough might involve Bordetella parapertussis, and some viruses, such as adenovirus and parainfluenza virus, can cause pertussis-like syndrome in children leading to differential diagnosis.

The above limitations may mean that, while we believe this is a replicable association robust to confounding, in theory, it is possible the association is partly driven by a whooping cough.

### Global childhood deaths from pertussis: A historical review [^111FM29a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The clinical syndrome of whooping cough has been recognized for at least 500 years, although the causative organism, Bordetella pertussis, was not identified until 1906. The physician's diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of whooping cough, in its typical form in unimmunized children, is highly specific when judged against culture as a gold standard. An episode of whooping cough is reliably recalled by mothers, even in resource-poor settings, so historical data on trends in whooping cough incidence should have acceptable validity if reporting and recording have remained consistent over time.

Similarly, interpretation of historical data on deaths due to pertussis assumes that recognition of the preceding clinical syndrome and recording of deaths have been consistent over time. In countries with good infrastructure, these data come from statistical reports derived from statutory death certificates. More recently, measurement of pertussis-related deaths has been supplemented by data on mortality from routine public health surveillance, often including laboratory confirmation. Capture-recapture methodology has suggested significant underascertainment in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

In resource-poor settings, attribution of deaths following clinically diagnosed pertussis may be problematic, especially when death occurs some time later, as other factors such as concomitant infection (e.g. malaria, measles) and comorbidities (e.g. malnutrition) are often present. Attribution is much clearer when it is in the context of well-established surveillance with clear diagnosis.

### Investigation of the pathomechanism of chronic cough using an in vitro approach [^116SyCKd]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Previous ATP inhalation studies and clinical trials have demonstrated an anti-tussive effect of P2X3 antagonists, supporting the mechanism of purinergic P2X3 receptor activation leading to unexplained chronic cough (UCC). However, the role of TRP receptors in UCC is currently unclear. In this study, an interaction between P2X3 receptors on airway bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) and TRPA1 channels on upper airway nerves was explored in vitro as a potential mechanism for UCC.

It was hypothesized that irritants activating TRP channels can result in ATP release from airway nerves, resulting in P2X3 receptor activation on adjacent airway epithelial cells. To investigate the role of TRPA1 channel activation of P2X3 receptors, an indirect in vitro cell model was developed to demonstrate whether activation of TRPA1 channels expressed on neuronal cells results in ATP release that subsequently activates P2X3 receptors on adjacent BECs.

- **Proposed mechanism**: TRPA1 activation on neuronal cells leads to the release of ATP and activation of P2X3 receptors on airway epithelial cells. MAF‐454 is a P2X3 receptor antagonist that inhibits P2X3 receptor activation.

- **Quantification of ATP release**: ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit was used to measure ATP release in cell supernatants after treatment of dorsal root ganglion ND8/34 cell lines with a TRPA1-specific agonist (JT010, 100 nM). ATP release was compared to identically treated cells preincubated with a TRPA1-specific antagonist (HC‐030031 5 μM). Mean ATP concentration in the JT010-treated samples and HC‐030031 + JT010-treated samples were 0.52.

### Whooping cough: The current scene [^115u91xF]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Pertussis, a highly contagious disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, is making a global comeback despite good immunization coverage. Developed countries have shown a shift in the epidemiology of the disease to the adolescent and adult age groups, leading to a revision of vaccination policies. The disease epidemiology in the Southeast Asian region seems poised for a similar change. Outbreaks have been reported among children and adults in countries such as Afghanistan, Israel, and Taipei.

Anticipation and early recognition of this change in epidemiology are crucial because affected adolescents and adults act as reservoirs of the disease to the vulnerable population of infants, for whom the disease can be life-threatening. In adolescents, the clinical presentation can be atypical, and the disease is often misdiagnosed. With the availability of polymerase chain reaction and serology, pertussis can be diagnosed even later in the disease course when culture results are often negative.

The whole-cell pertussis vaccine dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease but fell into disrepute due to rare, serious neurologic side effects. This led to the introduction of the acellular pertussis vaccine, which caused fewer adverse reactions and proved to be safe and effective as a booster in adolescents. However, the cost of the acellular vaccine may be prohibitive for widespread use in the developing nations of the Southeast Asian region.

### Omalizumab for the treatment of multiple food allergies [^113CUYJv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The OUtMATCH study, published by Robert A. Wood and colleagues in 2024 in the New England Journal of Medicine, examines the role of omalizumab in patients with multiple food allergies. It focuses on conditions such as food allergy, milk protein allergy, egg allergy, and peanut allergy.

The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 177 patients (77 female, 100 male).

- **Population**: Patients aged 1–55 years with a history of allergy to peanuts and at least two other trial-specified foods were included.

- **Exclusion criteria**: The study excluded individuals with poorly controlled or severe asthma, a history of severe anaphylaxis to patient-specific foods, previous immunotherapy for any protocol-specified foods, or those who had monoclonal antibody therapy within six months before screening.

- **Interventions**: In the trial, 118 participants received omalizumab subcutaneously, with doses based on weight and total IgE levels every 2–4 weeks for a total of 16–20 weeks. Fifty-nine participants received a subcutaneous matching placebo on the same schedule.

- **Primary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in successful consumption of peanut protein — a single dose of 600 mg — without dose-limiting symptoms at week 16 (67% vs. 7%; AD 60%, 95% CI 47 to 70) in the omalizumab group compared to the placebo group.

- **Secondary outcomes**: A significant increase was observed in the successful consumption of cashew protein — a single dose of 1,000 mg — without dose-limiting symptoms at week 16 (41% vs. 3%; AD 38%, 95% CI 19 to 52).

These findings underscore the potential of omalizumab as an effective treatment for patients with multiple food allergies.

In the context of medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, particularly concerning omalizumab, the CTS 2017 guidelines recommend considering the use of omalizumab in pediatric and adolescent patients.

### Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) contributes to Bordetella pertussis inflammatory pathology [^112DiB8Y]. Infection and Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

Whooping cough (pertussis) is a severe pulmonary infectious disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. Pertussis infects an estimated 24 million people annually, resulting in over 150,000 deaths. The NIH placed pertussis on the list of emerging pathogens in 2015. Antibiotics are ineffective unless administered before the onset of the disease's characteristic cough. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel pertussis therapeutics.

We have shown that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonists reduce pertussis inflammation without increasing bacterial burden. Transcriptomic studies were performed to identify this mechanism and allow for the development of pertussis therapeutics that specifically target problematic inflammation without sacrificing bacterial control. These data suggested a role for triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1). TREM-1, a cell surface receptor, functions as an amplifier of inflammatory responses. Expression of TREM-1 is increased in response to bacterial infection of mucosal surfaces.

In mice, B. pertussis infection results in Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent increased expression of TREM-1 and its associated cytokines. Interestingly, S1PR agonists dampen pulmonary inflammation and TREM-1 expression. Mice challenged intranasally with B. pertussis and treated with ligand-dependent (LP17) and ligand-independent (GF9) TREM-1 inhibitors showed no differences in bacterial burden and significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2) expression compared to controls.

### The evolving algorithm of biological selection in severe asthma [^115Mgwvm]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

New therapeutic options for severe asthma have recently emerged, mostly in the form of monoclonal antibodies ("biologicals") targeting relevant inflammatory pathways. Currently available agents target different aspects of "Type 2" immunity, and their indications often include overlapping patient groups. We present a round-table discussion that took place during the Annual Meeting of the Respiratory Effectiveness Group (REG) on the reasoning behind the use of different add-on medications for severe asthma and, crucially, on selection strategies.

The proposed rationale is based on evidence, including real-life studies, as well as an appreciation of the relevant complexities. Direct head-to-head comparisons of biologicals are lacking; therefore, algorithms for the initial choice and potential switch between agents should be based on understanding the key characteristics of different options and the development of a clear plan with predefined targets and shared decision-making, in a structured way.

### Spectrum and impact of reported side effects of omalizumab in patients with chronic urticaria: A long-term multicentre real-world study [^111UUWWL]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

Furthermore, side effects rarely (2.4%) led to omalizumab discontinuation, possibly indicating that the side effects were generally well tolerated. This is further supported by previous reports of long omalizumab drug survival related to side effects, indicating that discontinuation due to side effects over time is uncommon. However, this could also be due to the absence of effective and safe alternative treatments, leading to the higher acceptance of the experienced side effects during omalizumab treatment. As new therapies for chronic urticaria (CU) emerge, part of the patients reporting side effects but continuing omalizumab may consider switching to alternative options.

We expect that this will most likely concern patients with side effects and insufficient response who continued treatment: 5.5% (n = 100). Even patients who reported side effects with a complete/good omalizumab response (12.8%, n = 238) may reconsider their options depending on the severity and chronicity of their side effects. Currently, in a small proportion of patients (2.4%), mainly those experiencing arthralgia/myalgia, headache, and fatigue, these side effects led to omalizumab discontinuation. Nevertheless, many more patients (5.9%, 11.2%, and 15.5%, respectively) with these particular side effects continued treatment.

Patients with these specific side effects may consider other drugs more if available. Herewith, these results provide insight into the potential impact of side effects on treatment choices in the future therapeutic landscape of CU.

### Pertussis: Point-of-care testing in the making [^115MdF8Z]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pertussis, or whooping cough, is traditionally considered a "classical" childhood disease, with symptoms so typical that it is easily diagnosed clinically. However, in predominantly vaccinated populations, pertussis presents in a wide array of clinical scenarios, from atypical coughing and apneas in infants to long-lasting non-productive coughs in adults. Despite being considered primarily a childhood disease, pertussis affects all age groups, as neither infection nor vaccination provides lifelong protection. Consequently, symptoms of infection with *Bordetella pertussis* can mimic those of many other, mostly viral, pathogens. Recognizing pertussis as a vaccine-preventable disease makes accurate diagnosis essential, and this can be achieved through various laboratory tests. The culture of *B. pertussis* is the classical method but is the least sensitive. While serology is particularly vital for diagnosing the disease in adolescents and adults, the detection of *Bordetella* DNA through amplification methods such as PCR is now the mainstay in the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough.

Amplification methods, traditionally time-consuming, laborious, and expensive, have seen advancements over recent years with devices now allowing the detection of *Bordetella* DNA and other respiratory pathogens outside of dedicated laboratory settings. However, these methods still require complex equipment to control the PCR temperature cycle, and reagents remain quite costly. As an isothermal alternative to PCR, LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) has been developed.

### Genome-wide association study identifies SNPs in the MHC class II loci that are associated with self-reported history of whooping cough [^113Wbt9b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Overall, the proportion of participants who reported a history of whooping cough was 0.11 (95% CIs 0.10–0.12) in ALSPAC and 0.15 (95% CIs 0.14–0.16) in the 1958 birth cohort. In ALSPAC, all participants were female, and 72% were born between 1958 and 1968, whereas in the 1958 birth cohort, 50.6% were female and all were born in 1958.

In ALSPAC, the proportion of participants who reported a positive history varied across the year of birth, being highest for participants born pre-1958 and after 1968, and lowest between 1958 and 1967. In the 1958 birth cohort, a history of whooping cough was more common in girls than boys. In ALSPAC, there was good agreement between self-reported histories of whooping cough reported 8 years after initial data collection. Eighty-one and 89% of subjects with repeat data on positive or negative self-reported histories of whooping cough reported consistently at both time periods (Cohen's kappa 0.56).

### Emergence of whooping cough: Notes from three early epidemics in Persia [^115oMzWP]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Whooping cough is a relatively new infectious disease afflicting human beings compared with other infectious diseases, and it is undergoing a resurgence despite decades of vaccination. The oldest known epidemic is thought to be the Paris outbreak of 1578. In this historical review, we describe three epidemics of whooping cough in Persia, which, although arising roughly one century before the Paris outbreak, have not been examined in detail. A great amount of epidemiological detail was reported that not only distinguishes the various stages and complications of whooping cough, but also reveals unique immunological aspects of this disease. The first of these epidemics is the oldest recorded whooping cough epidemic.

On the basis of epidemiological features, we propose that this whooping cough epidemic was the first to have taken place in Persia and might have been part of the first pandemic. This theory pushes back the date of the first documented emergence of whooping cough by almost a century, which matches molecular data about its spread. Here, we discuss features of these early epidemics in relation to their initial emergence, potential origins, and spread to Europe.

### Symptomatic treatment of the cough in whooping cough [^116hqVme]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The worldwide incidence of whooping cough (pertussis) has been estimated at 48.5 million cases and nearly 295,000 deaths per year. In low-income countries, the case-fatality rate among infants may be as high as 4%. Much of the morbidity of whooping cough in children and adults is due to the effects of the paroxysmal cough. Cough treatments proposed include corticosteroids, beta 2-adrenergic agonists, pertussis-specific immunoglobulin, antihistamines, and possibly leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions to reduce the severity of paroxysmal cough in whooping cough in children and adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 1), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); MEDLINE (1950 to March 2009); EMBASE (1980 to March 2009); AMED (1985 to March 2009); CINAHL (1982 to March 2009), and LILACS (March 2009).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention (excluding antibiotics and vaccines) to suppress the cough in whooping cough.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the quality of each trial. The primary outcome was the frequency of paroxysms of coughing. Secondary outcomes were frequency of vomiting, frequency of whoop, frequency of cyanosis (turning blue), and development of serious complications.

This overview will demonstrate that cough is a common and potentially expensive healthcare problem. Improvement in the quality of care for those with cough has been the focus of study across various disciplines in medicine. The purpose of the Cough Guideline and Expert Panel is to synthesize knowledge in a form that will aid clinical decision-making for the diagnosis and management of cough across disciplines and also identify gaps in knowledge and treatment options.

### Pertussis (whooping cough) [^117R1TCx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In the absence of systematic vaccination with the pertussis vaccine, essentially every person will suffer whooping cough during infancy or childhood; many will suffer serious sequelae or die. No medical intervention is risk-free, but modern pertussis vaccines are both effective and safe — indeed, vastly safer than avoiding vaccination. Pertussis is an endemic and highly contagious disease; outbreaks will continue to occur. In an outbreak, vaccinated children are less likely to be infected; if infected, illness will be less severe [51–53, 332]. Unvaccinated children are at much higher risk of infection and, if infected, at much higher risk of adverse outcomes. A number of approaches to new vaccines with more durable protection are under investigation.

### Covid-19 in a patient with severe asthma treated with Omalizumab [^112iwNYt]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that the patient described in this case report might have been protected from an asthma exacerbation or pneumonia during Covid-19, either because of the underlying disease (allergic asthma) or due to the antibody used for treatment (Omalizumab), or both. Therefore, studies are needed to characterize the precise interaction of chronic airway diseases (such as asthma) and biologics (such as Omalizumab) with SARS‐CoV‐2 infections in humans.

### Beneficial effects of treatment with anti-IgE antibodies (omalizumab) in a patient with severe asthma and negative skin-prick test results [^116fbp1Y]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

It is now well recognized that treatment with anti-IgE antibodies like omalizumab is a valuable option in patients with allergic asthma who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment. To our knowledge, treatment with omalizumab in patients with nonallergic asthma has not been reported. We present and discuss a patient with severe asthma and elevated total IgE who had a negative radioallergosorbent (RAST) test result and a negative skin-prick test result; the patient showed a dramatic improvement with this treatment strategy.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and to make recommendations useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, it is often associated with the accumulation of excessive mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children: A diagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis [^113PvBEr]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Pertussis (whooping cough) is a highly infective cause of cough that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Existing case definitions include paroxysmal cough, whooping, and posttussive vomiting, but diagnosis can be difficult. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and SCI-EXPANDED/CPCI-S up to June 2016. Eligible studies compared clinical characteristics in those positive and negative for Bordetella pertussis infection, confirmed by laboratory investigations. Two authors independently completed screening, data extraction, and quality and bias assessments. For each characteristic, RevMan was used to produce descriptive forest plots. The bivariate meta-analysis method was used to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

- **Results**: Of 1,969 identified papers, 53 were included. Forty-one clinical characteristics were assessed for diagnostic accuracy. In adult patients, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever have a high sensitivity (93.2% [CI, 83.2–97.4] and 81.8% [CI, 72.2–88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [CI, 14.7–28.1] and 18.8% [CI, 8.1–37.9]), whereas posttussive vomiting and whooping have low sensitivity (32.5% [CI, 24.5–41.6] and 29.8% [CI, 8.0–45.2]) and high specificity (77.7% [CI, 73.1–81.7] and 79.5% [CI, 69.4–86.9]). Posttussive vomiting in children is moderately sensitive (60.0% [CI, 40.3–77.0]) and specific (66.0% [CI, 52.5–77.3]).

- **Conclusions**: In adult patients, the presence of whooping or posttus

### Omalizumab for asthma in adults and children [^115512MZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Asthma is a respiratory condition that affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits free serum immunoglobulin E (IgE); it is referred to as an 'anti-IgE' drug. IgE is an immune mediator involved in clinical manifestations of asthma. A recent update of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance in 2013 recommends omalizumab for use as add-on therapy in adults and children over six years of age with inadequately controlled severe persistent allergic IgE-mediated asthma who require continuous or frequent treatment with oral corticosteroids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of omalizumab versus placebo or conventional therapy for asthma in adults and children.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials for potentially relevant studies. The most recent search was performed in June 2013. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and searched online trial registries and drug company websites.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials examining anti-IgE administered in any manner for any duration were included. Trials with co-interventions were also included, as long as they were the same in each arm.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study quality and extracted and entered data. Three modes of administration were identified from the published literature: inhaled, intravenous, and subcutaneous injection. The main focus of the updated review…

### Montelukast for postinfectious cough in adults: A double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial [^111TM3vG]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2014). High credibility.

Postinfectious cough is common in primary care, but no proven effective treatments exist. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are involved in the pathogenesis of postinfectious cough and whooping cough (pertussis). We investigated the effectiveness of montelukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, in the treatment of postinfectious cough.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial, non-smoking adults aged 16–49 years with postinfectious cough of 2–8 weeks' duration were recruited from 25 general practices in England. Patients were tested for pertussis (oral fluid anti-pertussis toxin IgG) and randomly assigned (1:1) to montelukast 10 mg daily or image-matched placebo for 2 weeks. Patients could choose whether to continue the study drug for another 2 weeks. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated and stratified by general practice. Patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers were masked to treatment allocation. Effectiveness was assessed with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire to measure changes in cough-specific quality of life; the primary outcomes were changes in total score between baseline and two follow-up stages (2 weeks and 4 weeks). The primary analysis was by intention to treat with imputation by last observation carried forward. Recruitment closed on Sept 21, 2012, and follow-up has been completed. This trial is registered with EudraCT (2010–019647–19), UKCRN Portfolio (ID 8360), and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01279668).

- **Findings**: From April 13, 2011, to Sept 21, 2012, we randomly assigned 276 patients to montelukast (n = 137) or placebo (n = 1…

### Emergence of Bordetella holmesii as a causative agent of whooping cough, Barcelona, Spain [^114vhzvB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Even in the absence of clear recommendations to treat pertussis-like respiratory infections caused by B. holmesii, several studies have reported controversial results about a possible lower activity of macrolides compared with other antimicrobial agents. Unfortunately, because we could not recover the bacterial isolates, we were unable to perform antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing. However, no evidence of complications or relapses was observed in any patient after treatment with azithromycin.

B. holmesii lacks most of the antigens present in the pertussis acellular vaccine, or the proteins produced differ phenotypically. This situation, together with the lack of protection against replication observed in immunized mice, suggests the absence of cross-protection against B. holmesii infections. In our study, most of the patients had received the complete immunization schedule of 5 doses. Thus, the increasing trend of whooping cough might be attributed not only to B. pertussis adaptation to the introduction of the acellular pertussis vaccine, decreased vaccine efficacy, or waning immunity, as previously reported, but also to the emergence of secondary pathogens, such as B. holmesii, which the pertussis vaccine might not prevent.

Our study describes the emergence of B. holmesii as a causative agent of whooping cough in Spain. Accurate diagnosis of the causative agent of this disease is crucial to determine the real incidence and prevalence of the microbial species involved, to assess its contribution to the epidemiology of whooping cough, and to evaluate whether sp

### Recognition and management of severe asthma: A Canadian Thoracic Society position statement [^111gcWDw]. Canadian Journal of Respiratory, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly concerning biologic therapy, the CTS 2017 guidelines suggest offering omalizumab to pediatric and adolescent patients who experience repeated exacerbations or poor control. This is especially pertinent when therapy is stepped down from high-dose to moderate-dose ICSs along with at least one other controller, due to the known risk of side effects associated with high-dose ICSs in pediatric patients.

### The use of anti-IgE therapy beyond allergic asthma [^114YoB5H]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that has been used to treat allergic asthma for over a decade. The use of omalizumab to treat other diseases has largely been limited to case reports until recently reported large multicenter studies that have established omalizumab as an effective treatment option for chronic spontaneous urticaria. The utility of omalizumab to treat nonallergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, and the added safety and therapeutic benefits in combination with allergen immunotherapy, have been demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials. Data supporting the clinical efficacy of omalizumab in treating atopic dermatitis, physical urticarias, mast cell disorders, food allergy, and various other allergic disorders have shown promise in small clinical trials and case studies. More carefully designed, large clinical trials of high quality are needed to fully appreciate the potential of omalizumab in treating various allergic and nonallergic diseases.

### The clinical benefit of mepolizumab replacing omalizumab in uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma [^112GH5zV]. Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

- **Safety**: Overall, 124 patients (86%) experienced an on‐treatment adverse event (AE). The most frequently reported AEs were headache (28%) and viral upper respiratory tract infection (17%). Sixteen patients (11%) experienced an on‐treatment serious adverse event (SAE), of whom 7 (5%) experienced worsening asthma. These seven patients did not display any common clinical characteristics, and all tested negative for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Overall, AEs were comparable in the first 16 weeks of the study, when omalizumab was within the patients' system, and in the second 16 weeks of the study, when omalizumab is anticipated to have washed out.

- **Adverse events leading to discontinuation**: Two patients (1%) experienced AEs that led to permanent treatment discontinuation. One patient reported a nonserious AE of worsening urticaria and subsequently restarted omalizumab, which is indicated for the treatment of urticaria. A second patient met the protocol-defined ECG stopping criteria with a nonserious AE of prolonged ECG QT. Neither AE was considered related to mepolizumab treatment by the investigator. Both patients discontinued treatment but remained within the study until completion.

- **Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis**: No events of anaphylaxis were reported. One systemic hypersensitivity reaction was reported, described as a symptom of headache. This occurred in a patient 35 days after the first dose and 4 days after the last dose of mepolizumab. The reaction was assessed as mild and nonserious by the investigator and resolved with continued mepolizumab treatment.

### Omalizumab in chronic urticaria: A retrospective series of 15 cases [^116NcctY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody approved for the treatment of severe allergic asthma. There is increasing evidence in the literature of its usefulness in chronic urticaria. Herein, we report a retrospective case series of 15 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria treated with omalizumab. We reviewed their medical records to assess the improvement achieved after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Complete response was defined as symptom disappearance that could be followed by discontinuation of antihistamines, and partial response as symptom improvement but with symptom worsening when attempting to discontinue antihistamines.

After 3 months of treatment, 12 patients responded, with partial response in 9 and complete response in 3. At 6 months, 8 of 10 patients continuing on omalizumab had a complete response and 2 a partial response. The results of the present retrospective series show the effectiveness of omalizumab in most treated patients, which is consistent with other recently published series and studies. These data support its role in the management of patients with chronic urticaria refractory to conventional treatments.

### Omalizumab as a steroid-sparing agent in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [^111ChdSk]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is an idiopathic eosinophilic pulmonary disease characterized by an abnormal and marked accumulation of eosinophils in the lung. Common presenting complaints include cough, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, and night sweats. Common laboratory abnormalities are peripheral blood and BAL eosinophilia. The pathognomonic radiographic finding is bilateral peripheral infiltrates. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy, and dramatic improvement follows treatment. However, relapses are common, and most patients require prolonged therapy. Side effects associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy must be monitored.

This report describes a case involving a 36-year-old woman who exhibited characteristic clinical and radiologic features. She was initially treated with corticosteroids but required prolonged therapy, resulting in side effects. Due to her high IgE levels and a positive skin prick test, we administered omalizumab for treatment. The patient responded well. To our knowledge, this is the first CEP case in the literature successfully treated with omalizumab.
