## Question

Posttraumatic stress disorder dermatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relates to dermatologic disease, including mechanisms, manifestations, comorbidities, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining PTSD and its core psychophysiology. Then, I should verify the bidirectional brain–skin axis and stress-responsive dermatoses. Next, I will categorize the dermatologic manifestations linked to PTSD, including sensory flashbacks, autonomic arousal, dissociation/self-injury, and stress-triggered inflammatory flares. After that, I should review epidemiology and comorbidity patterns, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, chronic urticaria, and alopecia areata. Finally, I will outline a multidisciplinary management approach and highlight screening and treatment principles, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus emerging or controversial [^114snAH5] [^112JMcE4].

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct of PTSD and its pathophysiology. PTSD arises after exposure to trauma and features intrusive re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions/mood, and hyperarousal, with neurobiologic changes in fear circuitry, threat detection, and executive control; neuroendocrine abnormalities include HPA axis dysregulation and altered sympathetic tone, which plausibly intersect with cutaneous neuroimmune pathways [^114snAH5] [^112JMcE4].

> Wait, let me verify the brain–skin axis before I over-attribute causality. The skin possesses a local HPA-equivalent and dense neuroimmune innervation; stress activates central and peripheral HPA and sympathetic pathways that modulate barrier function, inflammation, and pruritus, establishing a bidirectional loop whereby stress can trigger or worsen skin disease and skin disease can amplify stress and psychiatric symptoms [^116TUoFY] [^116hGzgG] [^112qx6UL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform effects of stress on skin. I initially thought stress uniformly worsens dermatoses, but I should double-check the paradoxical data: in experimental models, acute stress and stress-induced glucocorticoids can paradoxically reduce inflammation in inflamed skin, whereas chronic stress and sustained HPA activation impair barrier function and promote chronic inflammation; clinically, chronic stress is more consistently linked to disease exacerbation, so I need to reconcile these findings by emphasizing chronicity and disease context rather than assuming a universal detrimental effect [^116sVYUC] [^1177KgKe] [^113u4Vu9] [^115WbPtQ].

> Next, I should review how PTSD manifests dermatologically. Let me consider four categories: (1) intrusion phenomena with cutaneous sensory flashbacks or trauma-linked urticaria/angioedema; (2) autonomic hyperarousal with night sweats, flushing, and idiopathic urticaria; (3) dissociation/conversion with numbness or medically unexplained cutaneous symptoms; and (4) cutaneous self-injury including dermatitis artefacta, neurotic excoriations, and trichotillomania; these patterns align with core PTSD symptom clusters and stress-reactive dermatoses [^112JMcE4] [^112kDVBb] [^1155tQ8P].

> I will now examine stress-reactive inflammatory dermatoses that commonly co-occur with PTSD. Atopic dermatitis shows robust associations with anxiety and depression and is stress-sensitive via barrier dysfunction and neuroimmune amplification; psoriasis similarly flares with stress and carries elevated risks of anxiety and depression; chronic idiopathic urticaria can be triggered by autonomic hyperarousal and trauma reminders, and PTSD may present with delayed onset, obscuring the link; alopecia areata has emerging data linking trauma exposure and PTSD with increased risk, supporting a psychoneuroimmune component [^1176GNeY] [^112wcSNd] [^115WbPtQ] [^114xwjVD] [^1155tQ8P] [^111tgXgg].

> Let me think about epidemiology and burden to ensure clinical relevance. PTSD is common in the general population, and dermatology clinics have high psychiatric comorbidity; large outpatient studies show elevated rates of depression and anxiety across common skin diseases, with notable suicidal ideation tied to skin disease burden; burn survivors and patients with severe drug reactions (SJS/TEN) demonstrate substantial PTSD prevalence and long-term psychosocial sequelae, underscoring the need for routine psychiatric screening in high-risk dermatologic contexts [^114snAH5] [^113dA4MM] [^114xwjVD] [^112nqKNH] [^112HjJP1] [^117DYT4E].

> I should confirm the directionality and strength of evidence for specific comorbidities. High-quality cohort data indicate adults with atopic dermatitis have about twice the odds of depression and higher odds of anxiety, with severity correlating to mental health burden; psoriasis guidelines explicitly recommend screening for anxiety and depression and note that treating psoriasis can improve mood symptoms; chronic urticaria and PTSD share autonomic and re-experiencing features, and PTSD may be underrecognized in urticaria clinics; alopecia areata cohorts show increased psychiatric comorbidity including PTSD, though causality remains under study [^112wcSNd] [^115LF4rM] [^111HnqM3] [^1155tQ8P] [^111tgXgg].

> Next, I should review management principles, and I need to ensure I emphasize nonconfrontational, collaborative care. For suspected PTSD-related dermatologic presentations, a multidisciplinary approach integrating dermatology, psychiatry, and psychology yields the best outcomes; for dermatitis artefacta and related self-induced lesions, avoid confrontation, build rapport, and treat skin and psyche in parallel; for stress-reactive inflammatory dermatoses, optimize anti-inflammatory therapy while adding stress reduction, sleep optimization, and cognitive-behavioral strategies; when PTSD is suspected, refer for trauma-informed care, as probing trauma without safety can destabilize patients [^116AsU36] [^112W3aoq] [^116tHhSW] [^1155tQ8P].

> But wait, what about pharmacotherapy specifics at the interface of PTSD and dermatology. I should confirm that SSRIs/SNRIs can target both PTSD and psychopruritic syndromes, and that agents with antipruritic and sedative properties (e.g., doxepin) may help when nocturnal itch and anxiety coexist; emerging data suggest adjunctive brexpiprazole with sertraline improves PTSD symptoms and functioning, which may indirectly benefit adherence and stress-related flares, though dermatologic applications require judicious, comorbidity-informed prescribing [^117J2aAr] [^117ALtVE] [^115hNQUr].

> I need to ensure screening and follow-up are practical. Routine assessment for sleep disturbance, itch-related impairment, and psychosocial stressors should be embedded in dermatologic visits; validated screens for depression/anxiety (PHQ-9, GAD-7) and PTSD (PC-PTSD) can be used selectively, with referral thresholds kept low in high-risk groups such as those with SJS/TEN, burns, or recalcitrant pruritic disease; guidelines for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis endorse asking about mood symptoms and referring when indicated, even if evidence for routine universal screening remains under study [^116hb6Vu] [^1176GNeY] [^117DYT4E] [^116NqgwT].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating causality. Much of the literature is observational and bidirectional, with stress worsening skin disease and skin disease worsening stress; experimental human data on stress as a causal trigger are limited, so I should frame stress and PTSD as important contributors within a multifactorial model rather than sole causes, and tailor interventions to the patient's stress reactivity profile and disease phenotype [^115WbPtQ] [^112BgTVc].

> In summary, PTSD intersects with dermatologic disease through neuroendocrine dysregulation, autonomic hyperarousal, and maladaptive behaviors, producing sensory flashbacks, stress-triggered flares of inflammatory dermatoses, and self-injurious skin findings; recognizing these links enables early identification, nonjudgmental care, and coordinated treatment that addresses both skin and psyche, improving outcomes where either domain alone might fail [^112JMcE4] [^116AsU36] [^1176GNeY].

PTSD-related dermatitis reflects the **bidirectional brain–skin axis** [^115WbPtQ], with stress triggering or worsening skin disease via HPA/ANS dysregulation [^116PHSQL] and immune alterations [^112JMcE4]. PTSD can present with **cutaneous sensory flashbacks**, autonomic hyperarousal (night sweats, flushing, urticaria) [^112JMcE4], and self-induced lesions (dermatitis artefacta, excoriations) [^112kDVBb]. Common stress-reactive dermatoses (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, chronic urticaria) are often exacerbated by PTSD [^112JMcE4]. Management requires a **multidisciplinary approach** [^112W3aoq] combining dermatologic care, trauma-informed psychotherapy, and selective psychotropics; screening for PTSD in chronic or treatment-resistant dermatoses is essential to break the stress–skin cycle and improve outcomes [^112JMcE4].

## Clinical manifestations of PTSD-related dermatitis

PTSD-related dermatitis spans **psychophysiologic, primary psychiatric, and secondary psychiatric** categories [^11293Lty] [^112JMcE4]:

- **Cutaneous sensory flashbacks**: Re-experiencing trauma via localized sensations (itch, pain, burning) linked to the traumatic event [^112kDVBb] [^112JMcE4].

- **Autonomic hyperarousal**: Night sweats, flushing, and idiopathic urticaria from sympathetic activation [^1155tQ8P] [^112JMcE4].

- **Self-induced lesions**: Dermatitis artefacta, neurotic excoriations, and trichotillomania as tension-reducing behaviors [^112kDVBb] [^113tjGvh].

- **Stress-reactive dermatoses**: Exacerbations of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and chronic urticaria via stress-induced immune dysregulation [^112JMcE4] [^112kDVBb].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

The **brain–skin axis** mediates PTSD-related dermatitis through interconnected pathways:

- **Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation**: Chronic stress alters cortisol signaling, impairing barrier function and promoting inflammation [^113t2HHF] [^113u4Vu9] [^112qx6UL].

- **Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation**: Sympathetic hyperarousal causes vasodilation, sweating, and pruritus [^112JMcE4] [^112kDVBb].

- **Immune dysregulation**: Stress shifts cytokine profiles, worsening inflammatory dermatoses [^112JMcE4] [^112uuyYZ].

- **Neurogenic inflammation**: Substance P and other neuropeptides amplify itch and inflammation [^113NHhvw] [^116hGzgG].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Diagnosis relies on **clinical correlation** of cutaneous findings with PTSD features and trauma history:

- **Clinical correlation**: Link skin findings to PTSD symptoms and trauma exposure [^112JMcE4].

- **Patient history**: Screen for trauma, intrusive memories, avoidance, hyperarousal, and self-injury [^112kDVBb].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude organic dermatoses and other psychocutaneous disorders [^113tjGvh].

- **Multidisciplinary assessment**: Combine dermatologic and psychiatric evaluations [^112W3aoq].

---

## Management strategies

Effective care integrates dermatologic, psychiatric, and psychological interventions:

- **Dermatologic care**: Treat lesions and symptoms while minimizing iatrogenic harm [^notfound].

- **Psychiatric treatment**: Trauma-focused psychotherapy (CBT, EMDR) and SSRIs/SNRIs for PTSD and comorbid anxiety/depression [^115hNQUr].

- **Psychological interventions**: Stress reduction, mindfulness, and behavioral strategies to reduce scratching and self-injury [^116tHhSW] [^117AywHD].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Coordinate dermatology, psychiatry, and psychology for holistic care [^112W3aoq] [^116AsU36].

---

## Prognosis and quality of life

PTSD-related dermatitis carries **significant psychosocial burden**, including anxiety, depression, social isolation, and reduced quality of life [^114xwjVD] [^112JMcE4]. Addressing PTSD can improve dermatologic outcomes and overall well-being [^1155tQ8P].

---

PTSD-related dermatitis reflects the **brain–skin axis**, with stress driving or worsening skin disease via neuroendocrine and immune mechanisms. Recognizing and treating both PTSD and skin disease — using a multidisciplinary approach — is key to breaking the stress–skin cycle and improving patient outcomes [^115WbPtQ] [^112JMcE4].

### Psychologic trauma, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dermatology [^112kDVBb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

Psychologic trauma refers to events (such as sexual assault, major earthquake, or plane crashes) that overwhelm an individual's capacity to cope. Psychologic trauma can result in chronic and recurring dermatologic symptoms that persist after the trauma subsides. Examples are cutaneous sensory flashbacks (which may be fragments of the sensory component of the traumatic experience), autonomic hyperarousal (with symptoms such as profuse sweating or flare-up of an underlying stress-reactive dermatosis), conversion symptoms (such as numbness, pain, or other medically unexplained cutaneous symptoms), and cutaneous self-injury (manifesting in many forms, including trichotillomania, dermatitis artefacta, and neurotic excoriations — tension-reducing behaviors in patients who have posttraumatic stress disorder).

### Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the dermatology patient [^112JMcE4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dermatologic symptoms can be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in several situations: (1) as features of some core PTSD symptoms, such as intrusion symptoms manifesting as cutaneous sensory flashbacks, as autonomic arousal manifesting as night sweats and idiopathic urticaria, and as dissociation manifesting as numbness and dermatitis artefacta; (2) the cutaneous psychosomatic effects of emotional and physical neglect and sexual abuse (eg, infantile eczema, cutaneous self-injury, and body-focused repetitive behaviors such as trichotillomania and skin picking disorder) and eating disorders, which can have dermatologic effects; (3) the direct effect of physical or sexual abuse or catastrophic life events (eg, earthquakes) on the skin; and (4) as a result of significant alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympatho-adrenal medullary axes, which can affect neuroendocrine and immune functions, and can lead to exacerbations of stress-reactive inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis, chronic urticaria, and atopic dermatitis. Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers and impaired epidermal barrier function have been reported in situations involving sustained psychologic stress and sleep deprivation. Some PTSD patients show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyporesponsiveness and higher circulating T lymphocytes, which can exacerbate immune-mediated dermatologic disorders. PTSD should be considered an underlying factor in the chronic, recurrent, or treatment-resistant stress-reactive dermatoses and in patients with self-induced dermatoses.

### Dermatitis artefacta [^116AsU36]. Clinics in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dermatitis artefacta (factitious skin disorder) is a rare psychocutaneous disorder that poses a complex clinical challenge to clinicians. The hallmarks of diagnosis include self-inflicted lesions in accessible areas of the face and extremities that do not correlate with organic disease patterns. Importantly, patients are unable to take ownership of the cutaneous signs. It is essential to acknowledge and focus on the psychologic disorders and life stressors that have predisposed the condition rather than the mechanism of self-injury. The best outcomes are achieved via a holistic approach in the setting of a multidisciplinary psychocutaneous team addressing cutaneous, psychiatric, and psychologic aspects of the condition simultaneously. A nonconfrontational approach to patient care builds rapport and trust, facilitating sustained engagement with treatment. Emphasis on patient education, reassurance with ongoing support, and judgment-free consultations are key. Enhancing patient and clinician education is essential in raising awareness of this condition to promote appropriate and timely referral to the psychocutaneous multidisciplinary team.

### Stress and psychoneuroimmunologic factors in dermatology [^114jyDZb]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

There is clinical and experimental evidence that the brain can start, influence, and stop biologic skin events. Studies suggest that the skin, as a relevant part of the "diffuse brain", can modify the quality of perceptions and feelings. The immune and the endocrine systems seem to represent the protagonists of the modulation of those events and, in this context, psychosocial stressors and interventions can lead to global health changes of great interest for dermatologists.

### Psychological factors in skin diseases: stress and skin: facts and controversies [^112BgTVc]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Psychological stress (PS) has long been related to many common skin diseases and conditions, thought to be the cause of their onset or aggravation. Although clinical experience is often in concordance with this notion, apparently scientific proof can sometimes be challenging rather than straight forward. Although many data have been published, it appears that not enough good statistical evidence exists to support them. The difficulty in validating beyond a doubt the stress-skin interactions has rendered some skepticism among physicians. The gap between clinical expertise and problematic clinical research data has led scientists to bypass the need to tackle the question directly by searching the evidence in basic science.

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^116sVYUC]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute psychological stress (PS) in response to perceived external threats provokes a suite of metabolic responses that benefit the host, not only through the rapid mobilization of endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) but also through autonomic responses (reviewed in). In contrast, it is generally accepted that excessive PS, an inevitable accompaniment of chronic illness of all types, adversely affects outcomes in chronic inflammatory disorders, as diverse as inflammatory bowel disease, coronary artery disease, and inflammatory dermatoses, including atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriasis, and chronic urticaria. Nevertheless, a recent body of work supports the concept that moderate amounts of PS can benefit the host, through a short-term enhancement of a variety of immune and neuroendocrine functions.

The negative consequences of PS have been extensively studied in normal skin, where PS in humans (or simply stress in animals) delays wound healing, disrupts permeability barrier homeostasis, impairs stratum corneum (SC) cohesion, and compromises epidermal innate immunity. Although neuroendocrine mechanisms doubtlessly have a role, to a large extent, these adverse cutaneous effects could be attributed to an increase in endogenous GCs, whose levels increase in proportion to the extent of stress. Pertinently, the link to GC could be demonstrated directly through the ability of either systemically coadministered antalarmin, an inhibitor of corticotrophin-releasing factor, or mifepristone (Ru486), a GC receptor antagonist, to normalize function in the face of ongoing stress. Accordingly, exogenous GC, whether administered systemically or topically, recapitulated all of these negative outcomes. In theory then, a sustained increase in endogenous GC due to intrinsic illness–associated or superimposed stress could harm clinical outcomes in inflammatory disorders by further compromising epithelial function. Yet, one could then ask why this component of the stress response was retained during evolution, if its consequences are uniformly detrimental.

### Dermatological manifestations of stress in normal and psychiatric populations [^1164Tx68]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article explores the way stress affects the skin, both at the molecular level, where the skin has an intricate connection to the neurocutaneous and immune systems, and at the clinical level. The concept of psychodermatology is reviewed with regard to the way skin reacts to stress, how stress is a trigger for several common skin diseases, and how neuropsychiatric disorders may have skin manifestations. The article is directed at making the dermatologist, the psychiatrist, the psychologist, and the primary physician familiar with the brain-skin mechanisms involved in stress and the resultant clinical expressions on the skin.

### How stress affects the skin: from designs to mechanisms [^115WbPtQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The reciprocal relationship between stress and skin diseases is well known, showing that for example many chronic skin diseases induce moderate‐to‐severe stress responses, such as subjective levels of psychological distress and a physiological stress response of altered hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity, that in turn might trigger a worsened disease course or progression. Although there is considerable evidence showing that stress is a common psychological consequence of skin conditions, there is much less 'hardcore' evidence from prospective studies about the possible causal effects of stress on the origin or course of a skin disease. There are at least three ways through which stress can affect the skin that all ask for different designs.
(i) Stress as a causal factor for the origin of the disease: examples are psychiatric diagnoses of factitious disorders (e.g. dermatitis artefacta) or compulsive disorders (e.g. trichotillomania), without a specific dermatological cause. These cases are usually studied in a clinical context, showing for example that successful treatments can cure these conditions.
(ii) Stress as a trigger for the worsening of a (chronic) skin disease. Examples are prospective diary studies showing that a worsening of chronic skin diseases, such as psoriasis or eczema, is temporally preceded by a phase of more stress, that for example induces maladaptive behaviour, such as higher scratching response or less adherence, or an altered HPA axis response. The number of prospective studies in this area is relatively low, but increasingly confirms the large number of cross‐sectional studies that suggest a relationship between stress and the course of skin diseases, at least during periods of high stress. Furthermore, experimental research showing that stress induction is related to increased itch severity in nonclinical populations underlines the potential relevance of experimentally examining stress‐related disease processes in patients with skin conditions.
(iii) Stress as a trigger for the onset of the skin disease: examples are many retrospective reports of patients with chronic skin conditions that report life events or other stressors in the period before the first onset of the condition, notwithstanding all the limitations of retrospective data. In contrast, large prospective and epidemiological studies, as presented by Schmidt et al.in this issue, are usually missing to demonstrate these possible causal relationships.

### Psychological stress and epidermal barrier function [^113WPPGz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The skin is the organ that acts as a barrier between the outer and inner environments of the body. It is thus exposed not only to a wide variety of physical, chemical, and thermal insults from the outside world but also to inner endogenous stimuli. Stress, once an abstract psychologic phenomenon, has taken research's center stage in recent years. The "mind-body connection" is now less of an obscure New Age term and more of an elaborate physiologic pathway by which bilateral communication occurs between body and brain. Dermatologists and dermatologic patients have long acknowledged the effect of stress on the skin and its capability to initiate, maintain, or exacerbate several skin diseases. Because disruption of epidermal barrier integrity may be important in the development of some common skin diseases, it is crucial to understand its vulnerability to psychologic stress.

### Chronic idiopathic urticaria and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): an under-recognized comorbidity [^1155tQ8P]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

A large body of literature supports the role of psychologic stress in urticaria; however, the comorbidity between chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a classic stress-mediated syndrome, has received little attention. The underlying etiology of urticaria is not identifiable in about 70% of patients, possibly because of difficulties with identification of a direct cause-and-effect relationship between a potential causative factor and the onset of urticaria. The core features of PTSD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision [DSMIV-TR]) that are important in urticaria include (1) autonomic nervous system reactivity and state of sympathetic hyperarousal that can manifest as CIU, and (2) the persistent re-experiencing of the traumatic events in PTSD, which can manifest as urticaria or angioedema, or both, affecting a previously traumatized body region (eg, urticarial wheals affecting the body region where the patient had been stabbed years earlier). The following features of PTSD make it difficult to use the cause-and-effect model for the determination of causation: (1) PTSD may first emerge years after the initial trauma and is classified as PTSD with Delayed Onset (DSMIV-TR); and (2) the traumatic triggers that precipitate the PTSD symptoms may be unique and idiosyncratic to the patient and not even qualify as stressful or traumatic by standard criteria (eg, precipitating events for the PTSD may include smell of a certain cologne that was used by the perpetrator or witnessing a scene in a movie that was reminiscent of the location where the abuse occurred). Finally, in PTSD with Delayed Onset, patients may not make a conscious association between their recurrent urticaria and their earlier traumas because they can develop classically conditioned associations between stimuli that are reminiscent of the original abuse situation and their somatic reactions such as urticaria. The clinician needs to be aware of these factors, because satisfactory resolution of the CIU may not occur without treatment of the PTSD. If the clinician suspects underlying PTSD, it is best to refer the patient to a qualified mental health professional, because detailed history taking about traumatic experiences alone can have an acute destabilizing effect and heighten PTSD symptoms in some patients.

### Disease clusters subsequent to anxiety and stress-related disorders and their genetic determinants [^114bsD76]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Over the past decade, accumulated evidence suggests a positive link between anxiety or stress-related disorders and a number of medical conditions. Previous studies have, however often relied on small samples, with incomplete follow-up, and focused on a single outcome/disease. Our study, therefore complements the knowledge gaps through a data-driven approach of including virtually all medical conditions after the diagnosis of anxiety and stress-related disorders. As a result, we managed to identify five key clusters of disease associated with a prior diagnosis of anxiety or stress-related disorders (with component diseases in the same system or across different systems), considering the temporal order and high intrinsic connectivity between diseases and with validation across two populations. Although evidence on the risk of these disease clusters after anxiety and stress-related disorders was scarce, our findings gain support from previous studies reporting associations between anxiety or stress-related disorders and individual diseases. For instance, anxiety and stress-related disorders have previously been reported to co-occur with other psychiatric disorders (e.g. major depressive episode, bipolar disorder, and alcohol dependence). Additionally, a population-based cohort study covering 5.9 million people in Denmark reported increased risks of 31 somatic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, vision problems, and hearing problems, following a prior diagnosis of neurotic disorders (including anxiety and stress-related disorders). In our previous population-based cohort study in Sweden, we also noted risk increases of 16 specific cardiovascular diseases among patients with stress-related disorders. In addition, several diseases in disease clusters predominated by skin and genitourinary diseases have been reported to be associated with anxiety or stress-related disorders, such as urinary infection, irregular menstruation, and premenstrual syndrome. We found largely similar disease clusters following a diagnosis of anxiety and stress-related disorders, with an additional cluster of musculoskeletal diseases noted among patients with stress-related disorders. Several studies have reported similar associations between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and arthritis, although using self-reported data. Furthermore, we found little role of age and sex in the identification of most disease clusters, indicating that the risk of developing these disease clusters is independent of age and sex.

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^1134cheF]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Alternatively, because of the increase in endogenous GC that accompanies PS, we hypothesized instead that superimposed PS could exert beneficial, rather than deleterious, effects in inflammatory disorders. Pertinently, supraphysiological doses of GC, whether administered systemically or topically, exert potent anti-inflammatory benefits; conversely, there are multiple, adverse consequences of GC deficiency in patients with Addison's disease. To address this issue, we examined the impact of additional exogenous stress on inflammation and epidermal function in mouse models of inflammatory skin disorders. Our results show that intervals of exogenous stress that universally compromise function in normal epidermis, paradoxically reduce inflammation and improve functional parameters in three immunologically diverse murine dermatosis models. Improvement paralleled an increase in endogenous GC, whereas blockade of GC peripheral action prevented the stress-induced improvements in inflammation and epidermal function, providing the link between the stress-induced increase in GC and improved clinical and functional outcomes. Assuming that these results will also apply to extracutaneous inflammatory disorders, these findings could explain why this component of the stress response, previously thought to be deleterious to health, has been conserved during human evolution.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^1176GNeY]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis in adults — mental health comorbidities — is linked to depression and anxiety, with ample evidence supporting these associations. For many patients, low mood may be driven by symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) including chronic itch and poor sleep, and successfully treating AD may alleviate depressive symptoms for some patients, while others may need assessment and treatment specific to their mental health.

### American Academy of Dermatology guidelines: awareness of comorbidities associated with atopic dermatitis in adults [^112wcSNd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Mental health — depression, anxiety, and self-harm in adults with atopic dermatitis (AD) show increased odds of depression and anxiety and higher likelihood of suicidal ideation: pooling 4 studies, AD was associated with double the odds of depression (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53–2.59), and for anxiety the OR was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12–1.75); adults with AD were more likely to have suicidal ideation than adults without AD (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.43–2.03), while there is lower certainty and conflicting evidence supporting a potential association with death from suicide, with 1 case-control study and 1 cohort study finding a modest increase and other studies finding nonsignificant decreases; the text notes reasons are unclear, citing psychosocial burden and symptom factors, and that trials in moderate-to-severe AD demonstrate decreases in depression and anxiety with improvement of skin disease.

### Dermatitis artefacta [^113tjGvh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Dermatitis artefacta, also known as factitial dermatitis, is a condition whereby self-induced skin damage is the means used to satisfy a conscious or unconscious desire to assume the sick role. It is particularly common in women and in those with an underlying psychiatric diagnosis or external stress. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and it is often difficult to confirm, with patients rarely admitting their role in the creation of their lesions. Treatment can be challenging, and management should adopt a multidisciplinary team approach composed of dermatologists and mental health professionals. We present a literature review of dermatitis artefacta, highlighted by a case report of a patient with bilateral ulcerations to the legs, which after thorough investigation represented dermatitis artefacta.

### The impact of psychosocial stress on healthy skin [^116PHSQL]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are only too aware of the significant role psychosocial stress plays in the exacerbation of skin disease; indeed, it is often the first precipitant patients mention when they attend outpatient clinics. Of late, research has focused on understanding the 'brain-skin' axis, a complex interplay between the nervous and immune systems and the skin. In particular, there is an evolving body of literature exploring the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms by which psychosocial stress influences skin homeostasis. This article provides a broad overview of the literature, emphasizing the importance of individual stress perception and summarizing the varied roles of the major cutaneous stress-response pathways. Both central [the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the locus ceruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) sympathetic adrenomedullary system] and peripheral (the intracutaneous HPA axis and the release of mediators from peripheral sensory and autonomic nerves) pathways are discussed. Moreover, how activation of these pathways affects the skin's immune system, barrier function, wound healing and susceptibility to infection is reviewed. Although this field of research is rapidly expanding, several important questions remain unanswered, including: what is the precise role of mast cells in the cutaneous stress response?; what is the role of regulatory T-cells?; can therapeutic intervention be harnessed to prevent the stress-induced exacerbation of skin disease? It is anticipated that an improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which psychosocial stress affects the homeostasis of healthy skin will not only increase knowledge of the brain-skin axis but will also improve the holistic management of stress-responsive cutaneous disease.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder in Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: prevalence and risk factors. A prospective study of 31 patients [^112HjJP1]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidermal necrolysis is a rare and severe cutaneous adverse reaction to drugs with long-term somatic consequences and potentially underrecognized psychological complications.

Objectives

To assess the prevalence and risk factors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in a population of adults undergoing psychiatric evaluation.

Methods

In this prospective study, we included adult patients admitted at the acute phase of SJS/TEN to our dermatology department from June 2009 to February 2013. The main objective was to assess the prevalence of PTSD at 6 months after the acute disease phase, defined by a PTSD Checklist score > 44. Secondary objectives were to investigate risk factors of PTSD in the medical history of patients and characteristics of the disease at the acute phase by the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire (PDEQ) and Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) and the degree of impairment on the Sheehan Disability Scale.

Results

We initially included 32 of 80 patients admitted during the study period. At 6 months, seven of 30 still followed up had a PTSD Checklist score > 44, suggesting a PTSD prevalence of 23%; 23 (77%) patients had a hydroxyzine prescription at the acute phase. The main risk factors associated with PTSD at 6 months were psychological results at the acute phase.

Conclusions

Despite frequent prescription of hydroxyzine at the acute phase, almost one-quarter of patients with SJS/TEN had PTSD at 6 months. A systematic psychiatric evaluation should be offered regularly for at least 1 year after the acute disease phase.

### Psychological stress and immunoprotection versus immunopathology in the skin [^112uuyYZ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Stress is thought to suppress immune function and increase susceptibility to infections and cancer. Paradoxically, stress is also known to exacerbate autoimmune/proinflammatory disorders (eg, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) that should be ameliorated by immunosuppression. Here we review studies showing that although chronic stress (lasting for weeks/months/years) can suppress/dysregulate immune function, acute stress (lasting for minutes to hours) can have immunoenhancing effects. Short-term stress experienced at the time of immune activation enhances dendritic cell, neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte trafficking, maturation, and function, and has been shown to augment innate and adaptive immunity; therefore, depending on the conditions of immune activation, and the nature of the activating antigen, short-term stress can enhance the acquisition and expression of immunoprotection or immunopathology. In contrast, chronic stress suppresses or dysregulates innate and adaptive immune responses by altering the Type 1-Type 2 cytokine balance, inducing low-grade chronic increases in proinflammatory factors, and suppressing numbers, trafficking, and function of immunoprotective cells. Chronic stress also increases susceptibility to skin cancer by suppressing Type 1 cytokines and protective T cells while increasing regulatory/suppressor T cell number/function. It is important to recognize that the adaptive function of a physiological stress response is to promote survival. Stress-related neurotransmitters, hormones, and factors act as biological alarm signals that prepare the immune and other physiological systems for potential challenges (eg, wounding or infection) perceived by the brain (eg, detection of an attacker); however, this may exacerbate immunopathology (eg, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) if the enhanced immune response is directed against innocuous or self-antigens, or if the system is chronically activated as seen during long-term stress. In view of the ubiquitous nature of stress and its significant effects on immunoprotection and immunopathology, it is important to further elucidate the mechanisms mediating both the salubrious and the harmful effects of stress, and to meaningfully translate findings from bench to bedside.

### The other side of atopic dermatitis: an evaluation of psychosocial comorbidities [^115M3t7K]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease that commonly affects patients. In addition to its effects on the skin, it has also been associated with other physical, psychosocial, and economic burdens along with numerous debilitating comorbidities. More recently, research has focused on the psychosocial and mental health aspect of atopic dermatitis, which has remained controversial. We reviewed the current literature and have discussed the association of atopic dermatitis with suicide, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia.

### Depression and skin disease [^1144KF8h]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

The occurrence of depression in association with dermatologic disease is common. Psychiatric disturbance is reported in approximately 30% of dermatology patients. Depression can have varied presentations and is more relevant clinically in dermatology patients during critical psychosocial periods of development. Early recognition and treatment of depression associated with skin disorders can lead to improved therapeutic outcomes and may avert disastrous outcomes, including suicide.

### Psychosocial stress and mechanisms of skin health: a comprehensive update [^112D8QaN]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although the relationship between psychosocial stress and skin health is commonly invoked in both the scientific and popular literature, its underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. In this review, we provide a comprehensive update on the pathophysiology of stress and its clinical impact on skin homeostasis. The recent characterization of a bidirectional HPA stress axis in the skin has illuminated peripheral stress pathways, with effects spanning inflammation, atopy, barrier function, dermal thinning, wound healing, and melanogenesis. Additionally, new research into the cutaneous microbiome suggests the development of stress-induced dysbiosis through the &ldquo; gut-brain-skin&rdquo; axis. These new findings help contextualize how lifestyle factors such as diet, personal care practices, and sleep patterns may mediate and sometimes amplify the cutaneous impacts of psychological stress. We aim to clarify these clinically important relationships and highlight areas of future study that have widespread academic, clinical, and commercial implications.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease [^112A38QD]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

In this paper, a first in a Series of two, we look at the evidence for an association of post-traumatic stress disorder with incident cardiovascular disease risk and the mechanisms that might cause this association, as well as the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder due to cardiovascular disease events and its associated prognostic risk. We discuss research done after the publication of previous relevant systematic reviews, and survey currently funded research from the two most active funders in the field: the National Institutes of Health and the US Veterans Administration. We conclude that post-traumatic stress disorder is a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease, and a common psychiatric consequence of cardiovascular disease events that might worsen the prognosis of the cardiovascular disease. There are many candidate mechanisms for the link between post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease, and several ongoing studies could soon point to the most important behavioural and physiological mechanisms to target in early phase intervention development. Similarly, targets are emerging for individual and environmental interventions that might offset the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder after cardiovascular disease events.

### Management of psychocutaneous disorders: a practical approach for dermatologists [^112W3aoq]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Psychodermatology is a growing specialty which is gaining momentum in different parts of the world. It focuses on the connection between skin and psyche. Psychocutaneous conditions are characterized by those disorders where stress is the key element in exacerbating skin conditions or flare ups of dermatoses like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. There is a direct relationship of stress with the course, and prognosis of the skin disease. In some situations, there is no skin condition but the lesions are self-inflicted and such disorders are always associated with underlying psychopathology or psychological conflicts. Sometimes emotional problems are more prominent as a result of having skin disease, and the psychological consequences may be more severe than the physical symptoms. Management of these conditions require a combination of psychpharmacology, psychotherapy, and liaison clinics of psychiatry and dermatology. This review focuses on the common management approach which can be adopted by dermatologists in treating patients with psychodermatological disorders, improving doctor-patient relationship and therapeutic bond.

### Psychocutaneous disease: clinical perspectives [^115srMqg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Psychocutaneous disease, defined in this review as primary psychiatric disease with skin manifestations, is commonly encountered in dermatology. Dermatologists can play an important role in the management of psychocutaneous disease because patients visit dermatology for treatment of their skin problems but often refuse psychiatric intervention. This review describes common psychocutaneous syndromes, including delusional, factitious, obsessive-compulsive and related, and eating disorders, as well as psychogenic pruritus, cutaneous sensory (pain) syndromes, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep-wake disorders. The updated classification of these disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition is included. Strategies for management are reviewed.

### Current concepts in psychodermatology [^117Ue5rv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Dermatology is a discipline in which psychosomatic issues serve a key purpose in helping us understand the etiology and progression of skin diseases and determining appropriate treatment protocols. Emotional factors appear to significantly influence most skin diseases, and the correlation between stressful life events and disease flares is well recognized in dermatology. In this article, recent research is highlighted for major cutaneous disease states, as well as psychiatric disorders with symptoms that present as skin disorders. The role of the expanding field of psychoneuroimmunology as it pertains to dermatologic disorders is discussed. The author also presents recommendations for optimal evaluation and management of psychosocial concerns in the dermatology patient population.

### Stress and allergic diseases [^113pTepQ]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Allergy describes a constellation of clinical diseases that affect up to 30% of the world's population. It is characterized by production of allergen-specific IgE, which binds to mast cells and initiates a cascade of molecular and cellular events that affect the respiratory tract (rhinitis and asthma), skin (dermatitis, urticaria), and multiple systems (anaphylaxis) in response to a variety of allergens including pollens, mold spores, animal danders, insect stings, foods, and drugs. The underlying pathophysiology involves immunoregulatory dysfunctions similar to those noted in highly stressed populations. The relationships in terms of potential for intervention are discussed.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder and asthma risk: a nationwide longitudinal study [^1128AEWC]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Increasing evidence suggests that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interferes with the immunological system and is correlated with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and chronic pain conditions. However, the association between PTSD and asthma remains unknown.

Methods

A total of 5518 patients with PTSD and 22,072 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were enrolled between 2001 and 2009 and followed until the end of 2011. Individuals who developed asthma during the follow-up period were identified.

Results

During the follow-up period, the patients with PTSD had an increased risk of asthma (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.27), particularly those belonging to the youngest age group (HR = 4.01). The findings were consistent in subsequent sensitivity analyses after the exclusion of the first year of surveillance or allergic disorders.

Discussion

This study showed a significant link between PTSD and asthma after adjusting for demographic data and related comorbidities. The risk of developing asthma in patients with PTSD was consistently higher than that in the controls during the study period. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms involved in this association between PTSD and asthma.

### Sex-based contributors to and consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder [^111fgcGJ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Given observations that PTSD is associated with immune dysregulation and inflammation, it is unsurprising that a bidirectional relationship with infectious disease has also been reported. In a longitudinal nationwide cohort study of all residents of Denmark diagnosed with PTSD between 1995 and 2011 (n = ~ 30,000), the association between PTSD and some infections (e.g. urinary tract and viral infections) was found to be stronger among women, whereas other associations were stronger among men (e.g. skin infections).

Three studies have also provided sex-specific differences in psychological comorbidities in association with PTSD. In a subsample of 9447 US service members with PTSD, 83% of individuals with PTSD had at least one comorbid condition. Women with PTSD were more likely to have depressive, generalised, or other anxiety disorders, with largest effect sizes for eating (OR: 12.6, 95% CI 7.9–20.1) and personality disorders (OR: 3.0, 95% CI 2.6–3.4). In contrast, men with PTSD were more likely to have a diagnosis of PTSD with comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders, with traumatic brain injury almost six times more prevalent and insomnia over twice as common in men compared to women. Given that sleep disturbances have a more prominent effect on suicidal ideation in men with PTSD compared to women (total n = 822 inpatients) suggests that it may be especially important for men to undergo empirically supported treatments for insomnia. Finally, a longitudinal study of US veterans (n = 1243) found evidence that PTSD symptoms predicted future illicit drug use problems among men, whereas drug use problems predicted future PTSD symptom severity among women. Thus, it was concluded PTSD severity should be monitored as a risk factor for future drug use in men, whereas women's drug use should be monitored as a particular risk factor for the increasing severity of PTSD symptoms.

Overall, these studies present a complex picture of possible sex-specific effects in the PTSD-disease pathway. Men appear to have heightened risk for cardiovascular disease possibly through PTSD-related changes to blood pressure, whereas women may be more at risk for dementia and metabolic syndrome. Further exploration that includes potential differential biological and behavioural (e.g. health risk behaviours) pathways is warranted.

### Dermatitis artefacta in a vulnerable adult with a dissociative state [^116cyUQf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Dermatitis artefacta (DA), a factitious skin disorder, often occurs as a response to traumatic life events or as a factitious behaviour, which may result in secondary gain. It can be difficult to get patients to engage with health services, and they seldom admit to causing the lesions themselves. The possibility of DA lesions occurring in dissociative states is less well known. We present a case of DA diagnosed in a vulnerable adult, who we believe caused the lesions during periods of dissociation. We discuss the way in which the concept of dissociation can provide an acceptable way of discussing the behaviour with patients and initiating psychological therapy.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: current evidence and future directions [^115m2J2t]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

From a risk assessment perspective, PTSD is likely multi-causal, and as such, individuals with differing vulnerabilities and different exposure and post-exposure circumstances may come to express the PTSD symptom complex through individual-specific pathways and be responsive to individual-specific interventions. One way to advance the prevention of PTSD is to better map the variety of paths leading to this condition and map those paths into subsets of trauma exposed individuals. Once such knowledge becomes available, personalized target-specific early interventions might replace generic treatment protocols, which in practice are effective for some but not for all.

Several steps should be taken in future studies. We need to step beyond diagnosis-based screenings and develop more complex accurate methods to predict individual risks of expressing debilitating symptoms and impairment after traumatic events. By enhancing prediction models, intervention studies can take the important step to select the most relevant sample for a more rigorous study design and the best clinical interest. At the same time, researchers need to continue exploring and confirming the underlying mechanisms of post-traumatic pathogenesis and, thereby, suggest new targets for novel interventions. These targeted intervention methods can allow clinicians to focus on both specific populations and specific pathological processes.

### Common mental health disorders in adults with inflammatory skin conditions: nationwide population-based matched cohort studies in the UK [^112fL6er]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Eczema and psoriasis in adults are associated with increased incidence of anxiety and depression. Our study indicates that at least part of this risk is mediated through modifiable risk factors, including sleeping problems in people with eczema. Our findings highlight potential opportunities for the prevention of anxiety and depression in people with eczema/psoriasis through treatment of modifiable risk factors and enhanced eczema/psoriasis management.

### Atopic eczema in adulthood and risk of depression and anxiety: a population-based cohort study [^1171gXKc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

We considered depression and anxiety as separate outcomes, with onset defined as the date of the first recorded diagnosis in either CPRD or HES (any inpatient hospital diagnosis). Codes for the depression outcome were those compatible with unipolar depression, and for the anxiety outcome, included those consistent with generalized anxiety and panic disorders. We considered broader definitions of depression and anxiety in prespecified sensitivity analyses (see this article's "Code lists for the outcomes (depression and anxiety)" section in the Online Repository at).

Defining follow-up

Individuals entered the cohort at the latest of: practice registration date plus 12 months; the date their practice met CPRD quality control standards; the date an individual met our atopic eczema diagnosis definition; or the start of the study (January 2, 1998). Individuals without atopic eczema entered the cohort on the same day as their matched atopic eczema–exposed case. We included a mandatory "wash-in" period of 12 months before cohort entry to ensure adequate time to capture true incident outcome diagnoses, as well as other baseline variables (eg, body mass index [BMI] and smoking).

Cohort members were followed until the first of the following events: anxiety or depression diagnosis (depending on analysis); a diagnosis suggesting an alternative cause for each outcome (ie, organic depression or dementia for depression analyses; obsessive-compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder for anxiety analyses; and schizophrenia or bipolar disease for both depression and anxiety analyses); record of a morbidity code for an atopic eczema diagnosis (for the unexposed group); death date recorded in CPRD; end of registration with practice; last data collection from practice; or the end of the study (March 31, 2016).

### Psychiatric evaluation of the dermatology patient [^113dA4MM]. Dermatologic Clinics (2005). Low credibility.

Over one third of dermatologic disorders have significant psychiatric comorbidity. The impact of the skin disorder on quality of life, the role of psychosocial stressors, and use of substances should be assessed. Major depressive disorder is the most frequently encountered psychiatric disorder in dermatology and is often associated with suicide risk. Other psychiatric syndromes comorbid with dermatologic disorders include obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder associated with dissociation and conversion symptoms, body image pathologies, delusional disorder, and a wide range of personality disorders. This article reviews psychiatric guidelines that may be used to assess psychopathology in the dermatology patient.

Methods

A Critically Appraised Topic was completed based on the four main steps outlined by Callander et al. 27

Formation of a focused question

The original question arose from clinical practice. Using the population, exposure, outcome/theme format we devised a review question. 28, 29 We considered empirical evidence, which focused on (population) adults over 18 years of age presenting with SJS or TEN; (exposure) adverse reaction diagnosed as SJS or TEN; and (outcome) the psychological impact such as emotional upset or trauma, post‐traumatic stress, anxiety, and other impacts on individuals' wellbeing and self‐concept (Table S1; see Supporting Information).

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^112qSBG2]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute psychological stress (PS) mobilizes metabolic responses that are of immediate benefit to the host, but the current medical paradigm holds that PS exacerbates systemic and cutaneous inflammatory disorders. Although the adverse consequences of PS are usually attributed to neuroimmune mechanisms, PS also stimulates an increase in endogenous glucocorticoids (GCs) that compromises permeability barrier homeostasis, stratum corneum cohesion, wound healing, and epidermal innate immunity in normal skin. Yet, if such PS-induced increases in GC were uniformly harmful, natural selection should have eliminated this component of the stress response. Hence, we hypothesized here instead that stress-induced elevations in endogenous GC could benefit, rather than aggravate, cutaneous function and reduce inflammation in three immunologically diverse mouse models of inflammatory diseases. Indeed, superimposed exogenous (motion-restricted) stress reduced, rather than aggravated inflammation and improved epidermal function in all three models, even normalizing serum IgE levels in the atopic dermatitis model. Elevations in endogenous GC accounted for these apparent benefits, because coadministration of mifepristone prevented stress-induced disease amelioration. Thus, exogenous stress can benefit rather than aggravate cutaneous inflammatory dermatoses through the anti-inflammatory activity of increased endogenous GC.

### Psychodermatological aspects of atopic dermatitis [^113t2HHF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Psychodermatology is an evolving area of science that focuses on the interaction between the mind, skin and body. It is known that various neuroendocrine mediators - including adrenocorticotropin, β-endorphin, catecholamines and cortisol - are produced in response to stress. The resulting increase in endogenous glucocorticoids can disrupt the skin's barrier function, leaving it vulnerable to inflammatory disorders like atopic dermatitis (AD). In turn, AD is associated with high levels of stigmatization, social withdrawal, anxiety and depression among patients and their carers. It is well known that the stress caused by AD can make the symptoms of the disease worse. Therefore, the goal of psychodermatological treatment is not only to improve the condition of the skin, but also to teach patients/carers how to cope with the disease. This requires a multifaceted approach, and time and patience, to ascertain the needs of individual patients. A multidisciplinary team that includes a dermatologist, psychiatrist and psychologist will be necessary to deliver high-quality, tailored care to patients.

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^112Kycjv]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast, PS likely triggers inflammation in a setting of normal skin that is predisposed to inflammation, such as in patients predisposed to develop AD or psoriasis. Similarly, PS is thought to trigger extracutaneous inflammatory disorders, such as allergic asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease, perhaps also by compromising epithelial barrier function, cell–cell cohesion, proliferation, and/or differentiation in these extracutaneous epithelia. In these epithelia, as in the skin, PS could compromise not only barrier function but also innate immunity, likely facilitating bacterial colonization, translocation, and invasion by pathogens, e.g. from the intestinal lumen into the colonic mucosa (Ibid).

The apparent benefits of PS through the anti-inflammatory activity of increased endogenous GC production could provide benefits in combating the sequelae of traumatic injury and infectious challenges. Thus, conservation of stress reactivity within the HPA axis, with the capability to increase endogenous GC production, could have equipped humans with an endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanism in eras before the availability of exogenous GC as anti-inflammatory therapy. Yet, although preservation of HPA axis reactivity likely benefitted humans by dampening inflammation during illness, a more prolonged increase in PS can decrease HPA axis reactivity, resulting in a reduction in endogenous GC levels. Thus, the potential benefits of PS through elevated endogenous GC on epithelial barrier function, inflammation, and innate immunity likely accrue only during periods of established disease/inflammation, and predominantly in earlier stages of an inflammatory response. We propose that a prolonged increase in endogenous GC production, induced by a variety of different, subacute-to-chronic stressors (i.e. trauma, surgery, infections, and chronic inflammation), correlates with the benefits of exogenous GC in the management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as following life-threatening trauma (e.g. cranioencephalic or spinal cord injury). Together, these studies support the concept that enhanced GC in response to PS could have an important role in modulating inflammation and preserving health in humans.

### Effects of genetically predicted posttraumatic stress disorder on autoimmune phenotypes [^115iyPUG]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), characterized by intrusive memories of traumatic experiences, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, negative changes in thinking and mood, and high levels of arousal, is a debilitating psychiatric illness that can develop in response to exposure to trauma. The burden of PTSD on individuals and society is extensive, with numerous emotional, interpersonal, and socioeconomic consequences. Moreover, PTSD is also associated with numerous physical health outcomes, notably including a variety of health conditions and diseases related to immune dysregulation and inflammation. Longitudinal research has demonstrated PTSD to be associated with a heightened incidence of autoimmune diseases, including diseases of the endocrine, skin, nervous, digestive systems, connective tissues, inflammatory arthritis, and vasculitis. Shared biological mechanisms related to immune dysregulation are thought to be a primary factor linking PTSD and autoimmune diseases, as studies of peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, the epigenome, transcriptome, and common genetic variation all support the notion of immune dysregulation being involved in PTSD pathophysiology.

While longitudinal observational studies suggest that PTSD precedes the development of autoimmune diseases, causal relationships have yet to be delineated. Insights into whether PTSD and a variety of autoimmune diseases are causally related may enhance biological understanding of PTSD and its sequelae, as well as inform intervention approaches for PTSD and co-morbid autoimmune diseases. In addition to directly assessing the relationship between PTSD and autoimmune diseases, it is also beneficial to evaluate the relationship between PTSD and biomarkers of inflammation, which can be the first non-specific sign of an autoimmune disorder that prompts further evaluation. Moreover, as inflammation underlies PTSD and autoimmune disease, it is of interest to determine whether inflammation confounds or mediates their relationship. Therefore, multiple causal questions need to be investigated: (1) if PTSD gives rise to autoimmune diseases or vice versa; (2) if this relationship is bi-directional; (3) if shared underlying pathology is a common cause (confounder) between PTSD and autoimmune disease; (4) if inflammation mediates or confounds the relationship between PTSD and autoimmune disease.

### Itching following burns: epidemiology and predictors [^112sHzB6]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Itching (pruritus) following burns is a well-known clinical problem. However, there are no long-term prospective studies that document the course and the extent of the problem. Studies on risk factors are anecdotal.

Objectives

To study self-reported itching in a multicentre cohort among adults with burns at 3, 12 and 24 months postburn. Further, to examine psychological and injury characteristics in relation to itching at these three points in time.

Methods

Itching was assessed as part of a self-report scar complaint list in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Injury characteristics, demographics and self-reported post-traumatic stress symptoms were examined as possible risk factors in three linear regression models.

Results

A total of 510 persons participated. The reported prevalence rates of mild to severe itching were as high as 87%, 70% and 67% at the three respective points in time. Significant predictors of itching at all three points in time were deep dermal injury and early post-traumatic stress symptoms. Along with these, total burned surface area and female gender were predictors at 3 months postburn.

Conclusions

Itching remains a significant problem over a 2-year period. Individuals having undergone surgical procedures and experiencing early post-traumatic distress are more likely to suffer from long-term and persistent itching. Implications regarding practice and research are discussed.

### Cohort studies on 71 outcomes among people with atopic eczema in UK primary care data [^116WMANt]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Eczema, also referred to as atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis, is one of the most common chronic conditions worldwide, and is associated with a substantial morbidity burden and cost for health care systems. Eczema, besides being associated with atopic diseases such as allergies and asthma, may also be associated with non-atopic diseases, possibly due to mechanisms such as chronic inflammation (which could explain observed cardiovascular outcomes), psychological stress, low self-esteem, and sleep deprivation (which could explain observed anxiety and depression outcomes). Guidelines published by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) in June 2022 included statements on 32 different adverse health outcomes, for each judging whether an association is likely to exist and the quality of the evidence. While there was clear evidence for associations between eczema and other atopic conditions (e.g. asthma and food allergies) the prior evidence for most adverse health outcomes included in the review (including mental illness, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, osteoporosis and fractures, and skin infections) was less clear. A hypothesis-generating study published in the same year suggests associations with gastrointestinal and neurological conditions which weren't included in the guidelines, and other important outcomes may exist but may have not been discovered. There is no internationally accepted approach to screening and prevention of adverse outcomes, despite potentially substantial impact at reducing morbidity and costs for health care systems, given eczema is common.

Studies on a range of health outcomes linked to eczema have typically focused on single, or small sets of, outcomes. Here, using the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum, we employed best-practice epidemiological study design, an outcome-wide confounding-adjustment strategy, and suitable approaches to sensitivity and secondary analyses across 71 outcomes to efficiently and systematically generate high-quality evidence on associations.

### Depression and anxiety in patients with atopic dermatitis: recognizing and addressing mental health burden [^111ye8dJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The psychosocial burden of atopic dermatitis (AD) is extensive, stemming from intense itch, sleep disturbance, unpredictable flares, lifestyle restrictions and missed activities, social stigma, and treatment burden. Overall, adults with AD are at a 2- to 3-fold greater risk for depression and anxiety compared with individuals without AD and children at a 1.5-fold greater risk, with greatest risk for those with more severe disease. A number of mechanisms seem to affect the relationship between AD and mental health, including poorly controlled disease, sleep disturbance, stress-induced itch, inflammation, and coping patterns. In some cases, the mental health burden of AD may also negatively affect AD management and course, creating a reinforcing cycle of psychosocial burden. Although depression and anxiety are known comorbidities of AD, the mental health burden of AD often goes unaddressed, which may further a sense of isolation for patients and families. Given the strong association between symptom severity and increased mental health burden, optimizing AD treatment and reducing itch are critical. Health care professionals can support patients with AD and their caregivers by encouraging open conversations about mental health, addressing common areas of condition-related stress, screening for depression and anxiety, and facilitating referrals to mental health professionals for further assessment and evidence-based care. Existing research supports use of cognitive-behavioral interventions to help manage the physical and mental health burden of AD. Further research is needed to evaluate psychological interventions for pediatric patients with AD and for patients with clinical diagnoses of depression and anxiety to better guide shared decision-making around support for these patients.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^114snAH5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on posttraumatic stress disorder:

- **Definition**: PTSD is a mental disorder resulting from exposure to a traumatic experience, which is typically characterized by intrusive, involuntary, and/or distressing recollection or re-experience of the traumatic events.
- **Pathophysiology**: PTSD is caused by traumatic exposure to death, injury, sexual assault, torture, or bodily disfigurement.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the estimated prevalence of PTSD, based on the Same Event definition of DSM-V for lifetime, past 12 months, and past 6 months, is 8.3%, 4.7%, and 3.8%, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The psychological impact of trauma leads to abnormalities in fear learning, threat detection, executive function, emotion regulation, and contextual processing. These neuroendocrine changes are linked to altered activity in the amygdala. PTSD is associated with mood, anxiety, substance abuse disorders, or suicidal ideation leading to serious disability, medical illness, and premature death. The relative risk of suicidal ideation in PTSD is similar to the relative risk of generalized anxiety disorder or alcohol dependence; however, is lower than that of depression.

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^111wj86Z]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Acute PS mobilizes glucose reserves and promotes insulin resistance as part of a highly conserved, acute response to perceived external threats that provides net benefits to the host. In contrast, sustained PS reportedly provokes and exacerbates both cutaneous and extracutaneous inflammatory disorders. Skin disorders with epidermal functional abnormalities, such as psoriasis and AD, seem particularly susceptible to PS. According to the current paradigm, the pathophysiologic basis of PS can be explained by abnormalities in immune and neuroendocrine mechanisms, which amplify inflammation and pruritus in these disorders (e.g.). Yet, studies in rodent models show that the deleterious effects of stress, at least in normal skin, are largely mediated by increased endogenous GC levels, based upon studies with the nonspecific GC receptor antagonist, mifepristone (Ru486), and also supported by the fact that the administration of exogenous GC mirrors the stress-induced abnormalities.

An elevation in endogenous GC, explained by altered GC production and/or peripheral activation, often accompanies chronic illness. Although such sustained increases in GC are presumed to pose a further threat to the host, our studies suggest instead that increases in illness-associated or exogenous stress could be beneficial. We showed here that a stress-induced increase in circulating GC ameliorates cutaneous inflammation. As GC can also be produced within various cell types in the skin, it remains possible that skin-specific changes in GC could also have contributed to the apparent benefits of stress. Accordingly, recent studies have shown that failure to mount a sufficient cortisol response under stressful conditions can trigger allergic inflammation and exacerbate disease in AD patients. Moreover, HPA axis hyporesponsiveness has been linked to increased severity of the full range of atopic inflammatory disorders, further linked to decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as other neuroendocrine mediators.

### Atopic dermatitis and the nervous system [^113NHhvw]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Due to the narrow associations between the skin, immune system, and nervous system, nerve endings are very important in the pathophysiology of inflammatory dermatoses and especially in atopic dermatitis. Many neurotransmitters and nerve growth factors that are released in blood or skin are involved in neurogenic inflammation, which dramatically enhance the inflammation induced by immune cells. During times of stress, their release is highly enhanced. In atopic dermatitis lesions, there are many specific changes in skin neurobiology and neurophysiology. These interesting data suggest that novel therapeutic possibilities can be imagined.

### Suicidal behaviors in the dermatology patient [^111qLgfr]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

An assessment of suicidal behaviors in the dermatology patient may be necessary in several situations: (1) in the presence of psychiatric comorbidity (major depressive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, substance use disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder), encountered in up to 30% of dermatology patients; (2) when dermatologic symptoms ("dysmorphophobia", dermatitis artefacta) represent psychiatric pathologic conditions; (3) when psychosocial stressors (bereavement, interpersonal violence) increase the risk of suicidal behavior and exacerbate stress-reactive dermatoses (psoriasis, acne); (4) in the presence of high disease burden (chronicity, increased disease severity); (5) in instances of significant pruritus or chronic sleep disruption; (6) in the presence of facial lesions or facial scarring; (7) when social exclusion or feelings of alienation arise secondary to the skin disorder; (8) with use of medications (retinoids, biologics) for which suicidal behavior has been implicated as a possible side effect; and (9) when treating psychiatric patients experiencing a serious reaction to psychotropic medications (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and anticonvulsants). Suicide risk must be assessed within a demographic context because suicide rates rise rapidly in adolescents and young adults, among whom the prevalence of skin disorders associated with suicidal behaviors (acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) is also high, and suicide rates are increasing among white men, who tend to be overrepresented in dermatology clinical trials.

### Atopic eczema in adulthood and risk of depression and anxiety: a population-based cohort study [^112t729H]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atopic eczema (eczema, atopic dermatitis) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease. It can cause intense itching and discomfort. Itch and disfiguring lesions result in sleeplessness and social embarrassment, impairing the quality of life of both sufferers and their families. Atopic eczema is common (20% of children and up to 10% of adults in developed countries) and is a major cause of years lost because of disability. Emerging evidence suggests that biologic agents, an effective treatment modality for severe atopic eczema, may also reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among people with atopic eczema.

Mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, with depression and anxiety together accounting for more than half of that burden. Depression, manifesting as loss of interest and enjoyment in ordinary things and experiences, affects approximately 4.4% of the global population; anxiety disorders, characterized by excessive fear, anxiousness, or avoidance of perceived threats, affect approximately 3.6%. Both depression and anxiety are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Atopic eczema has been shown to be associated with common mental disorders (depression and anxiety) and suicidality in cross-sectional studies that have frequently relied on self-reported exposures and outcomes. Individuals with atopic eczema may be more likely to experience depression and anxiety through the effects of itch and discomfort, disfigurement, and perceived social-stigmatization; in addition, poor sleep related to atopic eczema may increase the risk of mental illness. Inflammatory mediators in atopic eczema could also contribute to the development of depression. However, those with depression and anxiety could also be more likely to consult for a physical condition such as atopic eczema. Because longitudinal evidence is scarce and conflicting, the temporality of any association between atopic eczema and depression and anxiety, and whether the relationship changes with increasing atopic eczema severity, remains unclear.

### Atopic dermatitis and obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review [^114Dvwx8]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prominent inflammatory skin disorder that significantly affects daily functioning and mental health in patients. Among its psychological repercussions, besides anxiety and depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has emerged with multiple studies indicating an increased risk of OCD in AD patients. This systematic review aims to synthesize and evaluate the current literature on the association between AD and OCD, with particular attention to mechanisms linking disease and integrative treatment approaches. A search of the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases was performed on September 12, 2024 to select peer-reviewed English studies relevant to our topic. Our results revealed the influences of demographic variables such as gender, age, and atopic severity as central to concomitant disease prevalence, with women and young adults posing the highest risk of comorbidity. The complex interaction between the two disease states is thought to be a bidirectional relationship characterized by immunological, behavioral, and genetic factors. Hence, an understanding of underlying pathophysiology is necessary for comprehensive management. Patients may benefit from a multifaceted approach including prescription of immunomodulatory agents and referral to psychiatry and psychology. Ultimately, we seek to inform clinical practice by advocating for interdisciplinary approaches to care and providing the framework for future investigations.

### Long-term physical and psychological outcomes of Stevens-Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis [^117DYT4E]. JAMA Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is known to cause multiple end-organ complications in its acute phase, but less is known about the long-term association with patients' mental health and quality of life.

Objective

To examine the chronic physical and psychological sequelae affecting patients with SJS/TEN.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A survey study conducted at 11 academic health centers in the US evaluated 121 adults diagnosed with SJS/TEN by inpatient consultive dermatologists between January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2019.

Interventions

Patients completed a survey that included the following validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD), and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The survey also included questions created by the study team regarding fear, patient education, and long-term sequelae relevant to SJS/TEN.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome measures were the percentage of patients reporting long-term physical sequelae; the percentage of patients with positive results on PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PC-PTSD screening; and the numeric score on the SF-12 (score of 50 defined as average physical and mental well-being).

Results

A total of 121 individuals (73 women [60.3%]; mean [SD] age, 52.5 [17.1] years) completed the survey (response rate, 29.2%). The most common long-term physical sequelae reported were cutaneous problems (102 of 121 [84.3%]), ocular problems (72 of 121 [59.5%]), and oral mucosal problems (61 of 120 [50.8%]). A total of 53.3% (64 of 120) of the respondents had results indicating depression on the PHQ-9, 43.3% (52 of 120) showed signs of anxiety on the GAD-7, and 19.5% had results indicating PTSD on the PC-PTSD. The mean (SD) SF-12 Physical Component Summary score was 42.4 (22.8), and the mean Mental Component Summary score was 46.1 (20.9). A total of 28.2% (33 of 117) of the respondents were unable to work, 68.1% (81 of 119) were fearful of taking new medications, and 30.0% (36 of 120) avoided taking prescribed medications for a diagnosed medical condition.

Conclusions and Relevance

This survey study found that long-term physical sequelae, depression, and anxiety appear to be common in patients with SJS/TEN, with implications for health and well-being. Improved awareness of these complications may assist health professionals in offering medical care, counseling, and support to patients with SJS/TEN.

### Mechanisms by which psychologic stress alters cutaneous permeability barrier homeostasis and stratum corneum integrity [^113u4Vu9]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Although many skin disorders, including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, are adversely affected by psychologic stress (PS), the pathophysiologic link between PS and disease expression remains unclear. Recent studies demonstrated PS-induced alterations in permeability barrier homeostasis, mediated by increased endogenous glucocorticoids. Here, we assessed the mechanisms by which PS alters stratum corneum (SC) function. Insomniac psychologic stress (IPS) altered both barrier homeostasis and SC integrity. IPS decreased epidermal cell proliferation, impaired epidermal differentiation, and decreased the density and size of corneodesmosomes (CD), which was linked to degradation of CD proteins (e.g., desmoglein1). Barrier compromise was linked to decreased production and secretion of lamellar bodies (LB), which in turn could be attributed to a decrease in de novo synthesis of epidermal lipids. Topical physiologic lipids (equimolar cholesterol, ceramides, and free fatty acids) normalized both barrier homeostasis and SC integrity in IPS mice, further evidence that lipid deficiency accounted for these functional abnormalities. Thus, PS inhibition of epidermal lipid synthesis results in decreased LB formation and secretion, as well as decreased CD, compromising both permeability barrier homeostasis and SC integrity. These studies suggest that topical treatment with epidermal physiologic lipids could be beneficial in stress-induced, barrier-associated dermatoses, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

### The multidimensional burden of atopic dermatitis among adults: results from a large national survey [^111jkeFv]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Questions

What is the multidimensional burden of atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults, and what is the relative importance of different aspects of disease burden?

Findings

This survey study included responses from 1065 adult respondents living with AD. Atopic dermatitis impact scores were associated with multiple factors including AD severity, time spent managing the condition, and comorbid depression.

Meaning

The disease burden of AD on adults living with the condition is multi-dimensional and associated with a variety of factors.

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^1177KgKe]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

In light of the apparent benefits of exogenous stress in the dermatosis models, it becomes more difficult to defend the prevailing hypothesis — i.e. that PS exacerbates chronic inflammatory disorders. The apparently paradoxical nature of our results likely can be explained as follows: PS clearly compromises epidermal function, including innate immune status, in otherwise normal human and rodent skin. These negative effects in normal skin appear to be offset by the anti-inflammatory benefits of exogenous stress demonstrated in inflamed skin. Indeed, superimposition of exogenous stress reduced inflammation in the ICD, ACD, and AD models, conditions whose immunophenotypes differ widely. We show here further that the benefits of exogenous stress can be attributed to elevated endogenous GC, as coadministration of mifepristone, an antagonist of the GCr, reversed the apparent benefits of stress in the ICD and AD models. Stress, similar to GC, can be anti-inflammatory by a number of related mechanisms. For example, it is well accepted that an appropriate responsiveness of the HPA axis and a subsequent release of GC may be essential to control overshooting of the immune response. Yet, as the anti-inflammatory benefits of stress also correlated with a parallel improvement in epidermal function in the AD model, improved barrier function could contribute to reduced cutaneous inflammation by several downstream mechanisms — e.g. downregulation of the cytokine cascade. These potent anti-inflammatory effects, which require hours to days, rather than minutes, of stress, outweigh the negative impact of elevated GC on cutaneous homeostasis in otherwise normal skin.

### Psychocutaneous disorders [^112Yar7c]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Dermatologic conditions are commonly associated with psychiatric sequella, eg, urticaria, alopecia, psoriasis, or acne. Moreover, the onset and course of dermatologic disorders may be significantly influenced by stress, emotional disturbances, or psychiatric disorder. Compulsions involving the skin, excoriations, or hair pulling (trichotillomania) are the more frequently encountered problems. In some cases, skin conditions are self-induced or reflect signs or symptoms of an underlying psychiatric disorder, including psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, skin lesions have been frequently described in case reports of factitious dermatitis. Finally, adverse effects of psychotropic drugs may cause dermatologic side effects, mostly idiosyncratic skin eruptions. These problems are discussed with emphasis on clinical features, comorbidity, and psychiatric management.

### Stressing the steroids in skin: paradox or fine-tuning? [^111gSjAC]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The skin has recently been found to be an extra-adrenal site for glucocorticoid (GC) synthesis that likely acts to modulate local inflammation. Psychological, physiological, and physical stress, both acute and chronic, triggers immune-protective or -damaging responses, including increases in systemic GC levels, which, according to Lin et al. (this issue), may be beneficial in inflammatory skin disease. However, little is known about the interplay between local and systemic production of GCs and the effect of stress (local or systemic) in regulating tissue-specific GC synthesis, its impact on skin homeostasis, and its effect of skin disease.

### The impact of stress on epidermal barrier function: an evidence-based review [^112qx6UL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidermal barrier functions to limit skin infection and inflammation by inhibiting irritant and immunogen invasion. Abundant evidence suggests that psychological stress stemming from crowding, isolation, nicotine smoking, insomnia, mental arithmetic tasks, physical pain, real-life stressors (examinations and marital strain) and lack of positive personality traits may impart both acute and chronic epidermal dysfunction.

Objectives

To review the relationship between stress and epidermal barrier dysfunction.

Methods

A review of the PubMed and Embase databases was conducted to identify all English-language case-control, cross-sectional and randomized control trials that have reported the effect of stress on epidermal barrier function. The authors' conclusions are based on the available evidence from 21 studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Results

Psychological stressors upregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to stimulate local and systemic stress hormone production. This ultimately leads to aberrant barrier dysfunction, characterized by decreased epidermal lipid and structural protein production, decreased stratum corneum hydration and increased transepidermal water loss.

Conclusions

This evidence-based review explores the adverse effects of psychological stressors on epidermal barrier function. Future investigations using more real-life stressors are needed to elucidate further their impact on skin physiology and identify practical stress-relieving therapies that minimize and restore epidermal barrier dysfunction, particularly in at-risk populations. What's already known about this topic? The literature reports the negative effect of stress on prolonged wound healing. Less is known about the relationship between stress and epidermal barrier dysfunction, a chronic, superficial wound involving the upper epidermal layers. What does this study add? Psychological stressors impact epidermal barrier function by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to stimulate local and systemic stress hormone production. Stress hormones negatively affect the epidermal barrier by decreasing epidermal lipids and structural proteins, decreasing stratum corneum hydration and increasing transepidermal water loss. Identification of such stressors can promote stress-avoidance and stress-reduction behaviours that protect epidermal barrier function and prevent certain dermatological conditions.

### Atopic dermatitis beyond eczema: a review on its systemic impact through pruritus and associated comorbidities [^113FXKR6]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, traditionally recognized for its defining eczematous lesions. However, the implications of atopic dermatitis extend far beyond eczema itself. Increasing understanding of the disease has enabled a more accurate characterization of its burden, including structural and functional skin alterations as well as various systemic comorbidities. This review examines the impact of the disease, beginning with the neuroimmune pathways underlying pruritus and its psychosocial burden, and progressing to the current concepts surrounding the atopic march and the broader spectrum of inflammatory or immune-mediated non-atopic comorbidities, including the emerging discussion on its similarities and differences with psoriasis. Special attention has been given to literature published from 2015 onwards. Ultimately, this review aims to deepen the understanding of the systemic nature of atopic dermatitis, providing a broader conceptual framework for assessing disease extent and severity.

### Comorbidities and the impact of atopic dermatitis [^113uW6yd]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic pruritic inflammatory skin disease with substantial patient and population burdens. A number of comorbid health problems occur in patients with AD, aside from the cutaneous signs and symptoms. This review summarizes recent developments in the burden and comorbidities of AD.

Data Sources

Literature review.

Study Selections

Nonsystematic.

Results

Different aspects of AD, such as chronic pruritus, psychosocial distress, and inflammation, can lead to anxiety, depression, or suicidality. Atopic dermatitis is associated with and may predispose to higher risk of other atopic disorders, including asthma, hay fever, food allergy, and eosinophilic esophagitis. Persons with AD appear to be at higher risk for infectious and cardiovascular risk.

Conclusion

Atopic dermatitis is associated with substantial burden and comorbidities. Identifying AD comorbidities is essential for proper disease management and improving overall patient outcomes.

### VINDICATE-P: a mnemonic for the many comorbidities of atopic dermatitis [^116ccf2F]. Dermatologic Clinics (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are at increased risk of atopic and non-atopic comorbidities. In fact, the Hanifin and Rajka criteria include allergic and infectious comorbidities as a minor criterion. Despite the well-recognized list of comorbidities, the past 15 years greatly expanded the list of recognized comorbidities of AD. This narrative review focuses on comorbidities of AD using a mnemonic, VINDICATE-P: vascular/cardiovascular, infectious, neoplastic and neurologic, degenerative, iatrogenic, congenital, atopic and autoimmune, traumatic, endocrine/metabolic, and psychiatric. The comorbidities of AD vary by age. More research is needed into the mechanisms of comorbidities and optimal screening strategies in AD patients.

### Psycho dermatology: the mind and skin connection [^11293Lty]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

A psychodermatologic disorder is a condition that involves an interaction between the mind and the skin. Psychodermatologic disorders fall into three categories: psychophysiologic disorders, primary psychiatric disorders and secondary psychiatric disorders. Psychophysiologic disorders (e.g., psoriasis and eczema) are associated with skin problems that are not directly connected to the mind but that react to emotional states, such as stress. Primary psychiatric disorders involve psychiatric conditions that result in self-induced cutaneous manifestations, such as trichotillomania and delusions of parasitosis. Secondary psychiatric disorders are associated with disfiguring skin disorders. The disfigurement results in psychologic problems, such as decreased self-esteem, depression or social phobia. Most psychodermatologic disorders can be treated with anxiety-decreasing techniques or, in extreme cases, psychotropic medications.

### Assessment of health-related quality of life in postburn adult survivors: a cross-sectional 4 years of experience study from Cyprus [^112nqKNH]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Gautam et al.stated in their cross-sectional study on HRQoL in postburn survivors that the psychological and physical domains were the most affected. Meanwhile, the environmental and social domains were the least affected. As reported by Tibebu et al.in their study, 57.5% of participants (total number 405) had a poor postburn QoL, especially those with third-degree burns, exposed burn body parts, total body surface area (%TBSA) burned ≥ 20%, amputation and comorbidities. Two studies have also found a diminished postburn QoL. Specifically, the authors concluded that postburn hospital discharge had caused significant physical and psychological impairment over time, along with emotional and social consequences.

Egyhazi et al.stated in their study on chronic pain following physical and emotional trauma in burn survivors that 27% of participants reported pain at least 28 months after the incident. Several factors related to pain were evaluated in the univariate analysis; however, only age, graft, and back depression inventory score remained significantly associated with pain in the multiple regression model. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis on prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptomatology among burn survivors, the baseline prevalence of acute stress disorder ranged from 2% to 30%. In comparison, PTSD prevalence varied from 3% at 1 month to 40% by 6 months, peaking at 45% within a year postinjury and settling between 7% and 25% after 2 years. Life threat perception emerged as the strongest predictor of PTSD, followed by acute intrusive symptoms and pain related to burn injuries.

Additionally, 2 studies conducted in the United States analyzed postburn itchiness status, medically termed pruritus, in both pediatric and adult populations, respectively. The Itch Man Scale demonstrated strong reliability in the pediatric population, with independent rater scores showing a high correlation. It also showed a significant correlation with the visual analog scale, a standard pruritus measure. Additionally, the Itch Man Scale correlated with the total score of the 5-D Itch scale, though only the degree domain individually reached a significant correlation. An additional study by Carrougher et al.examines the postburn prevalence and risk factors associated with increased pruritus intensity in adults. They found a pruritus prevalence at discharge, 6, 12, and 24 months following injury at 93%, 86%, 83%, and 73%, respectively. Risk factors associated with increased pruritus intensity include younger age, higher %TBSA-burn, higher %TBSA-grafted, and female gender.

### Increasing comorbidities suggest that atopic dermatitis Is a Systemic disorder [^113KZF2o]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis comorbidities extend well beyond the march to allergic conditions (food allergy, asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis), suggesting both cutaneous and systemic immune activation. In reviewing atopic dermatitis comorbidities, Councilors of the International Eczema Council found a strong pattern of immune activation in peripheral blood and the propensity to both skin and systemic infections. Associations with cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and malignant diseases were increasingly reported, but confirmation of their link with atopic dermatitis requires longitudinal studies. Given the possibility of atopic dermatitis-related systemic immune activation, future investigations of new interventions should concurrently examine the impact on these comorbidities.

### Management of itch in atopic dermatitis [^117AywHD]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common itchy dermatosis that affects millions of children and adults worldwide. Chronic itch in this condition has significant impact on measures of quality of life, such as sleep. Treating itch in AD has been challenging for decades, but new drugs have emerged in the last year with significant anti-pruritic effect. The optimal treatment regimen for atopic itch addresses barrier dysfunction, inflammation, neural hypersensitivity, and the itch-scratch cycle. Topical moisturizers remain the foundation of treatment and should be used by all patients with AD-associated pruritus. Step-wise therapy, from topical anti-inflammatory creams to systemic monoclonal antibodies and immunosuppressants, is recommended. There are multiple adjuvant therapies that can be used, especially to target itch in the setting of minimal skin inflammation. Finally, patient education, sleep management, and stress relief are important components to optimize outcomes. This review assesses the latest advances and treatment recommendations for pruritus in AD. Finally, suggested therapeutic ladders and emerging treatments are discussed.

### Psychiatric disorders and pruritus [^117J2aAr]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

The skin and psyche are intimately related with various skin diseases caused by or resulting in psychiatric disturbances. Pruritus is a commonly reported symptom in psychiatric patients, and likewise psychiatric co-morbidities, including anxiety and depression, are frequently seen in chronic pruritus patients. Primary psychodermatologic conditions, such as somatic symptom disorder, dermatitis artefacta, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (excoriation disorder and prurigo nodularis), delusional infestation, and substance use disorder, can all induce significant pruritus in patients, severely affecting their quality of life. Such entities can be challenging to manage, and therefore a greater understanding of the underlying psychopathology and evaluation of associated psychosocial factors is necessary. In addition to proper skin hygiene and first-line pharmacotherapies such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, noradrenergic and selective serotonin antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antipsychotics (for delusional and psychotic disorders), patients with psychopruritic disorders should be offered psychotherapy to maximize the therapeutic efficacy.

### The exposome in atopic dermatitis [^112r4H17]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

3 THE EFFECT OF SPECIFIC EXTERNAL EXPOSURES ON AD

There have been multiple efforts to characterize the effects of specific external exposures (eg diet, water hardness, pollution and allergens) on AD development and progression. Akin to the nonspecific external exposome, these factors are likely to act in concert to drive the immune responses in AD skin. The inflammatory processes in AD likely involve perpetuating cycles of genetically predetermined barrier susceptibility, external exposures that contribute to barrier disruption (eg frequency of washing and detergent use), dysregulated skin barrier immunity and consequently increased itch sensation and scratch behaviour that leads to further deterioration in epidermal permeability and susceptibility to environmental insults. 15 An exposomal approach aims to elucidate common pathways downstream of individual‐specific external exposures in order to modulate the above processes (Figure 1). It is also worth noting that psychological stress during pre‐ and postnatal life may modulate the disease course via neuroendocrine pathways and induction of a T H 2 phenotype; however, the effect of specific psychological factors (personality, anxiety, depression) on AD pathogenesis is beyond the scope of this review. 16, 17

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^115Arpss]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Questionnaires

The first part of the questionnaire recorded socio-demographic variables including self-reported socio-economic status. Ethnicity was self-assigned by each participant referring to their own country of birth. Stress was assessed with the item "Have you had any stressful life events during the last 6 months?" with a possible answer of "yes" or "no".

Symptoms of depression and anxiety, the main outcome variables, were assessed with the HADS, a well-validated instrument showing good psychometric properties, to assess severity and presence of anxiety disorders and depression in somatic, psychiatric, and primary care patients, as well as in the general population. HADS includes seven items assessing anxiety and seven for depression, each with four possible answers. For each dimension of anxiety and depression a score from 0 to 7 is considered a normal case, from 8 to 10 a borderline case, and from 11 to 21 a case in need of further examination or treatment. This instrument was used in the validated translations relevant to the study countries.

To assess suicidal ideation, we included the item "Have you ever thought of committing suicide?" with possible answers "yes" or "no": we were not able to identify a validated item on suicidal ideation. An additional question was given to the patient group: "Have you ever thought of committing suicide because of your skin?" with an item on frequency when the answer was yes.

Description of Symptoms

The primary symptom of LSC is intense, chronic itch, often described as paroxysmal as it is marked by sudden urges to scratch followed by refractory relief periods of 1–5 hours. Scratching tends to worsen at nighttime and is not only habitual but often experienced as highly pleasurable, contributing to the chronicity of the itch-scratch cycle. In a cross-sectional study examining patients with chronic pruritus, those with LSC rated their scratching pleasure among the highest across pruritic dermatoses (mean score 3.4 ± 2.3 in a linear scale ranging from − 5 (not pleasurable at all) to + 5 (extremely pleasurable)), reinforcing the notion that scratching in this condition is rewarding. However, when LSC involves the genital area, this transient relief is often overshadowed by the condition's significant physical, sexual, and psychological toll, patients commonly report embarrassment, disrupted intimacy, and diminished quality of life. Psychological stress can exacerbate symptoms, and episodes of scratching often occur during periods of emotional distress. While there has historically been stigma surrounding psychogenic contributions to pruritus, growing research in psychodermatology has since underscored the complex neuroimmune interplay in conditions such as LSC. It is important to emphasize that while stress plays a role in the pathophysiology and exacerbation of LSC, the condition itself is a disorder with an established biological basis.

Commonly Affected Areas of the Body

LSC is typically localized to one or a few sites, distinguishing it from conditions such PN or other eczematous dermatoses that present with more generalized involvement. Commonly affected regions are both easily accessible for scratching and some are highly innervated, including the nape of the neck, ankles, scalp, vulva, scrotum, and extensor forearms. Further psychophysical research has shown that scratching is particularly pleasurable on the ankles and back, areas frequently involved in LSC, suggesting a topographical link between itch intensity and reward processing.

LSC lesions may demonstrate a three-zone architecture: a central area of flat lichenification, a middle ring of lichenoid papules, and a peripheral zone of mild thickening and hyperpigmentation. Scratching during the refractory period in the context of psychological stress, may result in clear skin sores. Plaques can range in color varying in terms of skin tone, from pink to dark brown, and may evolve into hypopigmented patches with darker borders over time.

### Defining disease severity in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis for the application to biomarker research: an interdisciplinary perspective [^1161ZbQZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Comorbidity and multimorbidity

The mechanisms underpinning the associations between atopic or psoriatic skin inflammation and their respective morbidities are incompletely understood, and may be morbidity-specific. Certain conditions, e.g. AD and asthma or psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, share genetic risk factors, and therefore appear likely to be driven by shared disease biology. For example, the established effectiveness of agents targeting the interleukin (IL)-4/IL-13 pathway in both diseases supports the concept of shared biology between these traits. Other comorbidities may influence skin inflammation directly, for example obesity and cardiovascular disease have been reported to be causally related to psoriasis risk. Prevalent mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are also associated with more severe inflammatory skin disease, but these disorders may be the result of severe inflammatory skin disease rather than the cause.

When present, comorbidities contribute to the overall impact of AD or psoriasis on affected individuals. However, when investigating biomarkers of skin disease severity, it is important to consider the mechanistic differences in their link with AD and psoriasis if comorbidities are used as a proxy measure of more severe skin inflammation.

### Key role of CRF in the skin stress response system [^116TUoFY]. Endocrine Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The discovery of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or CRH defining the upper regulatory arm of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, along with the identification of the corresponding receptors (CRFRs 1 and 2), represents a milestone in our understanding of central mechanisms regulating body and local homeostasis. We focused on the CRF-led signaling systems in the skin and offer a model for regulation of peripheral homeostasis based on the interaction of CRF and the structurally related urocortins with corresponding receptors and the resulting direct or indirect phenotypic effects that include regulation of epidermal barrier function, skin immune, pigmentary, adnexal, and dermal functions necessary to maintain local and systemic homeostasis. The regulatory modes of action include the classical CRF-led cutaneous equivalent of the central HPA axis, the expression and function of CRF and related peptides, and the stimulation of pro-opiomelanocortin peptides or cytokines. The key regulatory role is assigned to the CRFR-1α receptor, with other isoforms having modulatory effects. CRF can be released from sensory nerves and immune cells in response to emotional and environmental stressors. The expression sequence of peptides includes urocortin/CRF→pro-opiomelanocortin→ACTH, MSH, and β-endorphin. Expression of these peptides and of CRFR-1α is environmentally regulated, and their dysfunction can lead to skin and systemic diseases. Environmentally stressed skin can activate both the central and local HPA axis through either sensory nerves or humoral factors to turn on homeostatic responses counteracting cutaneous and systemic environmental damage. CRF and CRFR-1 may constitute novel targets through the use of specific agonists or antagonists, especially for therapy of skin diseases that worsen with stress, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

### Immune-mediated and psychiatric comorbidities among patients newly diagnosed with alopecia areata [^111tgXgg]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder characterized by sudden, inflammatory, nonscarring hair loss that can be limited or extensive, involving the entire scalp and body hair. Both geneticand environmental factorsplay a role in AA, with reports suggesting that an upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon-γ and interleukin 15) that signal through Janus kinases and other pathways may be involved. These inflammatory pathways, however, are not unique to AA but are known to play roles in several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Alopecia areata itself has been associated with many other systemic disorders, including atopic dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies have shown that patients with AA have increased rates of psychiatric conditions, including depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. A meta-analysis conducted by Toussi et alfound higher incidences of mental health disorders, including anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and depression, in patients with AA.

Altogether, the potential comorbidity burden of patients with AA may contribute to a reduced health-related quality of life, yet most studies that have assessed comorbidities associated with AA are limited. Although some studies examine a correlation between AA and psychiatric or autoimmune disorders, none have assessed the risks of developing psychiatric and autoimmune comorbidities in patients with newly diagnosed AA. Thus, there remains a lack of evidence of the comorbidity burden among those with AA in the US, particularly that of new-onset comorbidities after AA diagnosis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of autoimmune and psychiatric comorbidities at the time of AA diagnosis, as well as the incidence and risk of developing new-onset autoimmune and psychiatric comorbidities after AA diagnosis in patients in the US.

### Neuroimmunology of stress: skin takes center stage [^116hGzgG]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Like few other organs, the skin is continuously exposed to multiple exogenous and endogenous stressors. Superimposed on this is the impact of psychological stress on skin physiology and pathology. Here, we review the "brain-skin connection", which may underlie inflammatory skin diseases triggered or aggravated by stress, and we summarize relevant general principles of skin neuroimmunology and neuroendocrinology. Specifically, we portray the skin and its appendages as both a prominent target of key stress mediators (such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, ACTH, cortisol, catecholamines, prolactin, substance P, and nerve growth factor) and a potent source of these prototypic, immunomodulatory mediators of the stress responses. We delineate current views on the role of mast cell-dependent neurogenic skin inflammation and discuss the available evidence that the skin has established a fully functional peripheral equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as an independent, local stress response system. To cope with stress-induced oxidative damage, the skin and hair follicles also express melatonin, probably the most potent neuroendocrine antioxidant. Lastly, we outline major, as-yet unmet challenges in cutaneous stress research, particularly in the study of the cross-talk between peripheral and systemic responses to psychological stress and in the identification of promising molecular targets for therapeutic stress intervention.

### Major comorbidities of atopic dermatitis: beyond allergic disorders [^117EHBKv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The consequences of atopic dermatitis reach beyond the skin and past childhood. Patients with atopic dermatitis are at risk of developing allergic comorbidities, but less is known about the associations between atopic dermatitis and non-allergic conditions. Understanding these non-allergic comorbidities has the potential to improve patient outcomes and to help mitigate the cost and burdens associated with these conditions. Atopic dermatitis is associated with cutaneous bacterial infections, more severe forms/courses of cutaneous viral infections, and extra-cutaneous infections. Atopic dermatitis is also associated with several mental health comorbidities particularly attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. Data are largely inconsistent for specific cancers, but atopic dermatitis appears to protect against malignancy overall; severe long-term atopic dermatitis is associated with adult lymphomas. Atopic dermatitis may also be associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and autoimmune disease, particularly alopecia areata and gastrointestinal immune-mediated disorders. Although the causative mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood, treating physicians should be aware of associations in seeking to alleviate the burden for patients with atopic dermatitis.

### Paradoxical benefits of psychological stress in inflammatory dermatoses models are glucocorticoid mediated [^113vTpmA]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Acute allergic contact dermatitis model

We next evaluated the impact of exogenous stress in an ACD mouse model in which either the hapten, Ox, or vehicle alone was applied once to opposing ears of previously sensitized mice, under either stressed or nonstressed conditions. Exogenous stress again markedly reduced visible erythema and scale in Ox-challenged ears (Figure 1c), changes that were paralleled by significant reductions in ear thickness (Figure 1d) and inflammatory cell infiltrations (Figures 1e and 2g), as well as histologic evidence of a marked reduction in dermal inflammation (Figure 2a–c and Supplementary Figure 3C and D online). The stress-induced reductions in epidermal hyperplasia were mirrored by a normalization of epidermal hyperplasia and epidermal thickness, further quantified as a decreased density of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive basal cells (Figure 2d–g). Together, these results show that the imposition of exogenous stress displays potent anti-inflammatory activity in a mouse model of ACD.

Atopic dermatitis model

We next assessed the impact of exogenous stress in a repeatedly hapten-challenged, chronic contact dermatitis model that exhibits multiple features of human AD, including the following: (i) elevated serum IgE levels; (ii) epidermal hyperplasia; (iii) an inflammatory infiltrate enriched in eosinophils and mast cells; and (iv) a prominent permeability barrier abnormality. Superimposed stress markedly reduced epidermal hyperplasia and dermal inflammation in these AD mice (Figure 3a vs. b), and quantitative studies confirmed the stress-induced decrease in epidermal hyperplasia (Figure 3d). Finally, concurrent stress significantly reduced serum IgE levels in the AD model (Supplementary Figure 4 online). Thus, exogenous stress exerts potent anti-inflammatory activity in a repeatedly hapten-challenged mouse model, with features of AD.

Stress improves epidermal function in AD mice

Not only does permeability barrier dysfunction "drive" inflammation, but chronic inflammation in AD further alters epidermal barrier function in AD (see). Hence, we next assessed whether exogenous stress improves epidermal function in parallel with reduced inflammation in the AD model. Although both barrier function and SC hydration deteriorated in AD mice not subjected to exogenous stress, both of these functions normalized after the imposition of concurrent stress (Figure 4a and Table 1). Thus, despite the known propensity for stress to compromise multiple epidermal functions in normal skin, simultaneous exposure to exogenous stress improves two key epidermal functions in an inflammatory dermatosis model with features of AD.

Urticaria — associations with atopic dermatitis (AD) include acute and chronic forms, with epidemiologic signals of strong linkage: AD is associated with food allergy, which commonly manifests as acute urticaria; AD is also associated with chronic idiopathic urticaria, with a Danish study showing an association between chronic urticaria and AD (OR, 9.92; 95%CI, 6.43–15.32) and a Danish cohort finding chronic urticaria predicted subsequent AD (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; 95% CI, 2.0–4.8); the text notes this association may worsen dermatitis via the itch-scratch cycle.

### Extent and consequences of inadequate disease control among adults with a history of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis [^1144P54c]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study provides an initial effort at defining and characterizing patients with inadequately controlled moderate to severe AD, which was observed in more than half of the patients. Although the physician ratings of inadequate control, which relied on three criteria, has not been validated neither was it based on clinical measures, these criteria likely reflect real‐world clinical practice, especially because physicians report low awareness and use of clinical or patient‐reported measures for the assessment of AD and its severity. 27 However, robustness of these criteria was supported by the observation that the proportion of patients with inadequate control for each criterion increased with AD severity regardless of whether severity was rated by the physicians or the patients themselves; inadequate control was also observed in a substantial proportion of patients currently rated as mild.

Current flares were the most common reason for inadequate control, which may not be surprising, because flares could potentially have been the driver of the physician consultation. Of greater clinical relevance, inadequate control occurred regardless of treatment, with more than half of the patients treated with each medication class, including systemic agents, rated by the physicians as being inadequately controlled. It is possible that the high rate of inadequate control among patients on systemic corticosteroids might have resulted from use of these drugs in response to current flares. While the lack of control may be interpreted as current therapies being less than optimal, there appeared to be low dissatisfaction with treatment by both physicians (23.7%) and patients (24.6%). These results suggest there may be disparity between disease control and perceptions of disease management, and also reflect a need for greater understanding of what may be expected during treatment.

Inadequate control was associated with higher burdens relative to adequately controlled patients, including significantly greater work impairment and lower disease‐specific QoL. Inadequately controlled patients also had a higher prevalence of depression and stress, with a trend toward higher anxiety. These mental health outcomes are important because they not only contribute to QoL, 28, 29 but have additional implications, because suicidal ideation has been reported in AD patients. 29, 30, 31

Physician‐reported itch interference and sleep disturbance were independent factors associated with inadequate control, and the OR of more than 2 indicated that inadequate control was twice as likely among patients with these outcomes compared with those without. These results support the interrelationship of these outcomes. 8, 12, 32 In particular, sleep disturbance is frequently reported by patients with AD and its importance to patients is increasingly recognized, 9, 33 as it correlates with QoL. 8, 32

### Stress and skin disease quality of life: the moderating role of anxiety sensitivity social concerns [^114gHunX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Stress is an important factor in the onset, exacerbation and reoccurrence of many skin diseases. Little is known about psychological risk factors that affect the association between stress and dermatological conditions. One relevant factor that may modulate this link is anxiety sensitivity (AS) social concerns - the propensity to respond fearfully to anxiety-related sensations (e.g. sweating, flushing) owing to perceived social consequences (e.g. rejection or humiliation).

Objectives

To gain insight into psychological factors affecting skin disease, we examined the moderating role of AS social concerns in the relationship between stress and skin disease quality of life (QoL).

Methods

Participants [n = 237 (161 female), mean ± SD age 34·18 ± 9·57 years] with active skin disease symptoms were recruited online and completed questionnaires assessing stress, AS social concerns, skin disease QoL and global skin disease symptom severity.

Results

AS social concerns moderated the association between stress and skin-related emotional and social functioning in adults with skin disease. Stress was a significant predictor of the impairment associated with skin disease.

Conclusions

Stress was linked to skin disease-related emotional and functional impairment associated with skin disease among individuals with high AS social concerns. These results highlight the potential for AS reduction interventions to break the vicious cycle of stress and skin disease symptoms and to improve psychosocial well-being in dermatology patients.

### Symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression in atopic dermatitis in U.S. adults [^117DfWn7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by itch, skin pain, sleep disturbances and multiple comorbidities, all of which can lead to significant psychosocial distress and mental health burden. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 However, previous studies found conflicting results regarding whether AD is associated with increased mental health disorders, e.g. depression or anxiety. 7, 8, 9 We hypothesized that AD is associated with higher likelihood of anxiety and/or depression.

In addition, there are a number of outstanding questions about the relationship between AD, anxiety and depression. Firstly, the prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression in the U.S. adult population with AD are not well established. Secondly, the relationship of different aspects of AD severity with anxiety and depression requires elucidation. We hypothesized that symptoms of anxiety and depression are very common in AD, especially in moderate‐to‐severe AD. Finally, anxiety and depression may go undiagnosed in all age groups. 10, 11 We hypothesized that a large proportion of adults with AD have undiagnosed anxiety and/or depression. In the present study, we sought to determine the relationship of AD and its severity with symptoms and diagnosis of anxiety and depression in U.S. adults.

### Association of trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and non-affective psychosis across the life course: a nationwide prospective cohort study [^1118KrKU]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Trauma, PTSD and NAPD

Whilst we replicate findings from a Danish study showing that traumatic stress disorders are associated with increased risk of subsequent NAPD (Okkels et al.), we extend this by showing a stronger effect for PTSD than ASR and by examining the extent to which PTSD mediates the association between trauma and psychosis risk. Despite strong associations between interpersonal trauma and both PTSD and NAPD, and between PTSD and subsequent NAPD, we found little support for the hypothesis that PTSD mediates the relationship between trauma and psychosis. However, people with PTSD do not always present to secondary care (Lewis et al.) and where they do they are likely to receive treatment for their PTSD symptoms; therefore our results may under-estimate the mediation effect of PTSD symptoms.

This study provides novel information that can help inform our understanding of how TE can lead to the development of psychosis. The absence of evidence for PTSD mediation in our study suggests that the conceptualisation of trauma leading to PTSD symptoms which, over time, develop into psychosis might need reframing, although are findings are not necessarily inconsistent with the hypothesis that traumatic pathology has a causal role in the development of psychosis. The potentially causal relationship between trauma and psychotic disorders are likely to be complex and a measure of PTSD diagnosis may not be the best proxy for the multiple pathways and psychological mechanisms underpinning this association. Examination of potentially specific trauma-symptom associations (Hardy,) or of specific types of TE such as sexual abuse which we have not measured in this study, might provide a more sophisticated understanding of this relationship.

An alternative hypothesis suggests there is a spectrum of multifaceted, dimensional psychopathological responses to trauma, ranging in severity and need for care, and it is the balance between the timing, severity, and repetitiveness of trauma exposure within the context of an individual' specific liability (genetic, psychological and social) which leads to differential psychopathological expressions of response to trauma (Morrison, Frame, & Larkin). That is, while ASR, PTSD, and NAPD diagnostic categories are clinically useful, they may well be artificial constructs lying along trauma-related phenomenological continua rather than representing discrete/separate psychopathological processes.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^111BM7QW]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Table 4 gives data on anxiety in patients with common skin diseases. Overall, anxiety affected 17.2% of the patients compared with 11.1% of the controls (P < 0.001, adjusted OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.68–2.82). The highest adjusted OR for anxiety disorders were found among patients with psoriasis (OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.01–4.21), leg ulcers (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.18–6.64), hand eczema (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.45–4.67), and acne (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.40–4.58).

Suicidal ideation in common skin conditions is described in Table 5. Overall 12.7% of the dermatological patients reported suicidal ideation compared with 8.3% of the controls (P < 0.001, adjusted OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95–1.62). Only patients with psoriasis had a significant association with suicidal thoughts (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.33–2.82). Of the patients reporting overall suicidal ideation, 53.6% reported that the suicidal thoughts were because of their skin condition: specifically 67.6% of patients with psoriasis and 68.0% of patients with atopic dermatitis reported suicidal ideation because of their skin.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^114xwjVD]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The contribution of psychological disorders to the burden of skin disease has been poorly explored, and this is a large-scale study to ascertain the association between depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation with various dermatological diagnoses. This international multicenter observational cross-sectional study was conducted in 13 European countries. In each dermatology clinic, 250 consecutive adult out-patients were recruited to complete a questionnaire, reporting socio-demographic information, negative life events, and suicidal ideation; depression and anxiety were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A clinical examination was performed. A control group was recruited among hospital employees. There were 4,994 participants––3,635 patients and 1,359 controls. Clinical depression was present in 10.1% patients (controls 4.3%, odds ratio (OR) 2.40 (1.67–3.47)). Clinical anxiety was present in 17.2% (controls 11.1%, OR 2.18 (1.68–2.82)). Suicidal ideation was reported by 12.7% of all patients (controls 8.3%, OR 1.94 (1.33–2.82)). For individual diagnoses, only patients with psoriasis had significant association with suicidal ideation. The association with depression and anxiety was highest for patients with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, hand eczema, and leg ulcers. These results identify a major additional burden of skin disease and have important clinical implications.

### The shared and specific relationships between exposure to potentially traumatic events and transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology [^115hCJEC]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The experience of traumatic events has been linked to the development of psychopathology. Changing perspectives on psychopathology have resulted in the hypothesis that broad dimensional constructs account for the majority of variance across putatively distinct disorders. As such, traumatic events may be associated with several disorders due to their relationship with these broad dimensions rather than any direct disorder-specific relationship. The current study used data from 8871 Australians to test this hypothesis. Two broad dimensions accounted for the majority of relationships between traumatic events and mental and substance use disorders. Direct relationships remained between post-traumatic stress disorder and six categories of traumatic events in the total population and between drug dependence and accidents/disasters for males only. These results have strong implications for how psychopathology is conceptualized and offer some evidence that traumatic events are associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing psychopathology in general.

### The psychological burden of skin diseases: a cross-sectional multicenter study among dermatological out-patients in 13 European countries [^113jvry2]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

In total, 5,067 individuals agreed to take part––3,651 patients and 1,416 controls. The participation rate was 79.9%. Of the initial 3,651 patients, 16 were excluded, 9 because they were too young and 6 because of missing data, leaving 3,635. Of the initial 1,416 controls, 57 were excluded because they had a skin disease, leaving 1,359 (see flow chart).

The subject characteristics are given in Table 1: there were more females in both the patient and control populations. The mean patient age was 47 years versus 41 years for the controls, P < 0.001. Overall 92% participants originated from the country where the study took place (data not shown). The socio-economic level distribution was similar in the two groups. Overall 35.6% of the patients reported stress compared with 30.6% of the controls, P < 0.001. Overall patients had more physical co-morbidities compared with the controls, 28.8% versus 16.0%, P < 0.001.

### Psychodermatology: the mind and skin connection… [^117ALtVE]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Emotional stress may exacerbate many chronic dermatoses and can initiate a vicious cycle referred to as the "itch-scratch cycle"; therefore, treatment of recalcitrant patients with chronic dermatoses may be difficult without addressing stress as an exacerbating factor. 5 Patients often are embarrassed about discussing psychologic issues, especially if they feel hurried. Stress management classes, relaxation techniques, music or exercise may benefit these patients. If a specific psychosocial or occupational issue exists, therapy or counseling can help. The most common form of monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis encountered among patients with skin problems is called delusions of parasitosis. Pimozide therapy is generally started at the lowest possible dosage of one half of a 2-mg tablet daily and increased by 1 mg per week. 11 By the time the usual daily dosage of 4 to 6 mg is reached, most patients have experienced a decrease in crawling and biting sensations, as well as in the sensations of "organisms" moving in their skin. Optimal therapeutic effect may not occur for 6 to 8 weeks. During the treatment course, patients become less agitated. In younger patients, pimozide can be continued at the lowest effective dosage for several months and gradually tapered off without necessarily inviting the recurrence of symptoms. If the condition recurs, another course of therapy with pimozide can be instituted. If the patient has underlying depression that results in neurotic excoriations, one anti-depressant frequently used by dermatologists is doxepin. Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant with one of the most powerful anti-itch and antihistaminic effects, as well as sedative/tranquilizing effects. Because many people with depression who excoriate their skin are agitated, the sedative and tranquilizing effects of doxepin frequently prove to be therapeutic. 14 Moreover, the profound antipruritic effect of this drug is an added benefit. Although these patients create their own skin lesions as they continue to pick at their skin, not allowing it to heal, the "itch-scratch cycle" may create intensely itchy patches that can benefit from the antipruritic effect of doxepin.

### Brexpiprazole and sertraline for posttraumatic stress disorder… [^115hNQUr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Brexpiprazole + sertraline demonstrated statistically significant greater improvement vs sertraline + placebo on the LS mean change in CGI-S score from randomization to week 10: treatment difference: −0.47. Brexpiprazole + sertraline also demonstrated statistically significant greater improvement vs sertraline + placebo on the LS mean change in B-IPF total score from baseline to week 12: treatment difference: −12.0. Brexpiprazole + sertraline showed greater improvement vs sertraline + placebo on all other efficacy end points at week 10: PCL-5 total, HADS Anxiety, HADS Depression, and CAPS-5 symptom cluster scores, and CAPS-5 response rate. After randomization, 123 of 205 participants in the brexpiprazole + sertraline group and 114 of 196 participants in the sertraline + placebo group reported 1 or more TEAEs. In adults with PTSD, treatment with brexpiprazole + sertraline resulted in statistically significant greater improvement of PTSD symptoms vs treatment with sertraline + placebo at week 10, as measured by change in CAPS-5 total score, supported by all key secondary and other efficacy end points, both clinician-reported and patient-reported. Greater improvement in PTSD symptoms for brexpiprazole + sertraline vs sertraline + placebo was observed from week 6 and maintained to the end of the trial. Importantly, brexpiprazole + sertraline treatment showed improvement across the 4 CAPS-5 PTSD symptom clusters, as well as HADS depressive and anxious symptoms, which have not been consistently demonstrated for currently approved treatments.

9 Finally, brexpiprazole + sertraline treatment was associated with improvements in B-IPF psychosocial functioning.
