## Question

hyperbilirubin in newborns

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about neonatal hyperbilirubinemia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and pathophysiology to frame baseline risk. Then, I should verify the distinction between physiologic and pathologic jaundice and the red flags that mandate urgent action. Next, I will review risk stratification and screening strategies, including universal predischarge testing and follow-up planning. After that, I need to confirm diagnostic workflows, including when to use TSB versus TcB and how to evaluate hemolysis. Then, I will examine treatment thresholds and escalation pathways, including phototherapy, IVIG, and exchange transfusion. Finally, I should consider special populations, systems issues, and quality metrics, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and pathophysiology so I don't under- or overestimate risk. More than 80% of newborns develop some jaundice, reflecting immature hepatic conjugation and increased bilirubin production from fetal erythrocyte turnover; most cases are physiologic and self-limited, but a minority progress to severe hyperbilirubinemia with potential neurotoxicity, particularly in the presence of hemolysis, prematurity, or G6PD deficiency [^113gsmyE] [^114FLtHg]. Hold on, I should verify the neurotoxicity risk framing: bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus are rare in high-income settings but remain preventable tragedies when systems fail, underscoring the need for structured screening and timely intervention [^111ruW53] [^114o1GV4].

> I need to distinguish physiologic from pathologic jaundice carefully. Physiologic jaundice typically appears after 24 hours, rises gradually, peaks around days 3–5 in term infants, and resolves within 1–2 weeks; pathologic jaundice presents within 24 hours, rises rapidly, exceeds age-specific thresholds, or persists beyond 2 weeks in formula-fed infants or 3–4 weeks in breastfed infants, prompting evaluation for cholestasis or other pathology [^112wbpQY] [^1135ixgv]. Wait, let me verify the early-jaundice rule: jaundice in the first 24 hours is more likely hemolytic and warrants immediate TSB/TcB and hemolysis workup, which aligns with AAP guidance [^115ebwvN] [^115NLkzy].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and screening. The AAP recommends universal predischarge bilirubin screening between 24 and 48 hours or before discharge if earlier, using TSB or TcB, and plotting results on hour-specific nomograms to guide follow-up intensity. Infants with risk factors require closer surveillance and earlier follow-up [^11145n2r] [^113cBcwh]. Hold on, I should double-check the follow-up logic: the difference between the predischarge bilirubin and the phototherapy threshold helps determine timing of outpatient checks, and if reliable follow-up cannot be arranged, discharge should be delayed to mitigate risk [^1149kqgg] [^114XFTpB].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workflow. Visual assessment alone is insufficient. TSB is the definitive test for treatment decisions, whereas TcB is a convenient screening tool but should be confirmed with TSB if it is within 3 mg/dL of the phototherapy threshold or ≥ 15 mg/dL. Early jaundice (< 24 hours) mandates prompt TSB/TcB and hemolysis evaluation [^114K38Di] [^112hX1yJ]. Wait, let me verify the hemolysis piece: a rapid rise in TSB (> 0.3 mg/dL/h in the first 24 hours or > 0.2 mg/dL/h thereafter) suggests hemolysis, and if maternal antibody screen is positive or unknown, DAT and infant blood type should be obtained urgently [^114U751a] [^112LXTnw].

> Now, I should confirm treatment thresholds and escalation. Phototherapy is initiated based on gestational age, age in hours, and neurotoxicity risk factors using the 2022 AAP nomograms, which raised thresholds modestly from 2004. Escalation-of-care should begin when TSB is within 2 mg/dL of the exchange threshold, and exchange transfusion is indicated at or above the exchange threshold unless intensive phototherapy lowers TSB below threshold and there are no signs of intermediate/advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy [^111n6SzD] [^113cPtHG]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence during escalation: TSB should be checked at least every 2 hours until safely below the escalation threshold, and IVIG may be considered in isoimmune hemolysis though evidence for preventing exchange is mixed and NEC risk must be weighed [^1122fqZJ] [^114cxCKw].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. Preterm infants < 35 weeks generally have lower treatment thresholds due to increased susceptibility to bilirubin neurotoxicity, and management is often consensus-based given limited high-quality evidence. G6PD deficiency confers unpredictable surges in bilirubin and warrants a lower threshold for intervention and heightened vigilance. In LMICs, the burden of extreme hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus remains high due to delays in recognition, access to phototherapy, and exchange transfusion capacity, necessitating adapted, context-specific protocols and public health strategies [^113ucFkm] [^116ck3QN] [^114bgsCC]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should also note that cholestatic jaundice requires a different pathway: persistent jaundice beyond 2 weeks in formula-fed or 3–4 weeks in breastfed infants should prompt measurement of total and direct bilirubin with urgent evaluation for biliary atresia and other causes of neonatal cholestasis [^1135ixgv] [^112Vxztf].

> I need to ensure systems and quality metrics are addressed. Universal predischarge bilirubin screening coupled with structured follow-up reduces hazardous hyperbilirubinemia; root-cause analyses show most kernicterus cases in high-resource settings are preventable and linked to failures in screening, measurement, or treatment; breastfeeding support and avoidance of unnecessary water or dextrose-water supplementation reduce jaundice severity and readmissions; and emerging precision approaches may refine risk prediction but are not yet standard of care [^111y5X1n] [^111ruW53] [^113Yc2VW] [^113vhQzq]. Hold on, I should verify the supplementation point: AAP explicitly recommends against routine water or dextrose-water supplementation to prevent hyperbilirubinemia due to lack of benefit and potential harms, including interference with breastfeeding [^116kypNB] [^1138EPo7].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach while keeping the key guardrails. First, screen all newborns visually at least every 12 hours and obtain predischarge TSB/TcB between 24–48 hours or before discharge. Second, stratify risk using hour-specific nomograms and neurotoxicity risk factors to plan follow-up. Third, if jaundice appears in the first 24 hours or TSB rises rapidly, evaluate urgently for hemolysis with DAT, blood type, CBC, and reticulocytes. Fourth, initiate phototherapy per AAP thresholds and escalate care when approaching exchange thresholds. Fifth, arrange timely follow-up using the predischarge-to-threshold gap, and delay discharge if follow-up is uncertain. Sixth, evaluate any prolonged jaundice for cholestasis with fractionated bilirubin and appropriate referrals [^11145n2r] [^114U751a] [^111n6SzD] [^114XFTpB] [^1135ixgv]. I should double-check that this aligns with the 2022 AAP framework, which it does, including the emphasis on TSB as definitive and the structured follow-up algorithm [^113gsmyE].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line so we don't lose the forest for the trees. Most neonatal jaundice is physiologic and benign, but a small, preventable fraction progresses to severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus; adherence to universal predischarge screening, risk-based follow-up, accurate bilirubin measurement, and timely phototherapy or exchange transfusion when indicated are the pillars of prevention, and real-world data show that improving adherence to these steps markedly reduces hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and its neurologic sequelae [^113gsmyE] [^111ruW53] [^111y5X1n].

---

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborns is common and usually benign, but **early jaundice (< 24 h), rapid bilirubin rise (> 0.2 mg/dL/h), or high levels (> 95th percentile)** indicate pathologic causes and require urgent evaluation [^115ebwvN] [^114U751a]. Phototherapy is **first-line** and is guided by hour-specific nomograms and risk factors; exchange transfusion is reserved for severe cases or when bilirubin approaches neurotoxic levels [^111n6SzD] [^11187kdq]. Early recognition, risk assessment, and close follow-up are essential to prevent acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus [^113gsmyE].

---

## Physiological basis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia reflects an **imbalance between bilirubin production and elimination** [^116XW4Zq]. Increased production results from a higher fetal red cell mass and shorter red cell lifespan, while immature hepatic conjugation and excretion limit elimination. The resulting unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood–brain barrier and cause neurotoxicity if levels are high or prolonged [^113gsmyE].

---

## Classification of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is classified as **physiologic or pathologic** based on timing, rate of rise, and peak bilirubin:

| **Feature** | **Physiologic jaundice** | **Pathologic jaundice** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset | After 24 hours of life | Within 24 hours of life |
| Peak bilirubin | - < 12 mg/dL in term infants <br/> - < 15 mg/dL in preterm infants | - > 12 mg/dL in term infants <br/> - > 15 mg/dL in preterm infants |
| Rate of rise | - < 5 mg/dL/day | - > 5 mg/dL/day |
| Duration | Resolves by 7–10 days | Persists beyond 14 days |

---

## Risk factors for significant hyperbilirubinemia

Several factors increase the risk of **significant hyperbilirubinemia**:

- **Hemolytic disease**: ABO or Rh incompatibility, G6PD deficiency [^113uzebH] [^116ck3QN].
- **Prematurity**: Lower gestational age increases risk [^114U751a].
- **Breastfeeding**: Exclusive breastfeeding with suboptimal intake [^114U751a].
- **Family history**: Parent or sibling requiring phototherapy or exchange transfusion [^114U751a].
- **Clinical factors**: Jaundice in first 24 hours, rapid bilirubin rise, scalp hematoma, bruising [^114U751a].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic methods

Clinical evaluation includes visual assessment for jaundice and signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) — lethargy, poor feeding, high-pitched cry, hypotonia, and seizures [^1169zB4q]. Diagnostic methods include **transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB)** for screening and **total serum bilirubin (TSB)** as the definitive test for treatment decisions [^114K38Di] [^112bAK1d]. Additional tests may include a direct antiglobulin test (DAT), complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, and liver function tests if indicated [^112LXTnw].

---

## Management strategies

### Phototherapy

Phototherapy is the **first-line treatment** for significant hyperbilirubinemia, using blue-light wavelengths to convert bilirubin into water-soluble isomers for excretion [^111n6SzD]. Indications are based on hour-specific nomograms, gestational age, and risk factors [^111n6SzD]. Monitoring includes TSB measurement within 12 hours of starting phototherapy, with frequency based on age, risk factors, and bilirubin trajectory [^113zgN4H].

---

### Exchange transfusion

Exchange transfusion is indicated for severe hyperbilirubinemia, typically when bilirubin reaches or exceeds exchange thresholds, or if ABE is present. The procedure rapidly reduces bilirubin and corrects anemia but carries risks, including infection, electrolyte disturbances, and thrombocytopenia [^11187kdq].

---

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes ensuring **adequate hydration**, promoting frequent breastfeeding, and monitoring for complications. Breastfeeding should be initiated within the first hour and occur at least 8 times per 24 hours; routine supplementation with water or dextrose water is not recommended [^113Yc2VW] [^116kypNB].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or inadequately managed hyperbilirubinemia can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE)**: Acute brain injury with lethargy, poor feeding, seizures [^notfound].
- **Kernicterus**: Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy with choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, and intellectual impairment [^113gsmyE].
- **Neurodevelopmental impairment**: Long-term cognitive and motor deficits [^notfound].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **early identification and intervention**. Universal predischarge bilirubin screening, structured follow-up, and breastfeeding support reduce severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus [^111y5X1n] [^11145n2r]. Public health initiatives, including education and access to phototherapy, are essential, especially in low-resource settings [^115xcXFD].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis is **excellent with timely recognition and appropriate management**. Most infants recover fully without long-term sequelae. However, delays in treatment or underlying pathological conditions can result in significant morbidity and mortality [^11161rW4].

---

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborns is common and usually benign, but **early recognition, risk assessment, and appropriate management are critical** to prevent serious complications. Phototherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment, with exchange transfusion reserved for severe cases. Prevention through screening, breastfeeding support, and public health initiatives is essential to reduce the burden of disease [^111fV8bH].

### Hyperbilirubinemia: current guidelines and emerging therapies [^113VAzXX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

It is estimated that about two thirds of newborns will appear clinically jaundiced during their first weeks of life. As newborns and their mothers spend fewer days in the hospital after birth, the number of infants readmitted yearly in the United States for neonatal jaundice over the last 10 years has increased by 160%. A portion of these infants present to the emergency department, requiring a careful history and physical examination assessing them for the risk factors associated with pathologic bilirubin levels. Although the spectrum of illness may be great, the overwhelming etiology of neonatal jaundice presenting to an emergency department is physiologic and not due to infection or isoimmunization. Therefore, a little more than a good history, physical examination, and indirect/direct bilirubin levels are needed to evaluate an otherwise well-appearing jaundiced newborn. The American Academy of Pediatrics' 2004 clinical practice guidelines for "Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn Infant 35 or More Weeks of Gestation" are a helpful and easily accessible resource when evaluating jaundiced newborns (available at http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;114/1/297). There are several exciting developments on the horizon for the diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia including increasing use of transcutaneous bilirubin measuring devices and medications such as tin mesoporphyrin and intravenous immunoglobulin that may decrease the need for exchange transfusions.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^11145n2r]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia management — KAS 5 states: "The TcB or TSB should be measured between 24 and 48 hours after birth or prior to discharge if that occurs earlier" (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation). Benefits include that routine TcB or TSB screening can identify significant but undetected hyperbilirubinemia and can be used to plan for postdischarge follow-up and subsequent measures. Harms include that TSB measurements can cause discomfort and may trigger additional testing. Evidence from large health care systems suggests a decrease in infants reaching a TSB ≥ 25 mg/dL with a number needed to screen in the range of 1000 to 6000, and the number needed to screen to prevent one infant from reaching a TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL is approximately 15 000; there are no randomized trials of bilirubin screening. Parents may prefer strategies to minimize heel pricks or venipunctures and therefore prefer TcB compared with TSB.

Conclusions

In sharp contrast to the practice in most high-income nations, national guidelines for the effective management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia are rare in LMICs where the disease burden is greatest. In this paper, the authors have attempted to identify a number of key considerations for the effective management of hyperbilirubinaemia in LMICs that can be considered truly resource-poor, based on their HDI status. Most of the recommendations have been adapted from existing evidence or consensus-based guidelines in the industrialised world after extensive consultations at different stages with experts from various countries. Efforts were made to ensure that the proposed framework is consistent with universally accepted requirements for quality in healthcare. It is hoped that these recommendations will assist in the development of context-specific national guidelines and mobilisation of requisite resources for the care of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery in LMICs.

### Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus: are these still problems in the third millennium? [^111RfWAS]. Neonatology (2011). Low credibility.

Despite efforts to eliminate permanent and irreversible brain damage due to bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus, these conditions continue to accompany us into the third millennium. This phenomenon occurs not only in developing countries with emerging medical systems, but in Westernized countries as well. Comprehensive guidelines to detect newborns with jaundice and treat those in whom hyperbilirubinemia has already developed have been formulated in several countries, but have not been successful in completely eliminating the problem. In this appraisal of the situation we review selected aspects of bilirubin encephalopathy and/or kernicterus. We highlight recent reports of severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus, discuss some of the factors responsible for the continuing appearance of these conditions, and briefly review what can be done to decrease bilirubin-related morbidity and mortality to the minimum.

### An emergency medicine approach to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^114FnTZA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Jaundice (also known as hyperbilirubinemia) is a yellowish-greenish pigmentation of the sclera and skin caused by an increase in bilirubin production or a defect in bilirubin elimination. Management of hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common reasons for readmission of a newborn. Prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can result in acute bilirubin encephalopathy and eventually develop into chronic bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus). Kernicterus, the feared complication of hyperbilirubinemia, was considered almost extinct but has recently re-emerged despite virtual elimination of Rh disease. This review provides a systematic approach to the presentation, evaluation, and management of the jaundiced newborn.

Proceed with monitoring once the total serum bilirubin is lower than the escalation-of-care threshold.

### Is it time for a precision health approach to the management of newborn hyperbilirubinemia? [^113vhQzq]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Newborn hyperbilirubinemia during the first two weeks of life is one of most common problems requiring management decisions by a pediatrician. However, high bilirubin levels in the circulation have been associated with neurologic injury under a variety of conditions encountered in the newborn infant, such as hemolysis. The risk for developing dangerous hyperbilirubinemia is multifactorial and is determined by a complex set of factors related to a newborn infant's genetic capacities as well as intra- and extrauterine exposures. To this end, a precision health approach based on the integration of prenatal genetic and postnatal diagnostic measures might improve the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

### Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^116XW4Zq]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia (IHB) is caused by an imbalance in bilirubin production and elimination. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants develop jaundice in the first week of age. This review seeks to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the physiology of bilirubin, etiology of IHB, and management of severe IHB. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment for severe IHB. Noninvasive screening tools, innovative treatments, and a better understanding of how prematurity and genetics contribute to severe IHB have improved our understanding of IHB and may help eliminate the hazards associated with severe IHB, including kernicterus spectrum disorder.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^111ctzqU]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are numerous. Because of the consequences of untimely correction of EHBA as well as the potential consequences of untreated galactosemia, hypothyroidism and other etiologies associated with this problem, clinical evaluation needs to be prompt, focused, and complete. While specific symptoms may narrow the diagnostic possibilities, a complete history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging and laboratory investigations directed at the more common etiologies is required to make a prompt, definitive diagnosis. This systematic review provides evidence to direct the investigation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113gsmyE]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline — management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation — updates prior guidance and frames key risks and system needs. More than 80% of newborn infants will have some degree of jaundice, and careful monitoring of all newborn infants and the application of appropriate treatments are essential, because high bilirubin concentrations can cause acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus. Kernicterus is a permanent disabling neurologic condition characterized by some or all of the following: choreoathetoid cerebral palsy, upward gaze paresis, enamel dysplasia of deciduous teeth, sensorineural hearing loss or auditory neuropathy or dyssynchrony spectrum disorder, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Central to this guideline is having systems in place including policies in hospitals and other types of birthing locations to provide the care necessary to minimize the risk of kernicterus. This article updates and replaces the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the management and prevention of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and states that this clinical practice guideline addresses issues of prevention, risk assessment, monitoring, and treatment.

### Kernicterus: epidemiological strategies for its prevention through systems-based approaches [^111KEMFc]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Kernicterus, thought to be due to severe hyperbilirubinemia, is an uncommon disorder with tragic consequences, especially when it affects healthy term and near-term infants. Early identification, prevention and treatment of severe hyperbilirubinemia should make kernicterus a preventable disease. However, national epidemiologic data are needed to monitor any preventive strategies. Recommendations are provided to obtain prospective data on the prevalence and incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and associate mortality and neurologic injury using standardized definitions, explore the clinical characteristics and root causes of kernicterus in children identified in the Kernicterus Pilot Registry, identify and test an indicator for population surveillance, validating systems-based approaches to the management of newborn jaundice, and explore the feasibility of using biologic or genetic markers to identify infants at risk for hyperbilirubinemia. Increased knowledge about the incidence and consequences of severe hyperbilirubinemia is essential to the planning, implementation and assessment of interventions to ensure that infants discharged as healthy from their birth hospitals have a safer transition to home, avoiding morbidity due to hyperbilirubinemia and other disorders. At a recent NIHCD-sponsored conference, key questions were raised about kernicterus and the need for additional strategies for its prevention. These questions and an approach to their answers form the basis of this report.

### Outcomes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and associated factors at a tertiary hospital in Ghana [^11161rW4]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (NH) is one of the most common clinical presentations in the first week of life. Approximately 60% of term infants and 80% of preterm infants present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period. This condition results from the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood due to an imbalance between bilirubin conjugation and excretion. Rapid accumulation of bilirubin poses a unique problem since an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin is potentially toxic to the developing central nervous system resulting in severe and irreversible long-term consequences or even death.

NH is estimated to be highest in the African region, with rates of 667.8 per 10,000 live births reported in two systematic reviews, compared to incidences of 3.2 per 10,000 and 4.4 per 10,000 live births in Europe and the Americas, respectively. Higher prevalence rates have been reported in some countries with one teaching hospital in Ghana reporting a rate of 32.9%.

NH is one of the leading causes of admissions in the first week of life worldwide, and delays in presentation or in the initiation of its treatment could result in bilirubin encephalopathy - related complications and mortality. In spite of the presence of risk factors at birth in most cases, the condition also tends to be one of the major causes of readmissions during the neonatal period, which emphasizes the need for health professionals to promptly identify and monitor such neonates before discharging them home too early. The high readmission rate for NH after an initial early discharge also highlights the need for a more aggressive assessment of newborns before early discharge.

In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) like Ghana, it is important to reduce the neonatal mortality rate which has stagnated for some time. Reducing deaths and disabilities from NH is one way of achieving this goal. Unfortunately, there are no national figures for NH in most LMICs, including Ghana. Since NH contributes significantly to both neonatal morbidity and mortality, it is vital to have representative data for developing countries to inform resource allocation. Most studies done are retrospective making it difficult to estimate the incidence of NH. This study thus sought to determine the incidence of NH at one of the biggest teaching hospitals in Ghana. Additionally, we aimed to determine the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes specifically death, among neonates presenting with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia to the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Ghana.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^111y5X1n]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors", adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care".

### Effect of the 2022 AAP guideline for managing hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn [^113zNUad]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The American Academy of Pediatrics provides guidelines for managing hyperbilirubinemia in term newborns ≥ 35 weeks' gestation to prevent kernicterus. In 2022, the AAP revised these guidelines by raising thresholds for serum bilirubin testing and phototherapy. This study compares newborn outcomes before and after implementing the 2022 guidelines.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of 2,087 newborns, with 1,058 in the "before" group, using the 2004 guidelines, and 1,029 in the "after" group using the 2022 guidelines. Data collected included demographics, number of heel sticks for serum bilirubin, incidence of phototherapy, and incidence of readmission for hyperbilirubinemia.

Results

There was a 64% reduction in serum bilirubin draws, a 51% decrease in phototherapy sessions, and a 35% reduction in readmissions for phototherapy in the "after" group.

Conclusions

The 2022 AAP guidelines streamlined the management of hyperbilirubinemia, leading to fewer interventions without affecting patient safety.

### A "Gold standard" test for diagnosing and quantifying hemolysis in neonates and infants [^1125sXRL]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Identifying "gold standard" diagnostic tests can promote evidence-based neonatology practice. Hemolysis is a pathological shortening of the erythrocyte lifespan, differing from erythrocyte senescence in responsible mechanisms and clinical implications. Diagnosing hemolysis goes beyond a binary (yes vs. no) determination. It is characterized according to magnitude, and as acute vs. chronic, and genetically based vs. not. For neonates with significant hyperbilirubinemia or anemia, detecting hemolysis and quantifying its magnitude provides diagnostic clarity. The 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Clinical Practice Guideline on management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn states that hemolysis is a risk factor for developing significant hyperbilirubinemia and neurotoxicity. The guideline recommends identifying hemolysis from any cause, but specific guidance is not provided. A spectrum of laboratory tests has been endorsed as diagnostic methods for hemolysis. Herein we examine these laboratory tests and recommend one as the "gold standard" for diagnosing and quantifying hemolysis in neonates and infants.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112bAK1d]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants — KAS 6 specifies that total serum bilirubin (TSB) should be measured if the transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) exceeds or is within 3 mg/dL of the phototherapy treatment threshold or if the TcB is ≥ 15 mg/dL; this carries an Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation. The TcB is a good screening test but is not accurate enough to determine treatment decisions, and the benefit of having a more accurate measure to guide treatment decisions outweighs the discomfort associated with measuring the TSB. In borderline cases, especially if one or more TcB measurements has been greater than a contemporaneous TSB level, parents may prefer to rely on the TcB.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in newborns: updated guidelines from the AAP… [^111fV8bH]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Jaundice affects 4 out of 5 newborns, yet acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus are rare. Following a 2009 recommendation for universal newborn predischarge bilirubin screening, the incidence of hazardous bilirubin levels of 30 mg per dL or greater decreased across three large health systems. The American Academy of Pediatrics updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in infants born at more than 35 weeks of gestation. At 28 days of life, nearly 10% of infants have bilirubin concentrations of 10 mg per dL or greater. To reduce the risk of hyperbilirubinemia, breastfeeding support should be provided within the first hour after birth and continued during the infant's first weeks of life. Parents should be encouraged to breastfeed infants at least eight times every 24 hours to ensure adequate intake.

Oral supplementation with dextrose solution or water to prevent hyperbilirubinemia in breastfed infants is not recommended. When bilirubin levels increase by 0. 3 mg per dL or greater per hour within 24 hours of birth or
0. 2 mg per dL or greater per hour after 24 hours, this suggests the presence of hemolysis. A rapid rate of increase can identify infants at higher risk of hyperbilirubinemia. PROLONGED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA Prolonged hyperbilirubinemia suggests pathologic cholestasis. When breastfed infants are jaundiced at three to four weeks of life or formula-fed infants are jaundiced at two weeks of life, total and direct or conjugated bilirubin should be measured. Breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice should be referred to gastroenterology for further evaluation.

When escalating care, urgent measurement of total and direct serum bilirubin, serum albumin, and serum chemistries; complete blood count; blood typing; and crossmatch screening are required. While care is escalated, serum bilirubin should be measured at least every two hours until the bilirubin level drops below the escalation-of-care threshold. Infants should receive intensive phototherapy and intravenous hydration if possible. Intravenous immune globulin can be considered in infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114pGc1T]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (monitoring of treatment), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure total serum bilirubin within 12 hours after starting phototherapy in hospitalized infants. Guide the timing of the initial total serum bilirubin measure after starting phototherapy and the frequency of total serum bilirubin monitoring during phototherapy by the following factors:

- age of the infant

- presence of hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors

- total serum bilirubin concentration

- total serum bilirubin trajectory.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to phototherapy (monitoring of treatment), AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to repeat bilirubin measurement after phototherapy based on the risk of rebound hyperbilirubinemia. Consider measuring transcutaneous bilirubin instead of total serum bilirubin at least 24 hours after stopping phototherapy.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116ck3QN]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

G6PD deficiency — risk identification and clinical implications: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X-linked recessive enzymopathy that decreases protection against oxidative stress, is now recognized as one of the most important causes of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia leading to kernicterus in the United States and across the globe. Overall, 13% of African American males and about 4% of African American females have G6PD deficiency. Newborn infants with G6PD deficiency are more likely to receive phototherapy before hospital discharge, probably because of both increased bilirubin production and decreased conjugation, and have a greater risk of readmission and retreatment. Severe hyperbilirubinemia or atypical development of hyperbilirubinemia, such as elevated TSB in a formula-fed infant or late-onset jaundice, should raise the possibility of G6PD deficiency. An infant with G6PD deficiency can develop a sudden and extreme increase in TSB that may be hard to anticipate or prevent, and even after what appears to be an acute hemolytic event, there may be little or no laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Identifying neonates with G6PD deficiency is a challenge; most affected infants will not have a positive family history, and genetic ancestry from a population in which this condition is prevalent can be helpful in predicting risk.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the term newborn [^112wbpQY]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common problems encountered in term newborns. Historically, management guidelines were derived from studies on bilirubin toxicity in infants with hemolytic disease. More recent recommendations support the use of less intensive therapy in healthy term newborns with jaundice. Phototherapy should be instituted when the total serum bilirubin level is at or above 15 mg per dL (257 micromol per L) in infants 25 to 48 hours old, 18 mg per dL (308 micromol per L) in infants 49 to 72 hours old, and 20 mg per dL (342 micromol per L) in infants older than 72 hours. Few term newborns with hyperbilirubinemia have serious underlying pathology. Jaundice is considered pathologic if it presents within the first 24 hours after birth, the total serum bilirubin level rises by more than 5 mg per dL (86 micromol per L) per day or is higher than 17 mg per dL (290 micromol per L), or an infant has signs and symptoms suggestive of serious illness. The management goals are to exclude pathologic causes of hyperbilirubinemia and initiate treatment to prevent bilirubin neurotoxicity.

### Hyperbilirubinemia… [^115ru7kG]. AAP (2022). Medium credibility.

This AAP clinical guidance assists pediatricians with the diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. Tools are provided to ensure early identification of newborns of 35 or more weeks' gestation at risk for hyperbilirubinemia who might require treatment to prevent kernicterus. Hyperbilirubinemia Overview. Severe hyperbilirubinemia can cause kernicterus, a type of brain damage that leads to movement problems and hearing loss. Informed guidance on hyperbilirubinemia management, including preventive treatment thresholds, is critical to safely minimize neurodevelopmental risk. AAP Recommendations In August 2022, the Academy released updated clinical guidance on the prevention and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns greater than 35 weeks of gestational age. This clinical practice guideline will remain valid for use in practice through August of 2027 and considered retired thereafter.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^112LXTnw]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 1 directs that if the maternal antibody screen is positive or unknown because the mother did not have prenatal antibody screening, the infant should have a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and the infant's blood type should be determined as soon as possible using either cord or peripheral blood, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B and a Recommendation. The guideline notes that early DAT testing identifies newborn infants at risk for immune-mediated hemolytic disease and early hyperbilirubinemia born to mothers who carry anti-erythrocyte antibodies, acknowledges a small risk from an extra blood draw and false-negative or false-positive DAT results, and states that the benefit of early DAT testing likely exceeds these harms in infants born to mothers with positive or unknown antibody screen results.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114K38Di]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 3 advises using total serum bilirubin (TSB) as the definitive diagnostic test to guide phototherapy and escalation-of-care decisions, including exchange transfusion, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X and a Recommendation. Benefits include that virtually all treatment studies are based on TSB concentrations, while risks note there is some laboratory variation. The guideline adds that using TSB can lead to timely treatment and may help reduce overtreatment in infants in whom transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) overestimates TSB, although there are no direct comparisons between TSB and TcB as a diagnostic test and such studies are unlikely to be performed.

### A practical approach to neonatal jaundice [^117BRjeV]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus and neurologic sequelae caused by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia are preventable conditions. A structured and practical approach to the identification and care of infants with jaundice can facilitate prevention, thus decreasing rates of morbidity and mortality. Primary prevention includes ensuring adequate feeding, with breastfed infants having eight to 12 feedings per 24 hours. Secondary prevention is achieved by vigilant monitoring of neonatal jaundice, identifying infants at risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, and ensuring timely outpatient follow-up within 24 to 72 hours of discharge. Total serum bilirubin or transcutaneous bilirubin levels should be routinely monitored in all newborns, and these measurements must be plotted on a nomogram according to the infant's age in hours. The resultant low-, intermediate-, or high-risk zones, in addition to the infant's risk factors, can guide timing of postdischarge follow-up. Another nomogram that consists of age in hours, risk factors, and total bilirubin levels can provide guidance on when to initiate phototherapy. If the infant requires phototherapy or if the bilirubin level is increasing rapidly, further work-up is indicated.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate and young infant [^116pxvo2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in the first few weeks of life may herald potentially life-threatening pathology. It is therefore incumbent upon the pediatric practitioner to have a high index of suspicion for severe disease when investigating jaundice in a young infant. This article outlines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic workup for both the most common and the most severe causes of cholestasis in the neonatal period.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^115ebwvN]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia management — KAS 4 directs: "All infants should be visually assessed for jaundice at least every 12 hours following delivery until discharge. TSB or TcB should be measured as soon as possible for infants noted to be jaundiced < 24 hours after birth" (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Strong Recommendation). The rationale notes that onset of jaundice within 24 h of birth is more likely to be caused by hemolysis and to need treatment, and that the benefits are likely to exceed harms, especially in the first 24 h. Potential harms include that assessment can interfere with sleep and disturb the infant and family members, and parents may have preferences regarding frequency or timing as long as examinations occur at least every 12 h.

### Universal bilirubin screening for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^111Yqupv]. Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

To reduce the incidence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia affecting newborns with jaundice in the United States and to prevent kernicterus, there is a need to implement proven prevention strategies for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia as recommended in the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines for newborns > 35 weeks gestational age. The purpose of universal predischarge bilirubin screening is to identify infants with bilirubin levels > 75th percentile for age in hours and track those with rapid rates of bilirubin rise (> 0.2 mg per 100 mL per h). Early identification has been reported to predict severe hyperbilirubinemia and allow for evidence-based targeted interventions. A systems approach is likely to reduce the preventable causes of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. To do so, highest priority should be given to (i) designating extreme hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin > 427 μmol l(-1) or > 25 mg per 100 ml) as a reportable condition by laboratories and health-care providers through public health mandates; (ii) implementation of Joint Commission's Sentinel Report for kernicterus; (iii) nursing outreach to communities for education of prospective parents; (iv) development of clinical pathways to monitor, evaluate and track infants with extreme hyperbilirubinemia; and (v) societal awareness. These efforts should be monitored by a state and national surveillance system in order to critically improve the timeliness and completeness of notifications and to allow evaluation and interventions at the policy and individual family level.

### Neonatal jaundice: phototherapy [^112YUDQv]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 50% of term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice, which usually appears 2 to 4 days after birth, and resolves spontaneously after 1 to 2 weeks. Jaundice is caused by bilirubin deposition in the skin. Most jaundice in newborn infants is a result of increased red cell breakdown and decreased bilirubin excretion.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of different wavelengths of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of different intensities of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of different total doses of light in hospital phototherapy as treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in term and preterm infants? What are the effects of starting hospital phototherapy at different thresholds in term and preterm infants? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

Fourteen studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of different wavelengths, intensities, total doses, and threshold for commencement of the following intervention: hospital phototherapy.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114XFTpB]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants — KAS 8 notes that if appropriate follow-up cannot be arranged for an infant recommended to have an outpatient follow-up bilirubin measure, discharge may be delayed (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade D, Option). Follow-up after discharge for some families can be challenging and potentially contribute to missing the opportunity for timely treatment of hyperbilirubinemia, whereas delay in discharge can be difficult for families and increase nursery-related expenses. The balance of benefit and harm depend on the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and the challenge of follow-up, and extending access for newborn follow-up can reduce the need to delay discharge; shared decision making can help inform the benefit-harm assessment.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116kypNB]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia guideline — KAS 2 states that oral supplementation with water or dextrose water should not be provided to prevent hyperbilirubinemia or decrease bilirubin concentrations, with Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade B and a Strong Recommendation. Avoiding supplementation may help promote breastfeeding because supplementation has been associated with reduced maternal confidence in breastfeeding and breastfeeding duration, and one study found no difference in peak serum bilirubin concentrations or the need for phototherapy among term breastfed newborn infants with physiologic jaundice by whether they were fed supplemental water. Another study of breastfed term infants whose weight was appropriate for gestational age found that supplementation with water or dextrose water was associated with higher bilirubin concentrations on day 6 after birth. There is no evidence of the benefit of routinely providing water or dextrose water supplementation and there are possible harms, including interference with breastfeeding, hyponatremia, and water intoxication, and there are no clear risks, harms, or costs associated with not routinely supplementing infants with water or dextrose water who are not receiving phototherapy.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: evaluation and treatment [^115RLKsn]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Neonatal jaundice due to hyperbilirubinemia is common, and most cases are benign. The irreversible outcome of brain damage from kernicterus is rare (1 out of 100,000 infants) in high-income countries such as the United States, and there is increasing evidence that kernicterus occurs at much higher bilirubin levels than previously thought. However, newborns who are premature or have hemolytic diseases are at higher risk of kernicterus. It is important to evaluate all newborns for risk factors for bilirubin-related neurotoxicity, and it is reasonable to obtain screening bilirubin levels in newborns with risk factors. All newborns should be examined regularly, and bilirubin levels should be measured in those who appear jaundiced. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) revised its clinical practice guideline in 2022 and reconfirmed its recommendation for universal neonatal hyperbilirubinemia screening in newborns 35 weeks' gestational age or greater. Although universal screening is commonly performed, it increases unnecessary phototherapy use without sufficient evidence that it decreases the incidence of kernicterus. The AAP also released new nomograms for initiating phototherapy based on gestational age at birth and the presence of neurotoxicity risk factors, with higher thresholds than in previous guidelines. Phototherapy decreases the need for an exchange transfusion but has the potential for short- and long-term adverse effects, including diarrhea and increased risk of seizures. Mothers of infants who develop jaundice are also more likely to stop breastfeeding, even though discontinuation is not necessary. Phototherapy should be used only for newborns who exceed thresholds recommended by the current AAP hour-specific phototherapy nomograms.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^111aub4d]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

While we set out to ensure that our recommendations are realistic and consistent with the prevailing conditions in most LMICs, the methodological approach used in this document deserves clarification. We followed standard protocols for guideline adaptation including a comprehensive review of the priority issues to be considered, the formation of a working group, quality rating of existing guidelines and independent review by a panel of leading clinicians and experts on newborn care from different world regions. However, we did not grade specific studies in support of various proposals in this paper, more so because the body of evidence was predominantly adapted from existing guidelines or supported by the best available data from LMICs. Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is frequently underpinned by complex interactions of diverse biological and environmental risk factors across populations. It is our view therefore, that each LMIC still needs to develop context-specific guidelines for their own population. Such an initiative should be broadened to involve key stakeholders including parent groups and community leaders. It may be helpful to prepare separate documents for each level of care to avoid information overload especially at the primary care level. While the scope of this framework is not exhaustive, like any of the existing guidelines, we believe that most of the recommendations will still be valuable to LMICs that did not meet our selection criteria. Finally, strong clinical and public health leadership at all levels will be required to surmount the challenges that typically mitigate against initiatives for improved child and newborn care in LMICs.

### Rates of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in children and adherence to national guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment in Sweden [^111ruW53]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the incidence of hazardous neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and does an association exist between the quality of neonatal care and kernicterus?

Findings

In this population-based cohort study of 992 378 live-born children in Sweden from 2008 to 2016, 67 newborns were exposed to serum bilirubin levels of 30 mg/dL (510 μmol/L) or higher, of whom 13 developed kernicterus. Root cause analysis indicated that 11 of these 13 kernicterus cases (85%) were potentially avoidable because they were associated with suboptimal screening, diagnosis, or treatment.

Meaning

Kernicterus observed in a high-resource setting was associated with nonadherence to best practice guidelines and thus might have been prevented in a majority of infants.

### Association of SLCO1B1 genetic variants with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: a consolidated analysis of 36 studies [^114pQ2sN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, commonly known as jaundice, is a prevalent condition affecting both premature and full-term infants, often leading to hospitalization within the first week of life. It is estimated that approximately 60% of term infants and about 80% of preterm infants experience jaundice, with the highest risk observed in infants born before 35 weeks gestation. Severe neonatal jaundice (SNJ) presents a critical global health challenge, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). The prevalence of jaundice among hospitalized neonates in these regions ranges form 0.73–3.34%, with approximately 14.26% of jaundiced neonates classified as having SNJ. This highlights a substantial healthcare burden. Clinical complications associated with neonatal jaundice include bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, kernicterus, and acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE). The necessity for exchange blood transfusions (EBT) can also arise in severe cases. Rates of EBT range between 0.74% and 3.81%, while ABE occurs with a frequency of 0.16–2.75%.

The diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia primarily relies on a physical examination and the assessment of serum bilirubin levels, with jaundice becoming clinically evident when bilirubin levels exceed 85 µmol/dl (5 mg/dl). Key indicators of pathological jaundice include early onset, elevated bilirubin levels, and significant clinical symptoms. The pathophysiology of hyperbilirubinemia stems from an imbalance between bilirubin production and elimination. While low bilirubin levels are generally considered harmless and may even confer antioxidant benefits, elevated levels pose serious risks, potentially leading to bilirubin encephalopathy and central nervous system complications. Treatment strategies for jaundice are determined by its severity and underlying cause. Common interventions include phototherapy, exchange transfusion in critical cases, and enhanced feeding techniques. Prolonged unconjugated bilirubin levels that remain untreated can lead to bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and, in severe cases, may result in death from kernicterus. Jaundice generally resolves within a week in the absence of complications such as inadequate oral intake, hypoxia, fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility, infection, sepsis, or hepatic disorders.

### Rates of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in children and adherence to national guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment in Sweden [^111w3cH6]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is a major cause of lifelong neurodevelopmental impairment. Given effective tools for risk assessment and prevention, as well as for diagnosis and treatment, devastating neonatal hyperbilirubinemia should be a preventable condition. However, kernicterus occurs in high-resource settings despite evidence-based guidelines, and under what could be considered optimal conditions. Therefore, a better understanding of the processes leading to kernicterus is needed.

There are a few population-based studies (from Denmark, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada) of the incidence of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus. Previous studies report diagnoses associated with kernicterus, such as hemolytic or nonhemolytic diseases, bilirubin levels, and root cause analysis, but there is no previous study, to our knowledge, on hyperbilirubinemia resulting in kernicterus using population-based epidemiology to establish incidence rates with analysis of adherence to best practice guidelines.

In 2008, national guidelines for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia were issued in Sweden. At the same time, the Swedish Neonatal Quality (SNQ) register started to collect information on maximum serum bilirubin levels for all infants admitted to neonatal care. Using these sources of information and the Swedish Medical Birth Registry (MBR), the present study aimed to determine incidence rates of extreme and hazardous neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a population of almost 1 000 000 term and near-term newborns, the risk factors and causes of hazardous neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and to what extent kernicterus developed. In addition, the present study also aimed to audit the medical records of all newborns with hazardous hyperbilirubinemia for compliance with national standards and to determine to what extent kernicterus might have been avoidable. Finally, we captured information on the proportions of families affected by kernicterus who had applied for and were granted financial compensation from the Swedish Patient Insurance.

Hyperbilirubinemia KAS 23 — exchange transfusion and monitoring: An urgent exchange transfusion should be performed for infants if the total serum bilirubin (TSB) is at or above the exchange transfusion threshold, and if before starting the exchange transfusion a TSB concentration is below the exchange transfusion threshold without signs of intermediate or advanced acute bilirubin encephalopathy, the exchange transfusion may be deferred while continuing intensive phototherapy and following the TSB every 2 hours until the TSB is below the escalation of care threshold (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade C, Recommendation). Treatment at these levels may prevent kernicterus, and risks of exchange transfusion include death, necrotizing enterocolitis, apnea, hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia, with infectious risks from donor blood products low and costs at least thousands of dollars.

### An approach to the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the preterm infant less than 35 weeks of gestation [^113ucFkm]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

We provide an approach to the use of phototherapy and exchange transfusion in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants of < 35 weeks of gestation. Because there are limited data for evidence-based recommendations, these recommendations are, of necessity, consensus-based. The recommended treatment levels are based on operational thresholds for bilirubin levels and represent those levels beyond which it is assumed that treatment will likely do more good than harm. Long-term follow-up of a large population will be needed to evaluate whether or not these recommendations should be modified.

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114cxCKw]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Context

Severe hyperbilirubinemia is associated with kernicterus. Informed guidance on hyperbilirubinemia management, including preventive treatment thresholds, is essential to safely minimize neurodevelopmental risk.

Objective

To update the evidence base necessary to develop the 2022 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant ≥ 35 weeks' gestation.

Data Source

PubMed.

Study Selection

English language randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Excluded: case reports or series, nonsystematic reviews, and investigations focused on < 35-weeks' gestation infants.

Data Extraction

Topics addressed in the previous clinical practice guideline (2004) and follow-up commentary (2009) were updated with new evidence published through March 2022. Evidence reviews were conducted for previously unaddressed topics (phototherapy-associated adverse effects and effectiveness of intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] to prevent exchange transfusion).

Results

New evidence indicates that neurotoxicity does not occur until bilirubin concentrations are well above the 2004 exchange transfusion thresholds. Systematic review of phototherapy-associated adverse effects found limited and/or inconsistent evidence of late adverse effects, including cancer and epilepsy. IVIG has unclear benefit for preventing exchange transfusion in infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease, with a possible risk of harm due to necrotizing enterocolitis.

Limitations

The search was limited to 1 database and English language studies.

Conclusions

Accumulated evidence justified narrowly raising phototherapy treatment thresholds in the updated clinical practice guideline. Limited evidence for effectiveness with some evidence of risk of harm support the revised recommendations to limit IVIG use.

### Management of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the cholestatic neonate: a review and an approach [^111wAmpe]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

A review of the literature demonstrates that severe total hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin ≥ 20 mg/dL [340 µmol/L]) in some cholestatic term (≥ 37 weeks) and late-preterm (≥ 34 0/7 6/7 weeks) gestation neonates poses a risk for bilirubin-induced brain damage. When the direct bilirubin fraction is < 50% of the total serum bilirubin this risk is associated with the total serum bilirubin alone and treatment decisions should be based on the total serum bilirubin. On the other hand, there are limited data on the risk of bilirubin-induced brain damage in the neonate with severe total hyperbilirubinemia and a direct bilirubin fraction that is equal to or exceeds 50% of the total serum bilirubin. When this rare combination occurs, efforts to keep the indirect bilirubin fraction from reaching severe levels might, nevertheless, be prudent.

Postdischarge follow-up for hyperbilirubinemia — timing and testing are guided by using the difference between the bilirubin concentration and the phototherapy threshold at the time of measurement to determine the interval between discharge and follow-up and the need for additional total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements. This approach incorporates both gestational age and other hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors into the decision-making process, and should also take into consideration the presence of other hyperbilirubinemia risk factors. These guidelines are based only on the management of hyperbilirubinemia, and other considerations that may influence the timing of follow-up include gestational age, postnatal age, assessment of breastfeeding, weight loss from birth weight, and assessment of the well-being of the infant and parents.

### Kernicterus in the 21st century: frequently asked questions [^113GB5Zp]. Journal of Perinatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute kernicterus remains a clinical emergency and its delayed management represents an easily preventable neonatal brain injury. Yet, practitioners encounter recurrent questions regarding the risk and timing of bilirubin-related neurotoxicity. These include the following: does bilirubin damage the brain of healthy infants? Is there a re-emergence of kernicterus in the United States? Was kernicterus previously prevented in the United States? What was the public health impact of 1994 American Academy of Pediatrics Guidelines? What is the current incidence of kernicterus and severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia? What is the estimated risk of kernicterus in infants with excessive hyperbilirubinemia? Is there a specific bilirubin threshold total serum bilirubin (TSB) value for neurotoxicity? Are there sequelae of severe or prolonged moderate hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of recognized acute bilirubin encephalopathy? Can we define a bilirubin level that is safe in newborns? We address these questions in the context of available data and evidence, and estimate the current risk of chronic kernicterus is about one in seven in infants with TSB > 30 mg per 100 mL (513 micromol l(-1)).

### Management of jaundice and prevention of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in infants ≥ 35 weeks gestation [^116PRXSA]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Kernicterus is still occurring but should be largely preventable if health care personnel follow the recommendations listed in this guideline. These recommendations emphasize the importance of universal, systematic assessment of the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia, lactation support, close follow-up, and prompt intervention when necessary. A systems-based approach to prevent severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia should be implemented at all birthing facilities and coordinated with continuing ambulatory care. Translational research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic interventions.

### Phototherapy… [^113uzebH]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

More than two-thirds of newborns develop jaundice, the clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, and most cases are physiologic and benign. 1 In healthy newborns, unconjugated bilirubin, a lipid-soluble breakdown product of heme, transiently elevates during days 2 to 5 after delivery due to the turnover of fetal erythrocytes. 2 The liver conjugates the bilirubin into a water-soluble form that can be excreted via urine and stool. Bilirubin levels usually return to normal over one to three weeks without intervention or adverse effects. 2, 3. Diagnosing Hyperbilirubinemia EXAMINATION All newborns should be examined for jaundice and signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy. 16 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends measuring bilirubin only in newborns appearing jaundiced on examination. 20 Screening all newborns for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, regardless of risk, increases rates of phototherapy, sometimes inappropriately.

One large retrospective cohort study showed that only 56% of newborns who received phototherapy had a bilirubin level exceeding the recommended threshold from the then-current 2004 AAP guideline. SCREENING IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Jaundice in newborns with HDN often presents earlier, sometimes in the first 24 hours after delivery. Newborns born to mothers who are blood group O, are Rh negative, had a positive anti-erythrocyte antibody screening result during pregnancy, or have unknown results should have ABO blood group, Rh status, and direct antiglobulin tests as soon as possible after birth via cord or peripheral blood. Obtaining TcB measurement six hours after delivery in newborns who have positive results on direct antiglobulin testing helps determine whether they need phototherapy within 24 hours of delivery.

32 Infants with a bilirubin level of less than 3 mg per dL at six hours of life are highly unlikely to require phototherapy before 24 hours of life, whereas infants with a bilirubin level of 5. 3 mg per dL or higher are likely to need phototherapy and require ongoing, frequent bilirubin measurement. 32 Newborns who test positive only for anti-Rh antibodies and were born to mothers who received Rh 0 immune globulin are not considered to have a positive direct antiglobulin test result. 4.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112GAG71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and rhesus disease of the newborn: incidence and impairment estimates for 2010 at regional and global levels [^11761iXo]. Pediatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice occur in almost all newborns and may be benign if its progression to extreme hyperbilirubinemia (EHB; total bilirubin (TB) > 428 μmol/l in full-term babies) is recognized, monitored, and prevented or managed in a timely manner. Major risk factors include neonatal hemolysis (such as Rhesus (Rh) disease), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, infections, and an array of familial and genetic disorders. In addition to conditions such as preterm birth that make the neonate more susceptible to bilirubin neurotoxicity, suboptimal breast milk intake or dehydration may also contribute to EHB. At present, once the early stages of hyperbilirubinemic brain damage occur, therapeutic options are limited to the prompt (< 8 h) use of exchange transfusion, hence the imperative for preventive approaches. Universal prenatal Rh screening for specific risk of perinatal hemolysis and its prophylaxis with Rh immunoglobulin have been highly effective practices for preventing neonatal morbidities and mortality. Countries with universal access to perinatal health services have virtually eliminated severe hyperbilirubinemia (icterus gravis neonatorum), which had been so common in the late 19th century.

Now with emerging affordable technologies, the worldwide prevention and management of newborn jaundice can more feasibly reach those at risk even in low-income settings. Yet, there remains a paucity of quality population data on the prevalence of hyperbilirubinemia and related outcomes to inform such a strategy for most countries.

In the absence of direct national or regional reporting, we report systematic estimates for the prevalence, mortality, and neurodevelopmental outcomes of Rh disease and EHB due to other causes, e.g. G6PD deficiency, prematurity, neonatal hemolysis, and idiopathic causes. We based these estimates, as described below, on national risks of G6PD deficiency, preterm birth, neonatal hemolysis (not due to Rh disease), and other idiopathic causes, along with measures of the implementation gap for universal Rh prophylaxis.

### Rates of extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in children and adherence to national guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment in Sweden [^114o1GV4]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, among 100 000 near-term to term live-born infants in Sweden, 6.8 developed hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and 1.3 developed kernicterus. Among infants who developed brain damage associated with hazardous hyperbilirubinemia, 85% were deemed avoidable by the criteria used in the present study. The challenge and the way forward to prevent kernicterus include not only evidence-based guidelines advocating bilirubin level determination before hospital discharge but also improved digital solutions and automated safeguards for decision making regarding follow-up, diagnosis, and treatment. Finally, seeking explanations for cases of hazardous hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus in which no underlying cause can be found should be given priority.

Risk when below phototherapy threshold and when to stop checking: Among infants with TSB concentrations below the phototherapy threshold, the potential need for future phototherapy or escalation of care increases the closer the TSB is to the phototherapy threshold; however, once a spontaneous decline in TcB or TSB over at least 6 hours has been documented and absent other worrisome signs, additional bilirubin measurements are not necessary.

### Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^113h3u4e]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus. The focus of this guideline is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment. Although kernicterus should almost always be preventable, cases continue to occur. These guidelines provide a framework for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants of 35 or more weeks of gestation. In every infant, we recommend that clinicians 1) promote and support successful breastfeeding; 2) perform a systematic assessment before discharge for the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia; 3) provide early and focused follow-up based on the risk assessment; and 4) when indicated, treat newborns with phototherapy or exchange transfusion to prevent the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia and, possibly, bilirubin encephalopathy (kernicterus).

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breast-feeding of newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcome in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Management of late-preterm and term infants with hyperbilirubinaemia in resource-constrained settings [^115xcXFD]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia is a ubiquitous transitional morbidity in the vast majority of newborns and a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life worldwide. While timely and effective phototherapy and exchange transfusion are well proven treatments for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, inappropriate or ineffective treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia, at secondary and tertiary hospitals, still prevails in many poorly-resourced countries accounting for a disproportionately high burden of bilirubin-induced mortality and long-term morbidity. As part of the efforts to curtail the widely reported risks of frequent but avoidable bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with significant resource constraints, this article presents a practical framework for the management of late-preterm and term infants (≥ 35 weeks of gestation) with clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia in these countries particularly where local practice guidelines are lacking. Standard and validated protocols were followed in adapting available evidence-based national guidelines on the management of hyperbilirubinaemia through a collaboration among clinicians and experts on newborn jaundice from different world regions. Tasks and resources required for the comprehensive management of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery are proposed, covering primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and follow-up. Additionally, actionable treatment or referral levels for phototherapy and exchange transfusion are proposed within the context of several confounding factors such as widespread exclusive breastfeeding, infections, blood group incompatibilities and G6PD deficiency, which place infants at high risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in LMICs, as well as the limited facilities for clinical investigations and inconsistent functionality of available phototherapy devices. The need to adjust these levels as appropriate depending on the available facilities in each clinical setting and the risk profile of the infant is emphasised with a view to avoiding over-treatment or under-treatment. These recommendations should serve as a valuable reference material for health workers, guide the development of contextually-relevant national guidelines in each LMIC, as well as facilitate effective advocacy and mobilisation of requisite resources for the optimal care of infants with hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels.

### Israel guidelines for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and prevention of kernicterus [^1148kAJ1]. Journal of Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Despite publication of guidelines for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in term and late-preterm newborn infants, kernicterus, although rare, continues to occur. Guidelines written for use in one country may not always be universally appropriate. Bearing this in mind, a committee appointed by the Israel Neonatal Society has formulated a set of guidelines, based on those of the American Academy of Pediatrics (2004), but adapted to the realities of the Israeli scene. The guidelines include methods of surveillance of jaundice, prediction of jaundice, assessment of risk factors, discharge planning and post-discharge follow-up, in addition to therapeutic guidelines including indications for phototherapy, exchange transfusion and the use of intravenous immune globulin. Availability of these guidelines to the international community may offer direction to physicians of other countries who may be setting up guidelines for use in their own communities.

### Why is kernicterus still a major cause of death and disability in low-income and middle-income countries? [^114bgsCC]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is predominantly a benign condition that affects 60%-80% of newborns worldwide but progresses to potentially harmful severe hyperbilirubinaemia in some. Despite the proven therapeutic benefits of phototherapy for preventing extreme hyperbilirubinaemia, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus, several low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) continue to report high rates of avoidable exchange transfusions, as well as bilirubin-induced mortality and neurodevelopmental disorders. Considering the critical role of appropriate timing in treatment effectiveness, this review set out to examine the contributory factors to the burden of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and kernicterus based on the 'three delays model' described by Thaddeus and Maine in the 91 most economically disadvantaged LMICs with Gross National Income per capita ≤ US$6000 and median human development index of 0.525 (IQR: 0.436–0.632). Strategies for addressing these delays are proposed including the need for clinical and public health leadership to curtail the risk and burden of kernicterus in LMICs.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^114tSr2k]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to exchange transfusion, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to perform an urgent exchange transfusion in infants with a total serum bilirubin level at or above the exchange transfusion threshold. Consider deferring the exchange transfusion while continuing intensive phototherapy if, while preparing for but before starting the exchange transfusion, a total serum bilirubin concentration is below the exchange transfusion threshold and the infant does not show signs of intermediate or advanced stages of acute bilirubin encephalopathy, and following the total serum bilirubin every 2 hours until the total serum bilirubin is below the escalation-of-care threshold.

Hyperbilirubinemia — use of phototherapy thresholds and early initiation notes that these thresholds, like those in the 2004 guidelines, are based on expert opinion rather than strong evidence that they distinguish between infants in whom the benefits of phototherapy do or do not exceed its risks. Clinicians and families may choose to treat at lower levels, based on individual circumstances and preferences, and for example, it is an option to begin phototherapy at subthreshold level during a birth hospitalization to reduce the risk of readmission if the absolute level or rate of rise relative to the threshold slope suggests a high likelihood of exceeding the threshold after discharge. For infants without recognized hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors other than gestational age, Figure 2 provides phototherapy thresholds by gestational age and age in hours, and hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors include gestational age < 38 weeks; albumin < 3.0 g/dL; isoimmune hemolytic disease, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, or other hemolytic conditions; sepsis; or any significant clinical instability in the previous 24 hours.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^1135ixgv]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2017 guidelines recommend to measure total and conjugated serum bilirubin for the evaluation of cholestasis in any formula-fed infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age.
Consider observing otherwise well-appearing breastfed infants clinically until 3 weeks of age. Measure total and conjugated serum bilirubin if they appear icteric at that time.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia: a global perspective [^114FLtHg]. The Lancet: Child & Adolescent Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Hyperbilirubinaemia, presenting as jaundice, is a ubiquitous and frequently benign condition in newborn babies but is a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life. In some infants jaundice can become severe, progressing to acute bilirubin encephalopathy and kernicterus with a substantial risk of neonatal mortality and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Severe hyperbilirubinaemia and its sequelae continue to occur in industrialised countries with functioning medical systems and a disproportionately high burden also persists in low-income and middle-income countries due primarily to delays in delivering effective treatments that are routinely available in high-income countries. In this Review we summarise up-to-date evidence on the epidemiology of neonatal jaundice including its global burden based on estimates of its prevalence, and both fatal and non-fatal health outcomes. We also discuss the management of severe hyperbilirubinaemia including the prevention of kernicterus, and highlight future directions for research.
