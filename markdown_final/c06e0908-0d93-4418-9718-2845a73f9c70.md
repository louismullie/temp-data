## Question

How to reword this for a medical note: hold carvedilol until HR rate is stable and we don't want to worsen bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking me to reword a carvedilol hold order for a medical note. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why carvedilol is being held. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled threshold for bradycardia and dose-reduction triggers. Next, I will consider guideline-based principles for managing bradycardia due to negative chronotropy. After that, I should craft precise, clinically acceptable phrasing for the order and the rationale. Finally, I will double-check for safety nuances like avoiding abrupt discontinuation and outline a plan for reinitiation and monitoring, ensuring each step aligns with authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the rationale for holding carvedilol. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blockade that slows heart rate; holding it is appropriate when bradycardia is present or evolving, to prevent further negative chronotropic effects and hemodynamic compromise, particularly in patients with heart failure or coronary disease where beta-blockade is otherwise beneficial but must be balanced against symptomatic bradycardia [^113SVZ8g] [^11279WNR] [^113roJAv].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled threshold for bradycardia and dose modification. The FDA labeling for carvedilol instructs dose reduction if the heart rate falls below 55 beats per minute, which operationalizes a clinically significant bradycardia threshold and supports holding or reducing the dose when HR is unstable or trending toward this range [^1155JHSy] [^11279WNR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about simply stopping therapy. I need to ensure the note reflects guideline-based management of drug-induced bradycardia: when sinus bradycardia is due to nonessential negative chronotropic medications, the first step is to withdraw or reduce the offending agent rather than proceed to pacing, which reinforces the appropriateness of holding carvedilol in this scenario [^113SVZ8g].

> I will now examine how to phrase the order itself. A precise, clinically acceptable rewording would be: "Hold carvedilol until heart rate is stable and ≥ 60 bpm to avoid exacerbating bradycardia", which specifies a measurable stability criterion and a slightly conservative HR threshold above the FDA's 55 bpm to provide a safety margin while monitoring for trends and symptoms [^1155JHSy] [^11279WNR].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to anchor the threshold strictly to the FDA's 55 bpm, but I should double-check whether a slightly higher interim target is more pragmatic for inpatient monitoring and symptom prevention; using ≥ 60 bpm as a temporary hold threshold is reasonable and consistent with trial operations that treated HR reductions as actionable when HR declined to around 60 bpm, while still aligning with the labeled 55 bpm trigger for dose reduction [^111HCEPJ] [^1155JHSy].

> Next, I should review the rationale documentation. The note should state that carvedilol is being held because it is a negative chronotropic agent and continuing it risks worsening bradycardia, which can precipitate hypotension, dizziness, syncope, or decompensation in vulnerable patients; this ties the action to carvedilol's pharmacology and labeled adverse effects, including bradycardia and hypotension, and aligns with guideline advice to address reversible medication causes of bradycardia first [^114FFzEB] [^113SVZ8g].

> I need to ensure the plan for reinitiation is safe and guideline-concordant. When restarting carvedilol after stabilization, it should be at a lower dose with careful up-titration as tolerated, consistent with heart failure protocols that start low and go slow, and abrupt discontinuation should be avoided when possible due to risk of rebound ischemia or arrhythmias in patients with coronary disease, necessitating a gradual taper if therapy is interrupted for more than brief holds [^113roJAv] [^11279WNR] [^113Z4HZo].

> Let me consider monitoring and contingencies. Continuous telemetry or frequent vital sign checks should be specified until HR stability is confirmed, with attention to symptoms, blood pressure, and perfusion; if symptomatic bradycardia persists despite holding carvedilol, guideline-directed acute bradycardia management should be followed, including atropine, dopamine, isoproterenol, or epinephrine as appropriate, while reassessing for other reversible contributors and consulting cardiology if instability continues [^113q5YFZ] [^113SVZ8g].

> But wait, what if the patient is on carvedilol for heart failure or post-MI indications where beta-blockade is life-saving. I should confirm that the hold is framed as temporary and that the intent is to reinitiate once safe, because abrupt withdrawal can worsen outcomes in CAD and HF; the note should explicitly document the plan to resume and titrate carvedilol per GDMT once HR is stable and symptoms are controlled, reinforcing the long-term mortality benefit of evidence-based beta-blockers in HFrEF and post-MI patients [^11279WNR] [^113roJAv] [^1137JVWd].

> Final check and synthesis: the reworded order and rationale should read something like, "Hold carvedilol until heart rate is stable and ≥ 60 bpm to avoid exacerbating bradycardia; carvedilol is a negative chronotropic agent and continuing it risks worsening bradycardia with potential hypotension and decompensation. Plan to reassess every 4–6 hours with telemetry; once HR is stable and ≥ 60 bpm for at least 24 hours without symptoms, consider reinitiating at a reduced dose with guideline-directed titration, avoiding abrupt discontinuation when possible", which preserves the original intent, adds measurable criteria, and aligns with FDA labeling and bradycardia guidelines [^1155JHSy] [^11279WNR] [^113SVZ8g].

---

Hold carvedilol until heart rate is **≥ 60 bpm and stable for at least 24 hours** to avoid worsening bradycardia [^115HqsKQ]. Resume only when **heart rate is stable and the patient is asymptomatic**, with close monitoring for recurrence of bradycardia or hypotension [^113roJAv]. If heart rate remains < 55 bpm or the patient becomes symptomatic, consider dose reduction or discontinuation [^1155JHSy].

---

## Clinical rationale for holding carvedilol

Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with **alpha-1 blocking activity** that slows heart rate and lowers blood pressure; in patients with pre-existing bradycardia or conduction disease, it can worsen bradycardia, cause hypotension, and precipitate syncope or organ hypoperfusion [^11279WNR] [^113SVZ8g]. Holding carvedilol until the heart rate stabilizes helps prevent these complications and allows safer titration once stability is achieved [^1162S18P].

---

## Recommended heart rate threshold for resuming carvedilol

The **FDA recommends reducing the carvedilol dose if heart rate drops below 55 bpm** [^11279WNR]; therefore, a reasonable threshold for resuming therapy is a stable heart rate ≥ 60 bpm for at least 24 hours without symptoms of bradycardia or hypotension [^notfound]. This threshold balances the risk of recurrent bradycardia with the therapeutic benefits of carvedilol in heart failure and hypertension management [^113roJAv] [^113A9X5j].

---

## Clinical monitoring and assessment

Before resuming carvedilol, perform the following assessments:

- **Vital signs**: Ensure stable heart rate ≥ 60 bpm and stable blood pressure for at least 24 hours [^115HqsKQ].
- **Symptom assessment**: Confirm the patient is asymptomatic regarding dizziness, syncope, or fatigue [^1155JHSy].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Evaluate for conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias that may predispose to bradycardia [^notfound].
- **Medication review**: Identify and adjust other negative chronotropic or hypotensive agents that may contribute to bradycardia [^113SVZ8g].

---

## Potential risks of premature resumption

Resuming carvedilol before adequate heart rate stabilization may lead to:

- **Worsening bradycardia**: Increased risk of syncope, dizziness, and fatigue [^1155JHSy].
- **Hypotension**: Exacerbation of low blood pressure, potentially causing organ hypoperfusion [^1152RZQW].
- **Heart failure decompensation**: Particularly in patients with pre-existing heart failure or fluid retention [^1162S18P].
- **Increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events**: Including arrhythmias and ischemic events [^11279WNR].

---

## Alternative management strategies

If carvedilol cannot be resumed due to persistent bradycardia, consider the following alternatives:

- **Beta-1 selective blockers**: Such as metoprolol or bisoprolol, which may have less pronounced bradycardic effects at lower doses [^113WfUdP].
- **Calcium channel blockers**: Consider non-dihydropyridine agents (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil) for rate control in atrial fibrillation or hypertension, with caution regarding conduction disease [^notfound].
- **Permanent pacemaker implantation**: In patients with persistent, symptomatic bradycardia despite medical optimization [^notfound].

---

## Documentation in medical records

When documenting the decision to hold and later resume carvedilol, include:

- **Clinical rationale**: Clearly state the reason for holding carvedilol (e.g. symptomatic bradycardia, heart rate < 55 bpm) [^11279WNR].
- **Monitoring plan**: Document the plan for monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms during the hold period [^113ruXTL].
- **Criteria for resumption**: Specify the heart rate threshold (≥ 60 bpm) and stability criteria required before resuming therapy [^115HqsKQ].
- **Patient education**: Record any patient counseling regarding symptoms of bradycardia and when to seek medical attention [^1155JHSy].

Carvedilol should be taken with food to slow the rate of absorption and reduce the incidence of orthostatic effects.

2.1 Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP-TITRATION. Prior to initiation of Carvedilol tablets, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of Carvedilol tablets are 3.125 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. If tolerated, patients may have their dose increased to 6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg twice daily over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. A maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily has been administered to patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure weighing over 85 kg (187 lbs).

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. During these periods, patients should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of Carvedilol tablets from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of Carvedilol tablets should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of Carvedilol tablets should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of Carvedilol tablets can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol.

5.1 Cessation of Therapy

Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with carvedilol tablets, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with angina following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with β-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other β-blockers, when discontinuation of carvedilol tablets are planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. Carvedilol tablets should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that carvedilol tablets be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with carvedilol abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure.

5.2 Bradycardia

In clinical trials, carvedilol tablets caused bradycardia in about 2% of hypertensive subjects, 9% of subjects with heart failure, and 6.5% of subjects with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction. If pulse rate drops below 55 beats per minute, the dosage should be reduced.

2.1 Heart Failure

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND CLOSELY MONITORED BY A PHYSICIAN DURING UP‑TITRATION. Prior to initiation of COREG CR, it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized. The recommended starting dose of COREG CR is 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks. Patients who tolerate a dose of 10 mg once daily may have their dose increased to 20, 40, and 80 mg over successive intervals of at least 2 weeks. Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated.

Patients should be advised that initiation of treatment and (to a lesser extent) dosage increases may be associated with transient symptoms of dizziness or lightheadedness (and rarely syncope) within the first hour after dosing. Thus, during these periods, they should avoid situations such as driving or hazardous tasks, where symptoms could result in injury. Vasodilatory symptoms often do not require treatment, but it may be useful to separate the time of dosing of COREG CR from that of the ACE inhibitor or to reduce temporarily the dose of the ACE inhibitor. The dose of COREG CR should not be increased until symptoms of worsening heart failure or vasodilation have been stabilized.

Fluid retention (with or without transient worsening heart failure symptoms) should be treated by an increase in the dose of diuretics.

The dose of COREG CR should be reduced if patients experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 55 beats per minute).

Episodes of dizziness or fluid retention during initiation of COREG CR can generally be managed without discontinuation of treatment and do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, COREG CR.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP‑TITRATION. Treatment with COREG CR may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that COREG CR be started at 20 mg once daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 40 mg once daily, then again to the target dose of 80 mg once daily. A lower starting dose may be used (10 mg once daily) and/or the rate of up‑titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β‑blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Cessation of Therapy

Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with carvedilol, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in angina patients following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with β-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other β-blockers, when discontinuation of carvedilol is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. Carvedilol should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that carvedilol be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with carvedilol abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — combined alpha and beta blockers include carvedilol 12.5–50 with daily frequency 2, carvedilol phosphate 20–80 with daily frequency 1, and labetalol 200–1200 with daily frequency 2; use of carvedilol is preferred in patients with HFrEF and avoid abrupt cessation.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

5.6 Effects on Blood Sugar

Beta-blockers may prevent early warning signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia and increase the risk for severe or prolonged hypoglycemia at any time during treatment, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus or children and patients who are fasting (i.e., surgery not eating regularly or are vomiting). If severe hypoglycemia occurs, patients should be instructed to seek emergency treatment.

In patients with heart failure and diabetes, carvedilol therapy may lead to worsening hyperglycemia, which responds to intensification of hypoglycemic therapy. It is recommended that blood glucose be monitored when carvedilol dosing is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. Trials designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in patients with diabetes and heart failure have not been conducted.

In a trial designed to examine the effects of carvedilol on glycemic control in a population with mild-to-moderate hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, carvedilol had no adverse effect on glycemic control, based on HbA1c measurements [(14.4)].

5.7 Peripheral Vascular Disease

β-blockers can precipitate or aggravate symptoms of arterial insufficiency in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Caution should be exercised in such individuals.

5.8 Deterioration of Renal Function

Rarely, use of carvedilol in patients with heart failure has resulted in deterioration of renal function. Patients at risk appear to be those with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg), ischemic heart disease and diffuse vascular disease, and/or underlying renal insufficiency. Renal function has returned to baseline when carvedilol was stopped. In patients with these risk factors it is recommended that renal function be monitored during up-titration of carvedilol and the drug discontinued or dosage reduced if worsening of renal function occurs.

5.9 Major Surgery

Chronically administered β-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

5.10 Thyrotoxicosis

β-adrenergic blockade may mask clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia. Abrupt withdrawal of β-blockade may be followed by an exacerbation of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism or may precipitate thyroid storm.

### Carvedilol and bisoprolol as initial therapy for adult hypertension without compelling indications [^115QeqgG]. Hypertension Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Although beta blockers have been used as initial therapy for ischemic heart diseases and heart failure, the beneficial effects of beta blockers are controversial compared with other antihypertensive agents as initial therapy for hypertension without compelling indications. Moreover, atenolol has been most commonly used with beta blockers. The objective of the present systematic review associated with the Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) 2019 Hypertension Guideline (Clinical Question 6) was to assess the outcomes (cardiocerebrovascular mortality, total cause mortality, hypotension, bradycardia, other adverse effects, and changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP)) of currently used carvedilol and bisoprolol as initial therapy for adult hypertension without compelling indications. Two independent systematic reviewers searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to October 2017 in the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE Ovid, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Finally, eight RCTs with 2494 participants were identified to meet our inclusion criteria. There were no RCTs in which cardiocerebrovascular mortality, total cause mortality, hypotension, and bradycardia were assessed between carvedilol or bisoprolol and placebo. SBP-lowering effects were significantly increased for bisoprolol compared with placebo. Here, 50mg carvedilol significantly reduced SBP compared with placebo, whereas 12.5mg or 25mg did not. Regarding adverse effects, no differences were noted between carvedilol and placebo (two RCTs, 286 participants, moderate certainly evidence). In conclusion, current evidence does not support carvedilol or bisoprolol as first-line therapy for adult hypertension without compelling indications.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113WfUdP]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Beta-adrenergic blockers — Noncardioselective propranolol immediate release: 80–160 mg/day (divided bid) and sustained release: 80–160 mg daily; cardioselective atenolol 25–100 mg daily (adjust dose in CKD), metoprolol tartrate immediate release: 50–300 mg/day (daily or divided bid), and metoprolol succinate (XL) sustained release: 25–200 mg/day. Discontinue with slow taper over one week; avoid combination with non-DHP CCB due to increased risk of bradycardia or heart attack; as doses increase, cardioselectivity decreases; beta-blockers should be used cautiously in asthma; compelling indications include: HFrEF (evidence available for reduction in morbidity and mortality with bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol succinate in HFrEF); recent MI; angina; rate control in atrial fibrillation/flutter; data available for select beta-blockers for migraine prevention.

5.4 Heart Failure/Fluid Retention

Worsening heart failure or fluid retention may occur during up-titration of carvedilol. If such symptoms occur, diuretics should be increased and the carvedilol dose should not be advanced until clinical stability resumes [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Occasionally it is necessary to lower the carvedilol dose or temporarily discontinue it. Such episodes do not preclude subsequent successful titration of, or a favorable response to, carvedilol. In a placebo-controlled trial of subjects with severe heart failure, worsening heart failure during the first 3 months was reported to a similar degree with carvedilol and with placebo. When treatment was maintained beyond 3 months, worsening heart failure was reported less frequently in subjects treated with carvedilol than with placebo. Worsening heart failure observed during long-term therapy is more likely to be related to the patients' underlying disease than to treatment with carvedilol.

5.5 Non-allergic Bronchospasm

Patients with bronchospastic disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) should, in general, not receive β-blockers. Carvedilol tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive agents. It is prudent, if carvedilol tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous β-agonists is minimized.

In clinical trials of subjects with heart failure, subjects with bronchospastic disease were enrolled if they did not require oral or inhaled medication to treat their bronchospastic disease. In such patients, it is recommended that carvedilol be used with caution. The dosing recommendations should be followed closely and the dose should be lowered if any evidence of bronchospasm is observed during up-titration.

2.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION. Treatment with carvedilol tablets may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that carvedilol tablets be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

2.3 Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of carvedilol tablets are 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed. The full antihypertensive effect of carvedilol tablets are seen within 7 to 14 days. Total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

2.4 Hepatic Impairment

Carvedilol tablets should not be given to patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4)].

Fourth, many physicians are unfamiliar with the strategies that were used in large‐scale trials to manage and mitigate adverse effects of drug treatments, thereby, allowing uptitration to target doses. If clinically important hypotension occurs, it often does not recur with rechallenge at the same dose, and recurrences can be further minimized by downtitration of diuretics or the elimination of other drugs that can decrease blood pressure. Similarly, most increases in blood urea nitrogen should not prevent uptitration of neurohormonal antagonists, and azotaemia can be minimized by decreases in the dose of diuretics or discontinuation of other drugs that can worsen renal function. Increases in serum potassium were not considered actionable until the value exceeded 5.5 mmol/L, and the risk of hyperkalaemia can be mitigated by potassium‐binding agents. 42 Decreases in heart rate produced by beta‐blockers were not regarded as worrisome unless the heart rate declined to < 60 bpm. These strategies were essential to the treatment plan used to achieve target doses in the landmark clinical trials with neurohormonal antagonists. When these strategies are deployed, the highest tolerated subtarget dose yields survival benefits that approximate those produced by target doses. 28 Unfortunately, in clinical practice, asymptomatic hypotension and worsening renal function are important causes of underutilization of evidence‐based treatment. 43

Fifth, many physicians are reluctant to uptitrate drug treatments because they harbour personal fears that patients will not be able to tolerate the next increment in dose. Many physicians believe that medium and target doses are particularly likely to produce intolerable decreases in systolic blood pressure, worsening of renal function, or electrolyte disturbances. However, the most dramatic decreases in blood pressure with inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system and carvedilol are seen with the low starting dose, and subsequent changes in blood pressure with each dosing increment are comparatively modest. Furthermore, most occurrences of worsening of renal function are reflective of changes in intrarenal haemodynamics and not renal injury; and can be mitigated without a change in dosing. 44 Nevertheless, if drugs are not uptitrated because of physician fears, it is not possible to know whether the higher dose would have been well‐tolerated if the patient was not given the opportunity to receive it.

Beta-blocker–related hypotension — timing and management state that beta-blockers, especially those that also block alpha-1-receptors, can produce hypotension, and for beta-blockers that also block alpha-receptors, such as carvedilol, these vasodilatory side effects are generally seen within 24 to 48 hours of the first dose or the first increase in dose and usually subside with repeated dosing without any change in dose. Physicians may minimize the risk of hypotension by administering the beta-blocker and ACEI at different times during the day, and if this is ineffective, the occurrence of hypotension may require a temporary reduction in the dose of the ACEI. Hypotensive symptoms may also resolve after a decrease in the dose of diuretics in patients who are volume depleted, and if hypotension is accompanied by other clinical evidence of hypoperfusion, beta-blocker therapy should be decreased or discontinued pending further patient evaluation.

Second, physicians may recognize the inadequacy of low starting doses but may nonetheless believe that medium‐range doses provide most of the benefits of target doses. Theoretically, this premise would be true if medium‐range and high target doses were on the upper flat portion of the dose–response curve. Yet, in a clinical trials, higher doses have provided greater benefits than lower doses, 19, 20, 35, 36 and there is little evidence that medium‐range subtarget doses reduce the risk of death. Interestingly, the final step in the dose‐titration process to target doses may provide unexpectedly large survival benefits. In the COMET trial, 37 carvedilol (25 mg twice daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (50 mg twice daily) in a large double‐blind trial of > 3000 patients who were followed for nearly 5 years. At these doses, the heart rate reduction in the metoprolol group was within 1–2 bpm of that achieved in the carvedilol group, suggesting that metoprolol tartrate provided > 75% of the beta‐1 receptor blockade produced by carvedilol. 38 Yet, when compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was accompanied by a 20% lower risk of cardiovascular death. Since beta‐blockers reduce mortality by ≈30–35% when compared with placebo, 39 these observations suggest that more than half of the mortality reduction produced by target doses of beta‐blockers may be provided by the final step in the dose titration protocol. 40

2.2	 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED AND MONITORED DURING UP-TITRATION.

Treatment with COREG may be started as an inpatient or outpatient and should be started after the patient is hemodynamically stable and fluid retention has been minimized. It is recommended that COREG be started at 6.25 mg twice daily and increased after 3 to 10 days, based on tolerability, to 12.5 mg twice daily, then again to the target dose of 25 mg twice daily. A lower starting dose may be used (3.125 mg twice daily) and/or the rate of up-titration may be slowed if clinically indicated (e.g., due to low blood pressure or heart rate, or fluid retention). Patients should be maintained on lower doses if higher doses are not tolerated. The recommended dosing regimen need not be altered in patients who received treatment with an IV or oral β-blocker during the acute phase of the myocardial infarction.

2.3	Hypertension

DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED. The recommended starting dose of COREG is 6.25 mg twice daily. If this dose is tolerated, using standing systolic pressure measured about 1 hour after dosing as a guide, the dose should be maintained for 7 to 14 days, and then increased to 12.5 mg twice daily if needed, based on trough blood pressure, again using standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing as a guide for tolerance. This dose should also be maintained for 7 to 14 days and can then be adjusted upward to 25 mg twice daily if tolerated and needed. The full antihypertensive effect of COREG is seen within 7 to 14 days. Total daily dose should not exceed 50 mg.

Concomitant administration with a diuretic can be expected to produce additive effects and exaggerate the orthostatic component of carvedilol action.

### Effects of initiating carvedilol in patients with severe chronic heart failure: results from the COPERNICUS study [^111PWB3u]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Beta-blockers remain underused despite their established utility for improving outcome in heart failure. Concerns that initiation of treatment produces few immediate benefits and may have important risks may be deterring widespread use.

Objective

To evaluate the early effects of the beta-blocker carvedilol in patients with severe heart failure.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from October 28, 1997, to March 20, 2000, at 334 hospital centers in 21 countries among 2289 patients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or with minimal exertion who were clinically euvolemic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 25%.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive carvedilol, with start dosage of at 3.125 mg twice daily with uptitration to a target dosage of 25 mg twice daily (n = 1156), or placebo (n = 1133), in addition to their usual medications for heart failure.

Main Outcome Measures

Death, hospitalization, or permanent withdrawal from study drug, as well as adverse events during the first 8 weeks of treatment.

Results

The carvedilol group experienced no increase in cardiovascular risk but instead had fewer patients who died (19 vs 25; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.41–1.35); who died or were hospitalized (134 vs 153; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67–1.07); or who died, were hospitalized, or were permanently withdrawn from treatment (162 vs 188; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03). These effects were similar in direction and magnitude to those observed during the entire study, and were apparent particularly in the 624 patients with recent or recurrent decompensation or a very depressed left ventricular ejection fraction. Differences in favor of carvedilol became apparent as early as 14 to 21 days following initiation of treatment. Worsening heart failure was the only serious adverse event with a frequency greater than 2% and was reported with similar frequency in the placebo and carvedilol groups (6.4% vs 5.1%).

Conclusions

These data suggest that, in clinically euvolemic patients, the relation of benefit to risk during initiation of treatment with carvedilol is similar to that seen during long-term therapy with the drug. Our findings should provide the reassurance needed to encourage the high levels of use that are warranted by the results of long-term clinical trials.

Beta blockers — maintenance and relapse prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) with structural heart disease: beta blockers are generally not considered primary therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm, but evidence shows moderate efficacy, including a placebo-controlled study of 394 patients with persistent AF showing lower early recurrence and slower ventricular response with sustained-release metoprolol than placebo; two studies found atenolol and bisoprolol as effective as sotalol and better than placebo for reducing paroxysmal AF frequency and duration and relapse probability. In persistent AF, carvedilol and bisoprolol after cardioversion produced similar relapse reductions over 1 y, and an observational study noted reduced AF risk during an average follow-up of 3.2 y. These agents may be effective in postoperative patients but potentially aggravate vagally mediated AF.

HFrEF hospitalization — sequencing and dosing during GDMT initiation emphasize practical starting choices and available evidence. For patients with less robust blood pressure, "the first step may be a low dose of an ARB, with a potential switch to sacubitril/valsartan before discharge, once a low dose of beta-blocker has been tolerated (usually starting with metoprolol 6.25 mg twice per day or carvedilol 3.125 mg twice per day)". Evidence on sequence is limited; the historical CIBIS III "demonstrated no difference in overall outcomes… during the first 6 months", whereas "a small trial showed a higher achieved beta-blocker dose, lower heart rate, and greater increase in LVEF at 12 months when beta-blockers were started first". The document notes "The usual strategy aims for addition of all neurohormonal modulatory classes before any up-titration". In the European TRANSITION trial, "similar majorities of patients were on 49/51 mg to 97/103 mg twice-daily doses of sacubitril/valsartan at 10 weeks", regardless of timing relative to discharge, with higher doses in de novo HF, hypertension, and higher starting doses. It also states that U.S. experience shows discharge prescriptions increase maintenance and that "4-pillar GDMT has been shown to decrease recurrent HF events, reverse ventricular remodeling, and extend meaningful survival".

The protocol also specified that hospitalizations would be assessed. Fewer subjects on immediate-release carvedilol than on placebo were hospitalized for any reason (372 versus 432, P = 0.0029), for cardiovascular reasons (246 versus 314, P = 0.0003), or for worsening heart failure (198 versus 268, P = 0.0001).

Immediate-release carvedilol had a consistent and beneficial effect on all-cause mortality as well as the combined end points of all-cause mortality plus hospitalization (total, CV, or for heart failure) in the overall trial population and in all subgroups examined, including men and women, elderly and non-elderly, blacks and non-blacks, and diabetics and non-diabetics (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Effects on Mortality for Subgroups in COPERNICUS

Although the clinical trials used twice-daily dosing, clinical pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data provide a reasonable basis for concluding that once-daily dosing with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be adequate in the treatment of heart failure.

14.2 Left Ventricular Dysfunction following Myocardial Infarction

CAPRICORN was a double-blind trial comparing carvedilol and placebo in 1,959 subjects with a recent myocardial infarction (within 21 days) and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40%, with (47%) or without symptoms of heart failure. Subjects given carvedilol received 6.25 mg twice daily, titrated as tolerated to 25 mg twice daily. Subjects had to have a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, a sitting heart rate greater than 60 beats per minute, and no contraindication to beta-blocker use. Treatment of the index infarction included aspirin (85%), IV or oral beta-blockers (37%), nitrates (73%), heparin (64%), thrombolytics (40%), and acute angioplasty (12%). Background treatment included ACE inhibitors or angiotensin ­receptor blockers (97%), anticoagulants (20%), lipid-lowering agents (23%), and diuretics (34%). Baseline population characteristics included an average age of 63 years, 74% male, 95% Caucasian, mean blood pressure 121/74 mm Hg, 22% with diabetes, and 54% with a history of hypertension. Mean dosage achieved of carvedilol was 20 mg twice daily; mean duration of follow-up was 15 months.

### Relationship of β-blocker dose with outcomes in ambulatory heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction: results from the HF-ACTION (heart failure: a controlled trial investigating outcomes of exercise training) trial [^112pviup]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the association between baseline beta-blocker (BB) dose and outcomes in the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial.

Background

Beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction, but it is unclear whether titrating to higher BB doses improves outcomes in this setting.

Methods

The HF-ACTION trial was a randomized, multicenter trial enrolling 2,331 ambulatory HF patients with systolic dysfunction (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35) randomized to exercise training versus usual care, with median follow-up of 2.5 years. The BB dose at baseline was standardized with carvedilol equivalents and analyzed as a continuous variable and by discrete dose groups. The relationship between BB dose and the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization and other cardiovascular secondary endpoints was determined before and after adjustment for variables significantly associated with outcomes in the HF-ACTION cohort.

Results

Ninety-five percent of patients were receiving a BB. There was a significant inverse relationship between BB dose and all-cause death or hospitalization but not other cardiovascular endpoints after adjustment for other predictors of outcome, with a linear benefit up to the 50-mg daily dose. There was a significant association between BB dose and change in peak VO(2) at 3 months. There was no increase in bradycardia with higher doses of BB.

Conclusions

There was a significant inverse relationship between BB dose and the endpoint of all-cause death or all-cause hospitalization in this well-treated HF cohort with systolic dysfunction, supporting recommendations that titrating doses up to 50 mg/day might confer a benefit in such patients.

### Exchange of β-blockers in heart failure patients. experiences from the poststudy phase of COMET (the carvedilol or metoprolol European trial) [^116dE1gQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) reported a significant survival benefit for carvedilol, a beta1-, beta2- and alpha1-blocker, vs. metoprolol tartrate, a beta1-selective blocker, in patients with mild-to-severe chronic heart failure (CHF). Patients on treatment with metoprolol might benefit from switching to carvedilol.

Aim

To investigate the safety and tolerability of switching beta-blockers in CHF.

Methods

At the end of COMET, the Steering Committee recommended that study medication was stopped without unblinding, and patients were commenced on open-label beta-blockade at a dose equivalent to half the dose of blinded therapy, with subsequent titration to target or maximum tolerated dose. Patients were followed for 30 days.

Results

1321 out of 1440 patients were transitioned to open-label treatment (76.8% to carvedilol). Serious adverse and CHF-related events were respectively 9.4% and 4.7% in those switching from carvedilol to metoprolol and 3.1% and 1.5% in patients switching from metoprolol to carvedilol. Patients who switched from carvedilol to metoprolol showed the highest mortality or hospitalisation rate (12.3%) in comparison with those who switched from metoprolol to carvedilol (3.1%, p < 0.001) or who stayed on the same drug (carvedilol: 2.5%, p < 0.001; metoprolol: 4.2%, p = 0.04). Reducing the initial dose of the second beta-blocker maximised the safety of this strategy. Event rate was higher in patients with more severe heart failure and in those withdrawing from beta-blockade.

Conclusion

Our data show that switching beta-blockers is a practical, safe and well-tolerated strategy to optimise treatment of CHF. Patients who switched to carvedilol showed the lowest rate of adverse events. A closer clinical monitoring is recommended during transition in high-risk patients.

### Changes in heart rate variability are correlated to hemodynamic improvement with chronic CARVEDILOL therapy in heart failure [^115A1uwh]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to predict mortality in heart failure (CHF). The relationship between improved cardiac function and improvement in HRV has not been previously studied.

Methods and Results

This was substudy of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial of carvedilol of four months duration. Analysis of HRV was performed on 24-hour Holter monitors obtained at baseline and completion of study. All subjects had symptomatic CHF and an left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 0.35. Study medication was titrated over 1 month to 50 mg/day (≤ 75 kg) or 100 mg/day (< 75 kg). A total of 17 subjects were randomized to carvedilol and 12 to placebo. Treatment with carvedilol was associated with significant increases in total frequency power, very low frequency power, high frequency power, SDNN, the root-mean square of difference of successive RRs, and pNN50. Change in time and frequency domain measures of HRV had a positive correlation with change in LVEF and negative correlation with change in coronary sinus norepinephrine levels.

Conclusion

Carvedilol therapy in patients with CHF significantly increased HRV. Change in HRV correlates to improved hemodynamics. This suggests that carvedilol therapy partially normalizes autonomic modulation of heart rate in patients with CHF.

### Practical guidelines to optimize effectiveness of β-blockade in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure [^114UL57Z]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Antiadrenergic therapy reduces the risks of death and major morbidity in patients postinfarction and in those with chronic heart failure. Despite the common perception, these benefits are not attributable to a class effect, and clinical trials reveal evidence of specific agents that provide clinical advantages. To optimize patient outcome in the postinfarction setting, propranolol or timolol should be used in the setting of preserved ventricular function, and carvedilol should be used in patients with impaired ventricular function, with or without clinical evidence of heart failure. Patients with chronic heart failure are at lower risk of death when treated with carvedilol, which is also associated with a lower incidence of developing diabetes mellitus-related adverse events. This article reviews the scientific evidence for the hierarchy of antiadrenergic agents and addresses practical issues associated with initiation of therapy and long-term management.

### Effect of carvedilol on the morbidity of patients with severe chronic heart failure: results of the carvedilol prospective randomized cumulative survival (COPERNICUS) study [^1174zLtX]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blocking agents improve functional status and reduce morbidity in mild-to-moderate heart failure, but it is not known whether they produce such benefits in severe heart failure.

Methods and Results

We randomly assigned 2289 patients with symptoms of heart failure at rest or on minimal exertion and with an ejection fraction < 25% (but not volume-overloaded) to double-blind treatment with either placebo (n = 1133) or carvedilol (n = 1156) for an average of 10.4 months. Carvedilol reduced the combined risk of death or hospitalization for a cardiovascular reason by 27% (P = 0.00002) and the combined risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure by 31% (P = 0.000004). Patients in the carvedilol group also spent 27% fewer days in the hospital for any reason (P = 0.0005) and 40% fewer days in the hospital for heart failure (P < 0.0001). These differences were as a result of both a decrease in the number of hospitalizations and a shorter duration of each admission. More patients felt improved and fewer patients felt worse in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group after 6 months of maintenance therapy (P = 0.0009). Carvedilol-treated patients were also less likely than placebo-treated patients to experience a serious adverse event (P = 0.002), especially worsening heart failure, sudden death, cardiogenic shock, or ventricular tachycardia.

Conclusion

In euvolemic patients with symptoms at rest or on minimal exertion, the addition of carvedilol to conventional therapy ameliorates the severity of heart failure and reduces the risk of clinical deterioration, hospitalization, and other serious adverse clinical events.

### Effect of carvedilol on survival in severe chronic heart failure [^1137JVWd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Beta-blocking agents reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure, but little is known about their effects in severe heart failure.

Methods

We evaluated 2289 patients who had symptoms of heart failure at rest or on minimal exertion, who were clinically euvolemic, and who had an ejection fraction of less than 25 percent. In a double-blind fashion, we randomly assigned 1133 patients to placebo and 1156 patients to treatment with carvedilol for a mean period of 10.4 months, during which standard therapy for heart failure was continued. Patients who required intensive care, had marked fluid retention, or were receiving intravenous vasodilators or positive inotropic drugs were excluded.

Results

There were 190 deaths in the placebo group and 130 deaths in the carvedilol group. This difference reflected a 35 percent decrease in the risk of death with carvedilol (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 48 percent; P = 0.00013, unadjusted; P = 0.0014, adjusted for interim analyses). A total of 507 patients died or were hospitalized in the placebo group, as compared with 425 in the carvedilol group. This difference reflected a 24 percent decrease in the combined risk of death or hospitalization with carvedilol (95 percent confidence interval, 13 to 33 percent; P < 0.001). The favorable effects on both end points were seen consistently in all the subgroups we examined, including patients with a history of recent or recurrent cardiac decompensation. Fewer patients in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group withdrew because of adverse effects or for other reasons (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

The previously reported benefits of carvedilol with regard to morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure were also apparent in the patients with severe heart failure who were evaluated in this trial.

### Reasons for guideline nonadherence at heart failure discharge [^114YXL8R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Since the publication of the first coronary artery disease guidelines in the early 1960s, cardiology has been a leader in the development of clinical guidelines. 1 In mid‐1990s, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology published the first clinical guidelines for heart failure (HF). 2, 3 Based in large part on the results of the SOLVD (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction), 4 SAVE (Survival and Ventricular Enlargement), 5 CONSENSUS (Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study), 6 COPERNICUS (Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Study), 7 MERIT‐HR (Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure), 8 and CIBIS‐II (Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II) 9 trials, HF guidelines have consistently focused on the benefits of neurohormonal therapy to delay progression and improve survival for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). More recent guidelines have also included emphasis on the importance of achieving and maintaining decongestion regardless of ejection fraction. 10, 11, 12

### Relationships among achieved heart rate, β-blocker dose and long-term outcomes in patients with heart failure with atrial fibrillation [^111E3jWi]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

We compared means of continuous variables with the Wilcoxon rank-sum, and proportions with Fisher's exact test. We dichotomised β-blocker dose at ≥ 25 mg/day carvedilol equivalent, corresponding to ≥ 50% of the target dose (calculations are outlined in online supplementary table S1), and heart rate at ≥ 70 bpm as previously established by Fiuzat et al. We plotted unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves stratified by β-blocker and heart rate groups. We then used multivariable-adjusted Cox models to estimate the associations between discharge β-blocker dose and/or achieved heart rate with the primary composite outcome, as well as the individual secondary outcomes. We tested the proportional hazards assumption with Schoenfeld residuals. All models were constructed separately for HFrEF and HFpEF groups, and were adjusted for age, sex, admission heart rate, LVEF, and all comorbidities, medications, and laboratory values reported in table 1. We assessed for associations between admission heart rate or change in heart rate during hospitalisation with outcomes. We used a stepwise backwards elimination method to develop a parsimonious final model, we excluded variables with the weakest association until only variables significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the outcome remained. We forced age, sex, β-blocker dose and achieved heart rate to remain in the model regardless of significance. We assessed for interactions between variables in the final model and our candidate variables with no significant interactions identified. Two-sided p values < 0.05 defined statistical significance, and all analyses were performed using Stata V.13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling:

Worsening angina or myocardial infarction [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
Worsening heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].
Worsening AV block [see Contraindications (4)].

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates.

Hypertension and Angina: Most adverse reactions have been mild and transient. The most common (> 2%) adverse reactions are tiredness, dizziness, depression, diarrhea, shortness of breath, bradycardia, and rash.

Heart Failure: In the MERIT-HF study comparing TOPROL-XL in daily doses up to 200 mg (mean dose 159 mg once-daily; n = 1990) to placebo (n = 2001), 10.3% of TOPROL-XL patients discontinued for adverse reactions vs. 12.2% of placebo patients.

The table below lists adverse reactions in the MERIT-HF study that occurred at an incidence of ≥ 1% in the TOPROL-XL group and greater than placebo by more than 0.5%, regardless of the assessment of causality.

Post-operative Adverse Events: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 8351 patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic disease undergoing non-vascular surgery and who were not taking beta–blocker therapy, TOPROL-XL 100 mg was started 2 to 4 hours prior to surgery then continued for 30 days at 200 mg per day. TOPROL-XL use was associated with a higher incidence of bradycardia (6.6% vs. 2.4%; HR, 2.74; 95% CI 2.19, 3.43), hypotension (15% vs. 9.7%; HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.37, 1.74), stroke (1.0% vs. 0.5%; HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.26, 3.74) and death (3.1% vs. 2.3%; HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03, 1.74) compared to placebo.

### Role of in-hospital initiation of carvedilol to improve treatment rates and clinical outcomes [^1167rYKk]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with heart failure face a very high risk of hospitalization and mortality. Despite compelling scientific evidence that beta-blockers reduce hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure, this lifesaving therapy continues to be underused. Studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with heart failure are not receiving treatment with this guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapy when physicians are guided by conventional care. A similar treatment gap has been documented for lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. It has been demonstrated that initiation of lipid-lowering and other cardiovascular protective medications before hospital discharge for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes. This has led to national guidelines being revised to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Recent studies demonstrate that carvedilol can be safely and effectively initiated in patients with heart failure before hospital discharge and that this improves clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of carvedilol as the standard of care for patients hospitalized with heart failure could dramatically improve treatment rates-thus substantially reducing the risk of future hospitalizations and prolonging life in the many patients with heart failure hospitalized each year.

### Carvedilol phosphate [^113Z4HZo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

In clinical trials of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules in subjects with hypertension (338 subjects) and in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction or heart failure (187 subjects), the profile of adverse events observed with carvedilol phosphate was generally similar to that observed with the administration of immediate-release carvedilol. Therefore, the information included within this section is based on data from controlled clinical trials with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules as well as immediate-release carvedilol tablets.

This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.

Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsule contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people.

5.1 Cessation of Therapy

Patients with coronary artery disease, who are being treated with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients with angina following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. The last 2 complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris. As with other beta-blockers, when discontinuation of carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. Carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules should be discontinued over 1 to 2 weeks whenever possible. If the angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue therapy with carvedilol phosphate extended-release capsules abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension or heart failure.

### Predischarge initiation of carvedilol in patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure [^115MYhu4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The use of beta-blockers for the treatment of heart failure in the United States is inadequate, despite available data and current guidelines that support their use. The Initiation Management Predischarge: Process for Assessment of Carvedilol Therapy for Heart Failure (IMPACT-HF) study was designed to determine whether initiation of beta-blockade before hospital discharge is safe and effective in improving the 60-day use of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure. IMPACT-HF compared the strategy of the initiation of carvedilol before patients were discharged versus usual care (Heart Failure Society of America guidelines recommend waiting 2 to 4 weeks after hospitalization for heart failure before initiating beta-blocker therapy) in 363 randomized patients with heart failure. The entry criteria were non-restrictive to ensure inclusion of patients reflective of the general heart failure population. The primary end point of the study (the number of patients treated with any beta-blocker at 60 days) was statistically significantly higher in the predischarge group versus the postdischarge group (91.2% vs 73.4%, respectively). Based on the study's results, predischarge initiation may be a successful strategy to improve the use of beta-blocker therapy for patients with heart failure.

### Multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I-guided combination angiotensin receptor blockade and beta-blocker therapy to prevent anthracycline cardiotoxicity: the cardiac CARE trial [^112EnrM8]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Randomization and Intervention

After enrollment and a baseline cardiac magnetic resonance scan, cardiac troponin concentrations were measured before each cycle of anthracycline. Patients could be randomized from cycle 2 to cycle 6. Treatment allocation was by dynamic 1:1 randomization with minimization for prognostic factors: (1) age ≥ 65 or < 65 years; (2) baseline LVEF ≥ 60% or < 60%; and (3) planned cumulative epirubicin equivalent dose 300 or > 300 mg/m 2. Cardiac troponin concentration thresholds that triggered randomization were ≥ 5 ng/L for cycle 2 and ≥ 23 ng/L for cycles 3 to 6. These thresholds were defined in a previous study as identifying patients most likely to develop myocardial injury on completion of the course of chemotherapy. Nonrandomized participants were treated with standard care.

The trial intervention consisted of candesartan started at 8 mg daily and increased to 16 and 32 mg daily, and carvedilol was started at 6.25 mg twice daily and was increased to 12.5 and 25 mg twice daily. Combination candesartan and carvedilol therapy was dispensed within 14 days of randomization and continued until completion or withdrawal from the study. Dose restrictions and modifications were performed according to blood pressure, heart rate, and renal function.

Beta blockers — recommendations in chronic coronary disease (CCD) specify the following: In patients with CCD and LVEF ≤ 40% with or without previous MI, beta‑blocker therapy is recommended to reduce future MACE, including cardiovascular death (COR 1, LOE A). In patients with CCD and LVEF ≤ 50%, sustained release metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, or bisoprolol with titration to target doses is recommended in preference to other beta blockers (COR 1, LOE A). In patients with CCD started on beta‑blockers for previous MI without a history of or current LVEF ≤ 50%, angina, arrhythmias, or uncontrolled hypertension, it may be reasonable to reassess the indication for long‑term (> 1 year) therapy for reducing MACE (COR 2b, LOE B‑NR). In patients with CCD without previous MI or LVEF ≤ 50%, beta‑blocker therapy is not beneficial for reducing MACE in the absence of another primary indication (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B‑NR).

### Effect of β-blocker cessation on chronotropic incompetence and exercise tolerance in patients with advanced heart failure [^111aeKEA]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chronotropic incompetence is defined as the inability to reach 80% of heart rate (HR) reserve or 80% of the maximally predicted HR during exercise. The presence of chronotropic incompetence is associated with reduced peak oxygen consumption, and rate-responsive pacing therapy is under investigation to improve exercise capacity in heart failure (HF). However, uncertainty exists about whether chronotropic incompetence and reduced exercise tolerance in HF are attributable to β-blockade.

Methods and Results

Subjects with HF and receiving long-term β-blocker therapy underwent cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance testing under 2 conditions in random sequence: (1) after a 27-hour washout period (Off-BB) and (2) 3 hours after β-blocker ingestion (On-BB). Norepinephrine levels were drawn at rest and at peak exercise. β1-response to norepinephrine was assessed using the chronotropic responsiveness index: ΔHR/Δlog norepinephrine. Nineteen patients with systolic HF (left ventricular ejection fraction, 22.8 ± 7.7%) were enrolled. Mean age was 49.4 ± 12.3 years. Average carvedilol equivalent dose was 29.1 ± 17.0 mg daily. Peak HR off/on β-blockers was 62.7 ± 18.7% and 51.4 ± 18.2% HR reserve (P < 0.01) and 79.1 ± 11.0% and 70.3 ± 12.3% maximally predicted HR (P < 0.01). For the Off-BB and On-BB conditions, the respiratory exchange ratios were 1.05 ± 0.06 and 1.05 ± 0.10 (P = 0.77), respectively, confirming maximal and near identical effort in both conditions. The peak oxygen consumption was 16.6 ± 3.34 and 15.9 ± 3.31 mL/kg/min (P = 0.03), and the chronotropic responsiveness index was 19.3 ± 7.2 and 16.2 ± 7.1 (P = 0.18).

Conclusions

Acute β-blocker cessation does not normalize the chronotropic response to exercise in patients with advanced HF and chronotropic incompetence.

### Discharge heart rate and β-blocker dose in patients hospitalized with heart failure: findings from the OPTIMIZE-HF registry [^115yTZr7]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated heart rate of ≥ 70 beats/min despite β-blocker use may represent a new treatment target in patients in sinus rhythm with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, little is known about the proportion of patients with elevated heart rate despite β-blocker therapy.

Methods

We analyzed data from a large clinical registry to describe discharge heart rate as a function of β-blocker use and dose. We included patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% who were admitted with acute heart failure in 2003 and 2004; we excluded patients with a history of atrial arrhythmia or with a pacemaker or cardiac resynchronization therapy. We considered the β-blockers carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, atenolol, and metoprolol tartrate and described discharge dose as a percentage of target dose (ie, < 25%, 25%-49%, 50%-99%, and ≥ 100%).

Results

Among 10,696 patients, median discharge heart rate was 76 beats/min (interquartile range [IQR] 66–86 beats/min). Of these, 7,826 (73%) were discharged on a β-blocker. For patients not on a β-blocker, median discharge heart rate was 80 beats/min (IQR 70–89 beats/min), compared with 78 beats/min (IQR 69–88 beats/min) on < 25% of target dose, 75 beats/min (IQR 66–85 beats/min) on 25% to 49% of target dose, 74 beats/min (IQR 66–82 beats/min) on 50% to 99% of target dose, and 72 beats/min (IQR 65% to 80%) on 100% of target dose or greater (P < .001). Most patients, 7,647 (71%), had a discharge heart rate of ≥ 70 beats/min, including 1,460 (63%) of 2,301 patients discharged on 50% of target dose or greater.

Conclusions

Despite treatment with β-blockers, a substantial proportion of patients hospitalized with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction have elevated heart rate at discharge.

### Carvedilol, arginine (hypertenevide-12.5) [^117E5Hec]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

The following adverse events were reported with a frequency of greater then 1% but less than or equal to 3% and more frequently with carvedilol: Flu syndrome, cerebrovascular accident, peripheral vascular disorder, hypotonia, depression, gastrointestinal pain, arthritis, and gout. The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar in both groups of patients. In this database, the only cause of discontinuation greater than 1%, and occurring more often on carvedilol was hypotension (1.5% on carvedilol, 0.2% on placebo).

Hypertension: Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in hypertension in more than 2,193 patients in US clinical trials and in 2,976 patients in international clinical trials.

Approximately 36% of the total treated population received carvedilol for at least 6 months. Most adverse events reported during therapy with carvedilol were of mild to moderate severity. In US controlled clinical trials directly comparing carvedilol in doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,142) to placebo (n = 462), 4.9% of patients receiving carvedilol discontinued for adverse events versus 5.2% of placebo patients. Although there was no overall difference in discontinuation rates, discontinuations were more common in the carvedilol group for postural hypotension (1% versus 0). The overall incidence of adverse events in US placebo-controlled trials increased with increasing dose of carvedilol. For individual adverse events this could only be distinguished for dizziness, which increased in frequency from 2% to 5% as total daily dose increased from 6.25 mg to 50 mg.

COREG CR was evaluated for safety in an 8-week double-blind trial in 337 subjects with essential hypertension. The profile of adverse events observed with COREG CR was generally similar to that observed with immediate-release carvedilol. The overall rates of discontinuations due to adverse events were similar between COREG CR and placebo.

Table 3. Adverse Events (%) Occurring More Frequently with COREG CR than with Placebo in Subjects with Hypertension (Incidence ≥ 1% in Subjects Treated with Carvedilol, Regardless of Causality)

The following information describes the safety experience in hypertension with immediate-release carvedilol.

Carvedilol has been evaluated for safety in hypertension in more than 2,193 subjects in US clinical trials and in 2,976 subjects in international clinical trials. Approximately 36% of the total treated population received carvedilol for at least 6 months. In general, carvedilol was well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg daily. Most adverse events reported during carvedilol therapy were of mild to moderate severity. In US controlled clinical trials directly comparing carvedilol monotherapy in doses up to 50 mg (n = 1,142) with placebo (n = 462), 4.9% of carvedilol subjects discontinued for adverse events versus 5.2% of placebo subjects. Although there was no overall difference in discontinuation rates, discontinuations were more common in the carvedilol group for postural hypotension (1% versus 0). The overall incidence of adverse events in US placebo‑controlled trials was found to increase with increasing dose of carvedilol. For individual adverse events this could only be distinguished for dizziness, which increased in frequency from 2% to 5% as total daily dose increased from 6.25 mg to 50 mg as single or divided doses.

### Carvedilol for children and adolescents with heart failure: a randomized controlled trial [^1162UYWu]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although beta-blockers improve symptoms and survival in adults with heart failure, little is known about these medications in children and adolescents.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate the effects of carvedilol in children and adolescents with symptomatic systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 161 children and adolescents with symptomatic systolic heart failure from 26 US centers. In addition to treatment with conventional heart failure medications, patients were assigned to receive placebo or carvedilol. Enrollment began in June 2000 and the last dose was given in May 2005 (each patient received medication for 8 months).

Interventions

Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to twice-daily dosing with placebo, low-dose carvedilol (0.2 mg/kg per dose if weight < 62.5 kg or 12.5 mg per dose if weight ≥ 62.5 kg), or high-dose carvedilol (0.4 mg/kg per dose if weight < 62.5 kg or 25 mg per dose if weight ≥ 62.5 kg) and were stratified according to whether each patient's systemic ventricle was a left ventricle or not.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was a composite measure of heart failure outcomes in patients receiving carvedilol (low- and high-dose combined) vs placebo. Secondary efficacy variables included individual components of this composite, echocardiographic measures, and plasma b-type natriuretic peptide levels.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the composite end point based on the percentage of patients who improved, worsened, or were unchanged. Among 54 patients assigned to placebo, 30 improved (56%), 16 worsened (30%), and 8 were unchanged (15%); among 103 patients assigned to carvedilol, 58 improved (56%), 25 worsened (24%), and 20 were unchanged (19%). The rates of worsening were lower than expected. The odds ratio for worsened outcome for patients in the combined carvedilol group vs the placebo group was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.36–1.59; p = 0.47). A prespecified subgroup analysis noted significant interaction between treatment and ventricular morphology (P = .02), indicating a possible differential effect of treatment between patients with a systemic left ventricle (beneficial trend) and those whose systemic ventricle was not a left ventricle (nonbeneficial trend).

Conclusions

These preliminary results suggest that carvedilol does not significantly improve clinical heart failure outcomes in children and adolescents with symptomatic systolic heart failure. However, given the lower than expected event rates, the trial may have been underpowered. There may be a differential effect of carvedilol in children and adolescents based on ventricular morphology.

Cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy — preemptive pharmacotherapy during cancer treatment: Whether the preemptive use of ACEi+ARB, spironolactone, or selected beta blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol is effective in reducing risk has been investigated in small trials with conflicting findings, with the most supportive study randomizing 114 patients with a posttreatment troponin rise > 0.07 ng/mL to enalapril or placebo. None of the patients in the enalapril arm met the primary endpoint (< 10% decrease in LVEF to below 50%), while 43% of patients in the standard of care group had a significant decrease in LVEF; although other studies have shown similar findings, the difference in LVEF between arms was often small (< 5%) and of questionable clinical significance, and none of the studies have assessed whether preemptive use of HF therapies improves clinical outcomes.

### Prognostic benefits of carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol controlled release / extended release in hemodialysis patients with heart failure: a 10-year cohort [^1162y2ZV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is known to be a highly prevalent cardiovascular complication among patients receiving long‐term hemodialysis (HD). 1 The current treatment guidelines for HF, which include those provided by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology, recommend the use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs) as a means of improving the general survival rates for all patients. 2, 3 These 2 sets of guidelines also recommend the use of carvedilol, bisoprolol, or metoprolol controlled release (CR)/extended release (XL), in addition to an ACEI or ARB, as a means of improving HF symptoms and a potential survival benefit. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Indeed, in patients with HF symptoms, the European Society of Cardiology further recommends administering 1 of the 3 β‐blockers as the initial therapy, followed by the use of an ACEI or ARB. 3, 10, 11 Among the general population as a whole, the most compelling evidence on survival in cases of severe chronic HF is provided by the use of carvedilol, followed by bisoprolol and metoprolol CR/XL. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

Cardiovascular — Tachycardia with a Pulse (A-FIB rate control and anticoagulation considerations): A-FIB rarely requires cardioversion in the field and the risk of stroke needs to be considered prior to cardioversion. Amiodarone or procainamide can be used as a rate-controlling agent for patients who are intolerant of or unresponsive to other agents, and caution should be exercised in those who are not receiving anticoagulation, as amiodarone can promote cardioversion. Administer metoprolol to patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 120 mmHg, noting that worsening congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, as well as hypotension and bradycardia can occur with use of metoprolol.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^116LtvZ9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-4: Beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — The performance measure defines the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge. The numerator is patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge, where outpatient includes a prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking a beta blocker, and inpatient includes a prescription at discharge or documentation to continue therapy after discharge; beta-blocker therapy should include bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions for documentation of medical reason(s) (e.g., intolerance) or patient reason(s) (e.g., patient refusal) for not prescribing beta-blocker therapy. Rationale states that beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization for patients with stable heart failure and reduced LVEF, and treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with reduced LVEF and does not have prohibitively low systemic blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Clinical recommendations cited are that use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), and that initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents; therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients, with caution when patients have required inotropes during their hospital course (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

2018 ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — transient/reversible causes of sinus node dysfunction (SND) states that patients presenting with symptomatic SND secondary to a reversible cause should first be managed by directing the therapy at eliminating or mitigating the offending condition (COR I, LOE C-EO). When sinus bradycardia is the consequence of nonessential medications, permanent cardiac pacing should not be considered a first-line treatment, and withdrawal of the offending drug or dosage reduction can improve the heart rate and symptoms; medications are frequent culprits, including negative chronotropic drugs such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. Additional reversible contributors noted include hypothyroidism with cardiovascular abnormalities that respond to thyroxine, metabolic abnormalities such as severe systemic acidosis or hypokalemia in acute settings, and other treatable conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure, acute MI, severe hypothermia, and obstructive sleep apnea.

### Minimization or withdrawal of oral pharmacotherapy in chronic heart failure patients with improved myocardial function: a systematic review [^114hJgir]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The necessity of lifelong treatment and polypharmacy in chronic heart failure (HF) patients with improved myocardial function remains debated. This systematic review aims to synthesize current literature regarding this issue.

Methods and Results

A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the inception to 18 October 2024. Seven studies (n = 552) reporting minimization or withdrawal of pharmacotherapy in chronic HF patients with improved ejection fraction or stable New York Heart Association status were included. Findings were heterogeneous due to variations in study design and protocols. Loop diuretic withdrawal was favoured by one non-randomized study (n = 26) and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 188). Minimization of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (n = 77) or withdrawal of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) (n = 70) was not favourable. Carvedilol monotherapy was favoured by one small-sample RCT (n = 60). One RCT (n = 51) reported a high overall relapse rate (65%) following multiple drug withdrawal in recovered patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Another RCT (n = 80) found a low occurrence of cardiac dimensional deterioration (7.5%) following multiple drug withdrawal in post-cardiac resynchronization therapy patients with normalized ejection fraction. However, 28% required drug re-initiation due to cardiac comorbidities.

Conclusion

The existing evidence on minimizing or withdrawing oral pharmacotherapy in chronic HF patients with improved myocardial function remains very limited and heterogeneous, supporting only loop diuretic withdrawal and possibly carvedilol monotherapy, but not the minimization or withdrawal of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, MRA, or the combination of HF medications. Large RCTs are needed to determine the appropriate treatment strategy.

Class III antiarrhythmic agent — sotalol dosing and safety: initial dose is 40–80 mg every 12 h, and patients initiated or reinitiated on sotalol should be in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for a minimum of 3 d; it is contraindicated if the QTc interval is > 450 ms. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) should be calculated before dosing; if CrCl > 60 mL/min, dose twice daily; if CrCl 40–60 mL/min, every 24 h; if CrCl < 40 mL/min, it should not be used. The maintenance dose is 160 mg every 12 h; during initiation and titration the QT interval should be checked 2–4 h after each dose and if QT interval prolongs to ≥ 500 ms, the dose must be reduced or the drug discontinued. Adverse effects include QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, bradycardia, and bronchospasm; precautions list prolonged QT, renal dysfunction, hypokalemia, diuretic therapy, avoiding other QT‑prolonging drugs, sinus or AV nodal dysfunction, decompensated systolic HF, cardiogenic shock, reactive airway disease, and drugs with SA and/or AV–nodal blocking properties.

### Tolerability of β-blocker initiation and titration in the metoprolol CR / XL randomized intervention trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF) [^1143iKBD]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

beta-Blockade improves survival when administered over a long period of time to patients with heart failure. However, the time course of any possible deterioration during the titration phase has not been reported.

Methods and Results

We looked at evidence of clinical deterioration in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) by analyzing events and symptoms during the first 90 days. During titration, the Kaplan-Meier curves for the combined end point of all-cause mortality/all-cause hospitalization were similar in all patients randomized, with no significant difference in favor of placebo at any visit or in any of the analyzed subgroups (New York Heart Association class II, III/IV, or III/IV with ejection fraction < 0.25, heart rate less-than-or-equal 76 bpm, and systolic blood pressure less-than-or-equal 120 mm Hg). The curves started to diverge in favor of beta-blockade after 60 days. Low heart rate was the main factor that limited titration. In New York Heart Association class III/IV, 5.9% of the patients receiving placebo discontinued study medicine during the first 90 days compared with 8.1% of those receiving metoprolol CR/XL (P = 0.037 unadjusted, P = NS adjusted); corresponding figures in those with New York Heart Association class III/IV and ejection fraction < 0.25 were 7.1% and 8.0% (P = NS). From day 90 until the end of the study, more patients in the placebo group discontinued study medicine in all subgroups. There was no change in diuretic or ACE inhibitor dosing with beta-blocker titration. Most patients reported no change in symptoms of breathlessness or fatigue during the titration phase.

Conclusions

When carefully titrated, metoprolol CR/XL can be given safely to the overwhelming majority of patients with stable mild to moderate heart failure, with minimal side effects or deterioration.

### Heart rate or beta-blocker dose? Association with outcomes in ambulatory Heart failure patients with Systolic dysfunction: results from the HF-ACTION trial [^116moDLX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare whether reduced heart rate (HR) or higher beta-blocker (BB) dose affected outcomes to a greater extent in the HF-ACTION (Heart Failure: A Controlled Trial Investigating Outcomes of Exercise Training) trial population.

Background

Recent data have shown that HR is an important modifiable factor in reducing mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. It has also been shown that titration of doses of BBs improves outcomes of morbidity and mortality in chronic HF patients with reduced ejection fraction. We aimed to compare whether reduced HR or higher BB dose affected outcomes to a greater extent in the HF-ACTION trial population.

Methods

HF-ACTION was a randomized, multicenter trial enrolling 2,331 ambulatory HF patients with systolic dysfunction (New York Heart Association functional class II to IV, left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.35) randomized to exercise training versus usual care, with median follow-up of 2.5 years. BB dose at baseline was standardized by use of carvedilol equivalents. BB dose and HR were analyzed by discrete groups (higher/lower dose; higher/lower HR). The relationship of BB dose, HR, and the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization and other cardiovascular secondary endpoints were determined before and after adjustment for variables found to be significantly associated with outcome in the HF-ACTION cohort.

Results

There was a significant inverse relationship between either BB dose (higher was better) or HR (lower was better) and all-cause death or hospitalization in unadjusted analysis; however, only BB dose was significant for improved mortality outcomes. After adjustment for other predictors of outcome, only BB dose remained significant for improving all-cause death or hospitalization. BB dose, but not HR, was associated with improved outcomes of other cardiovascular endpoints in unadjusted analysis but did not remain significant when adjusted for other predictors of outcome in this cohort.

Conclusions

There were more associated improvements in outcomes with higher BB dose than with reduced HR in this well-treated HF cohort with systolic dysfunction, which suggests that titration of BB doses may confer a greater benefit than reduction of HR in such patients.

Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.2 Treatment intervention and visits

Following screening (visit 0) and randomization (visit 1) visits, the procedures across treatment arms are:

‐A‐arm: Patients allocated to this arm are instructed to reduce by half the dose of beta‐blocker (Figure 1). The patients will be advised for potential adverse effects and instructed to contact with outpatient's clinics of HF if any adverse effect occurs. Patients will be checked in 3 days (visit 2) by a cardiologist. If clinically stable, the patients are instructed to withdraw the beta‐blocker and repeat all the procedures of the study at 15 days (visit 3). After visit 3, the patients initiate the previous half dose of beta‐blockers. Patients are visited at 18 days (visit 4). If clinically stable, the patient will increase to the previous dose of the beta‐blocker and repeat all the examination tests at 30 days (visit 5).

‐B‐arm: Patients allocated to this arm will continue with the same treatment and revisited 3 days after (visit 2) (Figure 1). All of the study procedures repeated at 15 days (visit 3), and, after them, the patients are instructed to reduce by the half dose of beta‐blocker. Likewise, the patients are advised for potential adverse effects and instructed to contact outpatient HF‐clinics of HF if any adverse effect occurs. Patients are revisited in 3 days (at 18 days, visit 4), and if clinically stable, the patient withdraws the beta‐blocker and repeats all the examination tests at 30 days (visit 5).

At visit 5, the responsible cardiologist will assess all the examination test and individually decide the convenience of beta‐blockers reintroduction or withdrawal in both arms. A cardiologist of the HF‐unit will clinically evaluate all patients at 60‐day after randomization (visit 6). Additional visits will be permitted according to the patient's clinical status and will be registered.

### Perioperative β-blockers for preventing surgery-related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing cardiac surgery [^116WU4oj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of beta-blockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in unselected patients remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative beta-blockers in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update and assesses the evidence in cardiac surgery only.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered beta-blockers for the prevention of surgery-related mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing cardiac surgery.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backward- and forward-citation searching of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs and quasi-randomized studies comparing beta-blockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing cardiac surgery. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a beta-blocker, and studies in which beta-blockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 63 studies with 7768 participants; six studies were quasi-randomized and the remaining were RCTs. All participants were undergoing cardiac surgery, and in most studies, at least some of the participants were previously taking beta-blockers. Types of beta-blockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, esmolol, landiolol, acebutolol, timolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and atenolol. In twelve studies, beta-blockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in nine studies this was before surgery, in 20 studies during surgery, and in the remaining studies beta-blockers were started postoperatively. Overall, we found that most studies did not report sufficient details for us to adequately assess risk of bias. In particular, few studies reported methods used to randomize participants to groups. In some studies, participants in the control group were given beta-blockers as rescue therapy during the study period, and all studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the open-label study design. No studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. We judged 68% studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Study authors reported few deaths (7 per 1000 in both the intervention and control groups), and we found low-certainty evidence that beta-blockers may make little or no difference to all-cause mortality at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.90; 29 studies, 4099 participants). For myocardial infarctions, we found no evidence of a difference in events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 25 studies, 3946 participants; low-certainty evidence). Few study authors reported cerebrovascular events, and the evidence was uncertain (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.67; 5 studies, 1471 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Based on a control risk of 54 per 1000, we found low-certainty evidence that beta-blockers may reduce episodes of ventricular arrhythmias by 32 episodes per 1000 (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63; 12 studies, 2296 participants). For atrial fibrillation or flutter, there may be 163 fewer incidences with beta-blockers, based on a control risk of 327 incidences per 1000 (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; 40 studies, 5650 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the evidence for bradycardia and hypotension was less certain. We found that beta-blockers may make little or no difference to bradycardia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.91; 12 studies, 1640 participants; low-certainty evidence), or hypotension (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.80; 10 studies, 1538 participants; low-certainty evidence). We used GRADE to downgrade the certainty of evidence. Owing to studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain, we downgraded each outcome for study limitations. Based on effect size calculations in the previous review, we found an insufficient number of participants in all outcomes (except atrial fibrillation) and, for some outcomes, we noted a wide confidence interval; therefore, we also downgraded outcomes owing to imprecision. The evidence for atrial fibrillation and length of hospital stay had a moderate level of statistical heterogeneity which we could not explain, and we, therefore, downgraded these outcomes for inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of a difference in early all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, hypotension and bradycardia. However, there may be a reduction in atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias when beta-blockers are used. A larger sample size is likely to increase the certainty of this evidence. Four studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^114hmNpo]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

What drug treatments should be considered essential to the management of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction?

Accordingly, for purposes of the present review, the treatments that are considered to be essential and broadly applicable to patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction are (i) inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system; (ii) neprilysin inhibitors (i.e. sacubitril/valsartan); (iii) beta‐adrenergic blockers that have been shown to prolong life (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, and bisoprolol); and (iv) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 1, 2, 11 The evidence base for each of these drug classes is clinically persuasive and statistically robust. The magnitude of the incremental benefit of each drug class is meaningful (at least 20% reduction in the risk of death) for neprilysin inhibitors, beta‐blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. 11 Furthermore, these three classes of drugs have each been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death 18; consequently, the utilization of these drugs cannot be reasonably delayed even if patients are clinically stable. 10, 11 In contrast, angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have only a modest benefit on the risk of death (5–16% risk reduction) 19; the survival benefit cannot be enhanced by intensification of treatment 20, 21; and they do not reduce the risk of sudden death. 22

Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can prolong survival, but the combination may be inferior to ACE inhibitors with respect to mortality. 23 Use of this drug combination in the modern era is based on an analysis of a relatively small number of events in a select population. 11 Furthermore, sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors are not considered in the current framework, since the evidence base supporting their ability to reduce mortality in patients with established heart failure is still evolving. 24 If the survival benefits are confirmed by additional trials, these drugs can be included in our proposed system.

### The effects of short-term omission of daily medication on the pathophysiology of heart failure [^1135Z2gD]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Twenty patients (80% men, mean LVEF 32 ± 9%, median NT‐proBNP 962 ng/L) were enrolled in the study. Most patients had mild symptoms (16 in NYHA class II). Patient characteristics and treatment at baseline are presented in Table 1. All patients were treated with loop diuretics and beta‐blockers, mainly carvedilol, 18 received either an ACE inhibitor or ARB, but only 7 (35%) received a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, although this was consistent with guidelines for patients with predominantly NYHA class II HF at the time the study was conducted.

Table 1
Demographic, clinical, and pharmacological treatment data for the study population

Measurements made during visits with medication taken or omitted, and the relative changes in each variable are listed in Table 2, for the overall study group and for patients above and below the median plasma NT‐proBNP. With omission of HF therapies for 48 h, six patients (30%) reported an increase in exertional breathlessness with a deterioration in NYHA class by one rank. Omission of medications was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure (from 131 to 152 mmHg, P < 0.001) and plasma NT‐proBNP, which almost doubled (from 962 to 1883 ng/L, P < 0.001), and a fall in serum creatinine (from 135 to 118 µmol/L, P = 0.012). Weight, despite omission of diuretics, and heart rate, despite omission of beta‐blockers, did not change. Amongst echocardiographic measurements, LV and LA volumes and IVC diameter increased [LV end‐diastolic volume (LVEDV), +11%, P = 0.008; LAV max, +21%, P < 0.001; IVC diameter, +18%, P = 0.004]. The transmitral peak E velocity increased (E, +23%, P = 0.001), indicating a reduction in LAEF. However, LVEF and E/e' did not change significantly. Transthoracic BIM decreased (R E, −10%, P = 0.001), as did total body impedance (Z, −5%, P < 0.001). Changes in renal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), +12%, P = 0.015) were mostly driven by improvements in the subgroup with lower NT‐proBNP, while the behaviour of other measurements was similar regardless of NT‐proBNP subgroup.

### Β-blockers and 1-year postdischarge mortality for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction and slow discharge heart rate [^116RhWit]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Changes in Heart Rate and Blocker Prescription During Follow‐up

The β‐blocker prescription rate was 57% at discharge and 66.5% at 12 months, and the corresponding proportions of patients with slow heart rate were 29.1% and 30.3%, respectively (Figure 2 A). During follow‐up, there was no difference in heart rate between patients with slow heart rate with or without β‐blocker use (Figure 2 B).

### Adherence with once daily versus twice daily carvedilol in patients with heart failure: the compliance and quality of life study comparing once-daily controlled-release carvedilol CR and twice-daily immediate-release carvedilol IR in patients with heart failure (CASPER) trial [^114bf4GS]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Suboptimal compliance in taking guideline-based pharmacotherapy in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) potentially increases the burden of hospitalizations and diminishes quality of life. By simplifying the medical regimen, once-daily dosing can potentially improve compliance. The Compliance And Quality of Life Study Comparing Once-Daily Controlled-Release Carvedilol CR and Twice-Daily Immediate-Release Carvedilol IR in Patients with Heart Failure (CASPER) Trial was designed to measure differential compliance, satisfaction, and quality of life in chronic HF patients taking carvedilol immediate release (IR) twice daily versus the bioequivalent carvedilol controlled-release (CR) once daily.

Methods and Results

CASPER was a prospective multicenter, 3-arm, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial for a 5-month period. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate and compare compliance with carvedilol IR twice daily (BID) and carvedilol phosphate CR once daily (QD) in patients with chronic HF who were taking carvedilol IR. Secondary objectives included comparisons of quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), satisfaction with medication, and brain natriuretic peptide levels between subjects taking the two formulations. A total of 405 patients with chronic HF and left ventricular dysfunction were randomized to: (A) carvedilol IR twice daily, given double blind; (B) carvedilol CR taken in the morning and placebo in the afternoon, given double blind; or (C) carvedilol CR once daily, open label. Compliance was measured using the medication event monitoring system that captures time of bottle opening. The primary end point was a comparison of taking compliance (doses taken divided by total number of prescribed doses over the actual duration of the study) between the double-blind carvedilol IR BID versus the open-label carvedilol CR QD groups. Sample size estimates were based on assumptions of 75% compliance with BID dosing and 90% compliance with QD dosing. Mean compliance with carvedilol IR BID was 89.3% compared with 88.2% for carvedilol CR QD, and differential mean compliance was 1.1% (95% CI -4.4%, 6.6%; ie, not significant). There were no statistically significant differences in compliance between any of the 3 groups, nor differences in quality of life, treatment satisfaction, or physiologic measures among the 3 study arms. There were also no significant differences in adverse events or side effects among patients switching from carvedilol IR to carvedilol CR in arms B or C over the 5-month study duration compared with patients remaining on carvedilol IR.

Conclusions

Compliance among chronic HF patients in the CASPER trial was high at baseline and unaffected by QD versus BID dosing. Over the 5-month follow-up period, there were no differences in adverse events among patients switching from carvedilol IR to CR.

### Effect of sacubitril / valsartan vs. enalapril on changes in heart failure therapies over time: the PARADIGM-HF trial [^1146yMbF]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

As the objective of this analysis was to determine the association between sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril on use patterns of β‐blockers and MRA, all analyses were performed in the as‐treated cohort (based on treatment received). Patients with full data on medication use/dose at baseline and in follow‐up were included. Follow‐up was limited to 12 months given high missingness further from randomization. The proportion of patients on therapy (at any dose, ≥ 50% target dose, and ≥ 100% target dose) was assessed in both treatment arms (sacubitril/valsartan vs. enalapril) at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Target doses were based on the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF guidelines. Target doses for β‐blockers were bisoprolol 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, and extended‐release metoprolol 200 mg once daily. Given variable definitions of target dosing for MRA and lack of consistant demonstrated dose response on clinical outcomes, dosing was summarized for β‐blocker only.

Among patients not receiving β‐blocker and MRA at baseline, new initiations were compared by treatment arm in follow‐up. Similarly, among patients receiving β‐blocker and MRA at baseline, discontinuations were compared during follow‐up by treatment arm. New initiations and discontinuations were assessed among patients alive and with available data at each follow‐up time point. A P ‐value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with coronary artery disease (management of recurrent VA), ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider initiating amiodarone or sotalol to suppress recurrent VA in patients with ischemic heart disease and recurrent VA with significant symptoms or ICD shocks despite optimal device programming and ongoing treatment with a β-blocker.

### Dosing of β-blocker therapy before, during, and after hospitalization for heart failure (from organized program to initiate lifesaving treatment in hospitalized patients with heart failure) [^1119ia2u]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guidelines recommend that beta blockers be titrated to achieve the target doses shown to be effective in major clinical trials, if tolerated. Little is known, however, regarding the doses of beta blockers used in patients with HF in routine clinical practice before, during, and after hospitalization for HF. The Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) enrolled 5,791 patients admitted with HF in a registry with prespecified 60- to 90-day follow-up at 91 academic and community hospitals throughout the United States. Among 2,373 patients with systolic HF eligible for beta blockers at discharge, 1,350 (56.9%) were receiving beta-blocker therapy before admission and continued on therapy, and 632 (26.6%) were newly started. The mean total daily dose for beta blockers before hospital admission was < 1/2 the recommended target dose (carvedilol 21.5 ± 17.8 mg and metoprolol succinate 69.2 ± 51.9 mg), with infrequent up- or down-titration during the HF hospitalization. More than 2/3 of patients had no change in their beta-blocker doses in the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge. At 60- to 90-day postdischarge follow-up, only 17.5% and 7.9% of patients were being treated with recommended target doses of carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, respectively. In conclusion, these data reveal that the doses of beta blockers applied in clinical practice are substantially less that the doses achieved in randomized clinical trials in HF and recommended in national guidelines. In the first 60 to 90 days after hospital discharge, little up-titration in beta-blocker dosing occurs. Further efforts are needed to help understand and overcome this beta-blocker titration gap.

### Prognostic benefits of carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol controlled release / extended release in hemodialysis patients with heart failure: a 10-year cohort [^111YNMbA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Sensitivity Analysis

In addition to the main analysis, we performed additional analyses to assess the reliability of our results. The US National Kidney Foundation provided a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative evidence‐based clinical practice guideline for long‐term HD patients with cardiovascular disease in 2005. 26 The guideline suggested the treatment of HF in patients on long‐term HD with conventional therapies according to expert opinion, and the evidence for the use of a β‐blocker was moderately strong (only carvedilol). To evaluate the effect of the initiative guideline on the therapeutic results of our 10‐year cohort study, we first conducted discrete analyses for patients with index dates from 2001 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2010 (before and after publication of the guideline).

Second, persistence in therapy is a potential confounding factor in this study. The patients who received β‐blockers, ACEIs, or ARBs might not continue therapy during the entire follow‐up period. Because the consumption of β‐blocker would accumulate over time, when we followed the death event of the HF patients, the exposure duration by month of β‐blocker therapy was treated as a time‐dependent covariate to reflect its changing nature. In this analysis, we used the counting process method by allowing our β‐blocker therapy variable to vary over time. The time‐dependent variable of each individual was followed and updated at every monthly interval. For example, if an individual started β‐blocker therapy for 10 months, quit for 3 months, then restarted for 2 months before dying, we would have 2 changes of β‐blocker therapy status. We then set these 3 observations equal to 10 months with β‐blocker therapy, 3 months without β‐blocker therapy, and 2 months with β‐blocker therapy then censored. Similarly, the exposure duration of ACEI or ARB therapy was treated as a time‐dependent covariate because its use also has survival benefits for the HF patients. 21

In addition, we conducted analysis by defining the observation period beginning at intervals of 30 and 45 days after the initial HF diagnosis to assess the therapeutic effects on the probability of death and to minimize the risk of potential bias.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to patients with medication-induced arrhythmia, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to increase the HR with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol to suppress the arrhythmia in patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia unable to be suppressed with IV magnesium administration.
