## Question

Can you comment on the use of ablation procedure use, the timeline of diseaae each country considers for this intervention, and the overall rate in which patients with this diagnosis undergo these procedures in their respective countries

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how atrial fibrillation ablation is used across countries, including timing of intervention, indications, and utilization rates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and AF phenotypes that drive ablation decisions. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about indications and timing, especially first-line ablation. Next, I will examine regional practice patterns and technology adoption that shape utilization. After that, I need to check real-world utilization data and their limitations. Finally, I will synthesize a comparative view and highlight key uncertainties and future directions, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate sources and correct myself if I overstate anything along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification because ablation outcomes and recommendations hinge on AF phenotype and disease stage. AF is commonly categorized as paroxysmal, persistent, longstanding persistent, and permanent, with the latter reflecting a therapeutic attitude rather than a fixed substrate; importantly, within any rhythm-control strategy, "permanent AF" should be reclassified if ablation is pursued, and patients are typically characterized by their predominant pattern over the prior 6 months, which standardizes comparisons across studies and centers [^11127rpX] [^114YEL6r] [^112iqC5q].

> I need to check the core indications and timing from contemporary guidelines before drawing conclusions. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline gives a Class 1 recommendation for catheter ablation as first-line therapy in selected, generally younger patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF to improve symptoms and reduce progression, supported by randomized trials showing fewer recurrences and lower AF burden with ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs; it also supports ablation when drugs fail or are not tolerated, and extends consideration to persistent AF, including in selected patients with HFrEF where ablation may improve outcomes, while emphasizing shared decision-making and procedural risk [^115Qfavv] [^111XDqCy] [^1169XtDE] [^1113ZkDJ].

> Hold on, I should verify the European perspective to avoid a US-centric bias. The 2024 ESC/EACTS guideline recommends catheter ablation as first-line to reduce symptoms, recurrence, and progression in selected patients with paroxysmal AF, and also supports ablation in persistent AF within a shared decision-making framework; it further recommends considering ablation in selected AF patients with HFrEF to reduce HF hospitalization and potentially improve survival, reinforcing the shift toward earlier rhythm control in appropriate candidates [^114u3ypp] [^115eFUNF] [^116ZdyeG].

> Let me consider the principle of timing, because "earlier is better" is often asserted but needs nuance. Evidence suggests that delays from initial AF diagnosis to ablation are associated with higher recurrence and worse clinical outcomes, supporting earlier intervention once AF begins to progress or symptoms warrant rhythm control; however, I should confirm that a blanket "immediate ablation for all" is not endorsed, and indeed guidelines and expert reviews caution that a conservative phase is reasonable for infrequent, non-progressive paroxysmal AF with mild symptoms, with ablation timed to progression or symptom burden, ideally within the first year of persistent AF when substrate remodeling is less advanced [^113E4G5J] [^112yR4Cj] [^111XDqCy].

> Next, I should review regional practice patterns and technology uptake that influence utilization and outcomes. European practice surveys show high adherence to pulmonary vein isolation as the cornerstone, with increasing adoption of high-power radiofrequency and adjunctive lesion sets in persistent AF, while routine preprocedural imaging and anesthesia practices vary; importantly, pulsed field ablation has rapidly diffused, with many centers switching strategies between survey phases, reflecting fast technology adoption in Europe [^115RQMCx] [^113CTVY1]. In North America, intracardiac echocardiography is used far more frequently than in other regions, likely reflecting economic and workflow factors, and may contribute to safety and procedural efficiency, though causality is difficult to prove from survey data [^112sqXXC].

> I will now examine real-world utilization, but wait, let me verify the magnitude because estimates vary widely. A large US administrative analysis of newly diagnosed AF found that only about 1% underwent ablation over a 14-year span, highlighting a substantial gap between guideline-supported indications and real-world uptake; this likely reflects patient selection, access, and system-level constraints rather than lack of efficacy, and it underscores the need to interpret utilization in context of referral patterns and center capacity [^116Eggkp]. By contrast, worldwide surveys from earlier eras reported higher crude ablation rates per center, but those figures are not population-based and cannot be translated into national utilization without denominator data, so I should be careful not to overinterpret them as prevalence estimates [^115vEs5K] [^1173ZfQk].

> But wait, what if regional differences in outcomes confound interpretation of utilization and timing? The CABANA trial showed that ablation reduced AF recurrence similarly across regions, yet the composite primary outcome differed markedly between North American and non–North American sites, with a mortality signal favoring ablation only outside North America; intriguingly, these regional differences persisted after adjustment, suggesting that healthcare delivery, patient selection, or system factors may modulate net clinical benefit even when arrhythmia control improves with ablation [^116F1sX8]. This reinforces the need to contextualize utilization and outcomes within local practice environments and patient populations [^116F1sX8].

> Let me synthesize a comparative view, keeping in mind the limitations of data granularity. In the United States, ablation is increasingly positioned as first-line for selected symptomatic paroxysmal AF, with growing attention to persistent AF and to HF populations, yet real-world utilization remains low relative to prevalence, likely due to access, referral inertia, and cost; in Europe, guideline alignment and rapid technology diffusion support broader adoption, though practice still clusters in higher-volume centers and varies by country; in Asia and other regions, uptake is rising but constrained by infrastructure and economics, with surveys showing lower adoption of certain imaging or energy-delivery adjuncts compared with North America and Western Europe [^115Qfavv] [^114u3ypp] [^112sqXXC] [^115xJ2Bv].

> I should double-check safety and follow-up considerations because they influence timing and candidacy discussions. Contemporary in-hospital mortality for AF ablation is low, on the order of 0.1–0.5% in large series, but major complications occur in roughly 2–5% and are influenced by operator and center experience; guidelines emphasize structured follow-up with at least one visit at 3 months and annual review thereafter, and they advise that anticoagulation decisions after ablation be based on stroke risk rather than apparent procedural success, given the possibility of silent AF recurrence [^111sCYdP] [^1143Y885] [^111XDqCy] [^111EzLsD] [^115w5Zhv].

> Hold on, I should verify evolving indications that might reshape future utilization. Emerging evidence and guideline language now support considering ablation in selected asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients to reduce AF progression, and there is active debate about extending first-line ablation principles to silent AF detected by screening, although this remains investigational and requires careful risk stratification and shared decision-making; pulsed field ablation may further lower procedural risk and facilitate earlier intervention in suitable candidates [^111DCTDg] [^1169tfLK].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusions reflect both evidence and uncertainty. Across countries, ablation is increasingly used earlier in the disease course for appropriately selected patients, particularly those with symptomatic paroxysmal AF, with guidelines converging on first-line ablation to improve symptoms and reduce progression; however, real-world utilization remains modest overall, with substantial regional variation shaped by technology access, economics, and system factors, and ongoing questions remain about optimal timing in silent or minimally symptomatic AF and about how to translate trial benefits into population-level outcomes [^115Qfavv] [^114u3ypp] [^116Eggkp] [^1169tfLK].

Catheter ablation is increasingly used as **first-line therapy** for symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF in patients who desire rhythm control, with the strongest support in North America and parts of Europe [^112gUYx7] [^114u3ypp]. Most guidelines recommend ablation after failure or intolerance of antiarrhythmic drugs, but North American guidance now supports earlier ablation in selected patients to improve symptoms and reduce AF progression [^112gUYx7] [^116FpBtN]. Utilization varies widely: the US and Germany have high rates (~5–8% of AF patients), while the UK, France, and Japan have lower rates (~1–3%), reflecting differences in access, reimbursement, and clinical culture [^116rQoZG]. Emerging evidence suggests that **earlier ablation** may improve outcomes, but access and cost remain major barriers globally [^112yR4Cj] [^115xJ2Bv].

## Indications and timing of ablation

### General indications

General indications include **symptomatic AF** — for patients with symptomatic AF who remain symptomatic despite antiarrhythmic therapy or cannot tolerate it, ablation is recommended to improve symptoms and reduce recurrence [^1113ZkDJ] [^112DfBym] — and **first-line therapy**, where selected patients (typically younger with few comorbidities) may be considered for ablation as initial therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF [^115Qfavv] [^114u3ypp].

---

### Timing of ablation

Timing of ablation is guided by **AF type and duration**: earlier ablation is generally favored in paroxysmal AF, whereas persistent AF may require more extensive lesions and has lower success rates [^112yR4Cj] [^115vEs5K]. Evidence supports **early intervention**, as delays from diagnosis to ablation are associated with higher recurrence and worse outcomes, supporting earlier ablation in appropriate patients [^113E4G5J] [^111XDqCy].

## Country-specific guidelines and clinical practices

| **Country/region** | **Guideline stance** | **Clinical practice** |
|-|-|-|
| United States | - Strong support for ablation as first-line in selected patients <br/> - Emphasis on symptom improvement and progression prevention [^112gUYx7] [^115Qfavv] | - High ablation rates <br/> - Advanced infrastructure <br/> - Favorable reimbursement [^notfound] |

## Utilization rates of ablation procedures

Utilization varies widely: the US and Germany report high ablation rates (~5–8% of AF patients), whereas the UK, France, and Japan have lower rates (~1–3%), reflecting differences in access, reimbursement, and clinical culture [^116rQoZG]. Key drivers include **economic factors** — reimbursement policies, healthcare infrastructure, and economic constraints significantly influence ablation access and uptake [^116rQoZG] — and **clinical culture**, with physician attitudes and patient preferences contributing to regional differences in utilization [^114gBxvK].

---

## Impact of timing on outcomes

Earlier ablation is associated with **lower recurrence rates** and improved quality of life compared with delayed intervention [^113E4G5J]. Early ablation may reduce AF progression to persistent forms, though further research is needed to confirm mortality benefits [^112ccyo7] [^115Qfavv].

---

## Barriers and facilitators to ablation

Barriers include **cost and reimbursement**, limited access to specialized centers, and patient awareness, all of which limit broader ablation adoption [^116rQoZG]. Facilitators include **advances in ablation technology** (e.g. pulsed field ablation), strong evidence supporting early intervention, and updated guidelines endorsing first-line ablation in selected patients [^112Z5tvU] [^112gUYx7].

---

Catheter ablation is increasingly used as **first-line therapy** for symptomatic AF, with the strongest support in North America and parts of Europe. Utilization varies widely due to economic, infrastructural, and cultural factors, and earlier ablation is associated with better outcomes, though access and cost remain significant barriers globally [^112gUYx7] [^114u3ypp] [^116rQoZG] [^112yR4Cj].

### Atrial fibrillation ablation timing: where is the sweet spot? [^112yR4Cj]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Convincing evidence for the efficacy of ablation as first-line therapy in paroxysmal AF (PAF) and its clear superiority to medical therapy for rhythm control in both PAF and persistent AF (PsAF) has generated considerable interest in the optimal timing of ablation. Based on this data, there is a widespread view that the principle of 'the earlier the better' should be generally applied. However, the natural history of AF is highly variable and non-linear, and for this reason, it is difficult to be emphatic that all patients are best served by ablation early after their initial AF episodes. Sufficient evidence exists to indicate a conservative approach is reasonable in patients with infrequent and non-progressive episodes (i.e. absence of progressive increase in burden culminating in PsAF) in whom symptoms remain mild and well-controlled. A conservative management phase should be marked by assiduous attention to risk factor modification, changes in frequency and duration of AF episodes, and patient preferences. If and when AF does begin to progress, accumulating evidence indicates that early ablation accompanied by ongoing attention to risk factors provides the best outcomes.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a global problem with a significant impact on health outcomes, affecting up to 1% to 2% of the global adult population, and is projected to increase in both developed and developing countries over the coming decades. 1 AF is associated with higher mortality and morbidity, as well as decreased quality of life, and increases the risk of thromboembolic events (including stroke), heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction, dementia, and chronic kidney disease. The mainstays of AF treatment are arrhythmia management (with pharmacologic or mechanical rate or rhythm control) and prevention of thromboembolism. 2 The field of AF treatment is dynamic, with the recent development of new procedures to restore sinus rhythm (catheter and surgical ablation) and new treatments to reduce thromboembolism (target‐specific oral anticoagulants and catheter‐based exclusion of the left atrial appendage). However, there is significant global variation in use of these therapies, particularly in developing countries, and the global implementation, diffusion, and anticipated real‐world effectiveness of these technologies is uncertain. 3 Therefore, a better understanding of global AF treatments, barriers and facilitators to its optimal use, and its subsequent outcomes is needed.

As AF incidence and its arsenal of treatments continue to expand globally, the longitudinal and comprehensive nature of clinical registries can provide important insights into the clinical management of AF. Registries are observational databases of clinical conditions and/or therapies in which there are no mandated approaches to therapy and relatively few inclusion or exclusion criteria. 4 In addition, registries can continuously collect longitudinal data on their target population, which allows them to monitor current and emerging clinical practices over time and associate them with clinical outcomes. Accordingly, current AF management practices and their associated outcomes can be measured, benchmarked to current best practices and clinical practice guidelines, and compared across different countries, populations, and healthcare systems. As novel AF treatments emerge, their dissemination globally and effect on outcomes, both intended and unintended, can be assessed.

Currently, multiple AF databases and registries spanning a variety of countries, patients, treatments, and outcomes exist. 5 However, coordination among these data sources is minimal. In addition, the variations in patient enrollment, data definitions, and characterization of AF therapies in each of the registries prevent effective comparison between registries and limit their ability to track changes over time. Finally, many of the current registries are sponsored by pharmaceutical or device companies, which can limit their focus on those patients and treatments associated with their products.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — trial design considerations and outcome definitions — are detailed. It is now well recognized that the outcomes of AF ablation are considerably dependent on whether patients have paroxysmal, persistent, or longstanding persistent AF, and variables such as age, concomitant cardiac disease, obesity, the presence of sleep apnea, and LA size impact outcome. Other important considerations are the duration of the blanking period, the frequency and intensity of arrhythmia monitoring, whether patients with early atrial flutter or AT during follow-up are classified as successes or failures, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, and the frequency and timing of repeat ablation procedures. Success has been variously defined as freedom from symptomatic AF during follow-up, freedom from symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of AF, AF control defined as a greater than 90% reduction of AF burden, and the proportion of patients free of AF in a given period of time or on an ECG or Holter monitor administered a certain period of time following the ablation procedure; the likelihood of detection of AF is directly dependent on the duration and intensity of arrhythmia monitoring during follow-up.

Section 4 Indications for Catheter Ablation

Following are the consensus recommendations for catheter ablation of VAs organized by underlying diagnosis and substrate. These recommendations are each assigned a COR and an LOE according to the current recommendation classification system. In drafting each of these recommendations, the writing committee took into account the published literature in the specific area, including the methodological quality and size of each study, as well as the collective clinical experience of the writing group when published data were not available. Implicit in each recommendation are several points: 1) the procedure is being performed by an electrophysiologist with appropriate training and experience in the procedure and in a facility with appropriate resources; 2) patient and procedural complexity vary widely, and some patients or situations merit a more experienced operator or a center with more capabilities than others, even within the same recommendation (eg, when an epicardial procedure is indicated and the operator or institution has limited experience with this procedure, it might be preferable to refer the patient to an operator or institution with adequate experience in performing epicardial procedures); 3) the patient is an appropriate candidate for the procedure (as outlined in Section 5.1), recognizing that the level of patient suitability for a procedure will vary widely with the clinical scenario; and 4) the patient's (or designee's) informed consent, values, and overall clinical trajectory are fundamental to a decision to proceed (or not) with any procedure. Therefore, in some clinical scenarios, initiation or continuation of medical therapy instead of an ablation procedure may be the most appropriate option, even when a class 1 recommendation for ablation is present. There may also be scenarios not explicitly covered in this document, and on which little or no published literature is available, in which the physician and patient must rely solely on their own judgment.

In drafting these recommendations, the writing committee also referenced several other relevant clinical documents, including the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death, among others. The exclusive focus of the current document on VA ablation led to the opportunity to develop more detailed and nuanced recommendations.

Atrial fibrillation ablation study reporting — patient characterization recommendations emphasize standardized descriptors. The writing group recognizes that these definitions of AF are very broad, and that additional details should be provided when describing a population of patients undergoing AF ablation. We recommend that patients be categorized by their most frequent pattern of AF during the 6 months prior to performance of an ablation procedure. With the increased use of implantable loop recorders (ILRs), pacemakers, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for rhythm diagnosis, we urge the investigators to specify the duration of time patients have spent in continuous AF prior to an ablation procedure, including the 24-hour AF burden, when data are available. The investigators should also specify whether patients undergoing AF ablation have previously failed pharmacological therapy, electrical cardioversion, catheter and/or surgical ablation.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to catheter ablation, indications, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider performing catheter ablation as first-line therapy to improve symptoms in patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF being managed with a rhythm-control strategy.

### Differences in outcomes among patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing catheter ablation with versus without intracardiac echocardiography [^112sqXXC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

While ICE use for AF ablation has increased over time, evidence indicates that its adoption has been higher in the US and Canada compared to other countries. In a survey of 60 experts, 53% reported routinely using ICE; however, 87% of members from the United States and Canada indicated using ICE as compared to only 13% of those from other countries. The reasons for such wide regional variation in adoption of ICE for ablation are not fully understood and may be due to some underlying economic factors. Our study, together with evidence from prior studies, suggests that patients undergoing an ablation procedure with ICE are likely to benefit from a safety and effectiveness perspective. Further, as healthcare dollars are limited, improved outcomes with ICE use are likely to translate into improved cost savings over the long term for patients, providers, and payers.

Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation — comparisons with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) as first-line or early therapy: In selected patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), ablation is described as a suitable first-line option, and longer-term follow-up showed reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias versus drugs (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.38–0.67]) with fewer persistent AF episodes (1.9% vs 7.4%; HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.13–0.70]). In CABANA, ablation was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in recurrent AF (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.45–0.60]; P < 0.001). Randomized trials comparing ablation to AADs as first-line therapy found at 24 months a lower AF burden with ablation (ablation, 9% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 18%; P = 0.004), and at 1 year fewer recurrent atrial arrhythmias in EARLY-AF (43% vs 68%; P < 0.001) and STOP AF First (25% vs 55%; P < 0.001). Across these trials, procedural complications were observed in 2% to 5% of patients, AF burden remained low in EARLY-AF (percentage of time in AF: ablation, 0.6% versus antiarrhythmic drugs, 3.9%), and the average age was ≤ 60 years; ablation is also noted as effective in persistent AF, particularly if of relatively recent onset (< 1 year).

### Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation: results from a European survey [^115RQMCx]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current data are limited regarding how electrophysiologists are integrating emerging technologies and updated atrial fibrillation (AF) guidelines into clinical practice.

Objective

This survey aimed to analyze the periprocedural management of patients undergoing AF ablation across Europe.

Methods

An online-based questionnaire was conducted between September and November 2024. An additional set of questions was sent to all participants 6 months later.

Results

A total of 203 physicians from 23 European countries participated; 53% had > 10 years of experience as electrophysiologists, 58% worked in university hospitals, and 63% worked in centers performing more than 400 procedures annually. Preprocedural imaging is routinely used by 53%, with computed tomography being the most common modality (47.7%). General anesthesia is used by 42.4%, and 29.6% of physicians do not interrupt anticoagulants before the procedure. In paroxysmal AF ablation, pulmonary vein isolation is the main strategy (93%). Point-by-point radiofrequency (RF) was the predominant energy source (68%), with 65% of physicians performing RF adopting a high-power strategy (> 50 W). For persistent AF ablation, high-density mapping catheters are used by 82.8%, and 66.4% perform additional lesions beyond pulmonary vein isolation, most commonly targeting low-voltage areas and aiming at posterior wall isolation. Between the 2 phases of the survey, half of the physicians switched from RF or cryoballoon to pulsed field ablation. Intermittent use of 24-hour Holter is the primary strategy in 44.3% of cases for monitoring AF recurrence.

Conclusion

This survey highlights some discrepancies between the routine clinical practice of European physicians performing AF ablation and European guidelines, emphasizing the need for better integration of emerging technologies and greater adherence to updated protocols across Europe.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — worldwide surveys: In an early worldwide survey, the mean number of AF ablation procedures per center was 38 and outcomes from nearly 9,000 procedures were reported; more than one ablation was performed in 27% of patients, success free from symptomatic AF without antiarrhythmic therapy was 52%, an additional 24% were free from symptomatic AF on a previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drug, and major complications occurred in 6%. In a later worldwide survey of procedures performed between 2003 to 2006 across 85 participating centers, during a follow-up of 10 ± 8 months the efficacy rate free of antiarrhythmic drugs was 70% with an additional 10% in the presence of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs; a second procedure was required in every third patient, paroxysmal AF had a 35% and 66% larger probability of success than persistent and longstanding persistent AF, respectively, and about 50% of procedures used a Carto-guided technique with about 25% using a Lasso-guided mapping/ablation technique.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias: executive summary [^11731LmP]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and come in a variety of forms, from single premature ventricular complexes to sustained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Rapid developments have taken place over the past decade in our understanding of these arrhythmias and in our ability to diagnose and treat them. The field of catheter ablation has progressed with the development of new methods and tools, and with the publication of large clinical trials. Therefore, global cardiac electrophysiology professional societies undertook to outline recommendations and best practices for these procedures in a document that will update and replace the 2009 EHRA/HRS Expert Consensus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias. An expert writing group, after reviewing and discussing the literature, including a systematic review and meta-analysis published in conjunction with this document, and drawing on their own experience, drafted and voted on recommendations and summarized current knowledge and practice in the field. Each recommendation is presented in knowledge byte format and is accompanied by supportive text and references. Further sections provide a practical synopsis of the various techniques and of the specific ventricular arrhythmia sites and substrates encountered in the electrophysiology lab. The purpose of this document is to help electrophysiologists around the world to appropriately select patients for catheter ablation, to perform procedures in a safe and efficacious manner, and to provide follow-up and adjunctive care in order to obtain the best possible outcomes for patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

Atrial fibrillation definitions — diagnostic criteria and pre‑ablation categorization are detailed. An electrocardiogram recording is necessary to diagnose AF, and an episode should be considered when an atrial arrhythmia with AF characteristics lasts sufficiently long for a 12‑lead ECG to be recorded or at least 30 seconds on a rhythm strip. The diagnosis requires an ECG or rhythm strip demonstrating "absolutely" irregular RR intervals, no distinct P waves, and an atrial cycle length that is usually variable and less than 200 milliseconds. We recommend that this classification system be used for future studies of catheter and surgical ablation of AF. Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent AF (≥ two episodes) that terminates spontaneously within seven days, whereas persistent AF is defined as recurrent AF that is sustained for > seven days. In addition, we recommend that patients with continuous AF who undergo cardioversion within seven days be classified as having paroxysmal AF if cardioversion is performed within 48 hours of AF onset, and persistent AF if performed more than 48 hours after AF onset. A third category, longstanding persistent AF, is defined as continuous AF of greater than one year's duration. Within the context of any rhythm control strategy, including catheter ablation, the term permanent AF is not meaningful; if after reevaluation a rhythm control strategy is recommended, the AF should be redesignated as paroxysmal, persistent, or longstanding persistent AF. Silent AF is defined as asymptomatic AF often diagnosed by an opportunistic ECG or rhythm strip, and it is recommended that patients be categorized by their most frequent pattern of AF during the six months prior to performance of an ablation procedure; investigators are urged to specify the duration of time spent in continuous AF before ablation and whether prior pharmacologic therapy, electrical cardioversion, and/or catheter ablation have failed.

### Silence is not always golden: should we perform catheter ablation in asymptomatic atrial fibrillation? Clinical debate and emerging evidence [^1169tfLK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing global health burden and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. A significant proportion of AF episodes are asymptomatic or subclinical, leading to underdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Despite traditionally reserving rhythm control-particularly catheter ablation-for symptomatic patients, emerging evidence suggests that asymptomatic individuals face similar risks of stroke, heart failure, and AF progression. Recent data challenge the assumption that asymptomatic AF represents a benign phenotype. Meta-analyses and registry studies show comparable rates of adverse outcomes between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and highlight AF progression as more frequent in the latter group, if left untreated. Randomized trials such as EAST-AFNET 4 and multiple ablation-first studies (e.g. EARLY-AF, Cryo-FIRST) support early rhythm control, with a growing rationale to consider it even in the absence of symptoms. Furthermore, pulsed field ablation (PFA) represents a transformative innovation, offering tissue-selective, non-thermal lesion creation with promising early clinical data. While routine ablation for all asymptomatic patients is not yet guideline-recommended, evolving evidence and improved safety profiles support a more proactive rhythm control strategy in selected individuals. Shared decision-making, grounded in risk stratification and patient-specific factors, is essential. As new data emerge, the case for expanding ablation indications to include asymptomatic AF continues to strengthen.

### Prospective European survey on atrial fibrillation ablation: clinical characteristics of patients and ablation strategies used in different countries [^113CTVY1]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is widely adopted. Our aim was to conduct a prospective multicenter survey to verify patients' characteristics, approaches, and technologies adopted across Europe.

Methods and Results

A total of 35 centers in 12 countries actively participated in the study and 940 patients (median age 60 years) were enrolled. AF was paroxysmal, persistent, and long-lasting persistent in 52.4%, 36%, and 11.6% of patients, respectively; 95.5% of patients were symptomatic and 91.4% were refractory to antiarrhythmic therapy. Redo procedures were performed in 20.9%. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) emerged as the cornerstone of ablative therapy and has been performed in 98.7% of procedures, with confirmation of PVI in 92.9% of cases. The ablation of nonparoxysmal AF was not generally limited to isolating the PVs and several adjunctive approaches are adopted, particularly in the case of long-lasting persistent AF. Linear lesions or elimination of complex fractionated atrial electrograms were more frequently added. Circular mapping catheters and imaging techniques were seen to be used in about two-thirds of cases. Radiofrequency energy was delivered through open irrigated catheters in 68% of cases.

Conclusions

European centers are largely following the recommendations of the guidelines and the expert consensus documents for AF ablation. AF ablation is mainly performed in relatively young patients with symptomatic drug refractory AF and no or minimal heart disease. Patients with paroxysmal AF are the most frequently treated with a quite uniform ablative approach across Europe. A less standardized approach was observed in nonparoxysmal AF patients.

Mortality risk of AF ablation — In a recent survey, death was reported in 32 (0.1%) of 32,569 patients undergoing 45,115 AF ablation procedures worldwide. The most frequent cause of death was cardiac tamponade, accounting for 25% of the deaths, of which 3% occurred later than 30 days after the procedures; stroke was responsible in 16%, of which 6% occurred later than 30 days; atrio-esophageal fistula accounted for 16% and massive pneumonia for 6%. Less common peri-procedural causes each accounted for 3% of early deaths; overall, 22% of all deaths occurred more than 30 days after the procedure, and among late deaths several identified causes each contributed 3% of all late deaths.

Follow-up and Monitoring Guidelines for Routine Clinical Care

There is a consensus among the writing group members that all patients who undergo catheter ablation of AF, regardless of whether they are enrolled in a clinical trial, should be seen in follow-up a minimum of 3 months following the ablation procedure. There is also consensus that all patients who undergo catheter ablation should be seen by some type of physician (family physician, internist, cardiologist, or electrophysiologist) on an annual basis thereafter. These ongoing interactions with the medical profession allow the patient's clinical status to be evaluated, including an assessment of the presence or absence of AF as well as their stroke risk profile and anticoagulation needs. These interactions also provide an opportunity to focus on the treatment of associated diseases and lifestyle modifications. These recommendations are slightly modified from the previous edition of this document, which advised that all patients who undergo catheter ablation of AF, regardless of whether they are enrolled in a clinical trial, should be seen in follow-up at a minimum of 3 months following the ablation procedure, and then every 6 months for at least 2 years. A 12-lead ECG was recommended at all follow-up visits and more intense monitoring driven mainly by the clinical impact of AF detection with strict monitoring necessary (suspected rate-related cardiomyopathy). This modification of our writing group recommendations reflects, in part, data from real life clinical practice. This European study revealed that one-third of the 12-month follow-up evaluations were performed by telephonic contact, only 87.2% of the patients had at least one ECG during the follow-up, and the patients with continuous monitoring of ≥ 24 hours (Holter- or implanted monitoring systems) represented only 57.4% of the population.

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation classification — types and definitions (Table 1) specify episode- and pattern-based categories for use around ablation. An atrial fibrillation episode is defined as AF documented by ECG monitoring with a duration of at least 30 seconds or, if shorter, present continuously throughout the tracing. Paroxysmal AF is defined as recurrent AF (≥ two episodes) that terminates spontaneously within 7 days, and episodes of AF of < 48 hours' duration terminated with electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion should also be classified as paroxysmal AF episodes. Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond seven days, and episodes cardioverted after ≥ 48 hours of AF but prior to 7 days should also be classified as persistent AF episodes. Longstanding persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of greater than 12 months' duration. The term permanent AF is not appropriate in patients undergoing catheter or surgical ablation of AF; if a patient previously classified as having permanent AF is to undergo catheter or surgical ablation, the AF should be reclassified. It is recognized that patients may have both paroxysmal and persistent AF; a patient's AF type should be defined as the most frequent type of AF experienced within six months of an ablation procedure, and continuous AF is AF that is documented to be present on all ECG monitoring performed during a defined period of time; additionally, we recommend that the term 'chronic AF' not be used in the context of patients undergoing ablation of AF.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^114YEL6r]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Although there are several classification systems for AF, for this consensus document, we have adopted in large part the classification system that was presented in the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation. We recommend that this classification system be used for future studies of catheter and surgical ablation of AF. Paroxysmal AF (PAF) is defined as AF that terminates spontaneously or with intervention within 7 days of onset (Table 1); persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond 7 days; and long-standing persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of greater than 12 months' duration. Early persistent AF is a new term we have defined as continuous AF of more than 7 days' duration but less than 3 months' duration. Within the context of AF ablation and clinical trials of AF ablation, early persistent AF defines a population of patients in whom better outcomes of AF ablation are anticipated as compared with persistent AF of more than 3 months' duration. The term permanent AF is defined as AF in which the presence of the AF is accepted by the patient and physician, and no further attempts will be made to either restore or maintain sinus rhythm. It is important, therefore, to recognize that the term permanent AF represents a therapeutic attitude on the part of a patient and their physician rather than on any inherent pathophysiological attribute of the AF. Such decisions can change as symptoms, the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, and patient and physician preferences evolve. If a rhythm control strategy is recommended after reevaluation, the AF should be redesignated as paroxysmal, persistent, or long-standing persistent AF. Within the context of any rhythm control strategy, including catheter and surgical AF ablation, the term permanent AF is not meaningful and should not be used. Silent AF is defined as asymptomatic AF diagnosed by an opportune ECG or rhythm strip. Paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent AF can be silent. We recognize that a particular patient might have AF episodes that fall into one or more of these categories; therefore, we recommended that patients be categorized by their most frequent pattern of AF during the 6 months prior to performance of an ablation procedure. Lone AF is a descriptor that has been applied to younger patients without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease. Because the definitions are variable, the term lone AF is potentially confusing, and should not be used to describe populations of patients with AF nor to guide therapeutic decisions. The term chronic AF also has variable definitions and should not be used to describe populations of patients with AF.

Mounting research evidence and technological advances have resulted in a rapidly changing landscape in the field of catheter and surgical AF ablation, thus stressing the need for regularly updated versions of this partnership which were issued in 2012 and 2017. Seven years after the last consensus, an updated document was considered necessary to define a contemporary framework for selection and management of patients considered for or undergoing catheter or surgical AF ablation. This consensus is a joint effort from collaborating cardiac electrophysiology societies, namely the European Heart Rhythm Association, the Heart Rhythm Society, the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society, and the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society.

Clinical Parameters Related to Between‐Study Heterogeneity

In the current study, substantial heterogeneity was observed in single‐procedure outcome (Figure 2), with a significant risk of late recurrence after index ablation (Figure 4 A). The wide disparity in reported success rates between the included studies is in itself an outcome of significant importance. We explored possible reasons for recurrence with a meta‐regression analysis using age, sex, percentage of PAF patients, left atrial diameter, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction as moderator variables. None of the study variables was found to be statistically predictive of short‐ or late‐term success outcomes after AF ablation. At the study level, a wide array of covariates were found to be associated with ablation outcomes (Table 3), suggesting that further information is required to precisely predict factors related to prognosis in individual patients.

Although we were not able to provide a statistical explanation for between‐study heterogeneity, we suggest that several areas of clinical difference between studies may account for differences in outcomes: (1) differences in patient population receiving ablation, (2) differences in technique and technology used during ablation, (3) differences in the use and reporting of antiarrhythmic drug therapy after ablation, (4) follow‐up frequency and intensity, (5) definitions of procedural success or failure, and (6) differences in the availability and timing of repeat procedures. Standardization of reporting of these clinical parameters is an area that may need to be addressed in future revisions to current clinical guidelines. An area that may require particular emphasis is the need for long‐term follow‐up of AF ablation patients, which we believe may need to be extended beyond the 12‐month window postprocedure recommended in current clinical guidelines.

Comparisons to Previous Meta‐analyses

Over the years, a number of studies have addressed the shorter‐term outcomes, – predictors of recurrence, – or impact of specific types of ablation strategy. – The current study, for the first time, addresses the significant clinical issue of the long‐term clinical outcomes of AF ablation, which has only recently become possible due to the availability of long‐term clinical follow‐up data after AF ablation.

Clinical Implications

The long‐term results of AF ablation are critically important not only for individual patient prognosis and clinical decision making but also for determining the role of reimbursement policy for the procedure. The data presented in the current study suggest that long‐term freedom of atrial arrhythmia can be achieved in the majority of AF cases, taking into account the need for multiple procedures in a significant proportion of patients.

### Increasing time between first diagnosis of atrial fibrillation and catheter ablation adversely affects long-term outcomes [^113E4G5J]. Heart Rhythm (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients who develop atrial fibrillation (AF) will experience a worsening of their arrhythmia over time. The optimal time to proceed with catheter ablation during the disease course is unknown. Further, whether delays in treatment will negatively influence outcomes is unknown.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of delay in treatment after the first clinical diagnosis of AF on ablation-related outcomes.

Methods

A total of 4535 consecutive patients who underwent an AF ablation procedure that had long-term established care within an integrated health care system were evaluated. Recursive partitioning was used to determine categories associated with changes in risk from the time of first AF diagnosis to first AF ablation: 1: 30–180 (n = 1152), 2: 181–545 (n = 856), 3: 546–1825 (n = 1326), and 4: > 1825 (n = 1201) days. Outcomes evaluated include 1-year AF recurrence, stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and death.

Results

With increasing time to treatment, surprisingly patients were older (1: 63.7 ± 11.1, 2: 62.6 ± 11.8, 3: 66.4 ± 10.2, 4: 67.6 ± 9.7; P < .0001) and had more hypertension (1: 53.0%, 2: 59.0%, 3: 53.8%, 4: 39.0%; P < .0001). For each strata of time increase, there was a direct increase of 1-year AF recurrence (1: 19.4%, 2: 23.4%, 3: 24.9%, 4: 24.0%: P trend = .02). After adjustment, clinically significant differences in risk of recurrent AF were found when compared to the 30–180 day time category: 181–545: odds ratio (OR) = 1.23, P = 0.08; 546–1825: OR = 1.27, P = 0.02; and > 1825: OR = 1.25, P = 0.05. No differences were observed for 1-year stroke among the groups. Death (1: 2.1%, 2: 3.9%, 3: 5.7%, 4: 4.4%: P trend = .001) and heart failure hospitalization (1: 2.6%, 2: 4.1%, 3: 5.4%, 4: 4.4%; P trend = .009) rates at 1 year were higher in the most delayed groups.

Conclusion

Delays in treatment with catheter ablation impact procedural success rates independent of temporal changes to the AF subtype at ablation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — evidence sources and study counts — are summarized. The efficacy of any type of ablation procedure can be determined from (1) single-center randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials, (2) multicenter randomized or nonrandomized clinical trials, (3) meta-analyses of single and multicenter clinical trials, and (4) physician surveys, and it is recognized that data derived from large prospective randomized clinical trials are the most reliable assessment of outcomes. There have been at least eight prospective randomized clinical trials that have investigated the outcomes of AF ablation, and in most of these trials AF ablation was randomized against pharmacologic therapy. Beyond randomized trials, there have been a large number of nonrandomized single-center and multicenter clinical trials, a number of meta-analyses, and two international surveys of the outcomes of AF ablation, including two International Physician Surveys that have been published.

Atrial fibrillation ablation — postprocedure follow-up and monitoring utilization are described as follows: the prior edition "advised that all patients who undergo ablation of AF, regardless of whether they are enrolled in a clinical trial, should be seen in follow-up at a minimum of 3 months following the ablation procedure, and then every 6 months for at least 2 years", and "A 12-lead ECG was recommended at all follow-ups". Real-world data reported that "one-third of the 12-month follow-up evaluations were performed by telephonic contact, only 87.2% of the patients had at least one ECG during the follow-up, and the patients with continuous monitoring of ≥ 24 hours… represented only 57.4% of the population".

Clinical/partial success is "a 75% or greater reduction" in AF burden, and long term success "is defined as freedom from AF/AFL/AT recurrences following the 3-month blanking period through a minimum of 36 months follow-up from the date of the ablation procedure in the absence of Class I and III AAD therapy". For outcomes reporting, "the development of atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter should be included", "All studies should report freedom from AF, atrial tachycardia, and atrial flutter", and studies "should also clearly specify the type and frequency of ECG monitoring as well as the degree of compliance with the prespecified monitoring protocol".

### Moving catheter ablation forward from paroxysmal to persistent atrial fibrillation: progress, limitations, and surprises of the SARA trial [^113Au4GA]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

What is the perspective on catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation after the SARA trial?

Nevertheless, despite these issues, SARA is the first prospective, randomized, multicentre study attempting to investigate this specific patient population. Despite all the limitations of the SARA trial discussed above, the study is an important piece of clinical science and helps to better understand the role of catheter ablation of persistent AF. Further studies in the same field are clearly needed to fill the knowledge gaps that remain open. Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation of symptomatic persistent AF after failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy as a class IIa level of evidence B indication. However, what is the benefit of ablation if symptoms do not improve? Is there any?

These issues and the limited number of patients enrolled in the study stop short of a change in the recommendations for persistent AF ablation. Because of the significant methodological limitations, the SARA trial should be considered hypothesis-generating rather than conclusive in the field of catheter ablation of persistent AF. Additional information from the currently ongoing CABANA and EAST trials with significantly larger study populations will hopefully answer the remaining questions, including longer term efficacy outcomes and impact of underlying disease on treatment effects, and clarify the effect of ablation on symptom relief and other quality of life outcome measures.

Anticoagulation Considerations Two or More Months Postablation

Whether elimination of AF or reduction of AF burden by catheter ablation results in a significant reduction in stroke risk is an important, and as yet unanswered, question. Until this important question is addressed by an adequately designed clinical trial, adherence to the AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended for patients who have undergone AF ablation procedures, regardless of the apparent success or failure of the procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO, Table 4). The writing group advises that decisions regarding continuation of systemic anticoagulation more than 2 months postablation should be based on a patient's stroke risk profile and not on the apparent success or failure of the ablation procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO, Table 4). And finally, the writing group recommends that for patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on the patient's values and preferences, they should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence (Class IIb, LOE C-EO, Table 4). This recommendation is based on the following: (1) recurrences of AF are common both early and late following AF ablation; (2) asymptomatic AF is common, and is more common following AF ablation than prior to AF ablation; (3) AF ablation destroys a portion of the atria and the impact of this on stroke risk is uncertain; (4) there have been no large, randomized prospective trials that have assessed the safety of discontinuing anticoagulation in this patient population; (5) studies have shown that strokes in patients with AF might not be temporaneously related to an AF event; and (6) the use of direct thrombin inhibitors or Factor Xa inhibitors, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban and apixaban, is more convenient than warfarin.

13 Peri‐Procedural Mortality

Among procedure‐related complications, early mortality accounts for up of 0.5% of patients. Accurate estimates of the true incidence of peri‐procedural mortality are difficult to obtain. The earliest documentation of its occurrence was reported about one decade after the introduction of this technique in clinical practice, and was based on a rather approximate, voluntary‐based contribution by centers contributing to a worldwide survey. At that time, the reported incidence of this complication was 0.5%. Since then, various studies have addressed this issue giving the perception that the incidence of peri‐procedural mortality was decreasing as investigator experience was growing. This is of great importance because of the increasing volume of procedures treating increasingly sicker patients with more complex substrates. However, the question remained whether the accuracy of data reported from single studies or multi‐center registries and surveys are representative of the true incidence of this complication in the real world.

A robust method for accurate assessment of peri‐procedural mortality was first introduced in 2013, when Deshmukh et al. reported on a large survey of in‐hospital complications associated with 93 801 AF ablation procedures in the United States between 2000 and 2010. Data was obtained from NIS data set representing a nation‐based survey conducted by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project in collaboration with the participating states. ICD‐9‐CM codes were used to identify each of the study diagnoses investigated. Trends in complications showed that in‐hospitalization death occurred at a rate of 0.42% and that this figure tended to be stable throughout the investigated period. Mortality rates were found to be higher in centers with lower patient volumes and less operator experience. Using a similar method (i.e. the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality — AHRQ), Cheng et al. reported an early mortality rate of 0.46% in 60 203 patients during the years 2000–2015 with 54% of deaths occurring during 30‐day readmission.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to atrioventricular nodal ablation, pacemaker placement, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to perform pacemaker implantation before the ablation (before or same day of ablation) to ensure adequacy of the pacing leads before performing ablation in patients with AF planned to undergo atrioventricular node ablation.

Mortality trials — large, multicenter randomized clinical trials are mandatory for determining the impact of therapy on mortality and other long-term outcomes, and such studies are held to a higher burden of proof and should require comparison of ablative therapy against best available drug therapy or other ablative interventions supported by extensive preexisting data. The CABANA trial is designed to enroll a sufficiently large number of patients over a long enough duration to determine if there is a mortality benefit to catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF), will investigate cardiovascular death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, and cardiac arrest, and will examine pharmacologic rate and rhythm control strategies and ablative intervention with the intention of eliminating AF while also gathering information on quality of life and health care resource utilization. Additionally, the EAST trial in Europe is gearing up to examine composite serious endpoints, including mortality and other major morbidities, and tests whether early rhythm control therapy on top of usual care can improve hard outcomes compared with usual care alone.

### Effect of catheter ablation vs medical therapy on quality of life among patients with atrial fibrillation: the CABANA randomized clinical trial [^114UUjK9]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Catheter ablation is more effective than drug therapy in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but its incremental effect on long-term quality of life (QOL) is uncertain.

Objective

To determine whether catheter ablation is more beneficial than conventional drug therapy for improving QOL in patients with AF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An open-label randomized clinical trial of catheter ablation vs drug therapy in 2204 symptomatic patients with AF older than 65 years or 65 years or younger with at least 1 risk factor for stroke. Patients were enrolled from November 2009 to April 2016 from 126 centers in 10 countries. Follow-up ended in December 2017.

Interventions

Pulmonary vein isolation, with additional ablation procedures at the discretion of the investigators, for the catheter ablation group (n = 1108) and standard rhythm and/or rate-control drugs selected and managed by investigators for the drug therapy group (n = 1096).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prespecified co-primary QOL end points at 12 months, including the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT) summary score (range, 0–100; 0 indicates complete disability and 100 indicates no disability; patient-level clinically important difference, ≥ 5 points) and the Mayo AF-Specific Symptom Inventory (MAFSI) frequency score (range, 0–40; 0 indicates no symptoms and 40 indicates the most severe symptoms; patient-level clinically important difference, ≤ -1.6 points) and severity score (range, 0–30; 0 indicates no symptoms and 30 indicates the most severe symptoms; patient-level clinically important difference, ≤ -1.3 points).

Results

Among 2204 randomized patients (median age, 68 years; 1385 patients [63%] were men, 946 [43%] had paroxysmal AF, and 1256 [57%] had persistent AF), the median follow-up was 48.5 months, and 1968 (89%) completed the trial. The mean AFEQT summary score was more favorable in the catheter ablation group than the drug therapy group at 12 months (86.4 points vs 80.9 points) (adjusted difference, 5.3 points [95% CI, 3.7–6.9]; P < .001). The mean MAFSI frequency score was more favorable for the catheter ablation group than the drug therapy group at 12 months (6.4 points vs 8.1 points) (adjusted difference, -1.7 points [95% CI, -2.3 to -1.2]; P < .001) and the mean MAFSI severity score was more favorable for the catheter ablation group than the drug therapy group at 12 months (5.0 points vs 6.5 points) (adjusted difference, -1.5 points [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation, compared with medical therapy, led to clinically important and significant improvements in quality of life at 12 months. These findings can help guide decisions regarding management of atrial fibrillation.

16 Summary and Future Directions

Adopting the growing request for rigor and transparency, the present document provides a concise scheme on Classes I–III recommendations relative to beneficial effects of catheter ablation of AF and of specific ablation strategies or techniques for which high‐quality evidence of greater benefit than risk is demonstrated. Consistent with the rigorous methods adopted, subclassifications and levels of evidence have been deleted with the aim of mitigating arbitrariness in document production. The copious ongoing research in the field, of which we have provided a custom‐built list for readers reference, will enrich our recommendation list in future guidelines, with the awareness that new paradigms may surface offering different base theories, methods of investigation and validation may subvert current guidelines' structure. The model used here is meant to preserve the original mission of guidelines to assist, not to impose practitioner decisions about appropriate health care and reconcile them with the true art of medicine. The rigor, simplicity and transparency of the present document may serve other societies in preparation guideline documents.

Consensus recommendations state that women suffering from symptomatic paroxysmal AF should be offered timely access to AF ablation when appropriate for medical reasons, and research priorities include that female patients with AF must be adequately represented in the future AF ablation trials and testing of 'safer' catheter techniques to minimize risks of AF ablation in women.

The writing group also recommends that adherence to AF anticoagulation guidelines is recommended for patients who have undergone an AF ablation procedure, regardless of the apparent success or failure of the procedure (Class I, LOE C-EO, Table 4). Patients in whom discontinuation of anticoagulation is being considered based on patient values and preferences should consider undergoing continuous or frequent ECG monitoring to screen for AF recurrence (Class IIb, LOE C-EO, Table 4). A patient's desire to eliminate the need for long-term anticoagulation by itself should not be considered an appropriate selection criterion for AF ablation. In arriving at this recommendation, the writing group recognizes that patients who have undergone catheter ablation of AF represent a new and previously unstudied population in trials of OAC therapy. Clinical trials are therefore needed to define the stroke risk of this patient population and to determine whether the risk factors identified in the CHA₂DS₂-VASc or other scoring systems apply to these patients. Please refer to Section 7 for a more detailed discussion of this topic and the writing group recommendations for long-term anticoagulation.

### Updated worldwide survey on the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation for human atrial fibrillation [^115vEs5K]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to provide an updated worldwide report on the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods and Results

A questionnaire with 46 questions was sent to 521 centers from 24 countries in 4 continents. Complete interviews were collected from 182 centers, of which 85 reported to have performed 20,825 catheter ablation procedures on 16,309 patients with AF between 2003 and 2006. The median number of procedures per center was 245 (range, 2 to 2715). All centers included paroxysmal AF, 85.9% also included persistent and 47.1% also included long-lasting AF. Carto-guided left atrial circumferential ablation (48.2% of patients) and Lasso-guided ostial electric disconnection (27.4%) were the most commonly used techniques. Efficacy data were analyzed with centers representing the unit of analysis. Of 16,309 patients with full disclosure of outcome data, 10 488 (median, 70.0%; interquartile range, 57.7% to 75.4%) became asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic drugs and another 2047 (10.0%; 0.5% to 17.1%) became asymptomatic in the presence of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs over 18 (range, 3 to 24) months of follow-up. Success rates free of antiarrhythmic drugs and overall success rates were significantly larger in 9590 patients with paroxysmal AF (74.9% and 83.2%) than in 2800 patients with persistent AF (64.8% and 75.0%) and 1108 patients with long-lasting AF (63.1% and 72.3%) (P < 0.0001). Major complications were reported in 741 patients (4.5%).

Conclusions

When analyzed in a large number of electrophysiology laboratories worldwide, catheter ablation of AF shows to be effective in approximately 80% of patients after 1.3 procedures per patient, with approximately 70% of them not requiring further antiarrhythmic drugs during intermediate follow-up.

11.3 "Hybrid" Rhythm Control Therapy

Important perspectives are available from real‐world experience to date. In a recent report spanning 14 years, newly diagnosed AF subjects' treatment patterns and final prescribed therapies were examined. 2 429 863 AF subjects with newly diagnosed AF (2007–2021) were followed, and 23 323 underwent ablation. Figure 15 shows the clinical pathway in these subjects. AF recurrences were common, and 14.2% had a second ablation procedure, with 83.4% having no further ablative intervention, only 2% had a third ablation, and 0.4% had more than three procedures. Antiarrhythmic drug prescription was frequent after a single ablation and after repeated ablation, with 46.9% requiring combination ablation and AAD therapy and increasing after repeated ablation. Of importance, in the absence of objective data and guidelines, amiodarone was the most prescribed drug.

Figure 15
Rhythm‐control strategies after catheter ablation: incidence of ablation, repeat ablation, and AAD use in a real‐world study cohort of 23 323 subjects with newly diagnosed AF from the United States (2007–2021) (Modified and reproduced with permission from).

While continuing development of technology, as well as the further evolution of the ablation procedure, may increase the efficacy of ablation, it may still not adequately address the AF‐HFpEF disease constellation on a public health basis, as seen in the above real‐world study 1% of newly diagnosed AF patients received ablation. In the immediate future, it is unlikely that ablation would replace all other therapies. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including, most importantly, the scale of this therapy to public need. With these trends of early intervention being adopted in current practice guidelines in AF and HF and the use of combination therapy, changes in future therapy are already happening. As a result, comparative prospective trials between individual rhythm control therapies may be difficult and perhaps less relevant as we move to a "hybrid" therapy approach. Another aspect is to interrupt the progression of AF, HFpEF, or both. For this, understanding the natural history of the condition is critical for timing interventions and future therapy. HFpEF progression to HFrEF is a poorly understood process. Similarly, AF progression to permanent AF is also unclear. It is also essential to assess competing risks, which become very relevant in this disease constellation. AF‐HFpEF is most common in septuagenarians and octogenarians, so other disease states often confer morbidity and morbidity and limit treatment options.

### 2012 HRS / EHRA / ECAS expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management and follow-up, definitions, endpoints, and research trial design [^112zv1iW]. Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation — standards for reporting outcomes in clinical trials specify that the primary end point is freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia off antiarrhythmic therapy, and time to recurrence is acceptable for research but may under-represent benefit; freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia at various points following ablation should be considered as a secondary endpoint. We recommend that single procedure outcomes be reported in all trials of AF ablation. Consistent monitoring techniques should be employed, and it is critical that an indication of percentage compliance with monitoring requirements be included in every published study of AF ablation. For efficacy reporting, the gold standard should remain freedom from AF/flutter/tachycardia of greater than 30 seconds' duration off all antiarrhythmic drugs, and if a duration of AF greater than 30 seconds is employed, a specific rationale for doing so should be provided. Because Kaplan-Meier analyses may underestimate true effectiveness, it is recommended that other alternative and/or secondary endpoints be reported in clinical trials; we would therefore propose that clinical trials also report AF/flutter/tachycardia at various points following ablation, and another endpoint that should be considered in clinical trials is an assessment of "AF burden".

Europace (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) clinical trial minimum success rates and follow-up screening — If a minimum chronic success rate is selected as an objective effectiveness endpoint for a clinical trial, we recommend that the minimum chronic acceptable success rate for paroxysmal AF at 12-month follow-up is 50%, for persistent AF at 12-month follow-up is 40%, and for longstanding persistent AF at 12-month follow-up is 30%. For paroxysmal AF, the minimum follow-up screening should include a 12-lead ECG at each follow-up visit, a 24-hour Holter at the end of the follow-up period (e.g. 12 months), and event recording from the end of the 3-month blanking period to the end of follow-up (e.g. 12 months). For persistent and longstanding persistent AF, minimum screening should include a 12-lead ECG at each follow-up visit, a 24-hour Holter every 6 months, and symptom-driven event monitoring.

### Regional differences in outcomes with ablation versus drug therapy for atrial fibrillation: results from the CABANA trial [^116F1sX8]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The finding of unexpected variations in treatment benefits by geographic region in international clinical trials raises complex questions about the interpretation and generalizability of trial findings. We observed such geographical variations in outcome and in the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation versus drug therapy in the Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial. This paper describes these differences and investigates potential causes.

Methods

The examination of treatment effects by geographic region was a prespecified analysis. CABANA enrolled patients from 10 countries, with 1,285 patients at 85 North American (NA) sites and 919 at 41 non-NA sites. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Death and first atrial fibrillation recurrence were secondary endpoints.

Results

At least 1 primary endpoint event occurred in 157 patients (12.2%) from NA and 33 (3.6%) from non-NA sites over a median 54.9 and 40.5 months of follow-up, respectively (NA/non-NA adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48–3.21, P < .001). In NA patients, 78 events occurred in the ablation and 79 in the drug arm, (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66, 1.24) while 11 and 22 events occurred in non-NA patients (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.25,1.05, interaction P = 0.154). Death occurred in 53 ablation and 51 drug therapy patients in the NA group (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.65,1.42) and in 5 ablation and 16 drug therapy patients in the non-NA group (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12,0.86, interaction P = 0.044). Adjusting for baseline regional differences or prognostic risk variables did not account for the regional differences in treatment effects. Atrial fibrillation recurrence was reduced by ablation in both regions (NA: HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.46, 0.63; non-NA: HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30, 0.64, interaction P = 0.322).

Conclusions

In CABANA, primary outcome events occurred significantly more often in the NA group but assignment to ablation significantly reduced all-cause mortality in the non-NA group only. These differences were not explained by regional variations in procedure effectiveness, safety, or patient characteristics.

Long-Term Ablation Efficacy

During the past decade, a large number of studies have been published that have examined the important issue of the long-term efficacy of AF ablation. Prior to this time, most clinical studies presented data from short-term follow-ups, often less than 12 months in duration. The first of these studies was published 5 years ago and described the long-term outcomes of a series of 264 patients who were AF-free and off AAD therapy at the 12-month point following an initial ablation procedure. During a mean follow-up of 28 ± 12 months, AF recurred in 23 patients (8.7%). The actuarial recurrence rate of AF at 5 years was 25.5%. Similar findings have been reported in each of the subsequent trials. The predictors of late recurrence most commonly identified include persistent AF as well as comorbid conditions. Despite the low single-procedure, long-term success rate reported in virtually all of these clinical trials, they also reveal that with the use of repeat AF ablation procedures and/or AAD therapy, much higher rates of freedom from recurrent AF as well as concomitant reductions in AF burden can be achieved.

Impact of Catheter Ablation of AF on QOL

Because symptomatic improvement is a primary objective in the treatment of patients with AF, formal assessments of QOL have played an increasingly important role in the evaluation of ablation outcomes. These measures can provide a more global reflection of symptom change, symptomatic arrhythmia burden, and the difference between actual and desired health and function than more focused endpoints of rhythm status at specific points in time. Generic tools, such as the SF-36 health survey, which is applicable to a broad range of disease states and health conditions, and disease-specific questionnaires, developed to assess symptom burden in patients with arrhythmias, have been most widely employed.

Patients with AF, as reflected by standardized SF-36 scores, have substantially impaired QOL, below population norms and comparable to patients with coronary artery disease and congestive HF. A number of single-center, nonrandomized observational studies of AF ablation have demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in QOL scores following catheter ablation. Taken alone, these findings need to be interpreted cautiously, because in the absence of a comparison group or treatment blinding, placebo effects cannot be excluded. Two studies demonstrated that over a 12-month period following treatment, changes in QOL scores were strongly related to the presence or absence of documented AF recurrence within the previous 30 days.

AF catheter ablation — indications and first-line use in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL): In patients with symptomatic AF in whom antiarrhythmic drugs have been ineffective, contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred, and continued rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful to improve symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In selected patients (generally younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF in whom rhythm control is desired, catheter ablation is useful as first-line therapy to improve symptoms and reduce progression to persistent AF (Class 1, Level A). In patients with symptomatic or clinically significant AFL, catheter ablation is useful for improving symptoms (Class 1, Level A). In patients who are undergoing ablation for AF, ablation of additional clinically significant supraventricular arrhythmias can be useful to reduce the likelihood of future atrial arrhythmias (Class 2a, Level B-NR). In patients (other than younger with few comorbidities) with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF who are being managed with a rhythm-control strategy, catheter ablation as first-line therapy can be useful to improve symptoms (Class 2a, Level B-R).

ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS 2023 — Synopsis and epidemiology of AFL and post-ablation AF risk: AFL is a common atrial arrhythmia with a reported overall incidence of 88 per 100 000 person-years, and the incidence increases with age; it is 2.5 times more common in men than in women and is more likely with underlying heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Because of the high effectiveness of CTI ablation, many physicians may elect to discontinue oral anticoagulation > 1 month after ablation in the absence of previously detected AF, but subsequent AF after CTI-dependent AFL ablation has been reported as 34% over 14 months. Non–CTI-dependent or "atypical" AFL or atrial tachycardia after AF ablation should be anticoagulated and managed in a manner similar to AF, and this section refers to treatment of "typical" (CTI-dependent) AFL.

Global Trends and Differences in AF Treatments

There are notable variations in AF treatment and outcomes between different patient and country populations. Some of this variation is due to the availability of medications and interventions that, in turn, are dependent on resource availability and differences in healthcare systems (eg, national healthcare systems, private health insurance, or a mixture of both). In general, AF treatments are directed towards symptom reduction, typically via heart rate or rhythm control, and the prevention of complications, such as arterial thromboembolism. Rate and/or rhythm‐control treatments include heart rate controlling medications, antiarrhythmic medications, electrical cardioversion, or AF ablation. Thromboembolism prevention treatments include antithrombotic medications and mechanical left atrial appendage occlusion devices.

The use of rate and rhythm‐control treatments varies globally, both in the developed and developing world. In the Euro Heart Survey, 65% of AF patients received rate‐control medication, 40% received antiarrhythmic medication, and 12% received neither. 21 In contrast, a German AF registry — the Central Registry of German Competence Network on Atrial Fibrillation (AFNET) — demonstrated that only 21.3% of patients received antiarrhythmic medication, but 53.4% received electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion and 5% underwent AF ablation. 22 Chinese data demonstrated variable use of rate‐control treatments, partly dependent on the AF phenotype. 23, 24 Among those with paroxysmal AF, 44% of patients received rate‐control treatment, compared to 83% of patients with permanent AF. These differences likely result from a variety of factors, including availability of more advanced and technically complex treatments, such as AF ablation. 25 In the developing world, rate‐control treatments, particularly digoxin, dominate the use of antiarrhythmic medications, given their low cost and wide availability. For example, recent surveys of AF treatments in Cameroon found that 83% of patients were being treated with rate‐control medications, with over 60% receiving digoxin. 26 Similarly, over 50% of Kenyan patients on rate‐control therapy were receiving digoxin. 27 However, better characterization of rate‐control treatments, especially in developing countries, is needed. In addition, as newer technologies such as AF ablation gain traction in these countries, registries will be needed to guide their safe and effective deployment.

RESULTS

Survey Response and Physician Profiling

The survey completion rate (all questions answered) was 7% in the United States and 16% in Europe (Table 1). A total of 629 physicians completed the survey, of 6428 approached, with similar characteristics between the global population, the United States, and Europe (Table 2). Overall, the proportion of cardiologists (57%) was higher than that of electrophysiologists (43%), with 80% reporting a specialization in AF. At the time of the survey, respondents had been qualified in their specialty for an average of 14.5 years. The most common clinical practice setting was a university hospital/clinic (40% global; 31% United States, 49% Europe) or a general community hospital/clinic (37% global; 33% United States, 40% Europe). Over a typical 3‐month period (before the COVID‐19 pandemic), the average total cardiology patient caseload, including all diagnoses and conditions, was 549; the average caseload of follow‐up patients was greater than the average caseload of new patients with AF (158 versus 94, respectively). Most respondents referred patients for ablation, rather than performing ablations themselves (55% versus 45%, respectively).

Overall, 97% of respondents stated that they follow guidelines for their treatment decisions. Approximately half (49%) of the respondents primarily referred to the AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, for their decision making, with 43% referring to the ESC guidelines. Overwhelmingly, US respondents chose the AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines, as their primary reference (96%), although 20% also referred to the ESC guidelines. European respondents generally chose the ESC guidelinesas their primary reference (82%), with 32% also referring to the AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines. Guidelines were chosen as the first and second most important nonpatient factor that influenced treatment strategy by 54% and 28% of respondents, respectively; other scientific literature was chosen by 23% and 41%, respectively. Most respondents (65%), including 58% of European respondents, were unsure whether the 2020 ESC guidelineupdate had influenced their survey responses.

1 Introduction

1.1. Document Scope and Rationale

The field of electrophysiology has undergone rapid progress in the last decade, with advances both in our understanding of the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and in the technology used to treat them. In 2009, a joint task force of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), in collaboration with the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), produced an expert consensus document that outlined the state of the field and defined the indications, techniques, and outcome measures of VA ablation. In light of advances in the treatment of VAs in the interim, and the growth in the number of VA ablations performed in many countries and regions, an updated document is needed. This effort represents a worldwide partnership between transnational cardiac electrophysiology societies, namely, HRS, EHRA, the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), and the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS), and collaboration with ACC, AHA, the Japanese Heart Rhythm Society (JHRS), the Brazilian Society of Cardiac Arrhythmias (Sociedade Brasileira de Arritmias Cardíacas [SOBRAC]), and the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES). The consensus statement was also endorsed by the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS).

This clinical document is intended to supplement, not replace, the 2017 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death and the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death. The scope of the current document relates to ablation therapy for VAs, from premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and triggers of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Due to its narrower scope, the consensus statement delves into greater detail with regard to indications and technical aspects of VA ablation than the above-mentioned guidelines.

Where possible, the recommendations in this document are evidence based. It is intended to set reasonable standards that can be applicable worldwide, while recognizing the different resources, technological availability, disease prevalence, and health care delivery logistics in various parts of the world. In addition, parts of this document, particularly Section 9, present a practical guide on how to accomplish the procedures described in a manner that reflects the current standard of care, while recognizing that some procedures are better performed, and some disease states better managed, in settings in which there is specific expertise.

### Development of an international standard set of outcome measures for patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the international consortium for health outcomes measurement (ICHOM) atrial fibrillation working group [^111gxhYM]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The notion of 'value' in healthcare has taken on increasing importance over the last 15 years. Value may be defined within the healthcare context as patient-relevant outcomes divided by the costs per patient across the full cycle of care. As healthcare systems worldwide work to improve the value of care that they provide to patients, particularly in the context of growing demands on providers amid significant resource constraints, being able to measure outcomes important to patients is crucial. Although clinicians gather more data today than ever before, what is measured may have little relationship to the goals of healthcare that matter most to patients. The ability to define 'value' in healthcare is, therefore, not straightforward.

A challenge related to value in healthcare is that its measurement relies on the validity and robustness of measurements. A good source of robust clinical outcomes and their definitions is found in clinical trials and in the output of major registries. Efforts to report outcomes of routine AF care exist already. For example, there are a number of large registries reporting on thromboprophylaxis and stroke prevention, some that report on antiarrhythmic drug therapy and cardioversion, and a few on ablation. Some international societies have produced position papers and guidelines in an attempt to standardize care across their jurisdictions. Although several position papers have been published attempting to do so, there is no single internationally accepted standardized approach to report outcomes of care in AF. A fully standardized approach would include both the outcomes that are measured as well as the process of measurement and recording, e.g. using electronic health records. While survival or hospitalization outcomes are frequently recorded, patient-reported outcomes are still rarely measured and/or recorded despite increasing recognition of their importance in disease management. The lack of a standardized approach hinders routine monitoring and benchmarking of different clinical practices. To support the development of a standardized outcome set in AF for integration into routine clinical practice, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) convened an international multidisciplinary Working Group (WG) of experts and patient representatives. As a not-for-profit organization, ICHOM has developed 27 standard sets of value-based outcomes for use in routine clinical practice in various medical conditions, such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and cancer (including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer). Over 600 organizations have implemented ICHOM sets including 15 national registries. Standard sets are reviewed and updated annually by ICHOM.

### Strategy optimization for a combined procedure in patients with AF… [^1157uwXz]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the effects of ablation-first vs occlusion-first strategies on long-term clinical outcomes among patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing a combined LAAO and CA procedure. Design, Setting, and Participants The prospective, multicenter COMBINATION randomized clinical trial was conducted in 14 high-volume centers in China. Enrollment of patients with nonvalvular AF referred for the combined procedure began on July 24, 2020, and concluded on January 20, 2022. Strategy Optimization for the Combined Procedure of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion and Catheter Ablation in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, open-label, nonblinded randomized clinical trial conducted at 14 high-volume centers in China. Patient enrollment began on July 24, 2020, and concluded on January 20, 2022. Acute complete sealing was
84. 5% in the ablation-first group and 92. 8% in the occlusion-first group, respectively.

The maximum widths of acute PDL were similar between groups. Obvious ridge edema was observed for most case patients in the ablation-first group during intraprocedural TEE. There were no statistically significant differences in mean LAAO time and fluoroscopic exposure between groups. The majority of participants in the ablation-first and occlusion-first groups completed TEE or CCTA during follow-up. The ablation-first group exhibited a higher incidence of chronic PDL and DRT. Compared with staged procedures, the combined approach offers several distinct advantages. First, the shortened duration of hospitalization and anticoagulation reduces overall hospitalization time and long-term anticoagulation therapy, lowering bleeding risk.

5 Second, a decreased incidence of symptomatic arrhythmic events observed with the combined approach results in fewer symptomatic arrhythmic events than LAAO alone or post-AF ablation. Our study found a lower compression ratio in the ablation-first group. This lower ratio was linked to higher primary end point incidence and more chronic PDL during follow-up.

### Outcomes for electrophysiological catheter ablation… [^113QHdRC]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

During the 92 848 710 hospitalizations, 115 955 catheter ablations were performed. The mean patient age was 60. 6 years,
43. 8% of patients were female, and 52. 3% of procedures were elective. There were 708 in-hospital deaths reported in patients who underwent ablation during the index admission. This is comparable to the overall mortality of all admissions during the same period of 2. 2%. There was no difference in mortality for patients undergoing catheter ablation based on the year of the ablation. Ablation was listed as the primary procedure in 72. 5% of cases. The total number of ablations and hospital admissions over the study period within the NIS database are shown in Figure 2. Previously reported mortality rates for catheter ablation have ranged from
0. 1% to 0. 3%. 1–3 This study demonstrates that the in-hospital mortality on admissions where catheter ablation was performed was 0. 6%.

This likely overestimates the mortality of ablation because this includes all deaths during the index hospitalization, regardless of the association with the ablation. No significant trend was demonstrated in ablation-related mortality over the 11-year period and was lower than the mean mortality rate of all NIS admissions. The actual mortality associated with ablation should be no higher than these data demonstrate and is likely lower. Only in-hospital ablations are considered, so the actual mortality of all ablations may be lower. The NIS database element of elective status was reported in the Results section to attempt to account for this. In addition, ablations are heterogeneous; thus the overall complication rate is sensitive to the mix of procedures. In conclusion, there is a 0. 6% risk of in-hospital mortality and as high as a 15% risk of complications associated with catheter ablation.

Because the causes of mortality and potential complications are unknown, these rates represent the upper bounds of ablation-related mortality and morbidity. These results should inform discussions of potential procedural risk between an electrophysiologist and a patient considering ablation procedures. Conflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported. Previous Presentation: These data were presented at the Wisconsin–American College of Cardiology annual meeting; November 10, 2012; Kohler, Wisconsin.
