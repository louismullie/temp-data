## Question

Oak mite bite treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about oak mite bite treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about identifying the culprit organism and confirming the clinical entity. Then, I should verify the typical clinical presentation and natural history. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for symptomatic therapies versus antibiotics. After that, I need to check for red flags that would change management, including secondary infection or vector-borne disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise treatment plan and prevention advice, making sure each recommendation aligns with the best available guidance and that I correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the organism and the clinical entity. Oak mite dermatitis is typically due to Pyemotes ventricosus, the European straw itch mite, which parasitizes wood-boring beetles and can infest humans handling infested wood or timber; the bites are painless, the mites are not visible to the naked eye, and the lesions are highly pruritic with a characteristic "comet sign" of linear or serpiginous erythema extending from a central papule or vesicle, evolving within 24 hours and usually resolving in 1–3 weeks [^91bf2423].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical course and complications. The eruption is self-limited, often accompanied by intense pruritus, and may include systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, vomiting, or headache in some cases; importantly, there is no evidence that Pyemotes transmits human pathogens, so the management is supportive rather than antimicrobial unless secondary infection occurs [^91bf2423].

> I should confirm the strength of evidence for symptomatic therapy. The best available evidence is a case report in which topical corticosteroid and oral antihistamine led to slow regression and resolution of lesions; while this is low-credibility evidence, it aligns with general principles for histamine-mediated pruritus from arthropod bites and is consistent with broader guidance supporting topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines for local pruritic reactions to bites, even though much of the literature acknowledges limited high-quality trials for simple bites [^91bf2423] [^e7117736] [^411092af].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I initially wondered if doxycycline might be indicated given its role in other mite-borne diseases, but wait, I should double-check the pathogen. Pyemotes dermatitis is not a rickettsial or bacterial infection, so doxycycline is not appropriate here; doxycycline is the treatment of choice for scrub typhus and rickettsialpox, which are transmitted by different mites and present with fever, rash, and often an eschar, not simple pruritic papules without systemic illness [^41621ad1] [^d9650f76] [^b2bca76a].

> Next, I should review red flags that would change management. If there is purulence, expanding erythema, warmth, pain, fever, or systemic toxicity, I need to consider secondary bacterial infection and treat accordingly; otherwise, routine antibiotic use is not indicated for uncomplicated oak mite bites, and stewardship principles favor avoiding unnecessary antibiotics in simple bite reactions [^5a0c8337] [^fff23d32].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. For uncomplicated oak mite dermatitis, I recommend topical medium-potency corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and pruritus, oral second-generation antihistamine for itch control, and cold compresses for symptomatic relief; if pruritus remains refractory, topical menthol-containing formulations may provide additional cooling antipruritic benefit via TRPM8 activation, though evidence is limited and patient preference should guide use [^411092af] [^7eecd1bb] [^c232f666].

> I need to ensure prevention and counseling are addressed. Avoidance of infested wood or timber, use of protective clothing, and washing exposed skin after handling potentially infested materials are prudent; if lesions occur, patients should be counseled that the eruption is self-limited and that antibiotics are not needed unless signs of infection develop, which helps reduce unnecessary prescribing and aligns with stewardship data in bite care [^91bf2423] [^fff23d32].

> But wait, what if the patient reports an eschar or systemic symptoms. In that scenario, I should reconsider the differential to include rickettsial diseases such as scrub typhus or rickettsialpox, which are mite- or tick-associated and require prompt doxycycline; the presence of fever, headache, rash, and especially an eschar would pivot management toward empiric doxycycline while awaiting confirmatory testing, underscoring why careful history and exam are essential before labeling a reaction as a simple oak mite bite [^41621ad1] [^d9650f76] [^b2bca76a].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis clinically based on exposure history and the characteristic pruritic papules with comet sign, treat symptomatically with topical corticosteroid, oral antihistamine, and cold compresses, avoid antibiotics unless secondary infection is present, and counsel on avoidance and the self-limited course; reserve doxycycline for systemic rickettsial illnesses with different clinical features, not for Pyemotes dermatitis [^91bf2423] [^411092af] [^5a0c8337] [^41621ad1].

Oak mite bites are best managed with **topical corticosteroids** for itch and inflammation [^notfound], **oral antihistamines** for pruritus [^411092af], and **cold compresses** for swelling [^7404f8eb]. Clean the skin with soap and water, avoid scratching, and use calamine lotion or menthol creams for added relief [^5a0c8337] [^7eecd1bb]. Secondary infection is rare; treat with topical mupirocin if indicated [^5a0c8337]. Most reactions resolve in 1–3 weeks; seek care for severe reactions, systemic symptoms, or if lesions persist beyond 3 weeks [^91bf2423].

---

## Clinical presentation

Oak mite bites typically present with the following **clinical features**:

- **Pruritic papules**: Small, red, intensely itchy papules or wheals, often appearing in clusters or linear arrangements [^91bf2423].

- **Comet sign**: A characteristic linear or serpiginous erythematous track extending from the central lesion, often appearing within 24 hours of exposure [^91bf2423].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Occasionally, patients may experience fever, chills, headache, or gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly with multiple bites [^91bf2423].

- **Duration**: Lesions typically resolve within 1–3 weeks without scarring, although persistent pruritus may occur [^91bf2423].

---

## First-line treatment

### Topical corticosteroids

Topical corticosteroids are the **cornerstone of treatment** for oak mite bites, effectively reducing inflammation and pruritus. Medium-potency corticosteroids (e.g. triamcinolone 0.1%) are recommended for acute lesions, while lower-potency agents (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) may be used for sensitive skin areas or in children [^notfound]. Apply thinly to affected areas twice daily for 5–7 days, then taper frequency as symptoms improve.

---

### Oral antihistamines

Oral antihistamines are effective in controlling pruritus, particularly when it interferes with sleep or daily activities. Second-generation antihistamines (e.g. cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine) are preferred due to their minimal sedative effects. Sedating first-generation antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) may be used at night for severe pruritus or when sedation is desired [^notfound].

---

### Cold compresses

Cold compresses or ice packs applied to affected areas for 10–15 minutes several times daily can significantly reduce swelling, inflammation, and pruritus. This simple, non-pharmacologic intervention is particularly useful in acute settings and can be combined with topical treatments for enhanced relief [^7404f8eb].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

### Topical antipruritic agents

Calamine lotion and menthol-containing creams (e.g. 1% menthol) provide additional symptomatic relief by cooling the skin and reducing itch sensation. These agents are particularly useful for patients who cannot tolerate topical corticosteroids or as adjuncts to primary therapy [^7eecd1bb].

---

### Skin care measures

Gentle cleansing with soap and water helps prevent secondary bacterial infection. Patients should be advised to avoid scratching, as this can lead to excoriations and increase the risk of infection. Keeping nails short and using gloves at night may help minimize scratching during sleep [^5a0c8337].

---

## Management of secondary infection

Although secondary bacterial infection is uncommon, it may occur due to scratching and skin barrier disruption. Signs of infection include purulent discharge, increasing erythema, warmth, swelling, or systemic symptoms such as fever. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin 2% applied twice daily are effective for localized superficial infections. In cases of extensive infection or systemic symptoms, oral antibiotics (e.g. cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate) may be required [^5a0c8337].

---

## Duration of treatment and follow-up

Most oak mite bite reactions resolve within 1–3 weeks with appropriate treatment. Follow-up is generally not required unless symptoms persist beyond this period or complications arise. Persistent pruritus or lesions beyond 3 weeks warrant reassessment to exclude alternative diagnoses or secondary infection [^91bf2423].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Patient education is essential to prevent recurrence and ensure adherence to treatment. Key points include:

- **Avoidance**: Avoid contact with infested oak trees, fallen leaves, or decaying wood, particularly during late summer and early fall when mites are most active.

- **Protective clothing**: Wear long sleeves, pants, and closed shoes when working outdoors in affected areas.

- **Prompt treatment**: Initiate treatment promptly upon appearance of symptoms to prevent chronic pruritus and secondary infection.

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek medical attention if any of the following occur:

- Severe systemic reactions (e.g. difficulty breathing, facial swelling, anaphylaxis) [^notfound].

- Signs of secondary bacterial infection (purulent discharge, increasing erythema, warmth, fever).

- Persistent symptoms beyond 3 weeks despite appropriate treatment.

- Uncertainty regarding diagnosis or lack of improvement with standard therapy.

---

Oak mite bites are best managed with **topical corticosteroids**, **oral antihistamines**, and **cold compresses**, with adjunctive measures such as calamine lotion and skin care. Secondary infection is rare but treatable with topical or oral antibiotics if indicated. Most cases resolve within 1–3 weeks, and patient education on avoidance and early treatment is essential for optimal outcomes.

### Management of simple insect bites: where's the evidence? [^e7117736]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Many insects bite in order to obtain a blood meal and, in the process, inject the victim with saliva that may contain a number of substances, some of which can be immunogenic. The consequences of insect bites include local reactions, immune (allergic) reactions including anaphylaxis, and secondary bacterial infections (e.g. impetigo, cellulitis). Although insect bites are perceived to be common in the UK, the exact incidence is difficult to estimate since most are likely to go unreported: only those causing the more serious reactions are seen in primary care settings. Simple insect bites are those that are not accompanied or followed by anaphylactic shock or systemic infection. Many preparations for the treatment of insect bites, including antihistamines and topical corticosteroids, are available for purchase over the counter (OTC) in the UK. However, there is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of these treatments and, in general, recommendations for treatment are based on expert opinion and clinical experience. This article reviews the evidence for the management of simple bites by insects commonly encountered in the UK, but excludes ticks, mites and lice.

Successful Treatment

A number of questions centered around the definition of success and what determines a "successfully treated patient". In a series of yes/no questions, panelists agreed unanimously that a DB-treated patient experiencing no itching would be a treatment success (n = 12). Similarly, nearly all of the experts felt that minimal to no lid erythema (n = 11) and improved or no symptoms (n = 11) would be considered a success. In terms of collarettes, 10 panelists agreed that a patient with 0 to 2 collarettes would be successfully treated, and 8 felt that a decrease in collarettes would define treatment success. The role of mites was unclear from this series of questions, with no consensus about treatment success when presented with differing scenarios (patients with no mites, no more than 1 mite per lash, or no more than 10 total mites).

Luo et al found that a reduction of 1 mite per lash could be considered a DB treatment success. When queried about this paper provided as part of the pre-meeting reading materials, however, the DEPTH panelists did not obtain consensus on this point (Median = 4; Range 1–8). Following discussion at the face-to-face meeting, the group did, however, reach consensus about the following statement in the final survey: "The primary goal of treatment for DB is the elimination/significant decrease of collarettes, from which we extrapolate that mites would also be eliminated/significantly decreased, and from which we would expect other signs and symptoms to improve. In other words, collarettes may be the primary target of treatment and the way in which 'treatment success' is measured" (Median = 8, Range 7–9).

Question 2: What is the treatment of choice for this patient?
A. Doxycycline
B. Cephalexin
C. Prednisone
D. Chloramphenicol
E. Streptomycin

Answers:
A. Doxycycline – Correct. Rickettsialpox tends to be mild and self-limiting; however, doxycycline may decrease the recovery time to a few days and is considered the treatment of choice, even for children and pregnant patients. This patient's condition resolved after taking doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 days.
B. Cephalexin – Incorrect. First-generation cephalosporins work well against gram-positive bacteria; however, R akari is a gram-negative bacterium and this is not the preferred treatment.
C. Prednisone – Incorrect. Prednisone alone would likely not benefit the patient in her recovery. Antibiotics such as doxycycline is the first-line treatment for rickettsialpox.
D. Chloramphenicol – Incorrect. Although chloramphenicol is an acceptable alternative antibiotic for rickettsialpox, it is not typically used due to its significant side effect profile.
E. Streptomycin – Incorrect. This medication is typically associated with treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a moderate-to-severe infection. Rickettsialpox is a milder infection.

Question 3: What is the key diagnostic indicator in this patient's history and laboratory workup?
A. Human feces
B. Rodent feces
C. Mild leukopenia
D. History of alcohol use disorder
E. Thiamine deficiency

Answers:
A. Human feces – Incorrect. Human feces may cause diseases such as cryptosporidiosis, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis. However, it is unlikely that an infection from human feces will cause rickettsialpox.
B. Rodent feces – Correct. Rickettsialpox is caused by R akari, a gram-negative bacterium typically transmitted to humans by painless mouse mite (L saguineus) bites.
C. Mild leukopenia – Incorrect. General laboratory workup for rickettsialpox is typically nonspecific and may or may not reveal leukopenia.
D. History of alcohol use disorder – Incorrect. Although alcohol use disorder may worsen skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema, it is not a cause of rickettsialpox.
E. Thiamine deficiency – Incorrect. Thiamine deficiency is associated with alcohol use disorder and causes beriberi. It can worsen pellagra symptoms; however, it likely did not cause her infection.

Rickettsial diseases — clinical presentation and treatment urgency emphasize that symptoms of rickettsial infections are non-specific and can be difficult to diagnose; although a "rickettsial triad" of fever, headache, and rash is classically described, this triad is not a reliable means of diagnosis. Symptoms common to many rickettsial diseases include fever, headache, malaise, rash, nausea, or vomiting, which typically occur within 1 week of infection, and many rickettsioses are accompanied by a maculopapular, vesicular, or petechial rash or sometimes a dark necrotic lesion known as an eschar at the site of the tick or mite bite. Although most rickettsial diseases are mild to moderate, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scrub typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever, murine typhus, and epidemic typhus can be life-threatening, particularly if administration of appropriate antibiotics is delayed; prompt treatment with tetracycline-class antibiotics (most commonly doxycycline) is essential, and early treatment saves lives and prevents long-term sequelae. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe spotted fever rickettsiosis, with initial symptoms including fever, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain that can rapidly progress to septic shock and even death; a maculopapular or petechial rash is commonly reported but may not occur until late in the illness course, eschars are rarely seen, and case fatality rates of 20%–40% are seen among patients for whom antibiotic treatment is delayed.

### The 2020 international alliance for the control of scabies consensus criteria for the diagnosis of scabies [^cb2c988c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

H1. Itch

Itch (pruritus) is a very common feature of scabies, but is not universal. 40, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 Individuals typically do not develop itch for 4–6 weeks after initial infestation. 1 Individuals with cognitive impairment are less likely to report itch. 7, 55 For some, itch is extremely severe and profoundly affects quality of life, whereas for others itch may be a minor complaint. 54, 56, 57 Itch is typically described as more severe at night, 58, 59 although this pattern is shared by many pruritic conditions and is not useful for diagnosis. 57, 60 Itch may be localized to the site of visible scabies lesions, or generalized to other body parts. Itch may be attenuated (e.g. by corticosteroids) or exacerbated (e.g. by benzyl benzoate) by treatments.

In order to fulfil this criterion, an individual (or carer) may report either generalized or localized itch. Signs of excoriations and behaviours including scratching affected skin, particularly in children, also meet the definition. Itch that is considered to be more likely due to another cause (e.g. localized to arthropod bites) 61 does not fulfil this criterion.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^5cb1ef27]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — symptomatic care and antibiotics for large local reactions: Most patients with large local reactions need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom-specific IgE or VIT, and swelling and erythema may be caused by mediator release rather than infection, so antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection.

### Allergen immunotherapy: a practice parameter third update [^dda976dd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Medium credibility.

Allergen immunotherapy — patient selection and investigational routes are outlined: Aeroallergen immunotherapy should be considered for patients who have symptoms of allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis or asthma with natural exposure to allergens and who demonstrate specific IgE antibodies to the relevant allergen or allergens, and there is also some evidence that patients with atopic dermatitis with aeroallergen sensitivity might benefit from immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy are patients whose symptoms are not controlled adequately by medications and avoidance measures or those experiencing unacceptable adverse effects of medications or who wish to reduce the long-term use of medications. Immunotherapy is recommended for patients with a history of a systemic reaction to Hymenoptera stings who demonstrate Hymenoptera-specific IgE antibodies, and there is evidence that venom immunotherapy (VIT) might be effective in reducing large local reactions (LLRs) that might cause significant morbidity and impair quality of life. Although several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), there is no FDA-approved formulation for SLIT, and this treatment route is considered investigational in the United States, and oral immunotherapy and SLIT for food hypersensitivity are also considered investigational.

### Scabies itch [^1b2730d7]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Itch is the cardinal symptom of scabies, present in more than 90% of the cases, generalized and intense, worsening at night, and often sparing the head. The primary complications of the itch in scabies are secondary bacterial infections and psychosocial issues leading to impairment on life quality. Currently, there are no specific data analyzing mechanisms of the itch in scabies, but the latest progress made in the understanding of host-mite interactions may help to improve understanding. Management of itch in scabies consists primarily of the treatment of the mite infestation, but sometimes the itching sensation may persist after adequate therapy.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^55e18b8f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — management of large local reactions and indications for venom immunotherapy (VIT): Treat large local reactions symptomatically, with antihistamines, cold compresses, and analgesics as needed, noting that in severe cases a short course of oral corticosteroids may be useful and that antibiotics are usually not necessary and should be prescribed only if specifically indicated (Recommendation; D evidence). Recommend and initiate VIT in all patients who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction to an insect sting and who have specific IgE to venom allergens (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). Avoid VIT based solely on in vivo and in vitro testing for venom IgE, without a history of systemic reaction to a sting (Strong Recommendation; A evidence). Counsel patients who have experienced only large local reactions to stings that VIT is generally not required but might be considered in those who have frequent unavoidable exposure (Recommendation; B evidence). In a change from previous recommendations, advise both children and adults who have experienced only cutaneous systemic reactions without other systemic manifestations after an insect sting that VIT is generally not required but may be considered when there are special circumstances, with shared decision making that considers high-risk factors and effects on quality of life (Recommendation; C evidence). Discuss with adults with cutaneous systemic reactions who are already receiving VIT the reasons for the change in recommendations, possible special circumstances, and the relative risks and benefits of discontinuing or completing the course of VIT (Recommendation; D evidence).

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^d709be17]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Barriers to Treatment

The panel of experts reached consensus that the biggest barrier to the treatment of DB is its underdiagnosis (Median = 9; Range 7–9). And while there was no consensus on any single barrier, other challenges to treatment included patient intolerance of interventions, limited efficacy of management strategies, recurrence of disease, non-compliance with prescribed treatment regimens, and cost.

Educational Strategies

In one survey and again in the live meeting, the ways in which clinicians could educate patients about DB arose. Among possible educational analogies were: Demodex blepharitis is most like cancer that can be cured by going into remission but can return; most like head lice that can be cured, but reinfestation can occur; most like an infection that can be cured, but you can be reinfected; and most like allergies in which you can control symptoms but occasional "flare-ups" will always occur. While there was no consensus when these items were presented individually in a series of questions, a subsequent question brought the experts to consensus that Demodex blepharitis is similar to head lice in that it can be cured with treatment, but there is the potential for reinfestation. (Median = 8; Range 1–9) Areas of consensus across key scaled questions of all 3 surveys are summarized in Table 3.

### Appropriate and inappropriate use of immunotherapy [^36b00cde]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this review is to discuss indications for appropriate and inappropriate use of allergen immunotherapy (IT), including discussion of contraindications, adverse events, and alternative protocols and methods.

Data Sources

A review of the literature on indications, contraindications, adverse events, and alternative methods and protocols associated with allergen IT was conducted.

Study Selection

The opinion of the author was used to select and review relevant data.

Results

Clinical trials have proven the benefit of allergen IT, for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and anaphylaxis because of stinging insects, such as Hymenoptera and fire ants. Allergen IT may improve quality of life and decrease medication requirement for allergic rhinitis and asthma, especially for younger patients, and probably will assist in the prevention of the progression of allergic disease from rhinitis to asthma. Subcutaneous allergen IT is well established as clinically effective through multiple, blinded, placebo-controlled studies. The data for alternate therapies and routes of therapy are extensively reviewed and critiqued.

Conclusions

Allergen IT is a highly valuable form of treatment of IgE-mediated diseases. Documentation of sensitivity to allergen sensitization associated with symptoms is critical before use of allergen IT. Symptoms should also be of sufficient duration and severity to warrant IT. Before allergen IT is used, there must be an available allergen extract that is suitable for treatment of the relative sensitivity. It is essential for patients receiving allergen IT to understand the treatment principle, the frequency of injections, the duration of treatment, the risk and signs of adverse events, the magnitude of the efficacy, and the essential nature of patient compliance. Subcutaneous allergen IT is the only current mode of therapy in the United States that has been shown to be effective.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^2c161672]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goals of Treatment

The DEPTH panelists came to consensus that the primary objective when treating DB is the elimination or significant decrease of collarettes (Median = 7; Range 4–9). Similarly, when asked, "True or false: The single most important goal of treatment for Demodex blepharitis is elimination/significant reduction in collarettes", there was consensus that this statement is true (n = 9). On the other hand, there was also consensus that mite eradication should not be the goal of treatment (n = 9). While it may seem like clinicians would think that eradicating mites would be of paramount importance, discussion at the live meeting shed light on the seeming contradiction. In this discussion, the panelists clarified that although mite elimination is important, most clinicians treating DB are using collarettes, not mites, as the clinical marker for treatment success.

During the video conference, the panelists discussed the concept of collarettes serving as a surrogate for mites, and the elimination of one necessarily means the elimination of the other. Therefore, by eliminating or dramatically reducing collarettes, the mite burden is also eliminated or reduced. There was also discussion about being able to monitor the resolution of DB by looking for collarettes rather than needing to epilate lashes to look for mites. This discussion reinforced the suggestion for clinicians to perform routine slit-lamp evaluations, in which checking for the presence of collarettes should be an essential step.

The final survey helped quantify the content of the live meeting discussion. The DEPTH panelists concurred that when diagnosing and treating Demodex blepharitis, collarettes are a reasonable surrogate for mites, thereby eliminating the need to count mites and/or epilate lashes (Median = 9; Range 3–9). In another question, the group reached consensus about the statement, "The primary goal when treating DB is the elimination or significant decrease of collarettes, from which it can be extrapolated that mites would also be eliminated or decreased, leading to improvement in other signs and symptoms" (Median = 8; Range 7–9). In other words, collarettes, and therefore mites, are the primary target of treatment in clinical practice and the way by which clinicians can monitor patient response to therapy.

### Interleukin 31 in insect bite hypersensitivity-alleviating clinical symptoms by active vaccination against itch [^11650b20]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

Insect bite hypersensitivity is defined as type I allergy with type IVb characteristics. 18, 19, 20, 21 Type I pathology includes IgE‐mediated mast cell and basophil activation when allergen‐specific IgE binds to its Fc ε receptor type I (FcεRI), leading to histamine release from cellular granules. 31 Nevertheless, the use of antihistamines did not show any efficacy against IBH and thus is not recommended for IBH therapy. 32 This led to the assumption that there might be an additional causative mediator for the allergic itch. IL‐31 is a T H 2 cell–derived cytokine, mediating pruritus by targeting peripheral nerves and acting independent of histamine. 5

In humans, IL‐31 appears to be involved in the pruritus development of patients with several skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or lupus erythematodes. 33, 34, 35, 36 A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human IL‐31 receptor (nemolizumab, Chugai Pharma) for the treatment of pruritus in atopic dermatitis entered clinical testing in 2012 and significantly reduced itching, however, did not improve eczema. 37 A human double‐blind safety study of nemolizumab administered every 4 or 8 weeks for up to 64 weeks was well tolerated in patients with moderate‐to‐severe atopic dermatitis and was without any safety concerns. Furthermore, an anti‐IL‐31 mAb by Bristol‐Myers Squibb completed clinical phase 1 study in healthy subjects and adults with atopic dermatitis in 2015 and so far without safety concerns. In animals, Zoetis Inc developed an anti‐canine IL‐31 mAb (Lokivetmab, Cytopoint ®), which recently entered the market as a treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. Such antibody treatment is expected to have fewer side effects than the currently used JAK inhibitor (oclacitinib, APOQUEL™). Regarding therapy costs and given the size and weight of a horse, systemically daily chemical inhibition of JAK or intravenous monthly monoclonal antibody injections, both applied based on body weight, limit the choice of therapeutics to the class of vaccines, which are applied at low dose and will be injected subcutaneously for three times in the first year and a single booster in the following years. 24 Moreover, vaccines induce self‐made polyclonal active immunity with additive neutralization capacities over blocking a single epitope, that is, by passive immunity transfer of mAbs. In addition, mAbs commonly have a modified protein sequence adjusting the use to the target species such as humanization, thus, equine mAbs would need an "equinization". However, 786 existing equine breeds (2006, FAO Global Data Bank) will turn this into a very complex task. Even in humans, humanization can be challenging and a common side effect is the development of anti‐therapeutic antibodies limiting the choice of therapeutics in affected individuals. 38, 39

### Changing insect populations: new insects, old venoms [^46472631]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

We need more commercial venom extracts to represent the range of species causing sting reactions in the field. There continue to be patients with a clear history of sting anaphylaxis but negative results of tests for venom allergy and mast cell disorders. The frequency of anaphylaxis in response to insect species other than those included in commercial extracts is unknown, but the increasing number of species being identified as potential culprits points to a need for a greater variety of venom extracts. The impact on patient care is significant: we are not only missing the diagnosis in some patients but are also failing to protect others for lack of specific venoms. There are many different species of oak, grass, or birch pollen extracts available commercially in the United States despite their extensive cross-reactivity, yet we are limited to a small number of venoms that were selected in the 1970s. As suggested by Carlson and Fox, allergists should collaborate more closely with entomologists to identify potentially relevant species in different areas and emulate our colleagues in Italy, Australia, and Spain who moved quickly to develop and license specific new venom extracts for "new" insect species (P dominulus, JJA, and VVN, respectively). This will be a challenge to entomologists, allergists, and US Food and Drug Administration regulatory committee members, who must collaborate to serve the current and future needs of our patients.

Annotations to the algorithm — Box 1: Specific detailed history and physical examination emphasizes careful history and insect identification. Most people of all ages who are stung have only local reactions and require only symptomatic, if any, treatment, and clinicians should obtain a careful history and encourage patients to bring the offending insect for identification, noting whether the patient was stung once or multiple times. Identification clues include the presence of a stinger commonly left by honeybees or a sterile pustule from an imported fire ant sting lasting up to 24 hours or longer.

### Scrub typhus, republic of Palau [^b964e8d7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the Trombiculidae family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir. Rodents of the family Muridae (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support O. tsutsugamushi. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans. Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may be influenced by the strain of O. tsutsugamushi, a person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1%–30%. Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

### Dermatitis: a serpiginous skin lesion due to a mite that parasitizes a wood-boring beetle [^91bf2423]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

In July (midsummer) 2018, a 51-year-old man residing in a village in the Swiss canton of Valais developed two highly pruritic skin lesions. One large lesion was located on the abdomen and a smaller one on the left flank (Figure 1A). Erythematous macules evolved from initial red spots to full size (pictured) within 24 hours. An erythematous serpiginous track extending cranially from the larger lesion developed in the subsequent 12 hours. Both lesions appeared shortly after he handled substantial amounts of logs and timber outdoors. Based on the lesions' central morphology, rapid evolution, and itchiness, the consulted family physician discarded the differential diagnoses of erysipelas with lymphangitis, erythema migrans due to Lyme disease, and cutaneous larva migrans and suspected an unusual arthropod bite or sting. He referred the patient to the medical department of the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute for advice, where the spot diagnosis of Pyemotes ventricosus dermatitis was made. Under topical corticosteroid and oral antihistamine treatment, the lesions slowly regressed and finally disappeared.

Figure 1.
(A) skin lesions of the patient; (B) top: Pyemotes ventricosus mite; bottom: Anobium punctatum larva (left) and beetle (right).

Pyemotes ventricosus dermatitis is caused by the bite of P. ventricosus mites ("European straw itch mites"), free-living ectoparasites parasitizing the larvae of Anobium punctatum ("common furniture beetle"), a wood-boring beetle (Figure 1B). Pyemotes ventricosus mites occasionally infest humans handling affected wood or furniture as incidental hosts. Patients present with highly pruritic lesions consisting of a singular central vesicle/urticarial lesion (the mite's bite site) surrounded by a rapidly expanding erythematous macule. The clinical differentiation to other arthropod bite reactions can be made if the characteristic linear or serpiginous erythematous track, called "comet sign", is present. The lesions evolve within 24 hours after contact with P. ventricosus, are self-limited, and typically resolve in 1–3 weeks. Patients may also develop systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills, vomiting, or intense headache. The diagnosis can be challenging to make because the mites are not visible to the naked eye and its bites are painless.

### Are insect bites responsible for the rise in summer flucloxacillin prescribing in United Kingdom general practices? [^fff23d32]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data suggests there could be scope to change and improve the management of insect bites, with greater use of non-antibiotic management. To help detect early cellulitis swab of purulent discharge and drawing round the erythema to monitor spread may be helpful. Exploration of antihistamine, topical steroid, and topical antiseptics in insect bite management may reduce antibiotic use. Our findings highlight the next steps needed in a QI approach to generate practice-based evidence on optimal management of insect bites, specifically work on alternatives to antibiotic prescribing.

The James Lind alliancehas worked with patients to identify research questions related to the management of cellulitis, including "What are the early signs and symptoms of cellulitis that can help to ensure speedy treatment?". For insect bites in general practice, we suggest "What early symptoms and signs in insect bite reactions do not require antibiotics?" and "What non-antibiotic treatments reduce inflammation and cellulitis?" as changes to design and implement as the next step in a QI model to develop practice-based evidence.

### Venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings [^b1efd3ac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Venom immunotherapy (VIT) is commonly used for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had a sting reaction. The efficacy and safety of this treatment has not previously been assessed by a high-quality systematic review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immunotherapy using extracted insect venom for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings in people who have had an allergic reaction to a sting.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to February 2012: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), the Armed Forces Pest Management Board Literature Retrieval System, and OpenGrey. There were no language or publication status restrictions to our searches. We searched trials databases, abstracts from recent European and North American allergy meetings, and the references of identified review articles in order to identify further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of venom immunotherapy using standardised venom extract in insect sting allergy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. We identified adverse events from included controlled trials and from a separate analysis of observational studies identified as part of a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Health Technology Assessment.

Main Results

We identified 6 randomised controlled trials and 1 quasi-randomised controlled trial for inclusion in the review; the total number of participants was 392. The trials had some risk of bias because five of the trials did not blind outcome assessors to treatment allocation. The interventions included ant, bee, and wasp immunotherapy in children or adults with previous systemic or large local reactions to a sting, using sublingual (one trial) or subcutaneous (six trials) VIT. We found that VIT is effective for preventing systemic allergic reaction to an insect sting, which was our primary outcome measure. This applies whether the sting occurs accidentally or is given intentionally as part of a trial procedure. In the trials, 3/113 (2.7%) participants treated with VIT had a subsequent systemic allergic reaction to a sting, compared with 37/93 (39.8%) untreated participants (risk ratio [RR] 0.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.28). The efficacy of VIT was similar across studies; we were unable to identify a patient group or mode of treatment with different efficacy, although these analyses were limited by small numbers. We were unable to confirm whether VIT prevents fatal reactions to insect stings, because of the rarity of this outcome. Venom immunotherapy was also effective for preventing large local reactions to a sting (5 studies; 112 follow-up stings; RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.69) and for improving quality of life (mean difference [MD] in favour of VIT 1.21 points on a 7-point scale, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.67). We found a significant risk of systemic adverse reaction to VIT treatment: 6 trials reported this outcome, in which 14 of 150 (9.3%) participants treated with VIT and 1 of 135 (0.7%) participants treated with placebo or no treatment suffered a systemic reaction to treatment (RR 8.16, 95% CI 1.53 to 43.46; 2 studies contributed to the effect estimate). Our analysis of 11 observational studies found systemic adverse reactions occurred in 131/921 (14.2%) participants treated with bee venom VIT and 8/289 (2.8%) treated with wasp venom VIT.

Authors' Conclusions

We found venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom to be an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings, which can improve quality of life. The treatment carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reaction.

### Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations: a review [^1437fcba]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations are caused by organisms that live on or in the skin, on clothing, or in the environment and commonly cause pruritus and rash. In 2021, approximately 622 million incident cases of scabies occurred globally. Data on bedbug infestations are limited. Body lice prevalence ranges from 4.1% to 35% among persons experiencing homelessness worldwide.

Observations

Scabies is caused by mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) that burrow into the epidermis. Transmission primarily occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an individual who has an infestation. Common scabies is characterized by excoriated pruritic papules, plaques, and pathognomonic burrows on finger/toe web spaces, volar wrists, ankles, axillae, buttocks, male genitalia, and areolae. Permethrin cream and oral ivermectin are first-line treatments for adults, with similar clearance rates by week 2 (74% with permethrin vs 68% with ivermectin; relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.08). Treatment failure can occur with oral ivermectin (11.8%; 95% CI, 8.4%-15.4%) and topical permethrin (10.8%; 95% CI, 7.5%-14.5%). Bedbugs (Cimex lectularius, Cimex hemipterus) are insects that live on mattresses and furniture and feed on blood nocturnally, causing linear pruritic erythematous papules. New skin lesions on waking, cohabitants with similar symptoms, and recently residing in a high-occupancy setting should raise suspicion. Treatment requires eradication with pest management. Body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus) are insects found on clothing that travel to the skin for blood meals. Body lice bites cause pruritic excoriated macules/papules and hyperpigmentation in areas where clothing seams contact skin. Treatment and prevention require at least once-weekly bathing and laundering of clothing and bedding.

Conclusions and Relevance

Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations are common. Accurate diagnosis requires taking a history, including social drivers of health (eg, housing status, living environment), and physical examination. First-line treatments include scabicides for patients with common scabies and their close contacts. Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations should be treated with decontamination measures.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^0e43f19a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The DEPTH panel convened a second time with the aim of achieving consensus around aspects of treatment and management of patients with Demodex blepharitis in a clinical setting. Demodex blepharitis is a common condition and currently, there is no single therapeutic strategy for its management. The panelists concurred that some blepharitis maintenance therapies may provide temporary symptom relief but likely do not address the root cause of the disease. In the future, with a well-tolerated FDA-approved therapy, the experts believe that mechanical intervention such as lid scrubs may no longer be as necessary. The panel unanimously agreed that the key treatment goal for DB patients is the reduction or elimination of collarettes, with collarettes being a surrogate for Demodex mites. They also concurred that treatment success may be measured by the degree to which collarettes are eliminated or significantly decreased, indicating the elimination or decrease of Demodex mites. DEPTH panelists achieved consensus that, in order to assess patients for collarettes, a simple and effective technique that can easily be incorporated into the routine eye examination is as simple as having the patient look down during slit-lamp exam. Ultimately, the panel agreed, it is possible to cure Demodex blepharitis for some duration of time, although reinfestation is possible. The information from both phases of this Delphi panel can be used to increase awareness about Demodex blepharitis, leading to better care received by patients and better clinical outcomes.

### Arthropods in dermatology [^ff1b12c2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Arthropods are important in medicine for a multitude of reasons. Their bites and stings may induce allergic reactions, ranging from annoying to life-threatening. Many arthropod products are also capable of inciting allergic responses in sensitized persons. In recent years, bites and stings have gained greater attention owing to increased concern about disease transmission. A common hypersensitivity response to arthropod bites, stings, and products is papular urticaria. This eruption occurs primarily in children, who eventually "outgrow" this disease, probably through desensitization after multiple arthropod exposures. Papular urticaria is most often caused by fleas or bedbugs, but virtually any arthropod is capable of inducing such a reaction. Two arthropod classes of medical importance are the Arachnida (spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites) and the Insecta (lice, fleas, bedbugs, flies, bees, and ants). Animals in these two classes are probably responsible for more morbidity and mortality worldwide than are any other group of venomous creatures. In general, the diagnosis of arthropod bites and stings is dependent on maintenance of a high index of suspicion and familiarity with the arthropod fauna not only in one's region of practice, but also in the travel regions of one's patients. Learning objective At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the clinical manifestations caused by a variety of arthropods as well as the treatment and possible sequelae of arthropod attacks.

### Cooling the itch via TRPM8 [^7eecd1bb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Cooling is an effective temporary remedy for itch, bringing welcome relief to itchy insect bites, nettle stings, poison ivy, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Menthol, causing a cooling sensation, has similar itch-relieving effects. Palkar et al. demonstrate that TRPM8, a menthol- and cold-activated ion channel, is essential for cooling to relieve itch, suggesting that pharmacologic TRPM8 activation should be explored further as an antipruritic strategy.

### Anaphylaxis to stinging insect venom [^66437439]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Hymenoptera stinging insects are common culprits for allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis to insect stings can be life threatening and is associated with a significant risk of recurrence. Insect allergy requires referral to an allergist/immunologist for education and for diagnostic evaluation that will direct further management and treatment. Venom immunotherapy is safe and effective; it prevents sting anaphylaxis in up to 98% of patients. Potential risk factors for side effects during testing and treatment should be assessed for every patient to mitigate risk and to guide treatment recommendations and the duration of immunotherapy.

### Summer buzz: all you need to know about insect sting allergies [^aeb4acba]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Insect stings can generate a range of immune and clinical reactions. Most reactions are local and self-limiting. Allergic reactions to insect stings can occur at all ages, with or without previous stings. Individuals with a history of anaphylaxis carry a significant risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis with future stings. Health-care providers are often unaware of the tremendous clinical benefits of venom immunotherapy for these select patients. Scientific knowledge about the natural history, risk factors, and optimal therapy for insect sting allergies has improved considerably in recent years.

### Mite infestations [^8a48813c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Mite infestations are important in dermatology because these may cause dermatologic diseases that range from papulosquamous eruptions to urticarial lesions to bullous eruptions and may spread infectious diseases. These clinical manifestations are important to recognize because mite-associated diseases may have systemic complications and may be confused with other dermatologic conditions. In treating mite infestations, oral antibiotics may be necessary. Prevention of infestation may be accomplished by pre-treating clothing with permethrin, using insect repellent N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide on clothing and skin, and treating animals infected with mites. This article will review etiology, clinical manifestation, and treatment of mite infestations.

### Horsefly (genus tabanus) bite: allergy or infection? [^3cc4dc29]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Summer heatwaves are often associated with increased reports of insect bites as people enjoy spending time outdoors. The horsefly (genus Tabanus), or 'cleg' as it is colloquially known, often receives negative publicity due to peak activity in summer. Following an increase in local hospital presentations due to complications of bites, discussion among colleagues suggested a lack of knowledge regarding best management. We present a case of a woman in her 30s with a large erythematous swelling on her thigh following a suspected horsefly bite. Review revealed no clinical evidence of sepsis but a localised inflammatory response. Inflammatory markers were normal and she was treated with intravenous antibiotics and oral antihistamines to good effect. This case highlights secondary care presentation of a common condition and discusses potential complications, pathogenesis and uncertainties around best practice guidelines for treatment. We highlight strategies to aid antibiotic stewardship, reduce complications and secondary care presentation.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^c232f666]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Treatment approaches acting on peripheral sensory nerves

Antihistamines are well‐established antipruritic agents that inhibit H1R, which is expressed by itch‐transmitting peripheral sensory nerve fibers and thus attenuates histaminergic itch. Histaminergic itch is a significant contributor to itch observed in urticaria and insect bites/stings. These forms of itch can be effectively treated with antihistamines. However, the other majority of itching cases outside of these dermatoses may result from nonhistaminergic itch mechanisms, and, thus, antihistamines may not be the optimal treatment option.

Analgesics and anesthetics inhibit the activation of ion channels (particularly Na v channels) and the generation of action potentials (Figure 4). Topical creams containing lidocaine are available as over‐the‐counter antipruritics in Japan and other countries. Topical ketamine (10% or 5%)–amitriptyline (5%)–lidocaine (5%) (TKAL) has been demonstrated to alleviate both inflammatory itch (itch in atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis) and neuropathic itch (brachioradial pruritus and other forms of neuropathic itch).

The use of coolants (cooling agents) result in partial and transient alleviation of the itching sensation. They activate cold‐sensing TRPM8‐expressing nociceptors, which, in turn, stimulate Bhlhb‐5‐expressing itch‐inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord (Figure 3). Topical formulations containing TRPM8 agonists menthol (1%–3%) and/or camphor are available over‐the‐counter in Japan and other countries. Of note, a subset of patients with chronic itch report exacerbation of their itch when exposed to cold, and they should be recommended to avoid cold sensation.

Capsaicin, an active alkaloid compound contained in chili peppers and a ligand for TRPV1, has been demonstrated to alleviate itching when applied topically. The precise mechanism of action of capsaicin in the itch treatment remains to be elucidated. Treatment with capsaicin may result in functional and/or structural alterations of TRPV1‐expressing peripheral sensory nerve fibers that are involved in the transmission of itching sensations. The capsaicin 8% patch is indicated in adults for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in some countries, but it is not approved for itching conditions. Topical formulations containing capsaicin at lower concentrations are available over‐the‐counter in Japan and other countries.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^6be65979]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Bed bug bites can result in clinical manifestations; the most common are small clusters of extremely pruritic, erythematous papules or wheals that represent repeated feedings by a single bed bug. Less common but more severe manifestations include grouped vesicles, giant urticaria, and hemorrhagic bullous eruptions. Bites should be managed symptomatically with topical emollients, topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, or some combination of these treatments.

Health professionals should be aware of this reemerging urban pest to facilitate prompt diagnosis of affected patients and treatment of the underlying environmental infestation. Bed bug bites must be differentiated from scabies, body lice, and other insect bites. Diagnostic clues include clustering and timing of bed bug bites. Unlike body lice, bed bugs are rarely found on affected persons or their clothing, and persons with good personal hygiene who enter an infested area are likely to be bitten.

However, two applications, each about a week apart, may be necessary to eliminate all mites. Ivermectin oral tablet: Oral ivermectin is not FDA approved for the treatment of scabies. However, topical permethrin and oral ivermectin have similar efficacy for cure of scabies. If used for classic scabies, two doses of oral ivermectin should be taken with food, each 7 to 14 days apart. The safety of ivermectin in children weighing less than 15 kg and in pregnant women has not been established. Note that although ivermectin guidelines recommend taking on an empty stomach, scabies experts recommend taking with a meal to increase bioavailability. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton. Sulfur ointment 5%-10%: In the U. S. the ointment must be compounded.

Sulfur in an ointment base is safe for topical use in children, including infants under 2 months of age. Crusted scabies: both oral and topical agents should be used Ivermectin oral tablet: For crusted scabies, ivermectin should be administered together with a topical agent. There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of ivermectin administration. Some experts recommend administering oral ivermectin in three doses, five doses, or seven doses, depending on infection severity. There is no consensus on the optimal frequency of permethrin 5% application for the treatment of crusted scabies and experts have recommended anywhere from an initial daily application to application every 2–3 days for the first 1–2 weeks.

Keratolytic cream: A topical keratolytic cream may also be used to help reduce the crusting of the skin and aid in the penetration of the topical permethrin in those areas. The cream may be applied to areas of crusting on days that permethrin is not given, until crusting has resolved.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^17b03e85]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — VIT efficacy, dosing, duration, and safety: "VIT is extremely effective in reducing the risk of a subsequent systemic reaction from an insect sting to less than 5%, and sting reactions that occur during VIT are usually milder than those experienced before VIT". "The full dose of 100 μg is adequate to ensure optimal clinical protection (50 μg may be considered in children)". "Once initiated, VIT should usually be continued for at least 3 to 5 years". Adverse effects are "typically minor, although anaphylaxis may occur; therefore, close monitoring is warranted", with "Large local reactions" most common and generally tolerable; "Antihistamines may limit the reaction". If reactions recur, "rush VIT (sometimes with omalizumab pretreatment) is usually successful". Although "β-blockers and ACEIs may increase the risk of anaphylaxis to VIT, the published evidence is inconsistent". Studies also note that "80% to 90% of patients will not have a systemic reaction to an insect" despite persistent positive skin tests.

Large local reactions — clinical course and management — are usually IgE mediated, almost always self-limited, and rarely create serious health problems; patients with prior large local reactions often have recurrences, and up to 10% might eventually have a systemic reaction. For patients with large local reactions, it is optional to prescribe injectable epinephrine for use if a systemic reaction occurs in the future, most need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom specific IgE or venom immunotherapy (VIT), although increasing evidence shows VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and might be useful in those with frequent unavoidable reactions and detectable venom specific IgE; the decision to give VIT must be weighed against added cost and potential inconvenience. Supportive care can include cold compresses, oral antihistamines, and oral analgesics; although many physicians use oral corticosteroids for large local reactions, definitive proof of efficacy is lacking, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection (eg, fever, chills, or sweats).

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^08e798e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of infections developing in damaged skin (burn wounds, animal and human bites, and pressure ulcers)?

Irrigation of the wound and debridement of necrotic tissue are the most important factors in the prevention of infection and can substantially decrease the incidence of invasive wound infection. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not generally recommended (recommendation 1C).

For patients with systemic signs of infection, compromised immune status, severe comorbidities, associated severe cellulitis, severe and deep wounds, a broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against aerobic, and anaerobic organisms is always required (recommendation 1C).

Infections developing in damaged skin are a heterogeneous group that includes bite wounds (animal and human bites), burn wounds, and pressure ulcers. If managed incorrectly, these infections can develop into more complicated soft-tissue infections.

Soft-tissue infection is the most common complication of animal and human bites. The risk of infection depends on the type of bite, the site of injury, the time elapsed from the bite until presentation, host factors, and the management of the wound. In general, 10–20% of bite wounds become infected, including 30–50% of cat bites, 5–25% of dog bites, and 20–25% of human bites, respectively.

The predominant pathogens in these wounds are part of the normal oral flora of the biting animal, along with human skin organisms and occasional secondary invaders (e.g. S. aureus and GAS). Along with Staphylococcus ssp. (including MRSA) and Streptococcus ssp. (including S. pyogenes), the commonly isolated pathogens include Pasteurella spp. (Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis), Capnocytophagia canimorsus, anaerobes (Fusobacterium spp. Prevotella spp. Bacteroides spp. Porphyromonas spp.), and others. Streptococci can be isolated from 50% of human bite wounds, S. aureus from 40%, and Eikenella corrodens (a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacillus) from 30%. Human bites can transmit HBV, HCV, and HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered in every case.

### Possible role of environmental factors in the development of food allergies [^62f1f62e]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

The development of food allergies is thought to involve multiple factors, and it is unclear which conveys the most risk regarding this process. Since food allergy is a chronic disease without a cure at this time, understanding its development could provide an avenue for preventive practices and development of a curative treatment. Both historical and current data implicate maternal factors, genetics, and environmental exposures as major risk factors in the development of food allergy. An immature gut of the infant has been hypothesized as a possible route of sensitization. Breastfeeding until at least 6 months of age has been shown to have protective factors for the newborn and may possibly improve gut permeability. Newer studies such as the LEAP and EAT investigations also looked at early exposure and prevention of food allergies; their long-term results are critical in understanding early introduction and tolerance. Cutaneous exposure, oral exposure, and food protein exposure in house dust with their relation to the food allergy course are also a path of interest. Current research has shown sensitization can occur through impaired skin such as those with eczema and a filaggrin mutation. Tropomyosin and alpha-gal also are related to the complicated immunomodulatory factors involved in food allergy and allergic response. Cross-reactivity with plant allergens, sensitization to house dust mite and cockroach, and lone star tick bites can also induce food allergens in children and adults. Together, these factors provide a cohesive beginning to understanding how food allergies can occur and can influence further investigation into prevention, treatment, and eventual cure of food allergies.

### Epidemiologic changes of scrub typhus in China, 1952–2016 [^e86994cb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Scrub typhus is a life-threatening disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium transmitted by the larvae of trombiculid mites. Only biting larvae of Asian scrub typhus chiggers (Leptotrombidium spp.) can transmit the disease. After the bite of an infective mite, a characteristic necrotic inoculation lesion (an eschar) can develop. The microorganism then spreads through the lymphatic fluid and blood, causing manifestations including fever, headache, rash, lymphadenopathy, and mental changes. Without appropriate treatment with specific antimicrobial drugs (e.g. tetracycline, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, or azithromycin), > 6% of infected patients will die. There is no licensed human vaccine to prevent scrub typhus infection.

Globally, scrub typhus is traditionally regarded as a disease endemic to a region called the Asia-Pacific tsutsugamushi triangle, which extends from Pakistan in the west to far eastern Russia in the east to northern Australia in the south. In some countries of Southeast Asia, scrub typhus is a leading cause of treatable nonmalarial febrile illness. It is estimated that scrub typhus threatens > 1 billion persons, causes at least 1 million clinical cases per year, and is associated with substantial mortality rates globally. The 2010s saw a widespread reemergence of scrub typhus in endemic regions such as India, Korea, Laos, and the Maldives. The recent emergence of scrub typhus in the Arabian Peninsula, Chile, and possibly Kenya suggests wider global distribution of this disease in tropical and subtropical regions, far from the tsutsugamushi triangle. Although scrub typhus poses the greatest threat to residents of eastern and southern Asia as well as tourists traveling to these regions, it remains a neglected disease globally. The lack of both research and a nationwide surveillance system within many endemic regions have resulted in poorly understood epidemiologic characteristics and disease burden of scrub typhus at global, national, and subnational levels. The Global Burden of Disease Study publishes estimates for 333 diseases and injuries, but currently bundles scrub typhus with other neglected tropical diseases, rather than providing specific burden estimates.

### A birch sublingual allergy immunotherapy tablet reduces rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms when exposed to birch and oak and induces igGto allergens from all trees in the birch homologous group [^4ddbde4a]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase II trial with the SQ tree SLIT‐tablet, showed statistically significant reductions of ARC as well as rhinitis symptoms in birch allergic subjects exposed to birch or oak pollen in an EEC. Statistically significant differences between 12 DU and placebo were reached after 16 weeks of treatment and persisted until week 24 (end of trial). No significant treatment effect was shown for conjunctivitis symptoms alone; however, the level of conjunctivitis symptoms was generally low in all treatment groups.

An immune modulating effect of the SQ tree SLIT‐tablet was confirmed by induction of statistically significant changes from baseline in serum levels of both birch and oak specific IgE and IgG 4 for all active treatment groups compared to placebo. The Bet v‐specific immunological changes observed during the SQ tree SLIT‐tablet treatment (IgG 4, IgE‐BF) are similar to those observed for SQ grass SLIT‐tablet, where sustained clinical effect has been demonstrated for up to 2 years after end of treatment, 17, 18 which suggests a durable treatment effect of SQ tree SLIT‐tablet with continued daily treatment.

### Papules, pustules, and rhinoconjunctivitis in a 4-year-old [^8d399c8b]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:
A. Flea bites – Incorrect. Flea bites typically localize to exposed areas on lower extremities. The family had no risk factors for fleas in the home such as indoor pets. The exterminator did not identify fleas in the home.
B. Head louse bites – Incorrect. Head lice do not have a larval stage, and lice reside on the person. Physical exam did not reveal nits or lice. The patient did not report scalp pruritus.
C. Mosquito bites – Incorrect. The presence of urticarial wheals might indicate mosquito bites, but this patient has papules and pustules. There was no known outdoor biting insect exposure, and no one else in the home was affected. The patient additionally had symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis.
D. Dermestid dermatitis – Correct. Symptoms isolated to 1 family member point to an individual environmental exposure. The patient slept in close proximity to numerous unwashed stuffed animals that provide a nice environment for dermestid beetles. The setae (hairs) on dermestid beetle larvae can cause mucocutaneous reactions as in our patient. The patient's symptoms resolved within a few weeks once the home was treated by an exterminator for dermestid beetles and her stuffed animals removed from the bed and/or washed on a hot water cycle.
E. Bed bug bites – Incorrect. Bed bug bites do commonly present on the face of children; however, they often present in a breakfast, lunch, and dinner distribution without a central pustule. No similar symptoms were reported by other family members, and the exterminator did not find evidence of bed bugs.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^64a7934d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Stinging insect hypersensitivity — management of large local reactions: A large local reaction is described as extreme swelling extending from the sting site, usually peaking at 48 to 72 hours after a sting and lasting 1 week or more, and the risk of a systemic reaction in such patients is 4% to 10%. Because of this relatively low risk, diagnostic testing and VIT are generally not required; Summary Statement 16: Counsel patients who have experienced only large local reactions to stings that VIT is generally not required but might be considered in those who have frequent unavoidable exposure. Providing injectable epinephrine for these patients is usually not necessary but might be considered if it provides reassurance, and most patients will experience similar large local reactions after subsequent stings, with those who have frequent and/or severe reactions potentially benefiting from VIT.

### Pancreatitis in scrub typhus: a rare complication [^4fc41c45]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Scrub typhus is a zoonosis transmitted by a trombiculid mite which introduces bacteria of Orientia tsutsugamushi by its bite. The acute febrile illness is characterised by eschar at the site of the bite with maculopapular rashes and local and/or generalised lymphadenopathy. The disease is endemic in the tsutsugamushi triangle. Sikkim, a small Himalayan north-eastern state, is also not unaffected where outbreaks of the disease have been reported. The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from mild to fatal depending on the virulence of the bacterial strain, susceptibility of the host and promptness of the treatment. In severe cases, there can be multiple organ involvement. Pancreatitis is a serious and unusual complication of this disease, which was seen in our presentation. A 22-year-old man, diagnosed to have scrub typhus, developed pancreatitis in the second week of the illness and responded well to medical treatment.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^43f48bff]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

The evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed did not support the use of SLIT specifically for the treatment of allergic asthma. However, the FDA has approved SLIT tablets (but not aqueous preparations) for the treatment of allergic rhino conjunctivitis. Individuals with this condition who also have asthma might benefit from SLIT and, if so, this benefit is most likely to be in the form of a reduction in the use of quick-relief and/or long-term control medications.

On the basis of the currently available data, the Expert Panel does not recommend SLIT for allergic asthma. SLIT is beneficial for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. In an individual with comorbid allergic asthma, SLIT for allergic rhino conjunctivitis might reduce the symptoms of allergic asthma as well (and this potential provides the rationale for making the recommendation conditional). For individuals whose allergic asthma symptoms benefit from SLIT for allergic rhino conjunctivitis, the Expert Panel offers the following suggestions.

The clinician should administer the first dose of SLIT in the office, and the individual with asthma should wait in the office for at least 30 minutes after receiving the dose. If no problems develop, the individual may continue the SLIT dosing at home. Individuals receiving SLIT should ideally have an injectable epinephrine prescription and receive education on how to administer this medication.
Currently, only tablet SLIT formulations for short ragweed and dust mite mixture and for northern grass have FDA approval for treatment of allergic rhinitis with and without conjunctivitis. SLIT is not FDA approved specifically for asthma treatment.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients: The Expert Panel does not recommend SLIT for the treatment of allergic asthma, but this treatment may benefit individuals with certain comorbid conditions, such as allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis. The FDA has approved the use of SLIT to treat allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis in response to only a few allergens at this time for individuals aged 5 years and older (for sensitization to northern grass) and in individuals aged 18 years and older (for sensitization to a short ragweed and dust mite mixture).

### Dual genotype orientia tsutsugamushi infection in patient with rash and eschar, Vietnam, 2016 [^06109dc5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We demonstrated the coexistence of 2 different O. tsutsugamushi genotypes in this patient. The negative O. tsutsugamushi IFA results could have been a result of early stage plasma collection, on the seventh day of illness. For efficient serologic diagnosis, convalescent-phase plasma or serum is needed. Unfortunately, we could not obtain this type of sample from this patient because he returned to work in the forest after 5 days of treatment. Because serologic results can be negative for over a week after scrub typhus disease onset, we stress use of molecular assays rather than serologic tests for diagnosis.

We used appropriate controls and obtained sequences that had not been obtained before in our laboratory, making contamination a highly unlikely explanation for our results. However, in vitro isolation would have been stronger evidence for a dual O. tsutsugamushi infection.

Because this patient often worked in the forest, his dual infection could have been caused by bites from several mites, but bites from a single mite infected with multiple genotypes could have also happened. Although detecting both genotypes in the eschar sample would have been expected if he was bitten by a mite infected with multiple genotypes, 1 genotype might have predominated. Furthermore, a person bitten by multiple mites might have multiple eschars, but eschar formation varies, depending on the O. tsutsugamushi genotype. Wearing adequate personal protective gear when in wooded areas can help minimize exposure to mites and prevent scrub typhus. However, when a patient like such as the one we describe seeks treatment, clinicians should administer doxycycline immediately.

2.7 Endpoints and assessments

An electronic diary was issued to all subjects before every EEC session, and was used for assessment of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms before and during the 6‐hour exposure period in the chamber.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the average total symptom score (TSS) measured at 9 time points from hour 2 to 6 during the 6‐hour birch EEC session after 24 weeks of treatment.

The average TSS for each subject was calculated as the average sum of the total nasal symptom score consisting of four symptoms (TNSS); runny nose, blocked nose, sneezing, and itchy nose and the total ocular symptom score (TOSS) consisting of two symptoms; gritty feeling/red/itchy eyes and watery eyes. Each of the six symptoms were measured on a scale from 0‐3, where 0 corresponds to no symptoms and three corresponds to severe symptoms. Thus, the TSS had a range of 0‐18.

At the randomization visit, subjects received an adverse event (AE) notebook to be completed in case the subject experienced any AEs during the trial. The AE notebook entries served as a basis for AE assessment. At all subsequent visits, the investigator reviewed and discussed data entered in the AE notebook with the subject, and entries fulfilling the requirement for an AE were entered into the eCRF.

### Clinical overview of scrub typhus… [^41621ad1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Scrub typhus is transmitted to humans through bites from infected larval trombiculid mites known as chiggers.
- Symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, and eschar.
- Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for patients with scrub typhus. Seasonality of the disease is determined by the appearance of larvae. In temperate zones, scrub typhus season is observed mainly in the fall, but also occurs in the spring. If a person is bitten by an infected mite, disease occurs within 7–10 days and typically lasts 14–21 days without appropriate treatment. Transmission is year-round in tropical and sub-tropical regions, with seasonal peaks determined by rainy and dry seasons. The majority of cases of scrub typhus occur in rural areas where mite-harboring vegetation is common. Interestingly, studies have described focal areas of scrub vegetation as small as a few square meters that are infested with these mites.

If people enter one of these hot spots, their risk of infection increases dramatically. Eschar The area around the bite may develop a necrotic skin lesion known as an eschar. The eschar may appear before the individual develops systemic symptoms. Common sites of eschars are axillae, under the breast, and groin, and less often on the abdomen, back, and extremities. Multiple eschars have been reported. Treatment Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for suspected scrub typhus in persons of all ages. Patients should be treated for at least 3 days after the fever subsides and until there is evidence of clinical improvement. Single-dose or short courses of doxycycline may lead to a relapse in illness. Recommended dosages of doxycycline:

Treatments for patients with severe doxycycline allergy may include azithromycin or rifampin. Chloramphenicol is an alternative treatment, but oral formulations are no longer available in the United States and the parenteral formulation has limited availability. Limited clinical reports suggest ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin also might be effective alternatives in adults.

### A birch sublingual allergy immunotherapy tablet reduces rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms when exposed to birch and oak and induces igGto allergens from all trees in the birch homologous group [^9c0031b8]. Allergy (2019). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Ethics

The trial is identified by ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02481856. The trial was designed and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments 13 and conducted in compliance with the principles of ICH Good Clinical Practice. 14

2.2 Trial design

The trial was a phase II, randomized, parallel‐group, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial conducted in Canada using the Inflamax Research EEC (Mississauga, Ontario). Subjects were randomized equally to receive daily treatment with the SQ tree SLIT‐tablet in doses of 2, 7, or 12 DU, or placebo. The EEC pollen challenge was conducted outside the birch pollen season and included four birch EEC sessions and two oak EEC sessions. The initiation of treatment with the investigational medicinal product (IMP) took place from August to October 2015, and subjects received IMP for 24 weeks. Birch EEC sessions were performed at baseline and after 8, 16, and 24 weeks of treatment, and oak EEC sessions at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment (Figure 1).

2.3 Trial population

The subjects eligible for the trial were adults (18‐65 years) with moderate to severe rhinoconjunctivitis (with or without asthma) induced by pollen from the birch homologous group (confirmed by medical history, positive skin prick test to birch, and specific IgE to birch (Betula verrucosa) major allergen 1 (Bet v 1) (≥ 0.70 kU/L)) despite having received allergy pharmacotherapy during the two birch pollen seasons prior to trial entry. The eligibility criterion for the level of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms during the baseline birch EEC session was a score of at least seven on a TSS scale from 0 to 18. 15 Subjects were excluded if they had a history of uncontrolled asthma, reduced lung function (FEV 1 < 70%), or any other clinically relevant allergies expected to cause symptoms during the intervention period, which as judged by the investigators would act to confound the trial (see the Appendix S1 for further details on selection criteria).

### Pneumonia due to scrub typhus infection: a case report [^4494c7cf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mites. It is primarily found in rural and scrubby regions of Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of northern Australia. The disease is endemic in several areas of Southeast Asia, China, India, and Japan. Scrub typhus can present with a wide range of nonspecific symptoms, often resulting in delayed or missed diagnoses.

Patients usually present with a sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, and eschar formation at the site of mite bites. Additional common features include lymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In rare cases, infection with Rickettsia rickettsii can lead to sensorineural hearing loss and otalgia. Respiratory involvement, such as cough and shortness of breath, may occur, particularly in severe cases where scrub typhus can lead to complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early diagnosis and prompt antibiotic treatment, such as doxycycline, are essential to prevent severe complications.

Regarding medical management for tick bite, more specifically with respect to setting of care, WMS 2021 guidelines recommend to evacuate patients developing systemic or high-risk symptoms (fever, generalized rash, arthralgias, cranial nerve palsy, dyspnea, or syncope) related to a suspected tick-borne illness to a higher level of medical care.

Systemic antibiotics — Frostbite is not an inherently infection-prone injury and antibiotic administration specifically for preventing infection during or after frostbite injury is not supported by evidence; systemic antibiotics, either oral or parenteral, should be administered to patients with significant trauma, other potential infectious sources, or signs and symptoms of cellulitis or sepsis. Recommendation: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Standardized mite dermatophagoides farinae [^dcc6f423]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Standardized mite allergenic extracts are intended for use in the diagnosis and therapy of D.farinae and D.pteronyssinus mite allergy, as established by allergy history and skin test reactivity(6,10). Standardized Mite extracts are not interchangeable with non standardized mite extracts. To select patients for a confirmation of allergic disease diagnosis and/or treatment with allergen extracts, screening tests should be done using in vivo identification testing methods (i.e. scratch or intradermal testing).(13)

Standardized mite extract containing equal parts of D.farinae and D.pteronyssinus is intended for therapy only. The use of standardized mites extract is indicated for hypersensitization treatment and may be used as part of the over-all management of the allergic patient. This treatment is particularly to be recommended when a patient's sensitivity to mite has been determined initially by scratch or intradermal skin tests.

Inhalant/aeroallergens in AD — Reactivity to aeroallergens increases with age, with common aeroallergens including house dust mites, pollens, animal dander, and fungi, and higher rates of sensitization in those with moderate to severe AD. As with foods, true allergy to aeroallergens requires demonstration of an adverse health event that is reproducible on exposure, yet the exact role is controversial and avoidance measures have not consistently helped; skin contact can trigger eczematous lesions in some individuals but not others (5–45% positivity, depending on the allergen). The diagnosis of allergy to an aeroallergen is based on a sequential workup and demonstration of clinical relevance, where history can identify seasonal flares or exacerbation after contact, and in a second step, SPT or measurement of specific IgE antibodies can be performed to detect sensitization.

2.4 Interventional medicinal product

The IMP was an oral lyophilisate (fast dissolving, freeze‐dried formulation) for sublingual administration provided by ALK (Hoersholm, Denmark). The drug substance used for the active doses (2, 7, and 12 DU) was an allergen extract derived from birch pollen. DU has been used as a standardized potency unit during the development programme and is based equally on the major allergen content (Bet v 1) and total allergenic activity. One DU corresponds to approximately 5 μg Bet v 1. The matrix used was identical to the other SQ SLIT‐tablets (eg. grass, house dust mite, and ragweed). The placebo tablets were similar to the active IMP with regard to appearance, smell, and taste. The first dose was administered under medical supervision lasting at least 30 minutes after tablet intake. Subjects were instructed to take one sublingual tablet daily. Before the subjects attended each of the EEC sessions, a washout period ranging from 3 days (short acting antihistamines and nasal decongestants) to 120 days (eg. for glucocorticoids and, systemic depot formulations) was specified for relevant concomitant medication that interfered with the efficacy evaluations. If deemed necessary by the investigator, subjects could be provided with antihistamines or a β2‐agonist inhaler after an EEC session. None of the patients needed oral corticosteroids after the EEC sessions.

2.5 Allergen exposure

During the EEC sessions, subjects were exposed to airborne birch pollen at a density of 3500 ± 500 grains/m 3 or to oak pollen in a density of 2000 ± 500 grains/m 3 for six consecutive hours. The pollen levels used in the birch EEC sessions resembled what could be experienced during the peak season under natural exposure. 8 Pollen counts were obtained using rotational impaction samplers every 30 minutes during the EEC sessions to ensure stable pollen exposure.

2.6 Randomization

Each subject was randomly assigned to receive one of three active doses (2, 7, or 12 DU) or placebo. Randomization was performed according to an allocation schedule generated by a trial‐independent statistician and was stratified by sites using block randomization. Details on the randomization can be found in the Appendix S1.
