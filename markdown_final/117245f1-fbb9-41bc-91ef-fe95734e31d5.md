## Question

For a new patient with Group 1 PAH, provide recommendations for diagnostic workup and treatment, formatted for the Assessment and Plan section of a pulmonology consult note.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for recommendations for diagnostic workup and treatment for a new patient with Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension, formatted for the Assessment and Plan section of a pulmonology consult note. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnostic classification and hemodynamic definition. Then, I should verify the essential baseline workup and vasoreactivity testing. Next, I will outline risk stratification and map initial therapy by risk tier, including special handling of vasoreactive patients. After that, I need to cover supportive care, monitoring cadence, and escalation triggers. Finally, I should ensure referral to a PH center, advanced therapies, and patient education are addressed, all while double-checking key labels and guideline recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the assessment and definition because I need to ensure we are actually dealing with Group 1 PAH as opposed to PH due to left heart, lung disease, or CTEPH. The current hemodynamic definition for precapillary PH consistent with PAH is mPAP > 20 mmHg, PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg, and PVR ≥ 3 Wood units on right heart catheterization; I initially thought of the older mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg threshold — wait, that is outdated, and the revised definition uses > 20 mmHg, which this plan correctly reflects, so I should explicitly anchor to the updated criteria and confirm exclusion of Groups 2–5 etiologies on clinical and imaging grounds before labeling Group 1 PAH [^116q9UAQ] [^113343gB].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup and timing, and I need to check that we are not jumping to treatment before hemodynamic confirmation. Right heart catheterization with complete hemodynamics is mandatory, with acute vasoreactivity testing limited to idiopathic, heritable, or drug-induced PAH subtypes at an expert center; I almost said "for all PAH", but hold on, that would be incorrect for non-Group 1 etiologies, so I will keep vasoreactivity testing appropriately restricted and document mPAP, PAWP, PVR, and CO/CI along with the acute response criteria [^112g49Qh]. Transthoracic echocardiography for RV size and function, TAPSE, pericardial effusion, and estimated RA pressure, along with BNP or NT-proBNP and a comprehensive laboratory panel including HIV and autoimmunity screening are baseline essentials; pulmonary function tests with DLCO, and a ventilation–perfusion scan are needed to exclude CTEPH, with chest radiography and ECG complementing the initial profile, and the 6-minute walk test plus WHO functional class capture functional status; if available, CPET can refine phenotyping and risk, and importantly, I should avoid starting PAH therapy before full hemodynamic assessment, particularly in those with red flags suggesting high risk who may require inpatient optimization [^113343gB] [^116q9UAQ] [^113bNSFq] [^113KfYD6].

> I should double-check risk stratification because initial treatment hinges on it. The REVEAL 2.0/simplified calculator is validated to estimate 1-year mortality and provides clinically useful granularity across risk strata, while ESC/ERS recommends a multidimensional panel incorporating clinical, exercise, biomarkers, echocardiography, and hemodynamics; I will calculate a REVEAL score and reconcile it with a guideline-based three- or four-strata assessment so that discrepancies are resolved by clinical judgment rather than a single metric, especially given heterogeneity at lower mPAP thresholds in contemporaneous cohorts [^111m1mUS] [^113343gB] [^114XmJmh].

> Now, I will consider the high-risk profile and initial therapy because delays here affect survival. For patients with WHO FC IV, syncope, low cardiac index, very high PVR, or high/very high REVEAL risk, I should initiate continuous IV epoprostenol promptly as first-line therapy given survival and functional benefits in advanced disease; if epoprostenol is not feasible, IV or SC treprostinil is a reasonable alternative, and in selected patients, upfront triple therapy with a parenteral prostanoid plus ERA plus PDE5 inhibitor may be warranted, with concomitant urgent referral for lung transplantation evaluation at a specialized center; I need to ensure these steps proceed in a PH expert center and confirm label details where applicable [^112kFQ9E] [^112a58vU] [^114dBUTU] [^111APpA4].

> For intermediate-risk patients, I need to check combination evidence and drug selection nuances. Initial dual oral therapy with an ERA plus a PDE5 inhibitor is the preferred strategy to improve exercise capacity and delay clinical worsening; combinations such as ambrisentan with tadalafil have label support for reducing disease progression and hospitalization, and I should also consider patient-specific factors like hepatic function, drug–drug interactions, and tolerability. If dual therapy is not feasible, riociguat monotherapy targeting the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway can be considered, but I must remember not to combine it with a PDE5 inhibitor; in those with progression on dual oral therapy, adding inhaled or parenteral prostanoid or a prostacyclin receptor agonist is appropriate escalation [^112kFQ9E] [^115voR68] [^112w5RaS] [^113qZ5Uh] [^111D7oFg].

> For low-risk patients, I should confirm whether monotherapy suffices or if initial combination is preferred. Monotherapy with an ERA, a PDE5 inhibitor, or an sGC stimulator is acceptable if the patient is unable or unwilling to take combination therapy, with careful monitoring and a low threshold to escalate if there is any sign of progression; sildenafil and tadalafil have labeled benefits on 6MWD, while riociguat improves 6MWD and FC and delays clinical worsening, and in real-world cohorts, earlier combination therapy is associated with lower short-term mortality though confounding persists, so shared decision-making is key [^112w5RaS] [^116bNBM6] [^114kdSYr].

> I will now examine vasoreactive responders because the pathway diverges. If acute vasodilator testing shows a decrease in mPAP by at least 10 mmHg to 40 mmHg or less without a drop in cardiac output, I should initiate high-dose calcium channel blocker therapy such as amlodipine or nifedipine with close hemodynamic and clinical follow-up; I must reassess at 3–6 months to ensure the patient remains WHO FC I–II with sustained hemodynamic improvement, and if not, I need to transition to standard PAH-specific therapy promptly in line with guidelines [^112g49Qh] [^113xw1sF].

> Supportive and adjunctive care cannot be overlooked, and I should double-check areas of controversy. Diuretics for volume management in right heart failure, oxygen supplementation to maintain adequate saturation when hypoxemic, supervised exercise rehabilitation once stable, aggressive management of contributory conditions such as sleep apnea or systemic hypertension, and up-to-date influenza and pneumococcal vaccination are integral; anticoagulation in idiopathic PAH remains controversial with observational data showing mixed signals, so I will individualize this decision after weighing bleeding risk and phenotype rather than applying a blanket rule from older algorithms [^1143Dc6B] [^112kFQ9E] [^111KqqZF] [^1137gZGm].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and objective monitoring because missing early worsening can be costly. Every 3–6 months, I will reassess WHO functional class, vitals and signs of right heart failure, 6MWD, and BNP or NT-proBNP; echocardiography should be repeated approximately every 6–12 months to evaluate RV structure and function, and I need to monitor drug-specific labs such as liver function for ERAs and hemoglobin where applicable; criteria like a decline in 6MWD, worsening FC, PAH hospitalization, or initiation of parenteral therapy should trigger escalation to the next treatment tier or addition of a third class, recognizing that clinical worsening is strongly predictive of near-term mortality [^113bNSFq] [^1122pL3m] [^117F4CKn] [^115xfLyo].

> For advanced therapies and refractory disease, I need to ensure timely referral. Patients who are high risk at presentation or remain high risk despite optimized double or triple therapy should be referred early for lung transplantation evaluation, and balloon atrial septostomy may be considered as a palliative bridge in selected cases at experienced centers while ongoing clinical trial options should be discussed to access novel mechanisms [^112kFQ9E] [^1137gZGm].

> I should confirm referral pathways and patient education because specialized care impacts outcomes. All patients with PAH should be evaluated and co-managed at a specialized PH center, ideally before initiating therapy, with counseling on disease course, adherence, adverse effect surveillance, and reproductive planning; I need to emphasize strict avoidance of pregnancy when on teratogenic agents such as ERAs and ensure access to social support for high-cost therapies, with genetic counseling offered if idiopathic or heritable PAH is suspected [^111APpA4] [^116Ziprp] [^115voR68].

> In summary, let me reconsider the sequence to ensure internal consistency and no gaps. Confirm Group 1 PAH with RHC using the updated > 20 mmHg definition and exclude alternate PH groups; complete guideline-concordant baseline evaluation including vasoreactivity testing when appropriate; calculate REVEAL and synthesize a multidimensional risk profile; initiate parenteral prostacyclin for high risk, dual oral therapy for intermediate risk, and individualized monotherapy or combination for low risk with rapid escalation for any clinical worsening; provide supportive care; monitor rigorously every 3–6 months with predefined escalation triggers; engage a PH center, counsel comprehensively, and refer early for transplantation in refractory high-risk cases, correcting any earlier outdated thresholds or over-generalizations as I go [^116q9UAQ] [^113343gB] [^112kFQ9E] [^111m1mUS] [^111APpA4].

For a new group 1 PAH patient, confirm diagnosis with **right heart catheterization** (mPAP > 20 mmHg, PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg, PVR ≥ 3 WU) [^116q9UAQ] and exclude other PH groups with echocardiography, PFTs, and V/Q scan. Perform **vasoreactivity testing** [^112g49Qh]; if positive, start high-dose CCBs [^113xw1sF]; if negative, initiate **risk-stratified therapy**, with dual ERA+PDE5i for low/intermediate risk, and IV/SC prostacyclin for high risk or WHO FC IV [^113bNSFq] [^112kFQ9E]. Obtain baseline labs (CBC, CMP, LFTs, TSH, HIV, hepatitis, NT-proBNP), 6MWT, and consider genetic testing [^116toQDG] [^114fRpLe]; refer to a specialized PH center [^111APpA4] and reassess at 3–6 months with repeat risk assessment and right heart catheterization if needed.

## Diagnostic workup

### Confirmatory testing

Right heart catheterization (**RHC**) [^113343gB] confirms PAH with mPAP > 20 mmHg, PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg, and PVR ≥ 3 WU [^116q9UAQ]. Acute **vasoreactivity testing** [^112g49Qh] during RHC with inhaled nitric oxide or IV epoprostenol/adenosine identifies CCB responders [^113xw1sF].

---

### Exclusion of other PH groups

- **Echocardiography**: Exclude left heart disease (group 2) and assess RV function [^113KfYD6] [^113343gB].

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Exclude significant lung disease (group 3) [^111jJgiX].

- **Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan**: Exclude chronic thromboembolic PH (group 4) [^113343gB] [^115sEQvP].

---

### Laboratory and ancillary testing

- **Baseline labs**: CBC, CMP, LFTs, TSH, HIV, hepatitis serologies, NT-proBNP.

- **6-minute walk test (6MWT)**: Baseline functional capacity [^116toQDG].

- **Genetic testing**: Consider for heritable PAH [^114fRpLe].

---

## Initial treatment strategy

### General measures

Refer to a **specialized PH center** [^111APpA4] before initiating therapy. Supportive care includes **supplemental oxygen** for hypoxemia, **diuretics** for RV failure, and **anticoagulation** when indicated [^1137gZGm].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

Vasoreactive patients [^113xw1sF] should receive **high-dose CCBs** (amlodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem) [^112g49Qh]. For **non-vasoreactive patients**, initiate risk-based therapy as detailed in the table below [^113343gB].

| **Risk level** | **Recommended therapy** |
|-|-|
| Low/intermediate | Dual oral therapy (ERA + PDE5i) [^112g49Qh] [^114tztrQ] |
| High/WHO FC IV | IV/SC prostacyclin (epoprostenol, treprostinil) [^112kFQ9E] [^112a58vU] |

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Reassess at **3–6 months** using WHO FC, 6MWT, NT-proBNP, and echocardiography [^113bNSFq], with repeat RHC if needed. Escalate therapy by adding **prostacyclin** or considering **lung transplantation** if there is no improvement [^117F4CKn] [^113z5NwJ].

---

## Summary table: diagnostic and treatment plan

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm PAH with RHC and vasoreactivity testing [^116q9UAQ] [^112g49Qh] |
| 2 | Exclude other PH groups (echo, PFTs, V/Q scan) |
| 3 | Baseline labs, 6MWT, genetic testing [^116toQDG] [^114fRpLe] |
| 4 | Refer to specialized PH center [^111APpA4] |
| 5 | Initiate risk-stratified therapy [^114tztrQ] |
| 6 | Reassess at 3–6 months; escalate if needed [^117F4CKn] |

---

Early, accurate **diagnosis** and **risk-stratified therapy** are essential for optimal outcomes in group 1 PAH [^1172cuzE] [^116q9UAQ].

### Properly diagnosing pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115sEQvP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is encountered in many clinical conditions and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a clinical condition characterized by precapillary PH without causes such as lung disease, chronic thromboembolic PH, or other rare conditions. Evaluating a patient with suspected PH requires a series of investigations intended to confirm the diagnosis, determine the clinical PH group, and, in the case of PAH Group 1, ascertain the specific etiology. It is also essential to evaluate the functional and hemodynamic impairment.

- **Identifying risk factors for PH**: The workup should identify risk factors such as left heart disease, lung diseases associated with alveolar hypoxia, and chronic thromboembolism, as well as conditions associated with PAH Group 1 like scleroderma, human immunodeficiency virus, anorexigen use, and liver disease.
- **Use of diagnostic algorithms**: A detailed algorithm is presented to aid physicians in determining the appropriate PH category. Because the presence of one condition associated with PH does not exclude the presence of other etiologies, clinicians are strongly encouraged to follow the entire algorithm.
- **Clinical discussions and case studies**: Discussions and case studies describe the differentiation of PAH Group 1 from PH Group 2 and PAH Group 1 from PH Group 3. They also cover diagnosing PH Group 4, determining the long-term calcium channel blocker response in those with idiopathic PAH, and assessing the severity of PH.

### Contemporary trends in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension: an initiative to close the care gap [^115XGwwe]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (PAH-QuERI) was created to help clinicians implement a guidelines-based approach to the diagnosis and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Patients with PAH represent a heterogeneous population, and physician evaluation and treatment paradigms may vary considerably.

- **Methods**: Using an electronic data management system, participating physicians recorded data on the diagnostic workup, disease management, and outcomes of patients with PAH. Queries were generated automatically following each follow-up visit if the tests recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) were not performed at least once.

- **Results**: Of 791 patients enrolled in PAH-QuERI, 77% were women, and 64% received a diagnosis within three months prior to enrollment. Of these patients, 9% were in New York Heart Association functional class I, 39% in class II, 48% in class III, and 5% in class IV. The median age was 55 years, with an interquartile range of 45–66 years. At enrollment, all ACCP-recommended tests had been performed in only 6% of patients. The automated program generated 1,530 reminders for 642 patients (81%) with validated enrollment data. The proportion of recommended tests performed was as follows: 91% for complete blood count, 91% for liver function tests, 50% for connective tissue disease screening, 29% for HIV screening, 88% for chest radiographs, 82% for ECG, 97% for two-dimensional echocardiograms, 83% for pulmonary function tests, 41% for oximetry, 57% for ventilation/perfusion scans, 79% for 6-minute walk distances, and 90% for right-sided heart catheterization.

### Revised definition of pulmonary hypertension and approach to management: A clinical primer [^112g49Qh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Patients with idiopathic, hereditary, or drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but not other pulmonary hypertension (PH) subtypes, are considered for vasoreactivity testing with inhaled nitric oxide (NO) or another suitable agent performed at an expert PH center. A decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline to ≤ 40 mm Hg without a decrease in cardiac output generally warrants the initiation of oral calcium channel antagonist therapy, such as nifedipine or amlodipine, with the dose titrated based on the efficacy/adverse effect profile. Although vasoreactivity is uncommon (≈12%), this is an important subgroup because over 50% will achieve a dramatic, nearly curative, long-term clinical response to treatment.

If patients with PAH do not demonstrate vasoreactivity but are at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. WHO Functional Class III/IV symptoms, syncope, chest pain, cardiac index < 2.0 L/min/m², or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 12 Wood units), parenteral (preferred) or subcutaneous prostacyclin therapy, followed closely by the initiation of dual endothelin receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor oral therapy, is recommended.

For patients with PAH without vasoreactivity and not at a high-risk clinical profile, upfront endothelin receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy is a common therapeutic strategy, although other evidence-based approaches focusing on combination PAH therapy are also used.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: A review [^116q9UAQ]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a subtype of pulmonary hypertension (PH), characterized by pulmonary arterial remodeling. The prevalence of PAH is approximately 10.6 cases per 1 million adults in the US. Untreated, PAH progresses to right heart failure and death.

- **Observations**: Pulmonary hypertension is defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg and is classified into five clinical groups based on etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is one of these five groups of PH and is hemodynamically defined by right heart catheterization demonstrating a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mm Hg, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or lower, and a pulmonary vascular resistance of 3 Wood units or greater. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is further divided into subgroups based on underlying etiology, including idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, drug- and toxin-associated PAH, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, PAH in long-term responders to calcium channel blockers, and persistent PH of the newborn, as well as PAH associated with other medical conditions including connective tissue disease, HIV, and congenital heart disease. Early presenting symptoms are nonspecific and typically consist of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. Currently approved therapy for PAH consists of drugs that enhance the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate biological pathway (sildenafil, tadalafil, or riociguat), prostacyclin pathway agonists (epoprostenol or treprostinil), and endothelin pathway antagonists (bosentan).

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension in Latin America: Epidemiological data from local studies [^1169ioTR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a clinical classification of group 1 pulmonary hypertension (PH), is a rare and progressive disease with poor prognosis. It has a worldwide estimated prevalence ranging from 10 to 16 cases per million inhabitants per year and an incidence between 2.0 to 3.2 cases per million inhabitants. In the last two decades, knowledge of the basic pathobiology of PAH, its natural history, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic options has improved. National registries have provided a better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical evolution of the disease, offering valuable information on disease characteristics, demographics, and outcomes of patients with PAH, thereby enabling the development of risk stratification tools.

Two recent reviews have identified 11 PAH registries based in the United States (US), China, France, Scotland, United Kingdom (UK), Spain, and a European Union consortium. However, limited information is available on the characteristics of PAH patients outside of North America and Europe. Moreover, no Latin American studies were included in these reviews, which is particularly important as researchers have described potential geographical and regional differences. These differences are vital to consider in the design of clinical trials and PAH treatment. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of PAH (group 1) in Latin America.

### Prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114zB8QT]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Although idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is perceived as a progressive disease with a uniformly poor outcome, the natural history of the disease is heterogeneous, with some patients dying within months of diagnosis and others living for decades. The course of the disease has also been altered by advances in medical therapies. The outcome of patients with other types of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been less well characterized. Assessment of prognosis for such patients is important, as it influences both medical therapy and referral for transplantation. This chapter provides evidence-based recommendations to assess the prognosis of patients with PAH.

### Updated treatment algorithm of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113z5NwJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The demands on a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatment algorithm are multiple and, in some ways, conflicting. The treatment algorithm usually includes different types of recommendations with varying degrees of scientific evidence. Additionally, the algorithm is required to be comprehensive but not overly complex; it should be informative yet simple and straightforward. The types of information included in the treatment algorithm are heterogeneous, encompassing clinical, hemodynamic, medical, interventional, pharmacological, and regulatory recommendations.

Stakeholders, including physicians from various specialties with varying expertise in PAH, nurses, patients and their associations, healthcare providers, regulatory agencies, and industry, often find the PAH treatment algorithm relevant to their interests. These varied demands are considerable challenges when proposing appropriate updates to the evidence-based treatment algorithm. The treatment algorithm may be divided into three main areas:

- **General measures**: Supportive therapy, referral strategy, acute vasoreactivity testing, and chronic treatment with calcium channel blockers.

- **Initial therapy**: Initial therapy with approved PAH drugs.

- **Clinical response**: Clinical response to the initial therapy, combination therapy, balloon atrial septostomy, and lung transplantation.

All three sections will be revisited, highlighting information newly available in the past five years, and proposing updates where appropriate. The European Society of Cardiology grades of recommendation and levels of evidence will be adopted to rank the proposed treatments.

### Medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115XSa3n]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is often difficult to diagnose and challenging to treat. Untreated, it is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right ventricular failure and death. The past decade has seen remarkable improvements in therapy, driven largely by the conduct of randomized controlled trials. Still, the selection of the most appropriate therapy is complex and requires familiarity with the disease process, evidence from treatment trials, complicated drug delivery systems, dosing regimens, side effects, and complications. This chapter provides evidence-based treatment recommendations for physicians involved in the care of these complex patients. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic evaluation required and the treatment options available, it is strongly recommended that consideration be given to the referral of patients with PAH to a specialized center.

### Characterization of first-time hospitalizations in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension in the REVEAL registry [^114Hbzye]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

A composite endpoint encompassing hospitalization is considered a "level 1" endpoint, that is, a true measure of clinical efficacy. Clinical studies of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have incorporated such composite clinical-worsening endpoints in their study design, including a recent long-term event-driven clinical study that used time to PAH-related death or PAH-related hospitalization as a critical secondary endpoint. Clinical worsening, defined as worsening functional class, a ≥ 15% reduction in 6-min walk distance, need for parenteral prostacyclin analog therapy, or all-cause hospitalization, has been found to predict mortality at 1 year after any parameter of clinical worsening is met. Furthermore, hospitalization among patients with PAH appears to be associated with increased subsequent mortality. Hospitalization — and rehospitalization — therefore represent a substantial burden both for patients with PAH and for the health-care system.

Reports that characterize hospitalizations and/or calculate subsequent survival post-hospitalization in patients with PAH have identified factors at hospital admission that correlate with subsequent survival. However, it is difficult to generalize these reports to routine practice because of their single-center experience and their focus on only certain causes of PAH (World Health Organization [WHO] group 1 pulmonary hypertension). Also, these reports describe patients with disease-related hospitalizations and not patients with disease-unrelated hospitalizations or no hospitalizations, characterizations that could elucidate.

### The Reveal Registry risk score calculator in patients newly diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111m1mUS]. Chest (2012). High credibility.

In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), survival predictions can be important for optimizing therapeutic strategies. The present study aimed to validate a quantitative algorithm for predicting survival derived from the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) and to develop a simplified calculator for everyday clinical use.

Methods: Prospectively collected data from patients with newly diagnosed (< 3 months) World Health Organization group I pulmonary hypertension enrolled in the REVEAL Registry were used to validate a predictive algorithm for 1-year survival. Model calibration was evaluated by comparing algorithm-predicted survival with observed Kaplan-Meier estimates for the overall validation cohort and for five risk groups. Similarly, the risk discriminators for the simplified calculator were compared with those of the quantitative algorithm.

Results: The validation cohort comprised 504 individuals with a mean ± SD 6-min walk distance of 308 ± 128 m, and 61.5% were functional class III. The proportion of patients surviving 1 year fell within the range predicted by the model (95.1%, 91.5%, 84.6%, 76.3%, and 58.2%, respectively) among patients in the low (predicted survival ≥ 95%), average (90% to < 95%), moderate (85% to < 90%), high (70% to < 85%), and very high (< 70%) risk strata. Predicted and observed 1-year survival were similar across risk strata, and the c-index indicated good discrimination for both the full equation (0.726) and the simplified risk calculator (0.724).

### Treatment goals of pulmonary hypertension [^116toQDG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

With significant therapeutic advances in the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the need to identify clinically relevant treatment goals that correlate with long-term outcomes has emerged as one of the most critical tasks. Goals include achieving modified New York Heart Association functional class I or II, a 6-minute walk distance greater than 380 meters, normalization of right ventricular size and function on echocardiograph, decrease or normalization of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and hemodynamics with right atrial pressure at 2.5 mg/kg/min. However, to more effectively prognosticate in the era of complex treatments, it is becoming clear that the "bar" needs to be set higher, with more robust and clearer delineations aimed at parameters that correlate with long-term outcomes; namely, exercise capacity and right heart function.

Specifically, tests that accurately and noninvasively determine right ventricular function, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and BNP/N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, are emerging as promising indicators to serve as baseline predictors and treatment targets. Furthermore, studies focusing on outcomes have shown that no single test can reliably serve as a long-term prognostic marker and that composite treatment goals are more predictive of long-term outcomes. It has been proposed that treatment goals be revised to include the following: modified New York Heart Association functional class I or II, 6-minute walk distance of 380 to 440 meters, and cardiopulmonary exercise test-measured peak oxygen consumption greater than 15.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113bNSFq]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

In the classification and risk stratification of pulmonary hypertension, especially concerning severity assessment, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend assessing the severity of the disease systematically and consistently. This involves using a combination of the WHO classification (as provided below), exercise capacity, and echocardiographic, laboratory, and hemodynamic variables to inform therapeutic decisions.

- **FC I**: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
- **FC II**: Slight limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
- **FC III**: Marked limitation of physical activity. Patients are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes undue dyspnea or fatigue, chest pain, or near syncope.
- **FC IV**: Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. Patients manifest signs of right heart failure. Dyspnea and/or fatigue may even be present at rest. Discomfort is increased by any physical activity.

### Performance of the REVEAL model in who Group 2 to 5 pulmonary hypertension: Application beyond pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116ZUzQq]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) have non-pulmonary arterial hypertension PH (non-PAH PH) or multifactorial PH. The REVEAL score was designed to predict 1-year survival in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) only. It is unknown whether this model is applicable to a more general population of PH patients.

- **Methods**: Both newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed patients with PH of any etiology (n = 200) were enrolled in an observational cohort between the years 2003 and 2009. REVEAL scores were assessed for the ability to predict 1-year survival in the following groups: (1) PAH; (2) non-PAH PH; (3) multifactorial PH; and (4) the entire cohort.

- **Results**: Of the 200 patients, 126 (63%) had PAH, 32 (16%) had non-PAH PH, and 42 (21%) had multifactorial PH. The concordance indices for the model when applied to the various groups were: PAH, 0.72; non-PAH PH, 0.97; multifactorial PH, 0.77; and entire cohort, 0.775. Observed and predicted survivals of the entire cohort according to model-assigned risk strata were not statistically different from one another (p = 0.60), suggesting adequate model calibration.

- **Conclusions**: The REVEAL survival prediction model for PAH has comparable performance when applied to a broad population of PH patients. The data suggest that the model may have utility in PH patients in general, subject to validation in a larger cohort.

### Revatio [^116bNBM6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Revatio is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World Health Organization [WHO] Group I) in both adults and pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years, to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [see Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Adults**: Revatio is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening.

- **Pediatric patients (1 to 17 years old)**: Revatio is indicated in pediatric patients aged 1 to 17 years for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group I). It aims to improve exercise ability and, in pediatric patients too young to perform standardized exercise testing, addresses pulmonary hemodynamics thought to underlie improvements in exercise [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Evaluation of the predictive value of a clinical worsening definition using 2-year outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: A REVEAL registry analysis [^115xfLyo]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Time to clinical worsening has been proposed as a primary endpoint in clinical trials of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); however, neither standardized nor validated definitions of clinical worsening across PAH trials exist. This study aims to evaluate a proposed definition of clinical worsening within a large prospective, observational registry of patients with PAH with respect to its value as a predictor of proximate (within 1 year) risk for subsequent major events (i.e. death, transplantation, or atrial septostomy).

- **Methods**: We assessed overall 2-year survival and survival free from major events to determine the relationship between clinical worsening and major events among adults with hemodynamically defined PAH (N = 3,001). Freedom from clinical worsening was defined as freedom from worsening functional class (FC), a ≥ 15% reduction in 6-min walk distance (6MWD), all-cause hospitalization, or the introduction of parenteral prostacyclin analog therapy.

- **Results**: In the 2 years of follow-up, 583 patients died. Four hundred twenty-six died following a documented clinical worsening event, including FC worsening (n = 128), a ≥ 15% reduction in 6MWD (n = 118), all-cause hospitalization (n = 370), or introduction of a prostacyclin analog (n = 91). Patients who experienced clinical worsening had significantly poorer subsequent 1-year survival post-worsening than patients who did not worsen (P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Clinical worsening was highly predictive of subsequent proximate mortality in this analysis from an observational study. These results validate the importance of monitoring clinical worsening in patients with PAH.

### Characterization of first-time hospitalizations in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension in the REVEAL registry [^114E29um]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Hospitalization is an important outcome in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), shown previously to correlate with survival. Using the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL Registry), we sought to characterize first-time hospitalizations and their effect on subsequent hospitalization and survival in patients with newly diagnosed disease.

- **Methods**: Patients with newly diagnosed PAH (n = 862, World Health Organization group 1) were evaluated for first-time hospitalization. The hospitalizations were categorized as PAH related or PAH unrelated based on the case report form. Categories for PAH-related and PAH-unrelated hospitalization were defined before independent review. Patient demographics and disease characteristics are described as well as freedom from hospitalization and survival.

- **Results**: Of 862 patients, 490 (56.8%) had one or more hospitalizations postenrollment: 257 (52.4%) PAH related, 214 (43.7%) PAH unrelated, and 19 (3.9%) of undetermined causes. The most common causes of PAH-related hospitalization were congestive heart failure and placement/removal of a central venous catheter. Patients with PAH-related hospitalizations were more likely to receive parenteral therapy, be in functional class III/IV, and have higher risk scores before hospitalization at enrollment. Following discharge, 25.4% ± 3.2% and 31.0% ± 4.0% of patients with PAH-related and PAH-unrelated first hospitalization, respectively, remained hospitalization-free for 3 years (P = 0.11). Survival estimates at 3 years postdischarge were 56.8% ± 3.5% and…

### Early detection of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1172cuzE]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains an incurable disease associated with an unacceptably high early mortality, despite advances in therapeutic options. The disease is clinically silent until late in its natural history, when most of the distal pulmonary arteries have been obliterated. Early diagnosis of PAH is associated with improved long-term survival, and screening of at-risk populations is, therefore, a rational strategy to improve outcomes in this condition.

Doppler echocardiography is the most widely used screening tool in clinical practice. The role of evidence-based screening strategies has been clarified by research such as the DETECT study in patients with systemic sclerosis. A multimodal approach, using a range of noninvasive tests, improves the performance of screening algorithms. Right heart catheterization is mandatory to confirm a diagnosis of PAH.

Uncertainties exist about the definition and prognostic relevance of pulmonary hypertension during exercise, but accumulating evidence suggests that stress testing of the pulmonary circulation can unmask clinically important early disease. Novel tools for the early detection of pulmonary vascular disease are urgently needed, given the substantial limitations of currently available techniques.

### New progress in diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116RRnm6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a persistent and progressive disease that often leads to premature death. The most common etiology is left heart or lung disease. According to epidemiological data, the incidence of PAH is up to 7.6 cases per million adults, and its prevalence ranges from 26 to 100 per million adults worldwide. The morbidity and mortality rates for PAH are significantly high, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment.

According to the latest clinical classification by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), PAH can be categorized into five groups:

- **Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)**: This comprises diverse diseases that result in similar pathological changes within the pulmonary vasculature.
- **PAH caused by left heart disease**: Includes systolic or diastolic heart failure and left-sided valvular diseases.
- **PAH caused by pulmonary disease and/or hypoxia**.
- **PAH caused by chronic thromboembolic embolism (CTE) and other pulmonary obstructive processes**.
- **PAH associated with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms**.

### Predictors of outcomes in mild pulmonary hypertension according to 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines: The EVIDENCE-PAH UK study [^114XmJmh]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

The presence of heart or lung disease, alone or in combination, is associated with poorer survival outcomes irrespective of pulmonary hypertension (PH) severity. Excluding comorbidity plays a vital role when making a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) at lower thresholds. Large registry studies demonstrate the changing demographics in PAH, showing older age and more comorbidities present in a real-life population, resulting in diagnostic and treatment challenges. Our study shows that within the subgroup with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of 21–24 mmHg, only 31.8% of patients did not have underlying heart or lung disease. Given the updated guidelines, many more patients with early-stage PH are likely to be identified at PH centers. We have shown that this is a very heterogeneous population, with potentially only a minority having a true vasculopathy. Thus, recruiting for interventional studies in this population may prove challenging. Including a minority of patients with mPAP of 21–24 mmHg could simply reduce the signal-to-noise ratio without providing substantial evidence of efficacy among the newly included subpopulation, as illustrated in the UNISUS study of high-dose vs. usual-dose macitentan (NCT04273945). Studies dedicated to this population, such as the ESRA study (NCT05339087), may find it challenging to recruit only those without comorbidities.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive disease, associated with poor prognosis despite advances in therapy. Patients often experience a delay between symptom onset and PAH diagnosis, with registry data suggesting delays close to two years. Diagnosis is often late in the disease process, and patients are highly symptomatic at the time of diagnosis.

### Screening, early detection, and diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114ihnED]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) occurs as an idiopathic process or as a component of a variety of disease processes, including chronic thromboembolic disease, connective tissue diseases, congenital heart disease, and exposure to exogenous factors, including appetite suppressants or infectious agents such as HIV. This article reviews evidence for screening in susceptible patient groups and the approach to diagnosing PAH when it is suspected, and provides specific recommendations for applying this evidence to clinical practice.

### Mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension in the modern era: Early insights from the Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry [^114kdSYr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Mortality based on initial treatment strategy in patients diagnosed with PAH ≤ 6 months is assessed. Of the 483 treatment-naïve patients diagnosed with PAH in this period, 156 patients (32%) began monotherapy, 241 patients (50%) commenced combination therapy, and 86 patients (18%) were not started on any therapy upon enrollment. Within the monotherapy group, 62% received PDE5i, 21% received ERA, 15% received prostacyclin pathway drugs, and 2% received sGC stimulators. In the combination therapy group, 87% underwent dual therapy (with 53% receiving PDE5i+ERA, 27% PDE5i+prostacyclin pathway drug, 5% ERA+prostacyclin pathway drug, 1% sGC+prostacyclin pathway drug, and 1% ERA+sGC) and 13% received triple combination therapy (12% PDE5i+ERA+prostacyclin pathway drug and 1% ERA+sGC+prostacyclin pathway drug).

Compared with the monotherapy group, patients initiated on combination therapy were typically younger, had idiopathic PAH, exhibited better exercise capacity, higher PVR, and lower cardiac output. On unadjusted analysis, compared to initial monotherapy, those treated with initial combination therapy exhibited lower 1-year mortality (7% [95% CI, 5%–12%] versus 13% [95% CI, 8%–20%], P = 0.046), although no significant differences were noted for 2-year (17% [95% CI, 11%–24%] versus 20% [95% CI, 14%–29%], P = 0.13) and 3-year (19% [95% CI, 13%–27%] versus 23% [95% CI, 15%–33%], P = 0.17) mortality. When adjustments for age, sex, and PVR were made, the significant difference in 1-year mortality between initial monotherapy and combination therapy persisted (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43).

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114TMm4z]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Although the recommendations in this guideline focus on a population composed largely of children with Group 1 PH or pulmonary arterial hypertension whose optimal therapy is PH-specific pharmacotherapies, we provide additional considerations related to other important etiologies of PH in children that can progress despite optimal therapy.

- **Beyond pulmonary arterial hypertension**: PH is classified as Group 3, related to underlying lung disease and/or hypoxemia, in up to one-third of affected children. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common underlying diagnosis; screening echocardiography is recommended for infants with severe BPD and for those not improving as expected. Patients with severe BPD-PH have high mortality; however, PH typically resolves in those who survive. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia and other causes of pulmonary hypoplasia also commonly result in PH, which typically resolves with time and lung growth. Children with severe lung disease, as well as those with hypoxemia due to sleep-disordered breathing, are at risk for PH. As such, screening echocardiography is recommended for children with advanced diffuse lung disease or severe obstructive sleep apnea.

- **Management of Group 3 PH**: The foundation for managing Group 3 PH in children is to treat the underlying lung disease, minimize further insults to the lungs, avoid atelectasis, and normalize oxygenation and ventilation when possible. Despite concerns that indiscriminate dilation of the pulmonary vasculature could worsen clinical outcomes, careful consideration of therapy is essential.

### Characterization of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients walking more than 450 m in 6 min at diagnosis [^117YViCt]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

At diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), some patients are considered to have a "near-normal" 6-min walk distance (6MWD), i.e.g.reater than 450 m. Because they are generally excluded from randomized controlled trials, little is known about these patients.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the baseline characteristics and treatment responses of 49 consecutive patients with a 6MWD greater than 450 m at the time of newly diagnosed PAH. Data from this cohort were then compared with data from hemodynamically matched patients with a 6MWD of less than 450 m. Patients with a 6MWD greater than 450 m were either in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC) II (n = 23) or III (n = 26) at baseline. Compared with patients in FC II, those in FC III had more severe hemodynamic impairment, i.e. a lower cardiac index and higher pulmonary vascular pressures and resistance, but similar 6MWD. At first evaluation after initiation of PAH-specific treatment (3–6 months), FC improved (FC I-II: n = 38; FC III: n = 11, P < 0.01). Compared with matched patients with 6MWD < 450 m, patients with a 6MWD greater than 450 m were approximately 9 years younger (P = 0.0006) and had a lower BMI (P = 0.0009).

- **Conclusions**: Anthropometric characteristics such as younger age and lower BMI may explain higher 6MWD in some PAH patients. In the cohort of patients with a 6MWD greater than 450 m, hemodynamic indices and WHO FC were more sensitive than 6MWD in detecting changes secondary to PAH-specific treatments.

### Effect of warfarin treatment on survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the registry to evaluate early and long-term PAH disease management (REVEAL) [^115KdaVf]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

The limitations of our study include the inherent limitations of observational registry-derived data and the retrospective nature of the report. Additionally, a high discontinuation rate of warfarin was observed, consistent with practice patterns in US PAH centers and suggestive of poor tolerance of anticoagulation in PAH patients. We attempted to account for this high rate of discontinuation by using a time-varying covariate model as a sensitivity analysis.

Although both the matched and sensitivity analyses were adjusted for disease severity as captured by the REVEAL Risk Score, the anticoagulation arm was characterized by parameters consistent with disease severity. For example, a greater proportion of patients on anticoagulation received PAH parenteral and combination therapy, and had higher brain natriuretic peptide and NYHA/WHO functional class, which may well reflect that sicker PAH patients were more likely to be anticoagulated at baseline.

The REVEAL Risk Score encompasses PAH risk factors, including demographic data, comorbidities, NYHA/WHO group I subgroup, NYHA/WHO functional class, vital signs, 6-minute walk distance, and brain natriuretic peptide along with echocardiographic, pulmonary function testing, and hemodynamic risk factors in a risk score prognostic model. Although it is evident that the REVEAL Risk Score captures most, if not all, known prognostic risk factors in PAH, the possibility of an unknown factor cannot be excluded. Furthermore, the REVEAL Risk Score has been validated in both incident and prevalent patients and has been cross-validated.

### A modified risk score in one-year survival rate assessment of group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension [^112R8Y5u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

By May 2015, a cohort of 108 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) from May 2014 to May 2015 was established. In this cohort, between May 2015 and May 2016, 18 patients died and 5 patients were lost to follow-up. The validation cohort included 216 patients, with 7 cases lost to follow-up between May 2016 and May 2017. The mean age, proportion of female patients, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), NT-pro BNP, and proportion of WHO FC III or IV in the establishment cohort and validation cohort were as follows: 52.8 and 54.6 years (p = 0.088); 71.3% and 73.6% female (p = 0.123); 338 m and 309 m (p = 0.019); 3268 pg/mL and 3497 pg/mL (p = 0.066); and 63.9% and 72.2% (p = 0.005) respectively.

The demographics and characteristics of patients in the establishment cohort and the validation cohort are summarized in the following:

- **Characteristics of patients in two cohorts**:
	- WHO - World Health Organization, PAH - Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, CTD - Connective Tissue Disease, CHD - Congenital Heart Disease, PoPH - Portal Pulmonary Hypertension, 6MWD - 6-Minute Walking Distance, BNP - Brain Natriuretic Peptide, DLco - Diffusing Capacity of Lung for Carbon Monoxide, PFT - Pulmonary Function Test, VO2 - Volume of Oxygen, CPET - Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing, WU - Wood Units.

The model of the modified risk assessment score for PAH was established using the establishment cohort. The score of the modified risk assessment score (mRASP) for the establishment cohort ranged with a minimum risk score of 0, a maximum risk score of 8, and a mean risk score of 4.5.

### A modified risk score in one-year survival rate assessment of group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115L8Jix]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a pathophysiological disorder complicating both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. It is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) ≥ 25 mmHg, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mmHg, and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 3 Wood units (WU) without other causes of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH).

The 2015 ESC/ERS (European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society) PH guidelines strongly recommend a comprehensive regular assessment of patients with PAH since there is no single variable that provides sufficient diagnostic and prognostic information. Instead, a multidimensional approach is required. Based on the evaluation of multiple variables, PAH patients can be categorized as low, intermediate, or high risk with estimated one-year mortality rates of < 5%, 5–10%, and > 10%, respectively. The basic program should include the functional class (FC) and at least one measurement of exercise capacity. It is also recommended to obtain information on right ventricular (RV) function.

However, an individual patient is unlikely to have all variables indicative of merely one strata, thus leading to the physician's decision on the overall risk being subjective. Consequently, the assessment could vary between different physicians. One approach which can distinctly classify the risk strata of PAH is the French registry risk equation, which unfortunately concerns sex, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and cardiac output only. Another approach is the risk assessment score of the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL), which is a simplified risk score based on the patient population.

### Delay in recognition of pulmonary arterial hypertension: factors identified from the REVEAL registry [^112ANHi8]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and fatal disorder. Despite the emergence of effective therapy, PAH is commonly at an advanced stage when recognized. Factors associated with a prolonged symptomatic period before the recognition of PAH have not been fully evaluated.

- **Methods**: The Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) enrolled 2,967 US adult patients with PAH from March 2006 to September 2007. Patients were considered to have delayed disease recognition if more than two years elapsed between symptom onset and the patient receiving a PAH diagnosis, starting on PAH-specific therapy, or receiving a diagnosis by right-sided heart catheterization.

- **Results**: In 21.1% of patients, symptoms persisted for more than two years before PAH was recognized. Patients with the onset of PAH symptoms before age 36 years showed the highest likelihood of delayed disease recognition (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.03–4.66). A history of obstructive airways disease (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.5–2.47) and sleep apnea (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.33–2.22) were independently associated with delayed PAH recognition.

### The pulmonary hypertension consult: Clinical and coding considerations [^113xzq2r]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increasingly recognized cause of morbidity and mortality, and in the past 20 years, there has been a rapid expansion in research and available therapies. Although it is defined quite simply as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of ≥ 25 mm Hg, PH encompasses a heterogeneous group of disease processes. In the past, PH was classified as primary or secondary, but as understanding of the various contributing diseases has increased, classification systems have attempted to group these diseases by clinical features and disease mechanism.

The evaluation of patients with suspected PH can be cumbersome, and a careful and methodical approach is needed to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis, correct physiological classification, and appropriate treatment. In this review, we discuss the classification and diagnostic evaluation of PH in adults as well as some of the billing and coding considerations involved in this evaluation.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for pulmonary hypertension, specifically concerning the indications for screening patients at risk, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring patients at increased risk for PAH. These include individuals with a family history of PAH, a known PAH-causing genetic mutation in the patient or a first-degree relative, limited cutaneous scleroderma, or mixed connective tissue disease. Additional risk factors include exposure to drugs or toxins known to cause PH, and congenital heart disease with a surgically repaired left-to-right shunt within 3–6 months for the development of symptoms of PAH.

### Comparison of contemporary risk scores in all groups of pulmonary hypertension: A Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute GoDeep meta-registry analysis [^113ujYzg]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

- **Take-home points**:

	- **Study question**: Do risk scores originally developed for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; group 1 pulmonary hypertension [PH]) have predictive power in patients with non-PAH PH?

	- **Results**: Three-strata and four-strata risk scores predicted survival in all PH groups 1 through 4. The Comparative, Prospective Registry of Newly Initiated Therapies for Pulmonary Hypertension (COMPERA) four-strata risk score effectively distinguished patients with high-risk and low-risk disease within the intermediate-risk group. In contrast, the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) scores, used as a continuous scoring system, showed the highest statistical prognostic power and granularity in this global multicenter study, including 8,565 patients with incident and treatment-naïve disease.

	- **Interpretation**: PAH-designed three-strata, four-strata, or continuous data risk scores possess predictive power in a large cohort of patients with PH. This is true whether the scores are considered as a common group or calculated separately for each PH group (1–4) and various subgroups.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a multifaceted and heterogeneous disease with classification into five distinct groups: group 1, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); group 2, PH associated with left heart disease; group 3, PH associated with lung disease, hypoxia, or both; group 4, PH associated with pulmonary artery obstruction (CTEPH); and group 5, PH with an unclear or multifactorial cause, or both. It is noteworthy that the survival of all patients with PH is impacted by these classifications and associated risk scores.

### Risk reduction and hemodynamics with initial combination therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^111sdnui]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

An initial oral combination of drugs is being recommended in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but the effects of this approach on risk reduction and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) are not known. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that a low-risk status would be determined by the reduction of PVR in patients with PAH treated upfront with a combination of oral drugs.

The study enrolled 181 treatment-naive patients with PAH (81% idiopathic) with a follow-up right heart catheterization at 6 months (interquartile range, 144–363 days) after the initial combination of endothelin receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor drugs, along with clinical evaluation and risk assessments by European guidelines and the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management scores.

Initial combination therapy improved functional class and 6-minute-walk distance and decreased PVR by an average of 35% (median, 40%). However, one-third of the patients had a decrease in PVR of less than 25%. This poor hemodynamic response was independently predicted by age, male sex, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac index. At echocardiography, a right/left ventricular surface area ratio greater than 1, associated with low tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of less than 18 mm, was also a predictor. A low-risk status at 6 months was achieved or maintained in only 34.8% (Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management score) to 43.1% (European score) of the patients. Adding criteria of poor hemodynamic response improved the prediction of a low-risk status.

### A modified risk score in one-year survival rate assessment of group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113MKs4W]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical daily assessment is a critical method to evaluate patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) for determining disease severity, prognosis, and management. It should be performed regularly using a combination of variables. Although existing risk assessment approaches have been validated to predict survival rates in multiple cohorts, defects remain that leave room for improvement. Consequently, this study aimed to develop a modified risk assessment score for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

For the model establishment of this modified risk assessment score, we deliberated our desirable determinants based on the principles of validity, accuracy, simplicity, and convenience. The choice of these four determinants as variables for our modified risk assessment score stemmed from their frequent use in PH centers and their strong correlation with mortality in multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the score provided quantitative assessments rather than qualitative ones, since qualitative assessments might vary dramatically between physicians.

- **WHO FC**: WHO functional classification (FC) is one of the most valid predictors of survival for both diagnosis and follow-up, notwithstanding its variability. A deteriorating FC is a serious sign of disease progression.
- **6MWD**: The 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) results from the 6-min walking test (6MWT), a sub-maximal exercise test. It is the most inexpensive and familiar exercise test frequently used in PH centers. The overall treatment goal for patients with PAH is to achieve a low-risk status.

### Location of care delivery for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the United States [^1131gyam]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease that results in progressive right heart compromise, substantial morbidity, and high mortality. The European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society, American Heart Association, and Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) all recommend the referral of patients with PAH to specialized pulmonary hypertension (PH) centers for evaluation and management. One central idea is that defined PH centers should see a high volume of patients with PAH, with the aim of improving quality of care and outcomes in these patients.

The PHA started an accreditation program in 2014 within the United States to identify centers that provide comprehensive PAH care, increase collaboration across centers, and encourage guideline-concordant care. Many, but not all, high-volume PH centers have since been accredited by the PHA. Despite this emerging accreditation structure in the United States, and guidelines recommending evaluation at specialized PH centers, little is known about where the majority of PAH care is actually delivered or the factors that influence where care is received. Knowledge about where patients receive PAH care has important ramifications for education and health-system interventions around the delivery of care.

In a real-world administrative cohort, we aimed to identify where PAH care is being delivered in the United States by evaluating the fraction of care being delivered by PH centers as estimated by the location of the provider who prescribed PAH-specific therapies.

### United States pulmonary hypertension scientific registry: Baseline characteristics [^114fRpLe]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment, genotyping, and phenotyping of patients with World Health Organization Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have evolved dramatically in the last decade.

- **Research question**: The United States Pulmonary Hypertension Scientific Registry was established as the first US PAH patient registry to investigate genetic information, reproductive histories, and environmental exposure data in a contemporary patient population.

- **Study design and methods**: Investigators at 15 US centers enrolled consecutively screened adults diagnosed with Group 1 PAH who had enrolled in the National Biological Sample and Data Repository for PAH (PAH Biobank) within 5 years of a cardiac catheterization demonstrating qualifying hemodynamic criteria. Exposure and reproductive histories were collected using a structured interview and questionnaire. The biobank provided genetic data.

- **Results**: Between 2015 and 2018, a total of 499 of 979 eligible patients with clinical diagnoses of idiopathic PAH (IPAH) or familial PAH (n = 240 [48%]), associated PAH (APAH; n = 256 [51%]), or pulmonary venoocclusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (n = 3 [1%]) enrolled. The mean age was 55.8 years, the average BMI was 29.2 kg/m², and 79% were women. The mean duration between symptom onset and diagnostic catheterization was 1.9 years. Sixty-six percent of patients were treated with more than one PAH medication at enrollment. Past use of prescription weight loss drugs (16%), recreational drugs (27%), and oral contraceptive pills (77%) was common. Women often reported miscarriage (37%).

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to PAH-specific therapy, initial therapy according to the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommends obtaining continued monitoring in treatment-naive patients with PAH who have WHO functional class I symptoms. This monitoring is for the development of symptoms indicating disease progression and warrants the initiation of pharmacotherapy.

### Elevated pulmonary pressure noted on echocardiogram: A simplified approach to next steps [^113KfYD6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

On first look, this patient has demographics consistent with WHO group 1 PAH and WHO functional class IV symptoms, given the history of syncope. The next steps will be to perform a careful history and physical examination, looking for stigmata associated with the subgroups of PAH. Evidence of right heart failure on physical examination or a history of syncope will require rapid evaluation and treatment.

Of particular concern on physical examination are findings of low pulse pressure and cool extremities associated with low‐output state and hypoperfusion, which would require admission for expedited evaluation and treatment. The practice to start monotherapy before obtaining a full hemodynamic assessment (even with phosphodiesterase inhibitors) should be avoided.

### A modified risk score in one-year survival rate assessment of group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension [^117CV4xM]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

All eligible patients were enrolled according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: 1) age ≥ 18 years; 2) a diagnosis of PH with mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg, PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg, and PVR > 3 Wood units (WU) in RHC. Exclusion criteria: 1) a diagnosis of PH in Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, and Group 5 according to classifications in the 2015 ESC/ERS PH guidelines; 2) co-morbidity with other severe cardiopulmonary diseases; 3) absence of any variables involved in risk assessment; 4) no adherence to PAH-specific therapy; 5) loss to follow-up.

- **Risk assessment tools**: The REVEAL risk assessment score identifies variables independently associated with increased mortality by physical examination or laboratory tests. These include men aged > 60 years, PAH associated with portal hypertension, PAH associated with connective tissue disease, family history of PAH, modified New York Heart Association (NYHA)/World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III or IV, renal insufficiency, resting systolic BP, 92 beats/min, mean RAP > 20 mmHg, 6MWD 1500 pg/mL, PVR > 32 WU, % predicted diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) ≤ 32%, and the presence of pericardial effusion on echocardiography. Risk strata are indicated as follows: predicted one-year survival is 95 to 100% in the low-risk group, 90 to 95% in the average-risk group, 85 to 90% in the moderately high-risk group, 70 to 85% in the high-risk group, and < 70% in the very high-risk group. The average predicted one-year survival is 95 to 100% (low-risk) for patients with

### Characterization of first-time hospitalizations in patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary arterial hypertension in the REVEAL registry [^114mcLav]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The REVEAL Registry represents the largest database so far of patients newly diagnosed with PAH (WHO group 1) analyzed for characteristics of first-time hospitalization. The burden of disease in patients with PAH is substantial, as evidenced by the high incidence of hospitalization (57%) in this cohort of patients with newly diagnosed disease from the prospective REVEAL Registry. Our findings clearly demonstrate that all-cause hospitalization is very common among patients with newly diagnosed disease. In particular, the rate of PAH-unrelated hospitalizations in this REVEAL Registry cohort is relatively high, suggesting that the term "PAH-unrelated" is a misnomer and that this category of hospitalization actually reflects a degree of risk conferred by the PAH comorbidity.

For example, a primary discharge diagnosis of "pneumonia" on the case report form would result in a categorization of that patient's hospitalization as PAH-unrelated. However, if PAH predisposes the patient to non-line-related infections such as pneumonia or if an infection such as pneumonia were to precipitate congestive heart failure, then one could argue that the hospitalization is truly PAH related. The study is unable to address that methodologic challenge. Although 53% of patients had first-time hospitalizations that were clearly related to PAH, it is unclear what proportion of so-called "PAH-unrelated" hospitalizations were truly incidental or precipitated by the PAH comorbidity to some extent.

Patients in this analysis who were hospitalized for any reason had a higher prevalence…

### Effect of warfarin treatment on survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) [^111KqqZF]. Circulation (2015). High credibility.

- **REVEAL registry**: The design and baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the REVEAL Registry have been described previously. In brief, the REVEAL Registry is a multicenter (55 sites, university-affiliated and community hospitals), observational, US-based study designed to provide information about demographics, disease course, and management of 3515 consecutively enrolled patients with newly or previously diagnosed group I PAH. The study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was reviewed by the institutional review board of each participating center with written informed consent obtained from all patients. Patients were followed for at least 5 years from the time of enrollment.

	- Diagnosis was confirmed by right heart catheterization within 3 months before enrollment for newly diagnosed and more than 3 months before enrollment for previously diagnosed patients. PAH was defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or greater than 30 mm Hg with exercise, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure less than or equal to 18 mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance greater than or equal to 240 dyn·sec·cm–5. The IPAH group included only patients with IPAH and did not include patients with heritable or anorexigen-induced PAH. SSc-PAH included patients with both limited and diffuse SSc-PAH.

	- Data were collected at the time of enrollment, followed by quarterly updates including information from any clinic visits or other patient contact in the previous 90 days. Exact dates of PAH-specific medications were collected throughout the study.

### Predictors of outcomes in mild pulmonary hypertension according to 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines: The EVIDENCE-PAH UK study [^112SMr2x]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

We used standard investigations common in clinical practice to further phenotype this population and identify conditions that may contribute to mortality. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of 21–24 mmHg remained an independent predictor of mortality when adjusting for significant lung and left heart disease, age, and gender in the presence of mildly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR > 2– ≤ 3 WU). This excess mortality within the mPAP group of 21–24 mmHg, in certain subgroups, might be influenced by associations with chronic thrombo-embolic disease and malignancy. Patients with multisystem diseases such as connective tissue disease (CTD) may have a poor prognosis due to organ involvement beyond pulmonary vasculopathy. Understanding causality requires further evaluation.

Analysis of the population free of evidence of lung or heart disease reveals an inverse association between mPAP and survival. Kaplan–Meier curves suggest similar survival between those with normal haemodynamics and those with a mPAP between 21–24 mmHg for the first four years after catheterization, thereafter diverging. It is tempting to consider this as evidence of a progressive vasculopathy in this population, which certainly justifies close follow-up of patients in this group.

### Diagnosis and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension: Implications for respiratory care [^114cgPdD]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a pathological condition of the small pulmonary arteries. It is characterized histopathologically by vasoconstriction, vascular proliferation, in situ thrombosis, and remodeling of all three levels of the vascular walls. These pathological changes result in progressive increases in the mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, which, if untreated, lead to right-ventricular failure and death. PAH can be associated with multiple conditions or risk factors, such as collagen vascular diseases, liver disease, human immunodeficiency virus, congenital heart disease, or the ingestion of certain medications or toxins, or it can be idiopathic. Up to 10% of the idiopathic cases are familial. Regardless of the etiology, the clinical presentation, histopathologic lesions, and response to therapy are all similar.

Early in the disease process, the signs and symptoms of PAH are often subtle and nonspecific, making diagnosis challenging. Patients most often present with progressively worsening dyspnea and fatigue. An extensive evaluation is indicated to diagnose PAH, decipher its etiology, and determine long-term treatment goals. A transthoracic echocardiogram is an excellent screening tool to evaluate PAH, but every patient requires a right-side heart catheterization to help stage the disease and guide therapy.

Prior to a decade ago, clinicians were only able to offer symptomatic therapy to this challenging group of patients. However, earlier diagnosis, rapidly advancing understanding of the pathogenesis, and an increasing number of treatment options have transformed the management of PAH, providing more hope and improved outcomes for affected individuals.

### Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of non-pulmonary arterial hypertension pulmonary hypertension [^111jJgiX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The 4th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension was the first international meeting to focus not only on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) but also on the so-called non-PAH forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The term "non-PAH PH" summarizes those forms of PH that are found in groups 2 to 5 of the Classification of PH, that is, those forms associated with left heart disease, chronic lung disease, venous thromboembolism, and other diseases. Many of these forms of PH are much more common than PAH, but all of them have been less well studied, especially in terms of medical therapy.

The working group on non-PAH PH focused mainly on four conditions: chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, chronic thromboembolic PH, and left heart disease. The medical literature regarding the role of PH in these diseases was reviewed, and recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment of PH in these conditions are provided. Given the lack of robust clinical trials addressing PH in any of these conditions, it is important to conduct further studies to establish the role of medical therapy in non-PAH PH.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: Update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1122pL3m]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary hypertension, specifically in relation to PAH-specific therapy, the ACCP 2019 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a parenteral agent. Options include IV epoprostenol to improve the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and WHO functional class, or IV treprostinil to improve 6MWD. An inhaled prostanoid may also be considered for patients with PAH who have WHO functional class III symptoms and show evidence of progression and/or markers of poor clinical prognosis despite treatment with one to two classes of oral agents.

### The molecular targets of approved treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113qZ5Uh]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

The pathobiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is complex. It is necessary for prescribing clinicians to have a thorough understanding of the mode of action of the drugs available for PAH and the evidence base of various combinations. The approval of riociguat has introduced a new, fourth class of pharmacotherapy, targeting the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway with a different molecular target compared to previously approved PDE5 inhibitors. However, comparative studies of the approved classes of therapy are lacking.

Although more evidence from trials of various therapies in combination is becoming available, the benefits of many therapy combinations remain inconclusive. The question of sequential versus first-line combination therapy is still under investigation, with further studies warranted. Combination therapy according to patient phenotype will also need to be guided by future studies.

Despite the advances made in recent years, PAH remains an incurable disease. As such, there is still an unmet medical need for new therapies, possibly targeting alternative pathways.

### Phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension: A registry analysis [^114bvU3f]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension consists of five major groups: group 1, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); group 2, pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease; group 3, pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease; group 4, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; and group 5, pulmonary hypertension due to systemic or multifactorial conditions. The criteria for the diagnosis and classification of pulmonary hypertension have been outlined in guidelines published in 2015, but in some patients, the individual classification is not always straightforward. This problem is frequently encountered in patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH), the most common form of PAH.

Originally, IPAH, formerly called primary pulmonary hypertension, was described as a disease occurring mostly in younger, otherwise healthy individuals, predominantly women. Such patients represent the classical phenotype of IPAH. However, registries from Europe and the United States have shown that IPAH is now more frequently diagnosed in older patients, many of whom have cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities. In such patients, it is not always easy to distinguish IPAH from group 2 or group 3 pulmonary hypertension. Several disease phenotypes have been reported, including a subtype of patients diagnosed with IPAH who present with a lung phenotype, mainly characterized by a history of smoking and a low lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), but otherwise no or only subtle signs of parenchymal lung disease. In accordance with guidelines, these phenotypes are important to consider for accurate diagnosis and treatment.

### Early detection of pulmonary vascular disease in pulmonary arterial hypertension: Time to move forward [^116DVqPP]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be a rapidly progressive disorder and is associated with a high rate of mortality, despite medical intervention. With the availability of effective therapy, early disease detection becomes an important strategic objective to improve treatment outcomes. Resting echocardiography is currently the recommended screening modality for high-risk population groups. However, it is clear that derangements in resting haemodynamics and symptoms are late sequelae of the pathobiological processes that begin in the distal pulmonary arteries. Exercise stress may unmask early pulmonary vascular dysfunction, but the definition, clinical significance, and natural history of 'exercise PAH' remain undefined.

We will review the currently available and potential future strategies aimed at early disease detection and propose that the ultimate way forward is to detect disease at a stage prior to the rise in resting pulmonary artery pressure.

### Diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: A clinical practice guideline [^113jooD8]. Canadian Respiratory Journal (2010). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, specifically in relation to lung transplantation, the CTS 2010 guidelines recommend referring inoperable patients with CTEPH or those experiencing residual pulmonary hypertension post-pulmonary endarterectomy. This is particularly important for patients remaining in WHO functional class III or IV despite optimal medical therapy, as they should be evaluated for lung transplantation. Ensure early referral, as there can be significant delays until transplantation.

### Comparison of baseline predictors of prognosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients surviving ≤ 2 years and those surviving ≥ 5 years after baseline right-sided cardiac catheterization [^115ZK1mt]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is usually associated with a poor outcome, but the prognosis with other forms of PAH is not well described. Advances in therapy have further clouded the disease course. We sought to determine the baseline indicators of prognosis in patients with PAH. We reviewed the records of patients with PAH followed at our institution to identify those who died within 2 years (reduced survival group; n = 21) and those who survived more than 5 years (long survival group; n = 60). The groups were compared for prognostic significance of the baseline clinical parameters.

The reduced survival group were older (p = 0.001) and more likely to have:

- **Scleroderma-associated PAH**: (p = 0.01)
- **Pericardial effusion**: (p = 0.01)
- **Shorter 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance**: (p = 0.001)
- **Requirement for oxygen during 6MWT**: (p = 0.02)
- **Worse World Health Organization functional class**: (p < 0.001)
- **Greater serum brain natriuretic peptide levels**: (p = 0.01)

Regression analysis showed age, World Health Organization functional class, 6MWT distance, the need for oxygen during the 6MWT, and renal disease to be independently associated with a poor prognosis. In conclusion, age, PAH etiology, World Health Organization functional class, pericardial effusion, 6MWT distance, the need for oxygen during the 6MWT, and brain natriuretic peptide levels are predictors of prognosis in patients with PAH receiving specific therapy and might help identify a group that could benefit from aggressive upfront therapy.

### Updated evidence-based treatment algorithm in pulmonary arterial hypertension [^1137gZGm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled and controlled clinical trials with different compounds and procedures are reviewed to define the risk-benefit profiles for therapeutic options in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A grading system for the level of evidence of treatments, based on the controlled clinical trials performed with each compound, is used to propose an evidence-based treatment algorithm. The algorithm includes drugs approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of PAH and/or drugs available for other indications. The different treatments have been evaluated mainly in idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, and in PAH associated with the scleroderma spectrum of diseases or with anorexigen use. Extrapolation of these recommendations to other PAH subgroups should be done with caution.

Oral anticoagulation is proposed for most patients; diuretic treatment and supplemental oxygen are indicated in cases of fluid retention and hypoxemia, respectively. High doses of calcium-channel blockers are indicated only in the minority of patients who respond to acute vasoreactivity testing. Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing, or responders who remain in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III, should be considered candidates for treatment with either an oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor or an oral endothelin-receptor antagonist. Continuous intravenous administration of epoprostenol remains the treatment of choice in WHO functional class IV patients. Combination therapy is recommended for patients treated with PAH monotherapy who remain in WHO functional class III.
