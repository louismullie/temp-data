## Question

When do you treat subclinical hypothyroidism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding overt disease. Then, I should verify the TSH magnitude and how age modifies thresholds. Next, I will examine symptom status and antibody positivity. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy, infertility, and pediatrics. Finally, I will weigh benefits versus harms, outline a monitoring plan, and synthesize a practical decision framework with dosing and follow-up details.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before anything else, because I need to ensure we are truly dealing with subclinical hypothyroidism rather than overt hypothyroidism or a transient TSH abnormality. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by an elevated TSH with normal free T4, and I should repeat TSH and free T4 in about 2 to 3 months to confirm persistence, given that a substantial fraction of initially elevated TSH values normalize spontaneously, especially in older adults [^116W6nFP] [^116E5fuv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until I stratify by TSH magnitude, since this is the most consistent driver of decisions. For TSH persistently greater than 10 mIU/L, the balance of evidence favors treatment in most adults due to higher risks of progression to overt hypothyroidism and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, so I should recommend levothyroxine in this scenario unless there are compelling contraindications or patient preferences against therapy [^1151QfPg] [^1151QfPg] [^1151QfPg].

> For TSH between the upper limit of normal and 10 mIU/L, I should confirm that routine treatment is not beneficial in most adults, particularly older individuals, because high-quality randomized trials and meta-analyses show no improvement in quality of life, symptoms, cognition, or cardiovascular outcomes with levothyroxine in this range, so observation with periodic monitoring is generally preferred [^115B19e5] [^1151QfPg] [^1144AFHW].

> Wait, let me verify how age modifies thresholds, because older adults often have higher TSH distributions and may be harmed by overtreatment. In adults aged 65 years and older, especially those 80 and above, I should avoid treating when TSH is below about 7 mIU/L, and even consider a higher threshold around 7 to 10 mIU/L before initiating therapy, given the lack of symptomatic benefit and potential harms from iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, with the TRUST and IEMO80+ programs showing no improvement in symptoms, cognition, or function and pooled analyses showing no antibody-driven subgroup benefit [^1156Pzrh] [^1144AFHW] [^113HpyZ9].

> I need to check symptom status carefully, because nonspecific symptoms like fatigue and weight gain are common and often unrelated to thyroid status. In adults with TSH less than 10 mIU/L, even those with higher symptom burden at baseline did not experience greater improvement with levothyroxine than placebo, so I should avoid attributing vague symptoms to subclinical hypothyroidism and instead pursue other etiologies and shared decision-making about a time-limited trial if the patient strongly prefers it [^11459tG5] [^115B19e5].

> Let me consider thyroid peroxidase antibody status, since some guidelines historically weighed antibodies in decisions. However, I should double-check the latest interventional data, which show that positive anti-TPO does not predict better symptomatic or functional outcomes with levothyroxine in older adults, so I should not use antibody positivity alone to justify treatment in this population, even though antibodies increase the risk of progression to overt disease over long-term follow-up [^113HpyZ9] [^1151QfPg].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or trying to conceive? I should confirm that contemporary guidance differs from older paradigms. High-quality evidence and recent guidelines indicate that treating subclinical hypothyroidism in women who are pregnant or attempting pregnancy does not improve pregnancy loss, clinical pregnancy, or live birth rates, and randomized trials show no neurodevelopmental benefits for offspring, so routine treatment of screen-detected SCH is not recommended, though some older observational data suggested reduced pregnancy loss and historical ART guidance used lower TSH targets, which I should acknowledge while emphasizing the stronger negative RCT evidence base [^115zDF42] [^115U9TtT] [^111pZUZL] [^116y3PNk].

> I will now examine pediatric considerations, because progression risk and growth effects differ. In children and adolescents, most cases of mild TSH elevation normalize spontaneously, and treatment is generally reserved for persistent TSH greater than 10 mIU/L, goiter, or evidence of growth or developmental effects, with careful monitoring otherwise, so I should avoid overtreatment in this group as well [^115LrQCf] [^11138FYA].

> Next, I should review the balance of benefits and harms to ensure I am not underestimating risks. Benefits of treating TSH less than 10 mIU/L are unproven for symptoms, cognition, cardiovascular events, or mortality, whereas harms include iatrogenic hyperthyroidism with potential bone loss and atrial fibrillation, medication burden, and overtreatment that may persist lifelong, so the default should be observation unless a clear indication exists [^115B19e5] [^1151QfPg] [^115Qb6pQ].

> Let me think about a practical monitoring plan, because I need to ensure safe follow-up. For untreated patients with confirmed subclinical hypothyroidism, I should recheck TSH and free T4 every 6 to 12 months, recognizing that many will normalize spontaneously, and if treatment is initiated, I should titrate to a TSH target within the reference range using modest starting doses and reassess in 6 to 8 weeks, with lower starting doses in older adults or those with cardiac disease to avoid ischemia or arrhythmias [^1131kBp9] [^111HEjaz] [^116qyWMf].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing specifics when treatment is indicated. Typical starting doses for subclinical hypothyroidism are 25 to 50 micrograms daily, with adjustments based on TSH and clinical response, and in older adults or those with coronary disease I should start at 12.5 to 25 micrograms daily and titrate cautiously to avoid adverse cardiac effects [^113KWfGB] [^111HEjaz].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency. Treat when TSH is persistently greater than 10 mIU/L in most adults, consider treatment in younger or middle-aged patients with compelling symptoms after excluding other causes and documenting persistence, avoid routine treatment in older adults with TSH below about 7 mIU/L, and do not treat in pregnancy or infertility outside of research settings or exceptional circumstances, with all decisions anchored in shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of thyroid function [^1151QfPg] [^1156Pzrh] [^115zDF42] [^115B19e5].

Treat subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) when **TSH is persistently > 10 mIU/L** [^1151QfPg] because of the higher risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and cardiovascular events [^1145ew69]. For TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, treat only if there are **symptoms, positive thyroid antibodies, or cardiovascular risk factors** [^1168sTdk]; otherwise, monitor [^1131kBp9]. Do not treat **pregnant women with SCH** [^115zDF42] unless TSH exceeds 10 mIU/L or there are specific risk factors, as treatment does not improve pregnancy outcomes [^115igZfY]. In older adults (≥ 65 years), use a higher treatment threshold (TSH ≥ 7–10 mIU/L) [^1156Pzrh] and start low-dose levothyroxine (25–50 mcg) with cautious titration [^113KWfGB] to avoid overtreatment [^116qyWMf].

---

## Indications for treatment

### General adult population

- **TSH > 10 mIU/L**: Strong recommendation to treat due to increased risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism and cardiovascular events [^114LBMH9] [^1145ew69].
- **TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L**: Consider treatment if symptomatic, positive thyroid antibodies, or cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis) [^1168sTdk] [^116Sn7Cd]; otherwise, monitor [^1131kBp9].
- **Symptomatic patients**: Treat if symptoms are attributable to SCH after excluding other causes [^1168sTdk].

---

### Special populations

#### Pregnancy

Do not treat **routine SCH** [^115zDF42]; treatment does not improve pregnancy outcomes [^115igZfY]. Treat only if **TSH > 10 mIU/L** or if there are specific risk factors (e.g. thyroid antibodies, infertility treatment) [^116y3PNk].

---

#### Elderly patients (≥ 65 years)

Use a **higher threshold** (TSH ≥ 7–10 mIU/L) [^1156Pzrh] because of limited benefit and higher risk of overtreatment [^1144AFHW]. Start low and titrate slowly (25–50 mcg) [^113KWfGB] with close monitoring to avoid overtreatment [^116qyWMf].

---

#### Children and adolescents

Treat if **TSH > 10 mIU/L** or if there are symptoms, goiter, or growth/developmental concerns [^115LrQCf]. Otherwise, monitor, as many normalize spontaneously [^11138FYA].

---

## Situations where treatment is not recommended

- **Asymptomatic patients with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L**: No clear benefit; monitor instead [^115B19e5] [^1131kBp9].
- **Elderly with mild TSH elevation**: Higher risk of overtreatment; avoid treatment unless clearly indicated [^1156Pzrh] [^1144AFHW].
- **Pregnant women without specific risk factors**: Treatment does not improve outcomes [^115zDF42] [^115igZfY].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **rechecking TSH every 6–12 months** [^1131kBp9] if untreated, and every 6–8 weeks after starting or adjusting therapy until stable, then annually. Assess for **overtreatment** by watching for atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and anxiety [^115Qb6pQ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| TSH > 10 mIU/L | Treat |
| TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, symptomatic or with antibodies/cardiovascular risk | Consider treatment |
| TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, asymptomatic, no risk factors | Monitor |
| Pregnancy, routine SCH | Do not treat |
| Pregnancy, TSH > 10 mIU/L or specific risk factors | Treat |
| Elderly (≥ 65 years), TSH ≥ 7–10 mIU/L | Consider treatment |
| Children, TSH > 10 mIU/L or symptomatic | Treat |

---

Treatment of SCH should be **individualized** based on TSH level, symptoms, antibodies, cardiovascular risk, age, and pregnancy status, with a conservative approach to avoid overtreatment [^114LBMH9].

### Thyroid hormones treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism: a clinical practice guideline [^114LBMH9]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of thyroid hormones for adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH)? This guideline was triggered by a recent systematic review of randomised controlled trials, which could alter practice.

Current Practice

Current guidelines tend to recommend thyroid hormones for adults with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10 mIU/L and for people with lower TSH values who are young, symptomatic, or have specific indications for prescribing.

Recommendation

The guideline panel issues a strong recommendation against thyroid hormones in adults with SCH (elevated TSH levels and normal free T4 (thyroxine) levels). It does not apply to women who are trying to become pregnant or patients with TSH > 20 mIU/L. It may not apply to patients with severe symptoms or young adults (such as those ≤ 30 years old).

How This Guideline Was Created

A guideline panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced this recommendation in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach.

The Evidence

The systematic review included 21 trials with 2192 participants. For adults with SCH, thyroid hormones consistently demonstrate no clinically relevant benefits for quality of life or thyroid related symptoms, including depressive symptoms, fatigue, and body mass index (moderate to high quality evidence). Thyroid hormones may have little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality (low quality evidence), but harms were measured in only one trial with few events at two years' follow-up.

Understanding The Recommendation

The panel concluded that almost all adults with SCH would not benefit from treatment with thyroid hormones. Other factors in the strong recommendation include the burden of lifelong management and uncertainty on potential harms. Instead, clinicians should monitor the progression or resolution of the thyroid dysfunction in these adults. Recommendations are made actionable for clinicians and their patients through visual overviews. These provide the relative and absolute benefits and harms of thyroid hormones in multilayered evidence summaries and decision aids available in MAGIC (https://app.magicapp.org/) to support shared decisions and adaptation of this guideline.

### Association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115B19e5]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The benefit of thyroid hormone therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism is uncertain. New evidence from recent large randomized clinical trials warrants an update of previous meta-analyses.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of the association of thyroid hormone therapy with quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CENTRAL, Emcare, and Academic Search Premier from inception until July 4, 2018.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that compared thyroid hormone therapy with placebo or no therapy in nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism were eligible. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligibility based on titles and abstracts of all retrieved studies. Studies not excluded in this first step were independently assessed for inclusion after full-text evaluation by 2 reviewers.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool), and evaluated the quality of evidence (GRADE tool). For synthesis, differences in clinical scores were transformed (eg, quality of life) into standardized mean differences (SMDs; positive values indicate benefit of thyroid hormone therapy; 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 correspond to small, moderate, and large effects, respectively). Random-effects models for meta-analyses were applied.

Main Outcomes and Measures

General quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms after a minimum follow-up of 3 months.

Results

Overall, 21 of 3088 initially identified publications met the inclusion criteria, with 2192 adults randomized. After treatment (range, 3–18 months), thyroid hormone therapy was associated with lowering the mean thyrotropin value into the normal reference range compared with placebo (range, 0.5–3.7 mIU/L vs 4.6 to 14.7 mIU/L) but was not associated with benefit regarding general quality of life (n = 796; SMD, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.03; I2 = 66.7%) or thyroid-related symptoms (n = 858; SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.14; I2 = 0.0%). Overall, risk of bias was low and the quality of evidence assessed with the GRADE tool was judged moderate to high.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among nonpregnant adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, the use of thyroid hormone therapy was not associated with improvements in general quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms. These findings do not support the routine use of thyroid hormone therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Children with subclinical hypothyroidism — many clinicians consider it reasonable to initiate levothyroxine to avoid potential risk to growth and development, but treatment is generally not recommended when thyrotropin is 5–10 mIU/L; for thyrotropin > 10 mIU/L with signs and symptoms of primary thyroid disease and/or risk factors for progression, levothyroxine may be reasonable. Weak recommendation. Low-quality evidence.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^117KaLMs]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults — Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Should we treat for subclinical hypothyroidism? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115xMkqo]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In May 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a guideline on screening for thyroid disease that included a systematic evidence review and an update of its 2004 recommendations. The review assessed the effect of treating screen-detected subclinical thyroid dysfunction on health outcomes. It found adequate evidence that treating subclinical hypothyroidism does not provide clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure, body mass index, bone mineral density, lipid levels, or quality-of-life measures. The review also concluded that evidence was inadequate to determine whether screening for thyroid dysfunction reduced cardiovascular disease or related morbidity and mortality. In separate guidelines, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Thyroid Association advocated aggressive case-finding and recommended screening persons with certain clinical conditions or characteristics rather than the general population. These societies argue that subclinical hypothyroidism adversely affects cardiovascular outcomes and thus merits case-finding. Here, 2 experts discuss their perspectives on whether treating subclinical hypothyroidism reduces morbidity and mortality, whether there are harms of treatment, and how they would balance the benefits and harms of treatment both in general and for a specific patient.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^115zDF42]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) treatment — It is not recommended to treat women desiring pregnancy or already pregnant who have a diagnosis of SCH with levothyroxine, as treatment has not been proven to reduce pregnancy loss or to improve clinical pregnancy or LB outcomes (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate). In the absence of demonstrable benefit, practitioners are encouraged to use caution and not recommend routine screening and treatment.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^113AAuZf]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association hypothyroidism treatment guidelines — background and scope describe levothyroxine (LT4) as the standard of care for hypothyroidism, noting it is efficacious when administered orally, has a long serum half-life permitting daily administration, and resolves signs and symptoms in the majority of patients, while a small proportion feel LT4 does not restore optimum health. The guideline presents the latest data regarding combination therapy, liothyronine (LT3) monotherapy, compounded thyroid hormone products, and nutraceuticals, with a secondary objective to review thyroid hormone analogs; it states that subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is not addressed other than in the pediatric population and that thyroid hormone therapy in thyroid cancer is mentioned only if germane. The target audience is clinicians providing care to patients with hypothyroidism, and it is not the intent of these guidelines to replace clinical judgment or individual decision-making, as the recommendations are intended to inform clinicians considering management choices.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### Thyroid hormone replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism [^115D5oVA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with normal free thyroid hormones values. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is 4% to 8% in the general population, and up to 15% to 18% in women who are over 60 years of age. There is considerable controversy regarding the morbidity, the clinical significance of subclinical hypothyroidism and if these patients should be treated.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thyroid hormone replacement for subclinical hypothyroidism.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. Ongoing trials databases, reference lists and abstracts of congresses were scrutinized as well.

Selection Criteria

All studies had to be randomised controlled trials comparing thyroid hormone replacement with placebo or no treatment in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism. Minimum duration of follow-up was one month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for missing or additional information.

Main Results

Twelve trials of six to 14 months duration involving 350 people were included. Eleven trials investigated levothyroxine replacement with placebo, one study compared levothyroxine replacement with no treatment. We did not identify any trial that assessed (cardiovascular) mortality or morbidity. Seven studies evaluated symptoms, mood and quality of life with no statistically significant improvement. One study showed a statistically significant improvement in cognitive function. Six studies assessed serum lipids, there was a trend for reduction in some parameters following levothyroxine replacement. Some echocardiographic parameters improved after levothyroxine replacement therapy, like myocardial relaxation, as indicated by a significant prolongation of the isovolumic relaxation time as well as diastolic dysfunction. Only four studies reported adverse events with no statistically significant differences between groups.

Authors' Conclusions

In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. Some evidence indicates that levothyroxine replacement improves some parameters of lipid profiles and left ventricular function.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — natural history and evidence for treatment notes that about 37% of persons with subclinical hypothyroidism spontaneously revert to a euthyroid state without intervention after several years and about 2% to 5% develop "overt" thyroid dysfunction; one retrospective cohort study found that levothyroxine use in subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with lower risk for heart disease events and overall mortality, but the USPSTF did not identify any clinical trials that evaluated the causal relationship between treatment and subsequent cardiac events, and it did not identify any trials or observational studies that evaluated the effects of treatment of "overt" hypothyroidism versus no treatment.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in older individuals [^1156Pzrh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism, which is defined as a thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration higher than the reference range (generally 4.5 mIU/L or higher) with normal free thyroxine concentrations, is frequently found in older individuals. International guidelines differ in recommendations for management of subclinical hypothyroidism in older individuals. We assessed published data during the past decade on the clinical significance and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in individuals aged 65 years and older. Meta-analyses, randomised clinical trials, and cohort studies are discussed in this narrative Review. Studies showed no significantly increased incidence in adverse cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, or cognitive outcomes in individuals aged 65 years or older when serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration was 4.5–7.0 mIU/L versus a euthyroid group. Moreover, in older individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism, symptoms of hypothyroidism and cardiac and bone parameters did not improve after levothyroxine treatment. These data suggest that treatment with levothyroxine should be considered for individuals aged 65 years or older with subclinical hypothyroidism when thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is persistently 7 mIU/L or higher and to not initiate treatment with thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations of less than 7 mIU/L. Levothyroxine doses should be personalised according to age, comorbidities, and life expectancy.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^1164hEJ9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

To help resolve this clinical uncertainty of levothyroxine replacement treatment for SCH in older persons, we have performed an randomized controlled trial including participants over 80 years old in the presence of comorbid conditions; the Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO)80-plus thyroid trial. The TRUST trial was not designed specifically to investigate the effects in 80-plus participants and was consequently inadequately powered for a subgroup analysis in participants aged 80 and over. The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial was designed jointly with the TRUST trial as an ancillary trial using the same trial infrastructure and protocol to allow a pre-planned, joint analysis of all participants aged 80 and over. This combined endeavour will provide experimental evidence on potential multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment from the largest sample of 80-plus persons with SCH to date.

Among the specific study objectives are:
Does levothyroxine treatment for SCH provide benefits for 80-plus persons with SCH?
Are benefits seen across a wide range of outcomes, including health-related quality of life, muscle function, cognition and prevention of cardiovascular disease?
Are benefits seen in specific subgroups of people with SCH, including women, and those with mild degrees of SCH (TSH 4.6–10 mU/L)?
Are any benefits offset by adverse effects, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure?

### Management of subclinical hypothyroidism… [^1131kBp9]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question How should patients with subclinical hypothyroidism be managed. Evidence-Based Answer Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine may be of most benefit to patients with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism and those patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels higher than 10 μIU per mL or positive anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Levothyroxine is recommended for pregnant patients. For asymptomatic patients with TSH levels between 4. 5 and 10 μIU per mL, treatment may not be beneficial, but their thyroid function should be monitored at six- to 12-month intervals. Recommendations from Others One expert panel recommends that TSH levels between 4.

5 and 10 μIU per mL should not be routinely treated, but patients with these levels should have thyroid function tests repeated at six- to 12-month intervals. 1 Patients with symptoms of hypothyroidism may benefit from a trial of levothyroxine while monitoring symptomatic improvement, although distinguishing a true therapeutic effect from placebo effect may be difficult. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends levothyroxine therapy for patients with TSH levels higher than 10 μIU per mL, positive anti-TPO antibodies, or goiter; the recommended starting dose of 25 to 50 mcg daily must be adjusted as necessary after repeating the TSH level in six to eight weeks. 2 Annual evaluation of TSH is appropriate after a level between 0. 3 and
3. 0 μIU per mL is achieved. Clinical Commentary Subclinical hypothyroidism often is diagnosed when thyroid tests are ordered for non-specific symptoms such as depression, weight gain, or fatigue.

The physician must then decide if the patient's symptoms are caused by a relative thyroid hormone deficiency, and whether thyroid hormone replacement would improve the patient's well-being. Lacking clear-cut evidence to guide these decisions, the physician's role is to discuss the uncertain implications of the diagnosis and the potential risks and benefits of levothyroxine therapy to allow a patient to make an informed decision about therapy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^115U9TtT]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — recommendations for evaluation and treatment in infertility and pregnancy emphasize non-treatment for SCH and targeted thyroid testing. It is not recommended to treat pregnant women or women desiring pregnancy who have a diagnosis of SCH with levothyroxine, as treatments have not been demonstrated to reduce pregnancy loss nor to improve clinical pregnancy or LB outcomes (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate). Thyroid-stimulating hormone and T4 levels should be tested in patients with signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism (including irregular menstrual cycles) rather than in all patients with infertility (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate).

### Thyroid hormone treatment among pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism: US national assessment [^114guzt5]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

To facilitate the decision making process for pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism, clinicians are encouraged to use a shared decision making approach. With this approach, clinicians can discuss with patients the uncertainty behind our treatment recommendations and explore what is important to them when making decisions about their health with the goal of reaching a decision about treatment that best fits their situation. The timing of thyroid hormone initiation is another important area of research. Given that the observed benefit of thyroid hormone use was related to decreased risk of pregnancy loss, an event most commonly occurring in early pregnancy, treatment may be needed only in the first trimester of pregnancy. Finally, if treatment is started, monitoring of thyroid function and adjustment of treatment dose are essential.

In conclusion, this is the first national study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of thyroid hormone for pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone use was associated with a decreased risk of pregnancy loss in this population, especially those with TSH concentrations of 4.1–10 mIU/L. Further research is needed to understand whether a causal mechanism exists behind this association. In addition, the increased risk of other adverse outcomes calls for randomized trials evaluating the safety of thyroid hormone treatment in this population. These results could facilitate an informed conversation between patients and clinicians about starting thyroid hormone treatment.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: a pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113HpyZ9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

In clinical practice, the utility of measuring antithyroid antibodies remains controversial, as reflected by different recommendations in international guidelines, with two guidelines suggesting treatment in the presence of positive antibodies to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism and another guideline not mentioning antibody status as an indication for treatment. Our analysis showed no clear evidence for levothyroxine treatment in older adults with SHypo and positive anti‐TPO on a large range of patient‐relevant outcomes, underlining that anti‐TPO in SHypo should not guide treatment decisions in older adults. While we could not assess the long‐term impact on progression to overt hypothyroidism due to limited follow‐up duration, the rate of progression has been described as relatively low (4.3%/year for positive antibodies vs. 2.6%/year for negative antibodies) based on studies with 10–20 years of follow‐up, and it may not be of substantial clinical relevance in an ageing population. Some studies have also shown an increase in TSH in older adults, which has not been associated with clinical outcomes in observational studies. Our study now adds interventional data that treatment of Shypo is not associated with better outcomes — also in those with elevated anti‐TPO — and underscores the interpretation that treatment threshold in older adults could be safely raised. It might be argued that therapy might also start later when overt hypothyroidism (or important symptoms) developed by following TSH values. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events differed by anti‐TPO status; this is in line with evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which found no correlation of anti‐TPO with cardiovascular disease risk in SHypo, and it further adds against using anti‐TPO to guide treatment decisions.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^116K4S2Y]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in reproductive-age women — definition, prevalence, and evidence scope are outlined as follows: The classic definition of SCH is a thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) level greater than the upper limit of the normal range (4.5–5.0 mIU/ L) with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels, and with this definition the incidence of SCH in the reproductive-age population is approximately 4%–8%. There are also older data that suggest that inadequate treatment of SCH can lead to infertility, miscarriage, and adverse obstetrical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Debate persists about the definition of SCH and the decision of when to screen and treat, particularly for infertile women and women attempting pregnancy. Treatment recommendations for SCH vary between the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), the Endocrine Society, the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and others, and the current understanding of effects on fertility and pregnancy is based mainly on retrospective studies with limited high-quality data, though consistent trends in the literature allow for the guidelines set forth in this document.

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^114fVyja]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common in older people and its contribution to health and disease needs to be elucidated further. Observational and clinical trial data on the clinical effects of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons aged 80 years and over is inconclusive, with some studies suggesting harm and some suggesting benefits, translating into equipoise whether levothyroxine therapy provides clinical benefits. This manuscript describes the study protocol for the Institute for Evidence-Based Medicine in Old Age (IEMO) 80-plus thyroid trial to generate the necessary evidence base.

Methods

The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial was explicitly designed as an ancillary experiment to the Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism randomised placebo controlled Trial (TRUST) with a near identical protocol and shared research infrastructure. Outcomes will be presented separately for the IEMO and TRUST 80-plus groups, as well as a pre-planned combined analysis of the 145 participants included in the IEMO trial and the 146 participants from the TRUST thyroid trial aged 80 years and over. The IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial is a multi-centre randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial of levothyroxine treatment in community-dwelling participants aged 80 years and over with persistent subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH ≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mU/L and fT4 within laboratory reference ranges). Participants are randomised to levothyroxine 25 or 50 micrograms daily or matching placebo with dose titrations according to TSH levels, for a minimum follow-up of one and a maximum of three years. Primary study endpoints: hypothyroid physical symptoms and tiredness on the thyroid-related quality of life patient-reported outcome (ThyPRO) at one year. Secondary endpoints: generic quality of life, executive cognitive function, handgrip strength, functional ability, blood pressure, weight, body mass index, and mortality. Adverse events will be recorded with specific interest on cardiovascular endpoints such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure.

Discussion

The combined analysis of participants in the IEMO 80-plus thyroid trial with the participants aged over 80 in the TRUST trial will provide the largest experimental evidence base on multimodal effects of levothyroxine treatment in 80-plus persons to date.

### Thyroid hormone treatment among pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism: US national assessment [^117NgR1z]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Policy implications

Both clinicians and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy still face uncertainty about the effect of thyroid hormone treatment on maternal and neonatal outcomes. On the basis of our findings, continuing to offer thyroid hormone treatment to decrease the risk of pregnancy loss in pregnant women with TSH concentrations of 4.1–10.0 mIU/L is reasonable. Owing to the smaller magnitude of effect in the group with TSH concentrations of 2.5–4.0 mIU/L, and in light of the possible increased risk of other adverse events, treatment may need to be withheld in this group and guidelines may need to be revised. In fact, in the 2016 draft Guidelines for Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy presented at the 2016 Endocrine Society meeting, levothyroxine treatment is recommended for women positive for thyroid peroxidase antibody if TSH is above 4.0 mIU/L (strong recommendation; moderate quality evidence) and may be considered if TSH is above 2.5 mIU/L (weak recommendation; low quality evidence) or for thyroid peroxidase antibody negative women (weak recommendation; low quality evidence). Moreover, results from large randomized trials such as the TSH study and the pregnancy complication data from the Controlled Antenatal Thyroid Screening study are expected soon and are likely to provide additional scientific rationale for management of subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy.

Subclinical hypothyroidism — observational treatment and cohort findings include that in a U.K. general practitioner database of over 3000 individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH between 5.01 and 10 mIU/L) aged between 40 and 70 years and over 1500 individuals older than 70 years followed for a median of ~8 years, the ~50% treated group (87.4% women) had a reduced hazard ratio for ischemic heart disease events compared to untreated (~50%; 82.5% women) (0.61, CI 0.49–0.92), but this reduction was not evident in those older than 70 years (84.6% vs 75.6% women); additional cohorts reported increased risk with TSH levels of 10 mIU/L or greater and with TSH values between 6 and 15 mIU/L, including 3000 patients 65 years or older and across 11 prospective cohorts, with increased heart failure in six prospective cohorts with over 2000 patients up to 80 years of age.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^115igZfY]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in women seeking pregnancy or already pregnant — effects of levothyroxine on reproductive outcomes are mixed across study designs, with key results driven by a retracted trial and overall no demonstrated benefit in primary studies. A high-quality meta-analysis of four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 787 women reported no association with clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.46; 95% CI 0.86–2.48) or live birth rate (RR 2.05; 95% CI 0.96–4.36), and although miscarriage appeared lower (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.32–0.82), this effect was driven by a subsequently retracted study; excluding it found no improvement and no benefit when thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) patients were excluded. A low-quality meta-analysis of three RCTs including 220 women found higher live birth (RR 2.76; 95% CI 1.2–6.4) and lower miscarriage (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24–0.82) with levothyroxine, but these effects were largely driven by the retracted RCT, and excluding it eliminated significant associations with no difference in clinical pregnancy. An intermediate-quality retrospective cohort of 5,405 pregnant women with SCH found reduced pregnancy loss with levothyroxine versus no treatment (aOR 0.62; 95% CI 0.48–0.82). Overall, there are only two RCTs using TSH levels > 4 mIU/L, and despite at least nine meta-analyses, primary studies did not show benefit; therefore, the document states the recommendation is to not treat SCH in pregnant women or women desiring pregnancy.

### Is subclinical hypothyroidism a cardiovascular risk factor in the elderly? [^112S2yJD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

The negative impact of subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT) on cardiovascular risk, widely recognized in young adults (aged < 55–60 y), is still debated in the elderly (> 65 y), especially in the oldest olds (> 80 y).

Evidence Acquisition

We searched Medline for reports published with the following search terms: "hypothyroidism", "subclinical hypothyroidism", "ageing", "elderly", "L-thyroxin", "thyroid", "guidelines", "treatment", "quality of life", "cardiovascular risk", "heart failure", "coronary heart disease" (CHD), "atherosclerosis", and "endothelial dysfunction". We limited our search to reports in English published after 1980, although we incorporated some reports published before 1980. We supplemented the search with records from personal files, textbooks, and relevant articles. Analyzed parameters included the epidemiology of thyroid failure, the effect of thyroid hormone on the aging process, cardiovascular function, and CHD risk factors. We also included the potential benefits of L-T4 therapy on the quality of life, cardiovascular events, and survival.

Evidence Synthesis

TSH levels increase with age, even in older people without thyroid disease. Most longitudinal studies show an increased risk for CHD events and mortality in sHT participants. This increase is less evident in the elderly, mainly in cases of serum TSH values above 10 mIU/L. Lower mortality rate in a cohort of the oldest olds (> 85 y) has been reported.

Conclusions

sHT in older people should be not regarded as a unique condition, and moderately old patients (aged < 70–75 y) could be considered clinically similar to the adult population, albeit with a higher optimal TSH target value. Conversely, the oldest old subjects should be carefully followed with a wait-and-see strategy, generally avoiding hormonal treatment. The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge — first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) in subclinical hypothyroidism — treatment target and threshold: Subclinically hypothyroid women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) should be treated with LT4, and the goal of treatment is to achieve a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration < 2.5 mU/L; it therefore seems prudent to recommend treatment of subclinically hypothyroid women seeking pregnancy with ART for any TSH elevation > 2.5 mU/L. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the current diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in pregnancy — levothyroxine and neurodevelopmental outcomes: There is strong evidence, on the basis of three randomized clinical trials, that levothyroxine therapy for women with SCH diagnosed in pregnancy has no benefit for obstetrical, neonatal, childhood IQ, or neurodevelopmental outcomes, with trials reporting no significant differences in cognitive outcomes between treated and control groups. Levothyroxine therapy for SCH diagnosed in pregnancy is not recommended for the indication of improving developmental outcomes (strength of evidence: A; strength of recommendation: strong).

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^114Kkf6o]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

There are four main study objectives:
Does Levothyroxine treatment for SCH give multi-modal benefits for older people with SCH?
Are benefits seen across a wide range of outcomes, including prevention of cardiovascular disease, and improving health-related quality of life, muscle function and cognition?
Are benefits seen in specific subgroups of older people with SCH, including women, very elderly and those with mild degrees of SCH (TSH 4.6–10 mU/L)?
Are any benefits offset by adverse effects, such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure?

### Subclinical but significant? updated review of pediatric hypothyroidism [^112Wvvia]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this review are to describe the rates of diagnosis of true thyroid disease (and subsequent treatment) in children with an elevated TSH referred to pediatric endocrinology, risk factors associated with elevated TSH secondary to thyroid disease, and TSH threshold level associated with thyroid disease.

Methods

To accomplish these aims, our team searched through four databases to curate 211 articles regarding TSH values in healthy children ages 1–18 years without an underlying risk for hypothyroidism.

Results

Five studies met our criteria and were analyzed to create the conclusions about rates of hypothyroidism requiring treatment (6.3–59%), risk factors to developing hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 mIU/L, goiter, and anti-thyroid antibodies), and high-risk TSH value (9.6 mIU/L when averaged among four studies).

Conclusions

The results are helpful in guiding practitioners about when to repeat TSH value before considering referral to endocrinology, when to refer, and when to anticipate the need of thyroid hormone replacement.

### Thyroid hormone treatment among pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism: US national assessment [^111pYqXF]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Only 16% of pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism included in this large national US cohort received thyroid hormone treatment. Clinical practice guidelines on treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy were based on insufficient evidence, and our findings show the effect of using thyroid hormone replacement on pregnancy loss and other pregnancy related adverse events. We found that use of thyroid hormone was associated with decreased risk of pregnancy loss, but it was also associated with increased risk of preterm delivery, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia. Thyroid hormone treatment had no apparent effect on other important adverse outcomes. Moreover, the benefit of thyroid hormone use on pregnancy loss was observed only among women with pre-treatment TSH concentrations of 4.1–10.0 mIU/L, not those with concentrations of 2.5–4.0 mIU/L, raising questions about the current guideline recommended threshold of 2.5 mIU/L for treating subclinical hypothyroidism when population reference ranges are unavailable.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^116f6aBh]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common aberrant biochemical finding defined as an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal circulating thyroid hormone level. SCH is associated with multiple health problems in old age ranging from mild non-specific symptoms such as tiredness and emotional susceptibility to coronary heart disease and decreased physical and cognitive functioning.

As 8–18% of those over 65 years are affected and inference from both observational and experimental studies maintain the clinical equipoise whether the merits of levothyroxine treatment outweigh the risks, the Thyroid hormone Replacement for Untreated older adults with Subclinical hypothyroidism randomised placebo controlled Trial (TRUST) was designed to resolve this clinical uncertainty. The outcomes of the TRUST trial provided robust information that for community-dwelling persons of 65 years of age and older with SCH, levothyroxine treatment provides no apparent benefits.

There are ample data to suggest that thyroid function is mediated by age and that the effects of SCH may be profoundly different in octogenarians and older. Older persons generally require different dosages of levothyroxine to achieve euthyroidism than younger counterparts possibly due to changes in body weight, composition or hormonal status and are at higher risk of adverse effects of overtreatment including cardiovascular events, arrhythmias and fractures. In a large-scale, observational follow-up study among 599 community-dwelling participants aged 85 years and over, increasing levels of TSH were associated with prolonged life span. This association, however, could not be confirmed in a later Individual Patient Data meta-analysis investigating mortality information in 4344 participants with SCH aged 80 years and over. In addition, members of families with exceptional longevity are characterized by slightly higher TSH and slightly lower circulating thyroid hormone levels when compared with the general population.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^112JaoNb]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

Thyroid hormone replacement targets — serum thyrotropin (TSH) in primary hypothyroidism should be within the reference range and is the therapeutic target, with "a value within the reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) should be considered the therapeutic target". In subclinical hypothyroidism, "an increase in mortality has been observed in individuals with TSH levels > 10mIU/L, with potential effects of values > 7mIU/L", and "fewer ischemic heart disease events were associated with treatment of SCH in those under age 70 years". Aiming for "a target TSH in the lower tertile of the laboratory reference range" has been proposed, but "a randomized cross-over study of 8 weeks' duration did not show changes in well-being or quality of life with TSH titration within the normal and subnormal range". After thyroidectomy, when T3 is used as a target it "is reasonable to tailor therapy to achieve circulating levels of T3 similar to the pre-surgery values while maintaining the TSH value within the range of normal", and during LT4 therapy "Levels of FT4 above the reference range are often observed…; no evidence yet exists indicating that this condition is associated with adverse events or poor outcome".

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^113m5cBf]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Evidence quality and research needs in SCH — Most of the evidence advocating for screening and treatment of SCH in women with infertility or pregnancy is based on low-quality observational data and one clinical trial, which should be withdrawn because of significant concerns over data integrity. Additional clinical trials evaluating the treatment of SCH to improve offspring neurocognitive development are unlikely to change the evidence that screening and treatment do not provide benefits, whereas additional clinical trials evaluating the screening and treatment of antithyroid antibodies and pregnancy outcomes are needed, and studies in infertile patients and in patients receiving IVF therapies could result in a change in recommendations.

### Subclinical thyroid disorders: significance and clinical impact [^115tf2US]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^1124cvEq]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a common condition in elderly people, defined as elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal circulating free thyroxine (fT4). Evidence is lacking about the effect of thyroid hormone treatment. We describe the protocol of a large randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Levothyroxine treatment for SCH.

Methods

Participants are community-dwelling subjects aged ≥ 65 years with SCH, diagnosed by elevated TSH levels (≥ 4.6 and ≤ 19.9 mU/L) on a minimum of two measures ≥ three months apart, with fT4 levels within laboratory reference range. The study is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group trial, starting with levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (25 micrograms in subjects < 50Kg body weight or known coronary heart disease) with titration of dose in the active treatment group according to TSH level, and a mock titration in the placebo group. The primary outcomes are changes in two domains (hypothyroid symptoms and fatigue / vitality) on the thyroid-related quality of life questionnaire (ThyPRO) at one year. The study has 80% power (at p = 0.025, 2-tailed) to detect a change with levothyroxine treatment of 3.0% on the hypothyroid scale and 4.1% on the fatigue / vitality scale with a total target sample size of 750 patients.

Secondary outcomes include general health-related quality of life (EuroQol), fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, handgrip strength, executive cognitive function (Letter Digit Coding Test), basic and instrumental activities of daily living, haemoglobin, blood pressure, weight, body mass index and waist circumference. Patients are monitored for specific adverse events of interest including incident atrial fibrillation, heart failure and bone fracture.

Discussion

This large multicentre RCT of levothyroxine treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is powered to detect clinically relevant change in symptoms / quality of life and is likely to be highly influential in guiding treatment of this common condition.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: a pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113WyXiu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as an elevated thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH) level with free thyroxine (fT4) in the reference range, affects up to 6%–18% of older adults. Although clinical guidelines differ on which patients should be treated, SHypo is frequently treated with levothyroxine (LT4). This contributes to levothyroxine being one of the most prescribed medications in the United States and Europe. In older adults, two recent international, double‐blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — The Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism (TRUST) and the IEMO80+ Thyroid Trial — and a meta‐analysis found no benefit of levothyroxine on hypothyroid symptoms, tiredness, or quality of life, even among those with high symptom burden. However, specific subgroups might still benefit, such as patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

American Thyroid Association — subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in children generally has low progression risk and frequently normalizes without treatment. "The majority of pediatric patients with SCH will not progress to OH, and there does not appear to be a significant risk associated with not treating". In a large cohort, "In a large, retrospective study of 121,052 pediatric patients from 6 months to 16 years of age, 73.6% of subjects with a TSH > 5.5 to ≤ 10 mIU/L normalized their TSH over 5 years of follow-up". For higher TSH, outcomes were, "In subjects with a TSH > 10 mIU/L, 40% had normalization of their TSH vs. 33.1% had reduction of their TSH values, and only 25% had maintenance or increase of their TSH values".

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) with hyperlipidemia — recommendation and evidence: In patients with SCH (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] < 10 mIU/L) and associated hyperlipidemia, we suggest considering thyroxine treatment as a means of reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, with the technical remark to take into consideration the patient's age and general health, the possibility of suppression of TSH, and whether the patient has cardiovascular disease (CV). Prior clinical trials of people with SCH (TSH 4 to 10 mIU/L) treated with T4 versus placebo and a meta-analysis have failed to show benefit in thyroid-related symptoms, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and/ or quality of life, but the meta-analysis performed for this guideline showed an 11 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C in patients with SCH treated with T4, and the impact of T4 treatment on long-term CV outcomes is unknown.

### Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases: 2016 update [^1145ew69]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction comprises subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo), defined as elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by normal free thyroxine (FT4), and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) with decreased or undetectable TSH and normal FT4. Up to 10% of the elderly have SHypo, which is usually asymptomatic. Individual participant data (IPD) analyses of prospective cohort studies from the international Thyroid Studies Collaboration show that SHypo is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1,58 for TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, 95% CI 1.10–2.27), as well as increased risk of stroke, and heart failure (HF) for both higher and lower TSH. Small studies found that SHypo affects carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), diastolic function, peripheral vascular resistance, endothelial function, and lipid profile. SHyper is associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16–2.43) and CHD events (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.99–1.46). The TSH threshold for initiating treatment is unclear. In the absence of large randomized controlled trials, the best evidence suggests SHypo therapy should be started at TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L, and SHyper therapy at TSH < 0.1 mIU/L. Recommendations on screening are discordant, but most guidelines advocate that thyroid function should be checked in those at risk for hypothyroidism, those over 60, and those with known CHD and HF. This review updates current evidence on the association between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, as well as on screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116GJCRE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) — lipids and cardiovascular risk: Across included studies, 82% defined SCH as normal T4 with TSH 5–10 mIU/L and 18% as normal T4 with TSH 10 to 20 mIU/L; SCH cohorts generally show lipid abnormalities, with higher total cholesterol and LDL-C reported even when TSH < 10 mIU/L, though some studies find elevations only when TSH > 10 mIU/L. Lipid levels decrease after levothyroxine (LT4) treatment, with an Endocrine Society meta-analysis showing reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and TG after LT4 while lipids did not change in untreated SCH. Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data indicate increased CV events at TSH > 10 mIU/L; overall stroke risk was not increased for adults with SCH (TSH 4.5 to 19.9 mIU/L) but was significantly higher in those younger than 65 years, and across TSH 4.5 to 6.9, 7.0 to 9.9, and 10–19.9 mIU/L, fatal stroke rose with higher TSH without a significant trend. An individual participant meta-analysis (11 studies; 55 287 adults, including 3450 with SCH) found increased CVD risk with TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L but not at lower TSH; CHD mortality was increased for TSH 10 to 19.9 mIU/L and 7.0 to 9.9 mIU/L, reaching statistical significance only in the higher TSH group.

### Levothyroxine treatment of mild subclinical hypothyroidism: a review of potential risks and benefits [^115podkT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined as elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) with normal levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4). SCH is further classified into a milder condition with TSH levels between 4.0 and 10.0 milli-international units (mIU)/l (mild-SCH) and a severe form with TSH > 10.0 mIU/l (severe-SCH). SCH is a common problem (prevalence is greater in women than men), which increases further with increasing age and TSH levels. Even though the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism is higher in patients with severe-SCH, the risk is also significant in patients having mild-SCH; it has been suggested that every twofold rise in serum TSH would increase the risk from 1 to 4%, which further increases to 38% if thyroid antibodies are positive. Current data have shown increased cardiovascular risk in patients with mild-SCH and have demonstrated some benefits of levothyroxine treatment in reducing these events. However, evidence on the association of mild-SCH and musculoskeletal system, cognitive dysfunction, mood disorders, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and goitre is conflicting. Similarly, the discussion regarding the exact upper limit of normal for serum TSH remains controversial. The data have also shown increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patient with mild-SCH, with some benefits of thyroxine treatment. The recent available guidelines related to management of patients with serum TSH < 10 mIU/l have suggested decisions should be made taking into account the age of the patient, associated risk factors and comorbid conditions. This chronicle review assesses current evidence regarding the risks associated and the recommendations related to benefits of levothyroxine treatment in patients having mild-SCH.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^114BjMn1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) screening during pregnancy and infertility — There is moderate evidence that universal screening of thyroid function during pregnancy does not result in a decrease in adverse outcomes, and there is moderate-quality evidence to support a case-finding screening strategy targeted at specific groups of patients who are at increased risk of overt hypothyroidism. Universal screening of thyroid function during pregnancy is not recommended (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate), whereas screening with a serum thyrotropin level is recommended in patients at increased risk of overt hypothyroidism (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate). On the basis of current evidence, it is not recommended to screen or treat for asymptomatic SCH in women with infertility or pregnancy.

### Association between levothyroxine treatment and thyroid-related symptoms among adults aged 80 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism [^1144AFHW]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

It is unclear whether levothyroxine treatment provides clinically important benefits in adults aged 80 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism.

Objective

To determine the association of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroid-related quality of life in adults aged 80 years and older.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospectively planned combined analysis of data involving community-dwelling adults aged 80 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism. Data from a randomized clinical trial were combined with a subgroup of participants aged 80 years and older from a second clinical trial. The trials were conducted between April 2013 and May 2018. Final follow-up was May 4, 2018.

Exposures

Participants were randomly assigned to receive levothyroxine (n = 112; 52 participants from the first trial and 60 from the second trial) or placebo (n = 139; 53 participants from the first trial and 86 from the second trial).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Co-primary outcomes were Thyroid-Related Quality of Life Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO) questionnaire scores for the domains of hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness at 1 year (range, 0–100; higher scores indicate worse quality of life; minimal clinically important difference, 9).

Results

Of 251 participants (mean age, 85 years; 118 [47%] women), 105 were included from the first clinical trial and 146 were included from the second clinical trial. A total of 212 participants (84%) completed the study. The hypothyroid symptoms score decreased from 21.7 at baseline to 19.3 at 12 months in the levothyroxine group vs from 19.8 at baseline to 17.4 at 12 months in the placebo group (adjusted between-group difference, 1.3 [95% CI, -2.7 to 5.2]; P = 0.53). The tiredness score increased from 25.5 at baseline to 28.2 at 12 months in the levothyroxine group vs from 25.1 at baseline to 28.7 at 12 months in the placebo group (adjusted between-group difference, -0.1 [95% CI, -4.5 to 4.3]; P = 0.96). At least 1 adverse event occurred in 33 participants (29.5%) in the levothyroxine group (the most common adverse event was cerebrovascular accident, which occurred in 3 participants [2.2%]) and 40 participants (28.8%) in the placebo group (the most common adverse event was pneumonia, which occurred in 4 [3.6%] participants).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this prospectively planned analysis of data from 2 clinical trials involving adults aged 80 years and older with subclinical hypothyroidism, treatment with levothyroxine, compared with placebo, was not significantly associated with improvement in hypothyroid symptoms or fatigue. These findings do not support routine use of levothyroxine for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in adults aged 80 years and older.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115Qb6pQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

USPSTF — Estimate of net benefit and treatment-related harms in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults: The USPSTF found no direct evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults and therefore considered the indirect evidence on screening accuracy, benefits of early treatment, and harms. There is adequate evidence that the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test can identify abnormal levels, but substantial debate surrounds what constitutes an abnormal TSH level and thresholds vary for different populations. Although a single fair-quality observational study found a possible association between treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and reduced risk for cardiac events, there is no evidence from randomized trials to prove that early treatment of thyroid dysfunction leads to clinically important benefits. The harms of screening for and treating thyroid dysfunction have been poorly studied; screening and treatment have real potential harms that are probably common, and overall the USPSTF was unable to estimate the balance of benefits and harms in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults. Additional treatment-related concerns noted include that levothyroxine sodium was not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until 2000 and its approval process did not include studies evaluating short- or long-term adverse effects; the product label cites possible adverse effects on bone mineral density and the cardiovascular system. A previous review reported that one quarter of patients receiving levothyroxine were inadvertently maintained on doses high enough to make TSH levels undetectable, which could increase risk for osteoporosis, fractures, abnormal cardiac output, or ventricular hypertrophy. Across five trials of hypothyroidism treatment with levothyroxine, reports generally found no indication of harms or no or minimal (n = 0 to 2) withdrawals due to adverse effects, but harms were poorly assessed and studies were not designed or powered to evaluate long-term, serious, or overtreatment-related harms.

Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism — trial outcomes indicate no clear benefit on blood pressure or weight and mixed lipid effects: "Three trials (n = 239) found no statistically significant effect of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on blood pressure (1, 2), through 10.5 months of follow-up". "Similarly, 6 trials (n = 385) found no statistically significant effect of treatment on BMI or weight (1, 2) through 1 year of follow-up". For lipids, "In 8 good- or fair-quality trials (n = 597), 3 of which reported statistically significant results, differences between the treatment and control groups ranged from −0.7 to 0 mmol/L (−28 to 0 mg/dL) for mean total cholesterol level and from −0.6 to 0.1 mmol/L (−22 to 2 mg/dL) for mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level", and "No studies reported statistically significant differences in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides (1, 2)". Moreover, "no trials directly evaluated the effects of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism on final health outcomes, such as cardiac morbidity or mortality".

### L-thyroxine therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroid symptoms: secondary analysis of a randomized trial [^11459tG5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

L-thyroxine does not improve hypothyroid symptoms among adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). However, those with greater symptom burden before treatment may still benefit.

Objective

To determine whether L-thyroxine improves hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness among older adults with SCH and greater symptom burden.

Design

Secondary analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial TRUST (Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism Trial). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01660126).

Setting

Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Scotland.

Participants

638 persons aged 65 years or older with persistent SCH (thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4.60 to 19.9 mIU/L for > 3 months and normal free thyroxine level) and complete outcome data.

Intervention

L-thyroxine or matching placebo with mock dose titration.

Measurements

1-year change in Hypothyroid Symptoms and Tiredness scores (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate more symptoms) on the Thyroid-Related Quality-of-Life Patient-Reported Outcome Questionnaire among participants with high symptom burden (baseline Hypothyroid Symptoms score > 30 or Tiredness score > 40) versus lower symptom burden.

Results

132 participants had Hypothyroid Symptoms scores greater than 30, and 133 had Tiredness scores greater than 40. Among the group with high symptom burden, the Hypothyroid Symptoms score improved similarly between those receiving L-thyroxine (mean within-group change, -12.3 [95% CI, -16.6 to -8.0]) and those receiving placebo (mean within-group change, -10.4 [CI, -15.3 to -5.4]) at 1 year; the adjusted between-group difference was -2.0 (CI, -5.5 to 1.5; P = 0.27). Improvements in Tiredness scores were also similar between those receiving L-thyroxine (mean within-group change, -8.9 [CI, -14.5 to -3.3]) and those receiving placebo (mean within-group change, -10.9 [CI, -16.0 to -5.8]); the adjusted between-group difference was 0.0 (CI, -4.1 to 4.0; P = 0.99). There was no evidence that baseline Hypothyroid Symptoms score or Tiredness score modified the effects of L-thyroxine versus placebo (P for interaction = 0.20 and 0.82, respectively).

Limitation

Post hoc analysis, small sample size, and examination of only patients with 1-year outcome data.

Conclusion

In older adults with SCH and high symptom burden at baseline, L-thyroxine did not improve hypothyroid symptoms or tiredness compared with placebo.

### Incidence and determinants of spontaneous normalization of subclinical hypothyroidism in older adults [^116W6nFP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, we have demonstrated that in a large proportion of older adults with mild subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH levels spontaneously normalized in a median follow-up of 1 year, even after 2 consecutive measurements (≥ 3 months apart) of elevated TSH levels. These results have clinical relevance. Current guidelines recommend that a single measurement of elevated serum TSH, with fT4 within reference range, should be confirmed by a repeat measurement of both serum TSH and fT4, along with thyroid peroxidase antibodies, after a 2- to 3-month interval. However, international guidelines differ in their recommendations on the TSH threshold at which treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism should be considered in older adults. Once levothyroxine treatment is initiated, it is often continued lifelong. Based on the observation that with age, the TSH distribution shifts toward a higher level, it has been proposed to extend the upper limit of the TSH reference to 7 mU/L for people aged 80 years or older. Although increasing the upper reference limit will likely reduce unnecessary levothyroxine prescribing for older people, instead of a binary approach, our results support applying more continuous age-related reference ranges, which may be modified by other factors such as sex and season. Moreover, based on the high incidence of spontaneous normalization of TSH levels in a large proportion of older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (also after confirmation by repeat measurement), a third measurement may be recommended before considering initiation of treatment. Based on such an approach, the frequency of the diagnosis subclinical hypothyroidism can likely be reduced in older adults. This could potentially contribute to a reduction in health care costs, treatment burden, and risk of overtreatment. These results may also have implications for follow-up studies. Levothyroxine is among the most frequently prescribed drugs. Although general practitioner prescription practices vary widely between countries, many older adults have initiated levothyroxine treatment based on a mildly elevated TSH. Moreover, in clinical practice, treatment has often been started after a single measurement of TSH. A recent meta-analysis indicated that deprescribing levothyroxine could be successful for carefully selected patients, although the quality of available evidence was considered low. This underscores the need for future high-quality studies to assess the effects of safely withholding levothyroxine treatment in older adults who initiated levothyroxine treatment based on a diagnosis of mild subclinical hypothyroidism on relevant patient outcomes.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: a pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^114zDFsD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmunity is a common etiology of SHypo characterized clinically by high levels of anti–thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti‐TPO). Anti‐TPO induces cell‐mediated cytotoxicity and its presence is associated with the development of thyroid dysfunction. Adults with SHypo and positive anti‐TPO are more prone to progress to overt hypothyroidism in studies with long‐term follow‐up of up to 20 years (4.3%/year for positive antibodies vs. 2.6%/year for negative antibodies). For these patients, the indication for treatment remains controversial. Two guidelines suggest considering treatment in the presence of positive antibodies to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism, irrespective of TSH levels, as do some international experts, while another guideline does not mention antibody status as an indication for treatment. Despite controversial recommendations, physicians often use anti‐TPO testing to decide whether to initiate treatment. In a survey of American Thyroid Association members and primary care providers, approximately 10%–20% more physicians would initiate therapy in SHypo if antibodies were positive than if antibodies were negative. Little data on the frequency of anti‐TPO measurements at the population level exist, but a population‐based study of 5552 outpatients found a relatively high proportion of 3%/year of participants with at least one anti‐TPO antibody test. Data are very limited on the impact of positive antibodies, as no large RCTs have demonstrated that antibody status influences the effectiveness of levothyroxine on clinical outcomes in adults with SHypo. Previous studies had design limitations such as including only young patients or having small sample sizes (N = 40–100). Therefore, in this ancillary analysis of two large RCTs (TRUST and IEMO80+), we aimed to evaluate whether antibody status influences the effectiveness of levothyroxine on clinical outcomes in older adults with SHypo.

### Hypothyroidism in pregnancy [^114Kjd2F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is the most common pregnancy-related thyroid disorder, affecting 3–5% of all pregnant women. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more common than is overt hypothyroidism, and is usually defined as a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration greater than the pregnancy-specific reference range for each laboratory value, or by serum TSH concentrations greater than 2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester and greater than 3 mIU/L in the second and third trimesters. Some authors have defined subclinical hypothyroidism as a serum TSH between 5 and 10 mIU/L, and overt hypothyroidism as a serum TSH greater than 10 mIU/L, but this is not the commonly accepted definition. Once overt hypothyroidism is diagnosed, treatment with levothyroxine should be started to achieve serum TSH concentrations within the reference ranges for pregnancy as soon as possible. For patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, recommendations for therapy differ between various professional groups as a result of inconsistent data from both observational studies and clinical trials regarding the benefits for the mother or the child. Similarly, because benefits of therapy are still uncertain, universal screening of all pregnant women for subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity is not recommended by most professional groups. During gestation, an increase in levothyroxine dose is required in more than 50% of women with previously diagnosed hypothyroidism, and can be managed by increasing the levothyroxine dose by 30% when pregnancy is confirmed.

### Diagnosis and management of subclinical hypothyroidism in elderly adults: a review of the literature [^115MifCw]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

The estimated prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in the general population is 3% to 8%. As the average age of the population in the United States and other countries continues to increase, the overall prevalence of SCH may also be expected to increase. Although age-related changes in thyroid function are well described, normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) reference limits, derived for age-specific populations, are not routinely used to identify thyroid dysfunction in elderly adults. Therefore, currently accepted values for the upper limit of normal of TSH may be inappropriate for diagnosing SCH in individuals aged 65 and older, resulting in potential overestimation of the prevalence of SCH in this population. This review discusses the current evidence of the effects of SCH on cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric function in older adults. Although the results of some studies are conflicting, the overall evidence suggests that the consequences of SCH may be different for elderly adults than for younger populations. Treatment of SCH in older individuals requires special consideration with regard to thyroid hormone replacement therapy and expected clinical outcomes. Although careful identification of individuals with persistent SCH who could benefit from levothyroxine treatment is necessary, current evidence suggests that individuals with TSH levels greater than 10 mIU/L who test positive for antithyroid antibodies or are symptomatic may benefit from levothyroxine treatment to reduce the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism, decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, and improve their quality of life. After treatment is initiated, careful monitoring is essential.

### Effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism: an ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial [^116PDLbc]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusion

Current guidelines on subclinical hypothyroidism recommend taking into account age, TSH levels, and the presence of related symptoms when deciding whether to treat a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. This ancillary study of a randomized clinical trial found no effect of levothyroxine therapy on the development of depressive symptoms in older patients, even among those with a TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L, although this group was relatively small. Findings from this study do reinforce the current recommendation that levothyroxine therapy should not be prescribed to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism, with high quality of evidence. However, uncertainty remains on the effect of the treatment among severely depressed patients, as this trial was only conducted in patients with rather low depressive symptom scores at baseline.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^111HEjaz]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Blinding

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-h telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

### Interventions for clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy [^114gaf4S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last decade there has been enhanced awareness of the appreciable morbidity of thyroid dysfunction, particularly thyroid deficiency. Since treating clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism may reduce adverse obstetric outcomes, it is crucial to identify which interventions are safe and effective.

Objectives

To identify interventions used in the management of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy and to ascertain the impact of these interventions on important maternal, fetal, neonatal and childhood outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a pharmacological intervention for hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy with another intervention or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

We included three RCTs of moderate risk of bias involving 314 women. In one trial of 115 women, levothyroxine therapy to treat pregnant euthyroid women with thyroid peroxidase antibodies was not shown to reduce pre-eclampsia significantly (risk ratio (RR) 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 3.48) but did significantly reduce preterm birth by 72% (RR 0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.80). One trial of 30 hypothyroid women compared levothyroxine doses, but only reported biochemical outcomes. A trial of 169 women compared the trace element selenomethionine (selenium) with placebo and no significant differences were seen for either pre-eclampsia (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.25 to 8.38) or preterm birth (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.20 to 4.61). None of the three trials reported on childhood neurodevelopmental delay. There was a non-significant trend towards fewer miscarriages with levothyroxine, and selenium showed some favourable impact on postpartum thyroid function and decreased incidence of moderate to advanced postpartum thyroiditis.

Authors' Conclusions

Levothyroxine treatment of clinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy is already standard practice given the documented benefits from earlier non-randomised studies. Whether levothyroxine should be utilised in autoimmune and subclinical hypothyroidism remains to be seen, but it may prove worthwhile, given a possible reduction in preterm birth and miscarriage. Selenomethionine as an intervention in women with thyroid autoantibodies is promising, particularly in reducing postpartum thyroiditis. There is a probable low incidence of adverse outcomes from levothyroxine and selenomethionine. High-quality evidence is lacking and large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed in this area. Until evidence for or against universal screening becomes available, targeted thyroid function testing in pregnancy should be implemented in women at risk of thyroid disease and levothyroxine utilised in hypothyroid women.

Key Points

Question

Does levothyroxine treatment have an effect on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism?

Findings

In this ancillary study of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 427 participants with subclinical hypothyroidism, there was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted between-group difference in the mean Geriatric Depression Score at 12 months between the levothyroxine and placebo groups.

Meaning

These results do not provide evidence in favor of levothyroxine therapy in older persons with subclinical hypothyroidism to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^111mUJd6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Detection of thyroid dysfunction in asymptomatic adults — early detection and treatment of asymptomatic persons with abnormal serum TSH levels with or without abnormal T4 levels may be beneficial, but widespread screening and treatment of subclinical thyroid dysfunction can also result in harms due to labeling, false-positive results, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that screening can detect "abnormal" serum TSH levels in asymptomatic persons; however, what constitutes an abnormal TSH level is uncertain, laboratory reference intervals are based on statistical distribution (for example, using the 97.5th percentile as an upper boundary for normal), and there is professional disagreement about appropriate cut points, including in subgroups such as older adults.

### Treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism: BMJ rapid… [^1131StNB]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Thyroid hormones do not improve quality of life or thyroid-related symptoms in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism.
- In older patients, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism does not improve muscle strength or cognitive function, but could increase mortality.
- In patients who are pregnant and in those with a TSH level greater than 20 mIU per L, severe symptoms, or age 30 years or younger, the benefit of subclinical hypothyroidism treatment is unknown. Previous guidelines suggested that levothyroxine treatment may be appropriate with hypothyroid symptoms or a TSH level exceeding 10 mIU per L based on limited evidence. A recent large trial in older adults suggests that treatment shows no benefit in many areas and possible harm. The BMJ/MAGIC Group sought to determine whether treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism increases quality of life measures, improves symptoms, or induces harm.

People 65 Years and Older Studies of subclinical hypothyroidism primarily include older people. Substantial evidence demonstrates that levothyroxine is not beneficial for patients 65 years and older. Symptoms suggesting hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and depression, are not improved with supplementation more than with placebo. Quality of life and body mass index are unchanged. Muscle strength and cognitive function are not enhanced. Harms such as cardiovascular events and mortality are not more frequent, although data suggest that larger studies may demonstrate these risks. With no benefit and concern for harm, the group recommends against treatment. People Younger than 65 Years Although fewer younger people have been studied, levothyroxine shows a similar lack of benefit for subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment does not improve thyroid-related symptoms, quality of life, body mass index, muscle strength, or cognitive function.

Because few deaths of younger patients were reported, the effect of treatment is unclear. The lack of benefit suggests that lifelong medication use and mistaking mood disorders for subclinical hypothyroidism could represent further harms. Editor's Note: The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for thyroid disease based on lack of evidence of benefit. Even without screening, many patients present with symptoms of possible thyroid disease. Treatment has been suggested when TSH levels exceed 10 mIU per mL, but with little supporting evidence. The systematic review with this guideline provides the strongest evidence that levothyroxine treatment is not beneficial for subclinical hypothyroidism, and may be harmful for older people. — Michael J.
