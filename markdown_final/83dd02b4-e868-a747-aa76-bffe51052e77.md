## Question

A 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for management of community-acquired pneumonia. He is currently on supplemental oxygen but is hemodynamically stable and not in the intensive care unit. His home medications include metformin and glipizide, which were held on admission. Over the past 24 hours, his fasting and pre-meal blood glucose values have been 192 mg/dL and 198 mg/dL, respectively, on two separate occasions. He has not received any insulin or other glucose-lowering therapy since admission. The medical team is considering how to manage his hyperglycemia.

According to current guidelines, what is the appropriate threshold for initiating or intensifying glucose-lowering therapy in this hospitalized non-critically ill patient, and what is the recommended glycemic target range once therapy is started?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate threshold for initiating or intensifying glucose-lowering therapy in a hospitalized, non-critically ill patient with type 2 diabetes and persistent hyperglycemia, and what the recommended glycemic target range should be once therapy is started. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk category and whether he meets the definition of persistent hyperglycemia. Then, I should verify the initiation threshold from contemporary guidelines. Next, I will review the recommended target range and how it differs from older, more aggressive targets. After that, I need to consider the preferred insulin regimen and whether noninsulin options are appropriate. Finally, I should confirm monitoring cadence and safety checks, including hypoglycemia thresholds and when to adjust therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk category. The patient is a 62-year-old with type 2 diabetes, admitted for community-acquired pneumonia, hemodynamically stable, and not in the ICU, so he is a non-critically ill inpatient. His home oral agents were held on admission, and he has documented fasting and pre-meal glucose values of 192 and 198 mg/dL on two separate occasions within 24 hours, which constitutes persistent hyperglycemia in the hospital setting [^1124wFqj] [^113KQCPi].

> Now, I should verify the initiation threshold. Current ADA Standards of Care 2025 recommend initiating or intensifying insulin and/or other glucose-lowering therapy for persistent hyperglycemia at a threshold of ≥ 180 mg/dL confirmed on two occasions within 24 hours for most non-critically ill patients, which this patient clearly meets with values of 192 and 198 mg/dL, so therapy should be initiated now [^1124wFqj] [^113KQCPi] [^112rhL4X].

> Wait, let me verify the target range once therapy is started. For non-critically ill inpatients, the recommended glycemic goal is 100–180 mg/dL, provided it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia. This range balances the risks of hyperglycemia-related complications against hypoglycemia and is supported by ADA 2025 and the Endocrine Society 2022 guideline, with AACE 2022 also endorsing 140–180 mg/dL for most inpatients, allowing 100–140 mg/dL in selected stable patients without hypoglycemia risk [^117EdQPJ] [^111SeVFu] [^11328SXk] [^116DEFba].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about intensity. I initially thought about tighter targets like 80–130 mg/dL, but that would be too aggressive here. The NICE-SUGAR trial in ICU patients showed increased mortality with intensive control to 81–108 mg/dL, and contemporary guidance has moved away from such tight targets in both ICU and non-ICU settings, favoring 100–180 mg/dL for non-critically ill patients to mitigate hypoglycemia risk while improving outcomes versus uncontrolled hyperglycemia [^112NYCge] [^117EdQPJ] [^111SeVFu].

> Next, I should review the preferred regimen. For most non-critically ill inpatients with adequate nutritional intake, a basal–bolus regimen with basal, prandial, and correction components is recommended. Sliding-scale insulin alone is discouraged because it is reactive and associated with worse glycemic control and more complications. If oral intake is poor, basal or basal plus correction is reasonable, and for patients already on insulin, continuation and adjustment of the home regimen is advised, often reducing basal by 10–20% if basal-heavy, to match inpatient nutrition and illness severity [^115krdCd] [^113ZJis3] [^117RujRr] [^116X6zR8].

> I need to ensure we address noninsulin options. Oral agents are generally held in the hospital due to safety concerns and unpredictability of intake, and noninsulin therapies are not first-line for acute inpatient management. DPP-4 inhibitors may be considered selectively in mild hyperglycemia, particularly near discharge or in stable patients as part of transition planning, but scheduled insulin remains preferred for most inpatients requiring therapy [^113Ww4bS] [^115hkUSY] [^112QsPjx].

> Let me consider monitoring and safety. Point-of-care glucose should be checked before meals and at bedtime in patients receiving insulin, with additional checks if clinical status changes. I should confirm hypoglycemia thresholds: reassess the regimen if glucose declines below 100 mg/dL, and take immediate action if glucose is less than 70 mg/dL, as inpatient hypoglycemia is associated with worse outcomes and should be tracked and prevented whenever possible [^117EdQPJ] [^116TJNRr].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that my plan aligns with guidelines. The patient meets the ≥ 180 mg/dL threshold on two occasions, so I would initiate scheduled subcutaneous insulin with basal, prandial, and correction components, target 100–180 mg/dL, monitor premeal and bedtime glucose, and avoid sliding-scale insulin monotherapy. If intake is unreliable, I would use basal plus correction and adjust as nutrition improves, with a plan to resume or transition outpatient therapy prior to discharge based on stability and preadmission regimen [^1124wFqj] [^115krdCd] [^117EdQPJ].

Initiate or intensify insulin for **persistent hyperglycemia ≥ 180 mg/dL** [^1124wFqj] confirmed on two occasions within 24 hours [^113KQCPi] in non-critically ill inpatients. Once therapy is started, target **100–180 mg/dL** [^117EdQPJ] if it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia [^111SeVFu]; use a basal–bolus regimen with correction insulin [^115krdCd] for most patients with adequate intake [^117RujRr]. Avoid sliding-scale insulin monotherapy [^117RujRr] and adjust the regimen if glucose falls below 100 mg/dL or if hypoglycemia occurs [^116TJNRr].

## Threshold for initiating or intensifying glucose-lowering therapy

Current ADA Standards of Care recommend initiating or intensifying insulin or other glucose-lowering therapy for **persistent hyperglycemia ≥ 180 mg/dL** [^1124wFqj] confirmed on two occasions within 24 hours [^113KQCPi] for most non-critically ill inpatients. This threshold balances the risks of hyperglycemia-related complications with the potential for hypoglycemia from overly aggressive glycemic control [^117BKj6C].

---

## Recommended glycemic target range once therapy is initiated

Once therapy is initiated, the **recommended glycemic target range** for non-critically ill inpatients is 100–180 mg/dL (5.6–10.0 mmol/L) [^117EdQPJ], provided it can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia [^111SeVFu]. This range is supported by multiple guidelines and consensus statements, including the ADA and the Endocrine Society [^11328SXk] [^111PWGMn].

---

## Rationale for the recommended threshold and target range

The ≥ 180 mg/dL threshold is based on evidence linking persistent hyperglycemia to increased risks of infection, longer length of stay, and higher mortality [^112NYCge]. The 100–180 mg/dL target balances glycemic control with hypoglycemia risk, as tighter targets (e.g. 80–130 mg/dL) have been associated with increased hypoglycemia without consistent mortality benefit in non-critically ill patients [^112NYCge].

---

## Practical implementation and monitoring

- **Insulin regimen**: Use a basal–bolus regimen with correction insulin for most patients with adequate nutritional intake [^115krdCd] [^117RujRr].
- **Avoid sliding-scale insulin**: Prolonged use of sliding-scale insulin alone is discouraged due to poor glycemic control and increased hypoglycemia risk [^115KURAE].
- **Monitoring**: Check premeal and bedtime glucose; adjust therapy if glucose falls below 100 mg/dL or if hypoglycemia occurs [^116TJNRr].
- **Individualization**: Consider patient-specific factors such as age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk when setting targets and choosing regimens [^116DEFba].

Treatment of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients

On the basis of the available evidence, insulin infusion should be used to control hyperglycemia in the majority of critically ill patients in the ICU setting, with a starting threshold of no higher than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l). Once IV insulin therapy has been initiated, the glucose level should be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dl (7.8 and 10.0 mmol/l). Greater benefit may be realized at the lower end of this range. Although strong evidence is lacking, somewhat lower glucose targets may be appropriate in selected patients. Targets < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l), however, are not recommended. Use of insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, resulting in low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, is highly recommended.

Treatment of hyperglycemia in noncritically ill patients

With no prospective, RCT data for establishing specific guidelines in noncritically ill patients, our recommendations are based on clinical experience and judgment. For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, premeal glucose targets should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunctionwith random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), as long as these targets can be safely achieved. For avoidance of hypoglycemia, consideration should be given to reassessing the insulin regimen if BG levels decline below 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). Modification of the regimen is necessary when BG values are < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l), unless the event is easily explained by other factors (such as a missed meal).

Occasional clinically stable patients with a prior history of successful tight glycemic control in the outpatient setting may be maintained with a glucose range below the aforementioned cut points. In contrast, higher glucose ranges may be acceptable in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities, as well as in those in patient-care settings where frequent glucose monitoring or close nursing supervision is not feasible.

We emphasize that clinical judgment in combination with ongoing assessment of the patient's clinical status, including changes in the trajectory of glucose measures, the severity of illness, the nutritional status, or the concurrent use of medications that might affect glucose levels (for example, corticosteroids or octreotide), must be incorporated into the day-to-day decisions regarding insulin dosing.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

I. Critically ill patients

Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia, starting at a threshold of no greater than 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l).
Once insulin therapy has been started, a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10.0 mmol/l) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients.
Intravenous insulin infusions are the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glycemic control in critically ill patients.
Validated insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, and with low rates of occurrence of hypoglycemia, are recommended.
With IV insulin therapy, frequent glucose monitoring is essential to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycemia and to achieve optimal glucose control.

II. Noncritically ill patients

For the majority of noncritically ill patients treated with insulin, the premeal BG target should generally be < 140 mg/dl (< 7.8 mmol/l) in conjunction with random BG values < 180 mg/dl (< 10.0 mmol/l), provided these targets can be safely achieved.
More stringent targets may be appropriate in stable patients with previous tight glycemic control.
Less stringent targets may be appropriate in terminally ill patients or in patients with severe comorbidities.
Scheduled subcutaneous administration of insulin, with basal, nutritional, and correction components, is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control.
Prolonged therapy with SSI as the sole regimen is discouraged.
Noninsulin antihyperglycemic agents are not appropriate in most hospitalized patients who require therapy for hyperglycemia.
Clinical judgment and ongoing assessment of clinical status must be incorporated into day-to-day decisions regarding treatment of hyperglycemia.

III. Safety issues

Overtreatment and undertreatment of hyperglycemia represent major safety concerns.
Education of hospital personnel is essential in engaging the support of those involved in the care of inpatients with hyperglycemia.
Caution is required in interpreting results of POC glucose meters in patients with anemia, polycythemia, hypoperfusion, or use of some medications.
Buy-in and financial support from hospital administration are required for promoting a rational systems approach to inpatient glycemic management.

IV. Cost

Appropriate inpatient management of hyperglycemia is cost-effective.

V. Discharge planning

Preparation for transition to the outpatient setting should begin at the time of hospital admission.
Discharge planning, patient education, and clear communication with outpatient providers are critical for ensuring a safe and successful transition to outpatient glycemic management.

VI. Needed research

A selected number of research questions and topics for guiding the management of inpatient hyperglycemia in various hospital settings are proposed.

### International recommendations for glucose control in adult non diabetic critically ill patients [^116zPFrU]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Glucose control in ICUs should be a therapeutic objective. It is no longer possible to overlook severe hyperglycemia (> 10 mmol/L) although it is not yet possible to recommend a single glucose threshold common to all types of patients and diseases, especially as glucose control exposes patients to an increased risk of potentially harmful hypoglycemia. In addition, although mean glucose is an important therapeutic target to be achieved, recent data underscore the impact of many other factors (for example, variability in glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, presence or not of chronic hyperglycemia (diabetes). The safety and reliability of glucose monitoring techniques also need to be taken into account. Progress in the accuracy, harmonisation, and automation of these techniques is needed to enhance the efficacy and safety of glucose control, and diminish workload. There is no question of introducing tight glucose control into ICUs at all costs. However, further studies are needed to answer many unsolved questions: Which target glucose values should be used in which patients? How to monitor glucose levels? Which protocols should be used? In the meantime, each team should set up formal protocols in line with their technical and human resources.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^117RujRr]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Inpatient diabetes management — noncritically ill targets and insulin therapy: For most noncritically ill persons in the hospital setting, a glucose target of 140 to 180 mg/dL is recommended; a lower target range (100 to 140 mg/dL) may be reasonable when glycemic control can be achieved without hypoglycemia, whereas less stringent targets are appropriate for those with high clinical complexity, terminal illness, limited life expectancy, or high risk for hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy following approved protocols is recommended as the preferred therapy for managing hyperglycemia in the hospital, and for noncritically ill persons with T2D, an individualized approach is recommended and may include consideration of noninsulin agents alone or in combination with insulin. For hospitalized persons with satisfactory oral intake, the insulin regimen should include basal, prandial, and correction doses; for those without adequate food intake, basal, prandial, and correction doses should be used as necessary, and extensive use of "sliding-scale" insulin should only be used for those whose glucose are in the target range most of the time, and only occasionally exceed it.

VIII. DIABETES CARE IN SPECIFIC SETTINGS

Diabetes care in the hospital

Recommendations

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels Critically ill patients: Insulin therapy should be initiated for treatment of persistent hyperglycemia starting at a threshold of ≤ 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/l). Once insulin therapy is started, a glucose range of 140–180 mg/dl (7.8–10 mmol/l) is recommended for the majority of critically ill patients. (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Non–critically ill patients: There is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. If treated with insulin, the premeal blood glucose target should generally be < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) with random blood glucose < 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l), provided these targets can be safely achieved. More stringent targets may be appropriate in stable patients with previous tight glycemic control. Less stringent targets may be appropriate in those with severe comorbidites. (E)
Scheduled subcutaneous insulin with basal, nutritional, and correction components is the preferred method for achieving and maintaining glucose control in noncritically ill patients. (C) Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients in non-critical care setting: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116Mx6zB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines on the management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients in the non-critical care setting.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, and a methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Endocrine Society members, American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American Association of Diabetes Educators, European Society of Endocrinology, and the Society of Hospital Medicine reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of this guideline.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia is a common, serious, and costly health care problem in hospitalized patients. Observational and randomized controlled studies indicate that improvement in glycemic control results in lower rates of hospital complications in general medicine and surgery patients. Implementing a standardized sc insulin order set promoting the use of scheduled basal and nutritional insulin therapy is a key intervention in the inpatient management of diabetes. We provide recommendations for practical, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and describe protocols, procedures, and system improvements required to facilitate the achievement of glycemic goals in patients with hyperglycemia and diabetes admitted in non-critical care settings.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American diabetes association consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control [^114Fwz15]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Although hyperglycemia is associated with adverse patient outcomes, intervention to normalize glycemia has yielded inconsistent results. Indeed, recent trials in critically ill patients have failed to showa significant improvement in mortality with intensive glycemic control or have even shown increased mortality risk. Moreover, these recent RCTs have highlighted the risk of severe hypoglycemia resulting from such efforts. These outcomes have contributed to confusion regarding specific glycemic targets and the means for achieving them in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients.

Recognizing the importance of glycemic control across the continuum of care, the AACE and the ADA joined forces to develop this updated consensus statement on inpatient glycemic management. The central goals were to identify reasonable, achievable, and safe glycemic targets and to describe the protocols, procedures, and system improvements needed to facilitate their implementation. This document is addressed to health care professionals, supporting staff, hospital administrators, and other stakeholders focused on improved management of hyperglycemia in inpatient settings. Consensus panel members extensively reviewed the most current literature and considered the following questions:
Does improving glycemic control improve clinical outcomes for inpatients with hyperglycemia?
What glycemic targets can be recommended in different patient populations?
What treatment options are available for achieving optimal glycemic targets safely and effectively in specific clinical situations?
Does inpatient management of hyperglycemia represent a safety concern?
What systems need to be in place to achieve these recommendations?
Is treatment of inpatient hyperglycemia cost-effective?
What are the optimal strategies for transition to outpatient care?
What are areas for future research?

Preoperative glycemic targets for elective surgery — For adult patients with diabetes undergoing elective surgical procedures, we suggest targeting preoperative hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels < 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) and blood glucose (BG) concentrations 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L), and when targeting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) is not feasible, we suggest targeting preoperative blood glucose (BG) concentrations 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L). These recommendations apply only to scheduled elective procedures where time allows therapy implementation, and BG concentrations should be within the targeted range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours prior to surgery.

Strategies to Ameliorate the Adverse Effects of Prescribed GCs

Conventional Comorbidity Management

GC-induced hyperglycaemia

The monitoring and management of GC-induced hyperglycaemia (GIH) is a very common clinical challenge facing physicians across all specialities, and there are sparse data from observational and interventional trials upon which to guide therapy and no clear established therapeutic goals or targets.

The glucose threshold at which hypoglyeemic treatment should be started is also not clear. Some authors suggest that an implementation of glucose-lowering therapy should be started when pre- or post-prandial glucose repeatedly exceed 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) or 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), respectively, and similar treatment strategies used in patients with T2D, including a stepwise intensification of anti-hyperglycemic therapy as well as frequent re-evaluation. The American Diabetes Association suggests using similar targets as for other types of diabetes, aiming to individualize glycemic control according to patient-specific factors including life expectancy, comorbidities, compliance, and risk of hypoglycemia. In general, in hospitalized critically and noncritically ill patients, a target glucose range of 140 to 180 mg/dL (7.8–10.0 mmol/L) is recommended, although tighter control may be appropriate for selected patients, if this achievable without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. There are specific patient populations (eg, short life expectancy due to incurable disease, advanced age, and comorbidities) in which the best practice will be the avoidance of both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Importantly, after GC treatment has been initiated, there are frequent dose adjustments that must be made, matching the dose adjustment in GC dose with glucose-lowering therapies.

Introduction

The purpose of this research is to provide recommendations for the management of glycemic control in critically ill patients.

Methods

Twenty-one experts issued recommendations related to one of the five pre-defined categories (glucose target, hypoglycemia, carbohydrate intake, monitoring of glycemia, algorithms and protocols), that were scored on a scale to obtain a strong or weak agreement. The GRADE (Grade of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used, with a strong recommendation indicating a clear advantage for an intervention and a weak recommendation indicating that the balance between desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention is not clearly defined.

Results

A glucose target of less than 10 mmol/L is strongly suggested, using intravenous insulin following a standard protocol, when spontaneous food intake is not possible. Definition of the severe hypoglycemia threshold of 2.2 mmol/L is recommended, regardless of the clinical signs. A general, unique amount of glucose (enteral/parenteral) to administer for any patient cannot be suggested. Glucose measurements should be performed on arterial rather than venous or capillary samples, using central lab or blood gas analysers rather than point-of-care glucose readers.

Conclusions

Thirty recommendations were obtained with a strong (21) and a weak (9) agreement. Among them, only 15 were graded with a high level of quality of evidence, underlying the necessity to continue clinical studies in order to improve the risk-to-benefit ratio of glucose control.

Research considerations for individualized glycemic targets — observational data have generated hypotheses for future randomized controlled trials, with a lower target in non-DM patients associated with benefit and higher mean BG levels associated with greater mortality; this contrasts with the failure to show a benefit of INT in TGC-Fast, despite 80% of patients having no history of DM. Patients with DM and high admission HbA1C may have less risk from hyperglycemia but greater mortality with relative hypoglycemia, and a glycemic ratio of 80–90% is a proposed target (ratio of mean ICU BG/chronic estimated BG) but requires prospective trials using individualized targets that achieve adequate time in each target range.

Preoperative glucose management — panel suggestions: The panel agreed that the evidence suggests that patients with better preoperative glucose management have better outcomes, and while most studies compared HbA1c < 7% or ≥ 7% (< 53 mmol/mol vs ≥ 53 mmol/mol), the panel suggests a target HbA1c of > 8% (63.9 mmol/mol) as a feasible goal for identifying patients at higher risk for postoperative complications. In addition, the panel suggests a BG target 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6 to 10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours preoperatively, which is also the recommended target for intra- and postoperative glycemic management.

Background

Adult patients with diabetes or newly recognized hyperglycemia account for over 30% of noncritically ill hospitalized patients. These patients are at increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes in the absence of defined approaches to glycemic management.

Objective

To review and update the 2012 Management of Hyperglycemia in Hospitalized Patients in Non-Critical Care Settings: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline and to address emerging areas specific to the target population of noncritically ill hospitalized patients with diabetes or newly recognized or stress-induced hyperglycemia.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinician experts, together with a patient representative and experts in systematic reviews and guideline development, identified and prioritized 10 clinical questions related to inpatient management of patients with diabetes and/or hyperglycemia. The systematic reviews queried electronic databases for studies relevant to the selected questions. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 10 frequently encountered areas specific to glycemic management in the hospital for which 15 recommendations were made. The guideline includes conditional recommendations for hospital use of emerging diabetes technologies including continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump therapy; insulin regimens for prandial insulin dosing, glucocorticoid, and enteral nutrition-associated hyperglycemia; and use of noninsulin therapies. Recommendations were also made for issues relating to preoperative glycemic measures, appropriate use of correctional insulin, and diabetes self-management education in the hospital. A conditional recommendation was made against preoperative use of caloric beverages in patients with diabetes.

Conclusion

The recommendations are based on the consideration of important outcomes, practicality, feasibility, and patient values and preferences. These recommendations can be used to inform system improvement and clinical practice for this frequently encountered inpatient population.

3 GLUCOSE TARGETS

Because of the lack of good quality randomised controlled trials, there is inconsistent advice from learned societies around the world on what the glucose targets should be for those in general wards and those in an intensive care unit. Table 1 shows the targets for those in a general ward. Again, despite 20% or more of all inpatients having diabetes or hyperglycaemia, there remains debate on what the optimal target glucose concentration should be.

a. Definition of glucose abnormalities in the hospital setting.

Hyperglycemia has been defined as any blood glucose > 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this may require treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated blood glucose may be due to "stress hyperglycemia", a condition that can be established by a review of prior records or measurement of an A1C. A1C values > 6.5% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization. Hypoglycemia has been defined as any blood glucose < 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many as < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/l), although this is lower than the ∼50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l]) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

i. Critically ill patients.

Based on the weight of the available evidence, for the majority of critically ill patients in the ICU setting, insulin infusion should be used to control hyperglycemia, with a starting threshold of ≤ 180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l). Once intravenous insulin is started, the glucose level should be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dl (7.8 and 10.0 mmol/l). Greater benefit may be realized at the lower end of this range. Although strong evidence is lacking, somewhat lower glucose targets may be appropriate in selected patients. However, targets < 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) are not recommended. Use of insulin infusion protocols with demonstrated safety and efficacy, resulting in low rates of hypoglycemia, are highly recommended.

NICE-SUGAR study and 2009 guideline changes

The NICE-SUGAR study, conducted in critically ill patients, revealed that tight glycemic control (81–108 mg/dL) was associated with increased mortality compared to a more moderate glycemic target of 140–180 mg/dL. These findings led to changes in the glycemic target for critically ill patients in the 2009 Consensus Statement on Inpatient Glycemic Control by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American Diabetes Association (ADA). Although the NICE-SUGAR study was designed for critically ill patients, its results prompted the extrapolation of a similar target range (140–180 mg/dL) to non-critical hospitalized patients to balance the benefits of glycemic control with the risks of hypoglycemia.
Since 2012, the Endocrine Society has recommended a glycemic target range of 100–180 mg/dL for non-critical hospitalized patients. This target aims to balance glycemic control while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia, particularly in patients with diabetes or stress-induced hyperglycemia.
Murad MA et al. published a meta-analysis with a systematic review of the literature in 2012, aiming to evaluate the impact of glycemic control on the clinical outcomes of non-critical patients. The analysis included nine randomized studies and 10 observational studies, with intensive group glucose targets ranging from 100 to 180 mg/dL. A significant reduction in the RR of infection was observed with intensive glycemic control (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.21–0.77).
Fong et al. in a retrospective study of 52,107 patients admitted to ICU in 208 North American hospitals, including 15,652 patients with diabetes, assessed average glucose levels (AGL), hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability by coefficient of variation related to mortality in groups with and without diabetes. Patients without diabetes showed a J-shaped association between AGL and mortality, with a lower mortality risk at an average glucose range of 80–120 mg/dL. In contrast, patients with diabetes showed a right-shifted attenuated association between AGL and hospital mortality, with a lower mortality risk at an average glucose range of 90–150 mg/dL. Hypoglycemia was associated with increased mortality in both groups but to a lesser degree in patients with diabetes. An AGL > 180 mg/dL was associated with a relative mortality risk of 4.20 (4.07–4.33) in patients without diabetes and 1.14 (1.08–1.20) in patients with diabetes, using an AGL of 100 mg/dL as a reference and adjusting for other risk factors. The association between CV (coefficient of variation) and hospital mortality was observed only in patients without diabetes.
Bhatti JM et al. evaluated the association between glycemic control and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 638), observing a higher risk of mechanical ventilation with admission glucose levels above 250 mg/dL and a greater need for intensive care support with admission glucose levels above 160 mg/dL.
The randomized clinical trial SHINE included 1151 patients with acute stroke and reported no benefits in functional outcomes with intensive glycemic control (glucose targets 80–130 mg/dL) compared to standard glycemic control (glucose targets 80–179 mg/dL).

### Is incretin-based therapy ready for the care of hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes? insulin therapy has proven itself and is considered the mainstay of treatment [^115635EX]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemia is reported in one-third of general medicine and surgery patients with and without a known history of diabetes. The prevalence is even higher in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and following cardiac surgery, occurring in up to 80% of patients. While previously thought to be an epiphenomenon related to the acute underlying illness of the hospitalization itself, hyperglycemia is now recognized as a contributor to adverse outcomes in critical and noncritically ill patients, with higher mortality and disease-specific morbidity.

Protocols using insulin to maintain glycemia within a reasonable range reduces both mortality and morbidity. In critically ill patients in ICU settings, intravenously (IV) administered insulin is the preferred method of achieving recommended glycemic targets. The short half-life of IV insulin permits rapid dosing adjustments in response to alterations in insulin sensitivity observed during critical illness. For the majority of ICU patients, insulin infusion is started at a threshold of no higher than 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL). Once IV insulin is started, glucose levels should be maintained between 6.1 and 10.0 mmol/L (110 and 180 mg/dL). For patients in non-ICU settings, recent guidelines recommend the use of subcutaneous (SC) insulin as the preferred therapy. Scheduled basal-bolus SC insulin therapy consisting of long- or intermediate-acting preparations in combination with short- or rapid-acting analogs has been proven to be safe and effective for glycemic management and to reduce hospital complications including wound infections, pneumonia, bacteremia, and acute renal and respiratory failure when compared with the use of sliding-scale insulin alone in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Improved glycemic control with insulin therapy is associated with amelioration of the hormonal and proinflammatory aberrations associated with stress hyperglycemia. These include reductions in counterregulatory hormones and proinflammatory transcription factors, and potentially the formation of reactive oxygen species. Insulin therapy induces vasodilatation by stimulating nitric oxide release and inducing expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis reduces circulating free fatty acid levels with improved insulin sensitivity, while inhibition of platelet aggregation reduces thrombosis. The major concern raised with the use of insulin therapy in the hospital is hypoglycemia, which has been observed primarily in studies targeting near normal glucose ranges of 80–110 mg/dL. This concern has prompted a search for alternative methods of inpatient glycemic management that are not known to cause hypoglycemia.

Consider adding scheduled insulin therapy in patients with persistent hyperglycemia (≥ 2 point-of-care blood glucose measurements ≥ 180 mg/dL in a 24-hour period on correctional insulin alone).

Recommendations

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some, but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) For non–critically ill patients, there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucoses < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoids therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

Summary of clinical trials reviewed for question 1

Overall, although a very tight glucose target (80–110 mg/dl [4.4–6.1 mmol/l]) was beneficial in a predominantly surgical ICU population, this target has been difficult to achieve in subsequent studies, including the recently published NICE-SUGAR study, without increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia. In addition, there has been no consistent reduction in mortality with intensive control of glycemia, and increased mortality was observed in the largest published study to date. The reasons for this inconsistency are not entirely clear. The positive results reported in the initial studies may have been attributable to differences in measurement and reporting of BG values, selection of participants, glycemic variability, or nutritional support. Nevertheless, recent attempts to achieve tight glycemic control either have not reduced or have actually increased mortality in multicenter trials and clearly led to higher rates of hypoglycemia.

Despite the inconsistencies, it would be a serious error to conclude that judicious control of glycemia in critically ill patients, and in non-ICU patients in general, is not warranted. First, on the basisof a largenumber of studies in a varietyof inpatient settings, uncontrolled hyperglycemia clearly is associated with poor outcomes. Second, although severe hypoglycemic events are observed in an unacceptably high number of patients receiving intensive insulin therapy with protocols targeting a BG of 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), this risk can likely be minimized with relaxation of targets, improvement and standardization ofprotocols, and their careful implementation. Third, perhaps major beneficial effectson outcomes can be derived from a higher target range of glucose than 80–110 mg/dl in comparison with uncontrolled hyperglycemia.

Finally, until further information becomes available, it is prudent to continue to emphasize the importance of glycemic control in hospitalized patients with critical and noncritical illness while aiming at targets that are less stringent than 80–110 mg/dl (4.4–6.1 mmol/l), a topic that is discussed in detail subsequently.

### Inpatient management of diabetes and hyperglycemia [^1121kELL]. Clinical Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Illness, particularly when severe, leads to increased concentrations of counter-regulatory factors which induce insulin resistance and predispose patients to stress hyperglycemia. Elevated glucose concentrations are common in hospitalized patients, both those with as well as without recognized diabetes. Substantial data has emerged over the past decade that quality glucose management in these individuals actually improves clinical outcomes. Controlling glucose in this setting is challenging, given the phenotypic variability amongst patients, with fluctuating courses of acute illnesses and unpredictable nutritional schedules. We review the evidence basis that has informed national standards and glucose targets in both critically and non-critically ill patients. In the intensive care setting, insulin infusions are now widely endorsed to quickly achieve and maintain glucose control. On the hospital wards, physiological subcutaneous insulin therapy, incorporating both basal and nutritional components, is emerging as the optimal treatment strategy. The transition to outpatient care is another important aspect of any hospital glycemic management program.

Noninsulin therapies vs scheduled insulin for inpatient hyperglycemia — In most adult patients with hyperglycemia (with or without known type 2 diabetes [T2D]) hospitalized for a noncritical illness, we suggest that scheduled insulin therapy be used instead of noninsulin therapies for glycemic management. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) may be appropriate in select patients with T2D, including those with established noninsulin-requiring diabetes nearing hospital discharge, and it may be reasonable to begin other noninsulin therapies in stable patients prior to discharge as a part of a coordinated transition plan.

### Hyperglycemia during critical illness [^1153BbQe]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to review the literature describing the benefits of tight glycemic control in critically ill patients, comparing outcome differences in subgroup populations.

Methods

We searched PubMed for relevant literature on the topic of hyperglycemia and its management in the intensive care unit.

Results

Overwhelming evidence in both surgical and medical patients conclusively demonstrates that hyperglycemia is a marker of severity of illness and is also an independent determinant of bad outcome, largely from infectious complications. Randomized trial evidence, in conjunction with historically controlled trials, supports the use of intensive insulin therapy and euglycemic control in critically ill patients, with nondiabetics possibly benefiting even more than diabetic patients. Euglycemia is best achieved, and hypoglycemia attenuated, through use of a protocolized approach. Further elaboration as to what threshold range defines euglycemia in patient subpopulations is needed and what pitfalls must be avoided in this practice. Development of continuous blood glucose monitoring has started and will someday be incorporated into routine practice in the same way that continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and pulse oximetry are standards of care in the intensive care unit.

Conclusions

Hyperglycemia is a predictor of death and complications in critically ill patients. Early aggregated study results show that control of hyperglycemia improves outcomes. Well-designed studies involving thousands of patients have started to better elucidate the concomitant promoters of hyperglycemia and to better quantify the benefits from tight glycemic control.

### In-hospital management of hyperglycemia: the role of insulin degludec [^117J8df4]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, the effects of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability are equally concerning. Hypoglycemia, often resulting from improper insulin dosing or poor treatment adjustments, is associated with a 66% increased risk of death within 1 year and prolongs hospital stays by an average of 2.8 days. High glycemic variability has been shown to independently predict increased mortality, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is linked to an increased risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications, as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia. High glycemic variability is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes-related complications, especially in patients with cardiac conditions. While glycemic variability remains an important factor, some studies suggest that time-in-range (TIR) may be a stronger predictor of outcomes in hospitalized patients. Recognizing the significance of both, a comprehensive approach addressing glycemic variability along with absolute glucose levels is critical for achieving optimal patient outcomes. However, traditional approaches to glycemic control in hospitalized patients often lack the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing patient needs. This rigidity can result in inappropriate dosing and an increased risk of hypoglycemia, especially for patients with fluctuating nutritional intake or those undergoing medical procedures.

To mitigate the risks, it is crucial to establish clear glycemic targets for hospitalized patients. Table 1 details glycemic targets for hospitalized patients. Achieving these targets can reduce the risk of complications and improve overall patient outcomes. Various randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies have demonstrated that improving glycemic control not only reduces the length of hospital stays but also lowers the incidence of systemic infections and both short- and long-term mortality.

Diabetes Care in the Hospital

All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have their diabetes clearly identified in the medical record. (E)
All patients with diabetes should have an order for blood glucose monitoring, with results available to all members of the health care team. (E)
Goals for blood glucose levels: Critically ill surgical patients' blood glucose levels should be kept as close to 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) as possible and generally < 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l). (A) These patients require an intravenous insulin protocol that has demonstrated efficacy and safety in achieving the desired glucose range without increasing risk for severe hypoglycemia. (E) Critically ill nonsurgical patients' glycemic targets are less well defined. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols targeting blood glucose levels < 110–140 mg/dl have been shown to reduced morbidity and mortality in some but not all studies. Intravenous insulin infusion protocols that effectively and safely keep blood glucose < 140 mg/dl are recommended. (C) Non–critically ill patients: there is no clear evidence for specific blood glucose goals. Since cohort data suggest that outcomes are better in hospitalized patients with fasting glucose < 126 mg/dl and all random glucose levels < 180–200, these goals are reasonable if they can be safely achieved. Insulin is the preferred drug to treat hyperglycemia in most cases. (E) Due to concerns regarding the risk of hypoglycemia, some institutions may consider these blood glucose levels to be overly aggressive for initial targets. Through quality improvement, glycemic goals should systematically be reduced to the recommended levels. (E)
Scheduled prandial insulin doses should be appropriately timed in relation to meals and should be adjusted according to point-of-care glucose levels. The traditional sliding-scale insulin regimens are ineffective as monotherapy and are generally not recommended. (C)
Using correction dose or "supplemental" insulin to correct premeal hyperglycemia in addition to scheduled prandial and basal insulin is recommended. (E)
Glucose monitoring with orders for correction insulin should be initiated in any patient not known to be diabetic who receives therapy associated with high risk for hyperglycemia, including high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, initiation of enteral or parenteral nutrition, or other medications such as octreotide or immunosuppressive medications. (B) If hyperglycemia is documented and persistent, initiation of basal/bolus insulin therapy may be necessary. Such patients should be treated to the same glycemic goals as patients with known diabetes. (E)
A plan for treating hypoglycemia should be established for each patient. Episodes of hypoglycemia in the hospital should be tracked. (E)
All patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital should have an A1C obtained if the result of testing in the previous 2–3 months is not available. (E)
A diabetes education plan including "survival skills education" and follow-up should be developed for each patient. (E)
Patients with hyperglycemia in the hospital who do not have a diagnosis of diabetes should have appropriate plans for follow-up testing and care documented at discharge. (E)

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor option in select inpatients — In select adult patients with mild hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized for a noncritical illness, we suggest using either dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) with correction insulin or scheduled insulin therapy. Select patients include those with T2D that is moderately well-managed as reflected by a recent HbA1c < 7.5% (9.4 mmol/L), BG < 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L), and, if on insulin therapy before hospitalization, to have a total daily insulin dose < 0.6 units/kg/day; this recommendation also applies both to patients taking the DPP4i before admission and those who are not.

QUESTION 2: WHAT GLYCEMIC TARGETS CAN BE RECOMMENDED IN DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS?

The management of hyperglycemia in the hospital presents unique challenges that stem from variations in a patient's nutritional status and level of consciousness, the practical limitations of intermittent glycemic monitoring, and the ultimate importance of patient safety. Accordingly, reasonable glucose targets in the hospital setting are modestly higher than may be routinely advised for patients with diabetes in the outpatient setting.

Definition of glucose abnormalities

In this report, hyperglycemia is defined as any BG value > 140 mg/dl (> 7.8 mmol/l). Levels that are significantly and persistently above this level may necessitate treatment in hospitalized patients. In patients without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, elevated BG concentrations may be due to stress hyperglycemia, a condition that can be established by a review of prior medical records or measurement of A1C. A1C values of > 6.5–7.0% suggest that diabetes preceded hospitalization.

Hypoglycemia is defined as any BG level < 70 mg/dl (< 3.9 mmol/l). This is the standard definition in outpatients and correlates with the initial threshold for the release of counterregulatory hormones. Severe hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients has been defined by many clinicians as < 40 mg/dl (< 2.2 mmol/l), although this value is lower than the approximate 50 mg/dl (2.8 mmol/l) level at which cognitive impairment begins in normal individuals. As with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia among inpatients is also associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes. Early recognition and treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia (40 and 69 mg/dl [2.2 and 3.8 mmol/l], respectively) can prevent deterioration to a more severe episode with potential adverse sequelae.

Grade strength of recommendation classifications — "1 — Strong recommendation for or against" and "2 — Conditional recommendation for or against" — include criteria and stakeholder interpretations. For "1 — Strong recommendation for or against", the criteria are "Desirable consequences clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with interpretations: patients — "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not"; healthcare providers — "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; policymakers — "The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guidelines could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For "2 — Conditional recommendation for or against", the criteria are "Desirable consequences probably outweigh undesirable consequences in most settings (or vice versa)", with interpretations: patients — "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not"; healthcare providers — "Clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for each individual patient and that clinicians must help each individual arrive at a management decision consistent with the individual's values and preferences". and "Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences"; policymakers — "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### International recommendations for glucose control in adult non diabetic critically ill patients [^112zPsni]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Stress-induced hyperglycemia has been found to be associated with an increased morbi-mortality in critically ill patients. Thus, an excessive hyperglycemia (> 10 mmol/L) should be avoided in adult ICU patients.

- Due to persistent conflicting data and the increased risk of hypoglycemia, strict glycemic control cannot be a universal strategy regardless of the condition of patient and the training of the team.

- Continuous intravenous insulin is the only strategy permitted to efficiently control glycemia while decreasing the risk of glycemic variations in critically ill patients.

- In ICU, severe hypoglycemia (< 2.2 mmol/L) should be detected, even in the absence of warning clinical signs, using a close glycemic monitoring (repeated blood samples).

- Blood glucose concentrations determined with bedside point-of-care glucometers provides inaccurate measurements in critically ill patients. Thus, blood glucose measures should be preferentially performed on arterial (or venous) blood samples using classical laboratory devices or blood gas/glucose analyzers, especially in the case of extreme values.

### Glucose management technologies for the critically ill [^1123v5NF]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperglycemia is common in the intensive care unit (ICU) both in patients with and without a previous diagnosis of diabetes. The optimal glucose range in the ICU population is still a matter of debate. Given the risk of hypoglycemia associated with intensive insulin therapy, current recommendations include treating hyperglycemia after two consecutive glucose > 180 mg/dL with target levels of 140–180 mg/dL for most patients. The optimal method of sampling glucose and delivery of insulin in critically ill patients remains elusive. While point of care glucose meters are not consistently accurate and have to be used with caution, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is not standard of care, nor is it generally recommended for inpatient use. Intravenous insulin therapy using paper or electronic protocols remains the preferred approach for critically ill patients. The advent of new technologies, such as electronic glucose management, CGM, and closed-loop systems, promises to improve inpatient glycemic control in the critically ill with lower rates of hypoglycemia.

These recommendations apply only to patients who are scheduled for elective surgical procedures for whom it would be reasonable to allow time for implementation of therapies that target either a preoperative HbA1c or BG level, BG concentrations should be within the targeted range of 100 to 180 mg/dL (5.6–10 mmol/L) 1 to 4 hours prior to surgery, and factors that may affect HbA1c levels such as anemia, hemoglobinopathies, chronic renal failure, alcoholism, drugs, and large BG variations should be taken into account.

### Insulin therapy for the management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients [^1174jjnd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

It has long been established that hyperglycemia with or without a prior diagnosis of diabetes increases both mortality and disease-specific morbidity in hospitalized patients and that goal-directed insulin therapy can improve outcomes. This article reviews the pathophysiology of hyperglycemia during illness, the mechanisms for increased complications and mortality due to hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and beneficial mechanistic effects of insulin therapy and provides updated recommendations for the inpatient management of diabetes in the critical care setting and in the general medicine and surgical settings.

### Inpatient management of diabetes mellitus [^113VNhPC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There is now widespread appreciation of the importance of maintaining glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible among outpatients with diabetes. However, the importance of tight glucose control in inpatients is less well established. During the past several years, it has become apparent that hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients, especially those in the postoperative setting, is associated with poorer outcomes. In addition, two randomized trials have shown improved outcomes with intensive glucose management in acutely ill patients. Based on these studies and our own experience, we propose guidelines and a framework for improving the glycemic control of hospitalized patients.

### Management of hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients [^116nyzpF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

People with diabetes account for 25% of hospitalizations, or 8 million admissions annually. Poor glycemic control in the hospital is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and readmissions. Key considerations of inpatient diabetes management include initiation of appropriate insulin or medication regimens and frequent dose adjustments based on patient-specific factors. Inpatient diabetes management teams and new technologies are increasingly prevalent and can assist in achieving glycemic targets in the hospital. At discharge, standardized checklists should be used to ensure successful transitions of care.

Elective surgery outcomes by preoperative HbA1c — evidence summary notes: In 10 non-RCTs, postoperative infections were less frequent in patients with a preoperative HbA1c < 7% vs ≥ 7% (< 53 mmol/mol vs ≥ 53 mmol/mol; odds ratio 0.54 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.73); very low level of certainty), and a study reported a HbA1c ≥ 7.8% (61.7 mmol/mol) as the threshold above which a significantly higher rate of wound complications occurred.

Hospitalized adults — intensive care unit (ICU) glycemic targets and insulin strategy — glucose targets < 110 mg/dL are no longer universally recommended, and the AACE/ADA consensus statement on inpatient glycemic control favors more relaxed glycemic targets in the ICU, as high as 140 to 180 mg/dL; insulin therapy is the preferred method of glycemic control in most hospitalized persons, and IV infusion of insulin is the preferred route of administration for persons in the ICU; preference should be given to use of regular insulin for IV administration; most persons with T2D and all persons with T1D in the ICU receiving IV insulin infusion will require transition to a subcutaneous insulin regimen.

Objective

To provide insulin protocols and adjustment guidance for management of hyperglycemia in common inpatient clinical scenarios.

Methods

We performed a PubMed search of pertinent existing literature from 1980 to 2010.

Results

Hyperglycemia is frequently encountered in general medical and surgical wards and has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes, prolonged hospital length of stay, and increased institutional care needs after discharge. No randomized controlled trial has been conducted to define optimal glycemic goals or to investigate the effects of intensive glycemic control in the non-intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Nonetheless, it is advocated by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Diabetes Association, in their 2009 Consensus Statement on Inpatient Glycemic Control, that optimization of glycemia in hospitalized patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia be judiciously offered. This approach is clinically sound, in light of the known deleterious consequences of hyperglycemia in critically and noncritically ill patients and the benefits observed with improved glycemic control in intensive care settings. The approach to hyperglycemia in non-ICU inpatients should follow the principles of provision of basal-nutritional-supplemental insulin. Herein we provide insulin protocols and adjustment guidance for management of hyperglycemia in common clinical scenarios. Recommendations reflect the opinion of national experts in the field and our departmental consensus at Penn State Institute for Diabetes and Obesity.

Conclusion

Glycemic control in the non-ICU setting is a relevant clinical situation that should be addressed and managed effectively and prudently. We present a practical guide for management of hyperglycemia individualized to various clinical scenarios encountered in the general hospital wards.
