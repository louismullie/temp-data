## Question

For a subacute presentation of hip pain with a possible labral tear, what is the optimal initial workup?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal initial workup for subacute hip pain when an acetabular labral tear is suspected. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical assessment to set pretest probability. Then, I should verify first-line imaging and which radiographic views are necessary. Next, I will need to consider decision points on radiograph interpretation to branch the pathway. After that, I should review advanced imaging options, weighing MR arthrography versus optimized conventional MRI, and when each is preferred. Finally, I need to check the role of diagnostic intra-articular injection and reconcile controversies like the accuracy of physical exam maneuvers and the prevalence of incidental labral findings on MRI or arthroscopy [^1112nzLG] [^116pSqtB] [^11369rqR] [^115G3Scm].

> Let me first confirm the clinical foundation. In subacute anterior hip or groin pain with mechanical symptoms (clicking, locking, catching), I should elicit features that raise suspicion for intra-articular pathology and screen for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) morphology, while performing provocative maneuvers such as FADIR and FABER to increase pretest probability, knowing these are not definitive tests on their own [^1112nzLG] [^116pSqtB]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic accuracy caveat: exam maneuvers have limited specificity and variable sensitivity for labral pathology, so clinical assessment guides but does not establish the diagnosis, and cannot reliably differentiate labral tears from osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis on exam alone [^113YXeYW] [^1116mF1G].

> Wait, let me verify an apparent discrepancy about FADIR. Some sources report modest sensitivity and specificity for FADIR, but a meta-analysis suggested very high pooled sensitivity with limited diagnostic odds ratios, implying "screening accuracy" at best; I should reconcile this by acknowledging heterogeneity and bias in diagnostic studies and relying on imaging to confirm labral pathology when clinically suspected [^111wTzrX]. So, even if FADIR is sensitive in select studies, I need to ensure I don't over-interpret a positive test without imaging correlation, given exam alone is insufficient for a definitive diagnosis of a labral tear [^1116mF1G] [^113YXeYW].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging. Radiographs are the universal initial modality: obtain a standing anteroposterior pelvis view and a frog-leg lateral, with Dunn views when FAI is suspected to assess cam/pincer morphology and joint space, because radiographs are foundational for bony architecture and arthritis assessment before any soft-tissue imaging [^11369rqR] [^116pSqtB] [^115G3Scm]. Let me double-check why this sequence matters: significant proportions of asymptomatic individuals have labral findings on MRI or arthroscopy, so I must anchor interpretation to radiographic context to avoid over-calling incidental labral tears [^114MFrZ5] [^116tkUe7].

> I will now examine the critical decision point based on radiographic findings. If I see advanced osteoarthritis or definite joint space narrowing suggesting a degenerative joint, pursuing labrum-focused advanced imaging is unlikely to change management; instead, I should pivot toward conservative care and consider a diagnostic intra-articular injection to confirm the hip as the pain generator if needed [^113YXeYW] [^11369rqR]. Hold on, I should verify that this avoids unnecessary testing: guidelines on chronic hip pain emphasize radiography first and imaging escalation tailored to scenarios where it will alter management, which fits this branch [^11369rqR].

> But wait, what if radiographs are normal or show FAI morphology without advanced arthritis. In that case, with mechanical symptoms and persistent suspicion for intra-articular pathology, I should proceed to cross-sectional imaging of the hip to evaluate the labrum and cartilage, as recommended when clinical suspicion remains after nondiagnostic radiographs [^1112nzLG] [^116pSqtB] [^11369rqR]. Let me reconsider special scenarios: if trauma or fracture is suspected and X-rays are negative, CT or MRI is indicated for occult fracture per ACR variants, but in a labral tear–predominant presentation, MRI-based pathways are appropriate after radiography [^115G3Scm] [^113XcgA8].

> Next, I should review advanced imaging choices. MR arthrography (MRA) has traditionally been considered the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears due to higher sensitivity and excellent interobserver reliability compared with older conventional MRI, and it remains a strong option when precise tear delineation is needed or initial MRI is equivocal [^1149L717] [^114Fy6Zw] [^116Q3trB]. I need to ensure I capture trade-offs: MRA requires intra-articular contrast and can cause postprocedural discomfort, but joint distention can enhance visualization of labral and chondral lesions, which is valuable for preoperative planning in select patients [^112joLsZ] [^116QQSwX].

> Hmm, wait a minute, conventional MRI at 3T with optimized protocols can sometimes approach or even rival MRA for labral detection, though results vary by technique, field strength, and reference standard. Some comparative studies report very high sensitivity for 3T MRI versus 1.5T MRA, whereas others still favor MRA for sensitivity; taken together, high-quality 3T protocols are acceptable when MRA is unavailable or contraindicated, but MRA may still outperform in subtle or equivocal cases [^111r8k6M] [^115YAipD] [^112Ayf6m]. Hold on, I should verify the implication: given heterogeneity, I should tailor modality choice to local expertise and the clinical question, recognizing that optimized non-contrast MRI reduces invasiveness but may miss subtle lesions that MRA could detect [^116QQSwX].

> I need to ensure the selection criteria are clear. Choose MRA when preoperative mapping is required, suspicion remains high despite a negative or non-diagnostic high-quality MRI, or institutional MRA performance is demonstrably superior; conversely, choose optimized 3T MRI when avoiding invasive arthrography is desirable and local protocols have validated performance for labral and chondral assessment in this population [^112of2sY] [^116QQSwX]. Let me double-check that preoperative MRI also contributes beyond the labrum: cartilage assessment and definitions of advanced chondral wear help determine candidacy for hip preservation surgery, which underscores the value of high-quality MR-based evaluation [^112of2sY].

> Next, I should review the role of diagnostic intra-articular injection. When imaging and symptoms are discordant or the pain source is unclear (hip versus spine or extra-articular), an image-guided intra-articular anesthetic ± corticosteroid injection can serve as a confirmatory test; meaningful pain relief supports an intra-articular pain generator and helps refine management decisions and sequencing with spine or extra-articular treatments [^112umX67] [^1124MX3s] [^113YXeYW]. Hold on, I should verify use cases: this is particularly useful when incidental labral findings complicate decision-making, aligning with the need to confirm that the hip is truly the symptomatic source before intervention [^114MFrZ5].

> Let me synthesize the optimal initial workup sequence to ensure nothing is missing. First, establish pretest probability with a careful history and exam, recognizing that FADIR/FABER are supportive but not definitive. Second, obtain initial radiographs (standing AP pelvis, frog-leg lateral, and consider Dunn views for FAI). Third, branch based on radiographs: if advanced osteoarthritis or joint space loss is present, prioritize conservative management and consider a diagnostic intra-articular injection rather than labrum-focused advanced imaging; if radiographs are normal or show FAI morphology without advanced arthritis, proceed to MRI-based evaluation. Fourth, select MR protocol: consider MRA for maximal sensitivity and preoperative mapping, or use optimized 3T MRI when available and appropriate. Fifth, deploy diagnostic intra-articular injection when imaging is equivocal or symptom–imaging discordance persists to confirm the hip as the pain generator before committing to targeted interventions [^1112nzLG] [^116pSqtB] [^11369rqR] [^115G3Scm].

---

For subacute hip pain with suspected labral tear, the best initial workup is a **targeted history and exam** (FADIR/FABER, gait, impingement signs), followed by **AP pelvis and Dunn lateral radiographs** to assess for FAI, dysplasia, or arthritis [^113YXeYW]. If radiographs are normal or nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, obtain a **3T MRI with dedicated hip protocol** [^111r8k6M] [^1112nzLG]; if MRI is inconclusive or surgery is planned, proceed to MR arthrography for superior labral visualization [^114Fy6Zw]. Consider diagnostic intra-articular injection if diagnosis is uncertain or to confirm intra-articular pain [^113bw672]. This approach balances accuracy, invasiveness, and cost, and aligns with ACR/AAFP guidance [^114U99L1] [^1112nzLG].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough clinical history and physical examination are **essential** to guide subsequent diagnostic testing and imaging [^1124MX3s]. Key historical features suggestive of a labral tear include:

- **Pain location**: Anterior groin pain [^112Ljdgy], often activity-related, with possible mechanical symptoms (clicking, locking, instability) [^113YXeYW].

- **Onset**: Insidious or associated with low-energy trauma or repetitive activities [^112Ljdgy].

- **Risk factors**: Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), hip dysplasia, or hypermobility [^113YXeYW] [^112wSZZv].

Physical examination should include:

- **FADIR test**: High sensitivity (94–99%) but low specificity; useful as a screening tool [^111wTzrX].

- **FABER test**: Commonly used to identify intra-articular hip pathology [^1116mF1G].

- **Gait and impingement**: Assessment of gait, range of motion, and impingement signs [^1124MX3s].

---

## Initial imaging: plain radiography

Plain radiography is the recommended **initial imaging modality** [^11369rqR] for subacute hip pain. Standard views include the **AP pelvis** — to evaluate joint space, osteophytes, and acetabular coverage — and the **Dunn lateral** — to assess the femoral head-neck junction for cam lesions [^1112nzLG] [^113YXeYW]. Radiographs help identify structural abnormalities such as FAI, dysplasia, or osteoarthritis, which are often associated with labral tears [^112wSZZv] [^116pSqtB].

---

## Advanced imaging: MRI and MR arthrography

If radiographs are normal or nondiagnostic and clinical suspicion remains high, **advanced imaging is indicated** [^114U99L1]. **MRI** is noninvasive, involves no radiation [^117HwmhD], and provides excellent soft-tissue contrast [^112of2sY], with sensitivity for labral tears ranging from 77–97% depending on field strength and protocol optimization [^116QQSwX]. **MR arthrography** involves intra-articular injection of gadolinium contrast to provide joint distention and improved visualization of labral pathology, with sensitivity and specificity of 90.5–95.2% and 84.6%, respectively [^114Fy6Zw]. It is particularly useful when conventional MRI is inconclusive or when detailed assessment of labral pathology is required for surgical planning [^112joLsZ].

---

## Diagnostic intra-articular injection

**Diagnostic intra-articular injection** of local anesthetic is helpful for confirming intra-articular pathology and differentiating labral tears from extra-articular sources of hip pain [^112umX67]. A significant reduction in pain following injection supports an intra-articular pain source [^113bw672].

## Summary of recommended diagnostic workup

| **Step** | **Diagnostic modality** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical history and physical examination | - Initial assessment <br/> - Screening for labral tear [^111wTzrX] |
| 2 | Plain radiography (AP pelvis, Dunn lateral) | Identify structural abnormalities (FAI, dysplasia, osteoarthritis) [^11369rqR] |
| 3 | MRI (3T preferred) | Non-invasive assessment of labral pathology [^116QQSwX] |
| 4 | MR arthrography | - Detailed assessment of labral pathology <br/> - Surgical planning [^114Fy6Zw] |
| 5 | Diagnostic intra-articular injection | Confirm intra-articular source of pain [^113bw672] |

---

## Conclusion

The best initial diagnostic workup for subacute hip pain with suspected labral tear includes a **thorough history and physical examination** followed by **plain radiography**. If radiographs are normal or nondiagnostic, obtain advanced imaging with MRI or MR arthrography. A diagnostic intra-articular injection may help confirm intra-articular pathology. This approach supports accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of hip labral tears.

Because of the low reliability of clinical exams, diagnosing a labral tear necessitates imaging. Plain radiographs should be conducted as an initial investigation, including Dunn views. If joint space narrowing is present, further imaging is not recommended; however, a diagnostic injection may be worthwhile. In 40% of asymptomatic hip joints, a labral tear can be identified on arthroscopy.

A positive FADIR test, which reproduces groin pain when the hip is placed in a flexed, adducted, and internally rotated position, is commonly employed in physical exams for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The sensitivity of the FADIR test ranges between 0.40 and 0.60, while the specificity ranges between 0.47 and 0.52, depending on the type of FAI lesion. Given that FAI is a bony abnormality, plain radiographs of the hips and pelvis with Dunn views are recommended.

### 3.0 T conventional hip MR and hip MR arthrography for the acetabular labral tears confirmed by arthroscopy [^114Fy6Zw]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the value of hip MR in diagnosing acetabular labrum tears, and to further compare the diagnostic performances of conventional MR with MR arthrography for detecting acetabular labrum tears.

Methods: Ninety patients undergoing both hip MR examination and subsequent hip arthroscopy were retrospectively evaluated. Of these patients, 34 underwent both conventional MR and MR arthrography, while the other 56 underwent only conventional MR examination. All hip MR images were independently reviewed by two radiologists and further compared with the results of hip arthroscopy.

Results: Fifty-nine of the 90 patients were confirmed to have acetabular labral tears by hip arthroscopy, while 31 had no tears. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of conventional MR for evaluating the acetabular labral tears were 61.0%, 77.4%, 83.7%, and 51.1% (radiologist A), and 66.1%, 74.2%, 82.9%, and 53.4% (radiologist B), respectively, demonstrating good consistency between the two observers (K = 0.645). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of MR arthrography for assessing acetabular labral tears were 90.5%, 84.6%, 90.5%, and 84.6% (radiologist A), and 95.2%, 84.6%, 90.9%, and 91.7% (radiologist B), respectively, with excellent consistency between the two observers (K = 0.810). The sensitivity and NPV of MR arthrography for diagnosing acetabular labral tears were significantly higher than those of conventional MR (both P < 0.05).

Conclusion: Hip MR arthrography is a reliable evaluation modality for diagnosing acetabular labral tears, demonstrating superior sensitivity and NPV compared to conventional MR.

### Acetabular labral tear is associated with high pelvic incidence with or without femoroacetabular impingement morphology [^115z4G9h]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Even though differential diagnosis is difficult due to complex pathological structures, acetabular dysplasia, and ligamentous laxity might be the cause of groin or hip pain. Acetabular labral tears have been reported as the cause of 22–55% of cases of groin or hip pain due to the location of pain-sensing free nerve endings in the labrum. Although several studies have reported a high prevalence of asymptomatic acetabular labral tears in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some etiologies of acetabular labral tear have been investigated. Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a bony morphology (cam or pincer type) and abnormal articulation of the femoral head and acetabulum that is associated with acetabular labral tears. FAI is considered one of the primary predisposing factors for acetabular labral tear due to impingement on the anterior–superior portion of the labrum. However, symptomatic acetabular labral tears are known to be common in patients without FAI as well as those with FAI. It is also well known for degenerative acetabular labral tears to be associated with degenerative changes of the hip joint. Some acetabular labral tears could be related to acetabular trauma and traumatic labral tears among athletes.

The spinopelvic sagittal parameter of pelvic incidence (PI) is found in the upright position by determining the shape and orientation of the lower limbs and spine, which is independent of the patient position and pelvic orientation. It is defined as the angle between the line perpendicular to the midpoint of the sacral plateau and the line from this point.

### Acetabular labral tear is associated with high pelvic incidence with or without femoroacetabular impingement morphology [^115b2kXk]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Radiologic assessment of acetabular labral tear was confirmed by MRI or MRA. An acetabular labral tear on the MR image was defined as an irregular labrum shape, a non-triangular labrum, a thickened labrum with no labral recess, a labrum with increased signal intensities on the T1 images, or labral detachment from the acetabular labrum.

All subjects were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of radiologic acetabular labral tears. MRI or MRA and plain radiography were employed to measure the alpha angle, lateral center–edge angle, typical pistol grip deformity, crossover sign, posterior wall sign, and ischial spine sign. The alpha angle was defined as the angle between the bisection of the femoral axis and a line connecting the center of the femoral head to the point where asphericity began in the oblique axial view on MRI or frog-leg lateral radiography.

- **Pistol grip deformity**: Evaluated on standard anterior–posterior hip plain radiography.
- **Crossover sign, posterior wall sign, and ischial spine sign**: Evaluated on standard anterior–posterior hip plain radiography.

The lateral center–edge angle was measured by drawing three lines on the anterior–posterior hip plain radiography:
1. A horizontal line connecting the bilateral inferior of teardrops.
2. A line through the center of the femoral head, perpendicular to line 1.
3. A line through the center of the femoral head, passing through the most superolateral point of the acetabular sourcil. The angle created by lines 2 and 3 is the lateral center–edge angle.

### Mri for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^112of2sY]. Insights into Imaging (2016). High credibility.

Knowledge of the mechanisms of injury in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) can facilitate an understanding of patterns of chondrolabral injury seen on MRI. As advanced chondral wear is a relative contraindication to hip preservation surgery, MRI assessment of the integrity of hip joint cartilage can assist in the selection of patients most likely to benefit from surgery. A description of the underlying osseous morphology and the presence of compensatory soft tissue injuries should also be included in the preoperative evaluation of FAI.

### Clinical presentation of patients with tears of the acetabular labrum [^112Ljdgy]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American volume (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of a labral tear of the acetabulum may be variable, and the diagnosis is often delayed. We sought to define the clinical characteristics associated with symptomatic acetabular labral tears by reviewing a group of patients who had an arthroscopically confirmed diagnosis.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the records for sixty-six consecutive patients (sixty-six hips) who had a documented labral tear confirmed with hip arthroscopy. We had prospectively recorded demographic factors, symptoms, physical examination findings, previous treatments, functional limitations, the manner of onset, the duration of symptoms until the diagnosis of the labral tear, other diagnoses offered by health-care providers, and other surgical procedures that these patients had undergone. Radiographic abnormalities and magnetic resonance arthrography findings were also recorded.

- **Results**: The study group included forty-seven female patients (71%) and nineteen male patients (29%) with a mean age of thirty-eight years. The initial presentation was insidious in forty patients, associated with a low-energy acute injury in twenty, and major trauma in six. Moderate to severe pain was reported by fifty-seven patients (86%), with groin pain predominating (sixty-one patients; 92%). Sixty patients (91%) had activity-related pain (p < 0.0001), and forty-seven patients (71%) had night pain (p = 0.0006). On examination, twenty-six patients (39%) had a limp, twenty-five (38%) had a positive Trendelenburg sign, and sixty-three (95%) had.

### Paralabral cyst of the hip causing deep vein thrombosis treated with arthroscopic decompression and labral repair [^113QwzNp]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old woman was referred to our office for evaluation of a right hip paralabral cyst found on MRI. She initially presented to her primary care physician with reports of asymmetric lower extremity swelling, a palpable painful right-sided groin mass, and mild generalized right hip pain. She reported no history of trauma or issues with her right hip previously. A lower extremity duplex ultrasonography (US) revealed an acute occlusive DVT of the right common femoral vein, deep femoral vein, and occlusion at the saphenofemoral junction (Figures 1 and 2). She was immediately started on an oral anticoagulant, and a hematology workup was initiated to rule out causes of a seemingly unprovoked, acute DVT. The initial workup was normal. Given the presence of an associated mass in the groin and proximal location of the DVT, a pelvic MRI was ordered. This revealed a large anterior paralabral cyst appearing to originate from the joint capsule just medial to the iliopsoas tendon and clearly abutted the femoral vessels. In addition, there was evidence of a labral tear without associated subchondral cystic formation or bony edema within the acetabulum. Her plain radiographs demonstrated an anterolateral CAM-type lesion with preserved joint space (Figures 3–6).

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1116mF1G]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Two hip joint pathologies that mimic lumbosacral radiculopathy are labral tears and femoroacetabular impingement. Like avascular necrosis (AVN), these conditions are more common in younger adults.

The labrum of the hip joint is the fibrocartilaginous tissue that surrounds the acetabulum, playing a role in shock absorption, joint stability, and pressure distribution. Labral tears are associated with athletic activities and affect up to 55% of athletes who present with hip pain along with mechanical symptoms such as clicking, locking, and instability. Labral tears are more common in women, particularly between 15 and 41 years of age. They typically present with anterior groin pain, with nearly all patients who have arthroscopically diagnosed labral tears noting this symptom. However, pain attributable to labral tears can be felt in the lateral hip or radiate to the buttocks or the knees, mimicking lumbosacral radiculopathy. Acetabular labral tears can be caused by trauma, joint hypermobility, age-related degeneration, hip dysplasia, such as a shallow acetabulum and femoral/acetabular anteversion, and femoroacetabular impingement.

There are no specific physical exam maneuvers that distinguish an acetabular labral tear from other forms of intraarticular hip pathology, such as osteoarthritis or AVN, but the flexion, abduction, and external rotation (FABER) test is commonly used to diagnose intraarticular hip pathology. The FABER test is positive when there is anterior hip/groin pain when the hip is placed in the flexed, abducted, and externally rotated position.

### Are degenerative findings detected on traction MR arthrography of the hip associated with failure of arthroscopic femoroacetabular impingement surgery [^117WUNbP]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

To conclude, we could identify MRI parameters that can potentially aid surgeons when contemplating which patients can still benefit from arthroscopic FAI surgery based on the severity of already present joint degeneration. Among these parameters, extensive acetabular cartilage damage > 2 h, central femoral osteophytes, and femoral cartilage damage associated with ligamentum teres damage were associated with failure, independent of advanced age and radiographic arthritis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria postmenopausal subacute or chronic pelvic pain [^113bGCfM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic pelvic pain in women, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a pelvic ultrasound as the initial imaging modality. This recommendation is particularly for postmenopausal subacute or chronic pelvic pain localized to the deep pelvis or when clinically suspected pathologies exist in the perineum, vulva, or vagina.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and management of hip pain after total hip arthroplasty [^115YMLwQ]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2009). Low credibility.

Evaluation of pain following total hip arthroplasty (THA) can be challenging in the absence of radiographic pathology. This study aimed to examine the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of enigmatic hip pain following THA. We reviewed a series of patients who were evaluated with MRI after presenting with enigmatic hip pain following THA. MRI was able to demonstrate pathology in the periprosthetic tissues in all hips with minimal artifact. Patients underwent a range of conservative and operative interventions depending on the underlying pathology. If used discriminately in situations where pathology cannot be detected by conventional methods, MRI is a highly effective modality that can aid in the diagnosis of a wide range of disorders, thereby allowing the clinician to determine the most appropriate intervention.

### Association of hip pain with radiographic evidence of hip osteoarthritis: Diagnostic test study [^117HwmhD]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Studies of knee MRI in Framingham have shown that scanning can detect cartilage damage in those without radiographic knee osteoarthritis, and this may also be true of the hip. MRI can also detect other abnormalities not seen on radiographs, such as bone marrow lesions, synovitis, and subtle osteophytes. No large-scale studies have compared hip radiographs with hip MRI, but the few existing studies have shown that hip radiographs are less sensitive in detecting specific features of osteoarthritis than MRI scans of the hip.

In HOAMS (Hip OA MRI Scoring Systems) studies, hips with a Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0 (no radiographic osteophyte nor joint space narrowing) often showed features of osteoarthritis on MRI: 25% of hips with evidence of severe cartilage damage, 33% with synovitis, and 58% with labral tears. For elderly people with chronic hip pain in HOAMS, radiographs were not as sensitive in detecting joint space narrowing as MRI scans. Though we did not investigate the diagnostic performance of hip MRI, the problems with using MRI to diagnose hip osteoarthritis are likely to be similar to those associated with the knee. In the knee, studies have shown that though MRI is more sensitive than radiography, it is far less specific for abnormalities suggestive of osteoarthritis in most middle-aged and older people.

The definition of radiographic hip osteoarthritis has differed in hip osteoarthritis studies, and only a few epidemiology studies have compared the differing definitions of radiographic hip osteoarthritis. The Osteoarthritis Initiative definition derived from the modified…

### Diagnostic accuracy of clinical tests for the diagnosis of hip femoroacetabular impingement/labral tear: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111wTzrX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Surgery for hip femoroacetabular impingement/acetabular labral tear (FAI/ALT) is exponentially increasing despite a lack of investigation into the accuracy of various diagnostic measures. The useful clinical utility of these measures is necessary to support diagnostic imaging and subsequent surgical decision-making.

- **Objective**: Summarize and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various clinical tests relevant to hip FAI/ALT pathology.

- **Methods**: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases was conducted using keywords related to the diagnostic accuracy of the hip joint. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Random effects models were used to summarize sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and respective confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: The employed search strategy revealed 21 potential articles, with one demonstrating high quality. Nine articles qualified for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated that flexion-adduction-internal rotation (pooled SN ranging from 0.94 [95% CI 0.90 to 0.97] to 0.99 [95% CI 0.98 to 1.00]; DOR 5.71 [95% CI 0.84 to 38.86] to 7.82 [95% CI 1.06 to 57.84]) and flexion-internal rotation (pooled SN 0.96 [95% CI 0.81 to 0.99]; DOR 8.36 [95% CI 0.41 to 171.3]) tests possess only screening accuracy.

- **Conclusions**: Few hip physical examination tests for diagnostic accuracy in FAI/ALT have been identified as highly reliable.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute hip pain: 2024 update [^115G3Scm]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute hip pain can be related to any combination of hip fracture, dislocation, and/or soft tissue injury. These injuries require timely diagnosis to avoid associated complications such as osteonecrosis or prolonged immobility. Imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of these injuries, noting that hip fractures cannot be reliably diagnosed or excluded via physical examination alone. Radiographs are the initial imaging modality of choice for acute hip pain. Several recent studies have evaluated specific scenarios in which cross-sectional imaging (CT and/or MRI) should also be obtained; these scenarios will be reviewed as separate variants within this document.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Comparative reliability and diagnostic performance of conventional 3T magnetic resonance imaging and 1.5T magnetic resonance arthrography for the evaluation of internal derangement of the hip [^111r8k6M]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a recognized cause of premature osteoarthritis of the hip joint due to abnormal mechanical contact between the proximal femur and acetabular rim. Imaging plays a significant role in the early diagnosis of this condition, with the hope that early intervention may delay the onset of osteoarthritis. The imaging investigation of choice for suspected FAI is currently MR arthrography (MRA), which has been shown to have greater diagnostic accuracy for detecting labral tears compared to conventional MRI. However, some studies comparing the diagnostic findings of 1.5T MRI with arthroscopy have shown encouraging results for non-arthrographic conventional MRI as a diagnostic tool in FAI.

MRA increases contrast resolution, making labral and cartilage defects more conspicuous. In a meta-analysis comparing the diagnostic accuracy of MRA and conventional MRI against surgical outcomes in 19 studies, MRA was superior at diagnosing labral tears. However, advances in MRI strength and surface coil technology have necessitated a re-thinking of FAI imaging, and the use of conventional 3T MRI instead of MRA is gaining momentum. The main diagnostic challenge for conventional 3T MRI is to identify labral and cartilage lesions with similar sensitivities/specificities to 1.5T MRA.

To the best of our knowledge, there have only been three published papers directly comparing both conventional MRI and MRA with arthroscopic findings. Of these, the two earliest studies concluded that MRA has superior diagnostic performance over conventional MRI.

### Acetabular labral tears [^112wSZZv]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Acetabular labral tears rarely occur in the absence of a structural osseous abnormality. These tears are frequently associated with lesions of acetabular cartilage, such as delamination. Hip arthroscopy is the preferred operative approach for treating labral injuries when there are no substantial structural osseous abnormalities present.

### Deep learning and conventional hip MRI for the detection of labral and cartilage abnormalities using arthroscopy as standard of reference [^115YpsH6]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

While substantial inter-rater reliability was observed for labral assessment (Gwet's AC2: 0.87–0.93), marked variability was noted in cartilage evaluation across different zones. Notably, the lower inter-rater reliability observed in femoral Zone C (Gwet's AC2: 0.04–0.08) could be attributed to the differences in cartilage assessment between radiological readers and orthopedic surgeons rather than sequence-specific limitations. These findings underscore the inherent complexity of cartilage signal interpretation in MR imaging, independent of the acquisition technique employed.

In our study cohort, the diagnostic performance was highest for chondral abnormalities in Zones C and D, which represent the superior and anterosuperior zones of the acetabulum and the corresponding femoral zones. Notably, these zones demonstrated a universal presence of cartilage defects at arthroscopy, precluding specificity calculations due to the absence of true negative cases. Cartilage damage in the hip typically occurs at the acetabulum, primarily at the superolateral to anterosuperior facet (Zones C/D), and is frequently associated with FAIS. Detecting damage to the femoral head cartilage presents significant challenges attributed to anatomical factors, with normal cartilage thickness varying from 0.32 to 2.53 mm at the femoral head and 0.95 to 3.13 mm at the acetabulum. Isolated damage to the femoral head cartilage is uncommon, usually resulting from trauma or avascular necrosis. When bilateral cartilage damage is evident, affecting both the acetabulum and the femoral head, it usually indicates…

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic hip pain: 2022 update [^11369rqR]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic hip pain is a frequent chief complaint for adult patients who present for evaluation in a variety of clinical practice settings. Following a targeted history and physical examination, imaging plays a vital role in elucidating the etiologies of a patient's symptoms, as a wide spectrum of pathological entities may cause chronic hip pain.

Radiography is usually the appropriate initial imaging test following a clinical examination. Depending on the clinical picture, advanced cross-sectional imaging may be subsequently performed for further evaluation. This document provides the best practice for the imaging workup of chronic hip pain in patients presenting with a variety of clinical scenarios.

- **Guideline development**: The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the hip: Detection of labral and chondral abnormalities using noncontrast imaging [^112Ayf6m]. Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Traditional imaging techniques have limited ability to detect subtle chondral and labral injuries of the hip. We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip and subsequent hip arthroscopy to evaluate the ability of optimized, noncontrast MRI to identify tears of the acetabular labrum and defects in articular cartilage.

- **Type of study**: Retrospective review of a consecutive sample.

- **Methods**: Between January 1997 and July 2000, 92 patients had MRI of the hip, followed by arthroscopic surgery of that hip by 1 of 2 surgeons. Two musculoskeletal MR radiologists, blinded to the initial MRI and surgical findings, independently interpreted the studies, looking for the location and degree of articular cartilage and acetabular labral pathology.

- **Results**: Of the 92 patients studied, each of the 2 radiologists correctly identified 83 (94%) and 84 (95%) of the 88 labral tears present at surgery, respectively. There was 92% interobserver agreement on the MRI studies. For articular cartilage defects on the femoral head and acetabulum, there was good agreement (92% and 86% within one grade) between MRI and surgical grading and between the two MR readers (kappa of 0.8 for femoral head cartilage and 0.7 for acetabular cartilage).

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that noncontrast MRI of the hip, using an optimized protocol, can noninvasively identify labral and chondral pathology. Such information may facilitate deciding which patients warrant surgical intervention, thus preserving hip arthroscopy as a therapeutic option.

### Deep learning and conventional hip MRI for the detection of labral and cartilage abnormalities using arthroscopy as standard of reference [^114j2yQ6]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The accurate assessment of hip joint pathologies remains a significant challenge due to the curved anatomy and tight proximity of opposing articular surfaces. The thin hyaline cartilage layers of the acetabulum and femoral head, measuring between 0.8 mm and 3.0 mm in healthy individuals, further complicate this evaluation, making it particularly difficult to detect small-scale pathologies. Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a motion-related disorder characterized by abnormal contact between the femoral head-neck junction and the acetabular rim, leading to various degrees of chondrolabral damage and progressive hip pain. Early detection of cartilage and labral abnormalities is crucial, as timely intervention with hip arthroscopy can significantly reduce the risk of onset and progression of hip osteoarthritis.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is considered the gold standard for evaluating hip joint pathologies due to its superior soft-tissue contrast. Standard protocols typically include T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fat-suppressed sequences. However, these conventional techniques often lack the spatial resolution required to effectively detect subtle labral and cartilage abnormalities. Recent advancements in MR imaging have focused on optimizing spatial resolution and tissue contrast while mitigating the prolonged acquisition times typically associated with high-resolution imaging. Compressed Sense (CS) accelerates image acquisition by undersampling k-space data and employing iterative image reconstruction algorithms to maintain diagnostic quality.

### MRI is better than CT scan for detection of structural pathologies after traumatic posterior hip dislocations in children and adolescents [^112UtmAW]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Low credibility.

Traumatic posterior hip dislocations in children and adolescents require emergent closed reduction. Post-reduction imaging is necessary to assess the concentricity of reduction and structural injuries to the hip. There is no consensus on which imaging modality is the optimal choice in such conditions. The purposes of this study are to describe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of traumatic posterior hip dislocations and to compare the effectiveness of MRI with computerized tomography (CT) in detecting structural abnormalities of the hip that impact patient management.

- **Methods**: This study is a retrospective review of imaging in traumatically dislocated hips in patients treated at our institution. All CT and MRI images were reviewed, with specific osseous and soft tissue injuries documented by consensus among two musculoskeletal pediatric radiologists. They interpreted the MRI and CT scans of each patient in a blinded manner.

- **Results**: In total, 27 patients (23 males, 4 females) with a mean age of 12.5 years (range, 2 to 19 years) underwent post-reduction MRI evaluations. MRI findings revealed femoral head injuries in 17 patients (62.9%), posterior labral entrapments in 6 patients (22.2%), posterior labral tears in 17 patients (62.9%), posterior wall fractures in 15 patients (55.5%), fractures of the posterior unossified part of the acetabulum in 4 patients (14.8%), and ligamentum teres injuries in 8 patients (29.6%). Among the 16 patients who had post-reduction CT scans, 6 (37.5%) had femoral head fractures, 9 (56.3%) had posterior wall fractures, and 8 (50%) had intra-articular osseous entrapments.

### Deep learning and conventional hip MRI for the detection of labral and cartilage abnormalities using arthroscopy as standard of reference [^112fyrw1]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

Overall specificity showed a small but significant decrease from CS to CSAI sequences (CS: 81% [95% CI: 78.6–84.2]; CSAI: 79% [95% CI: 76.4–82.2]; p < 0.001), and overall specificity across all femur zones was significantly lower in CSAI vs. CS (CS: 76% [95% CI: 72.4–79.4]; CSAI 73% [95% CI: 69.7–77.1]; p < 0.001). The highest specificity was in the assessment of the anteroinferior acetabular zone (both CS and CSAI: 99%). The lowest average specificity was observed in the assessment of the femoral weight-bearing zone (Zone C), with specificity significantly lower in CSAI compared to CS (CS: 47% [95% CI: 37.8–56.6]; CSAI: 37% [95% CI: 27.9–46.1]; p < 0.001).

- **Overall performance evaluation**: McNemar's test was used to compare sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy between CS and CSAI sequences. Statistically significant differences are indicated in the CSAI column. p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.001 (**) denote significant and highly significant differences, respectively.

- **Individual performance evaluation**: The performance of individual readers in detecting labral abnormalities and cartilage defects on MR imaging versus arthroscopy is summarized. All readers demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in assessing labral abnormalities, with values as high as 100% for both CS and CSAI. The expert orthopedic surgeon improved sensitivity for labral abnormalities from 81% with CS to 90% with CSAI; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08).

### Comparative reliability and diagnostic performance of conventional 3T magnetic resonance imaging and 1.5T magnetic resonance arthrography for the evaluation of internal derangement of the hip [^115YAipD]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

For the analysis of labral tears, only sensitivity values could be calculated, as all participants undergoing surgery had an abnormal labrum. The overall sensitivities for detecting labral tears for both readers were higher with conventional 3T MRI (98%) compared to 1.5T MRA (79–82%), but these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Both readers had identical detection rates for acetabular cartilage defects, with higher overall sensitivities using conventional 3T MRI (84%) versus 1.5T MRA (61%), and these differences were statistically significant (p = 0.02).

The results for cartilage delamination show that Reader 1 had a slightly higher sensitivity and specificity using 1.5T MRA, whereas Reader 2 had better sensitivity with conventional 3T MRI but a lower specificity. However, these results were not shown to be statistically significant (p = 0.66). Other parameters, such as femoral cartilage, ligamentum teres, and the transverse ligament, also showed variable sensitivities (9–100%) and high specificities (> 89–100%), but in areas with a very low incidence of abnormality, the figures were not statistically significant.

- **Comparison of diagnostic accuracy between magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and 3T**:
	- *Statistically significant difference between MRA and 3T (p = 0.02)*
	- No MRI pathology was recorded in the anteroinferior (AI) and posteroinferior (PI) quadrants at MRA.
	- No MRI pathology was recorded in the PI quadrant at 3T.

### MRI for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^111QUZXK]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) refers to a condition characterized by the impingement of the femoral head-neck junction against the acetabular rim, often due to underlying osseous and/or soft tissue morphological abnormalities. It is a common cause of hip pain and limited range of motion in young and middle-aged adults. Hip preservation surgery aims to correct the morphological variants seen in FAI, thereby relieving pain, improving function, and potentially preventing early osteoarthritis.

The purpose of this article is to review the mechanisms of chondral and labral injury in FAI to facilitate an understanding of patterns of chondrolabral injury seen on MRI. Preoperative MRI evaluation of FAI should include an assessment of osseous morphologic abnormalities, labral tears, cartilage status, and other associated compensatory injuries of the pelvis. As advanced chondral wear is the major relative contraindication for hip preservation surgery, MRI is useful in selecting patients likely to benefit from surgery.

- **Teaching points**: The most common anatomical osseous abnormalities predisposing to FAI include cam and pincer lesions. Morphological abnormalities, labral lesions, and cartilage status should be assessed. In cam impingement, chondral wear most commonly occurs anterosuperiorly. Pre-existing advanced osteoarthritis is the strongest predictor of poor outcomes after FAI surgery. Injury to muscles and tendons or other pelvic structures can coexist with FAI.

### Acetabular labral tear is associated with high pelvic incidence with or without femoroacetabular impingement morphology [^116AhdbJ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Of 449 symptomatic hips that did not respond to conservative treatment, acetabular labral tears in 291 hips (64.8%) were confirmed by MRI or MRA. Among them, when only 308 hips without femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) were analyzed, acetabular labral tears were confirmed in 164 hips (53.2%). When the 141 hips with FAI were analyzed, acetabular labral tears were confirmed in 127 hips (90%). As in previous studies, FAI was confirmed to be a predisposing factor for acetabular labral tears due to its impinging on the anterior–superior portion of the labrum in bony deformity and abnormal articulation of FAI. Additionally, the proportion of bilateral symptoms in the labral tear group was high, with 38% compared to 3% in the non-labral tear group for all patients, and 34% compared to 1% in patients without FAI.

Pelvic incidence was greater in the labral tear group than in the non-labral tear group (52.3° ± 8.2° versus 47.1° ± 6.8°, p < 0.001). Additionally, there were significant differences in age, sacral slope, pelvic tilt, cam or pincer morphology of FAI, herniation synovial pit, and cartilage denudation between the labral tear group and the non-labral tear group. After accounting for potentially confounding variables like sex, BMI, FAI, cartilage denudation, and synovial herniation pit, we found that higher age, FAI, and high pelvic incidence were independently associated with acetabular labral tear.

### Editorial commentary: Hip imaging studies suggest significant pathology in asymptomatic individuals [^117EWk3P]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Hip imaging studies suggest significant pathology in asymptomatic individuals. We use the term "suggest" because if the patient is asymptomatic, perhaps reported findings should not be labeled pathologic. Hip imaging researchers may need to reconsider what represents an abnormal radiologic sign. While we introduce that knee and shoulder imaging is of greater diagnostic value, upon reflection, we realize that knee and shoulder imaging researchers may also need to reconsider what represents abnormal.

### Imaging the painful hip [^1149L717]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging and, subsequently, magnetic resonance arthrography, the imaging algorithm for hip pain has evolved considerably. Magnetic resonance imaging has supplanted bone scintigraphy as the first-line imaging test after conventional radiographs in the setting of suspected occult fracture, transient marrow edema, and osteonecrosis. Computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging are invaluable for the evaluation of monarticular arthropathies such as pigmented villonodular synovitis and synovial osteochondromatosis. By combining conventional magnetic resonance imaging with capsular distention afforded by arthrography, magnetic resonance arthrography has become the imaging examination of choice for disorders of the acetabular labrum and for the evaluation of articular cartilage at the hip.

### MRI for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^113xLoij]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

The superior soft tissue contrast of MRI allows for direct evaluation of the labrum and cartilage and can guide the selection of patients who will benefit from this surgery. MRI can be performed without or with the injection of intra-articular contrast and does not employ ionizing radiation, which is of critical importance in this young patient population. The purpose of this article is to outline the pathophysiology of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and to provide an approach for preoperative MRI evaluation.

### Editorial commentary: Small labral size on magnetic resonance imaging is an indication for labral reconstruction in the setting of revision hip arthroscopy [^111PvqCt]. Arthroscopy (2024). High credibility.

Revision hip arthroscopy is an increasingly common procedure as rates of primary hip arthroscopy rise. Etiologies for symptom recurrence may include residual femoroacetabular impingement, cam over-resection, labral pathology, chondral wear, adhesions, and instability. This has led to the development of sophisticated surgical techniques in hip arthroscopy, including labral reconstruction.

- **Indications for labral reconstruction**: In the revision setting, labral deficiency is an obvious indication. Additionally, in the absence of other clear reasons for the failure of the primary procedure, a labral reconstruction should be considered for diminutive labra.

The ability to predict labral size before surgery based on magnetic resonance imaging can be invaluable.

### Differentiating hip pathology from lumbar spine pathology: Key points of evaluation and management [^1124MX3s]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of patients with both hip and lumbar spine pathologies can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms, often delaying correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients with both conditions commonly report low back pain accompanied by buttock, groin, thigh, and possibly knee pain. To identify the primary source of pain, a thorough patient history should be obtained and a complete physical examination conducted. Plain and advanced imaging studies alongside diagnostic injections can further delineate the primary pathology and guide the appropriate treatment sequence.

Both the surgeon and the patient should be aware that even after managing one pathology, managing the other may be necessary if pain persists. Recognizing both conditions can help reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, and managing both in the correct sequence may minimize persistent symptoms.

### Diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities and injection techniques for the diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement/labral tear: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^1117SNaZ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosing femoroacetabular impingement/acetabular labral tear (FAI/ALT) and subsequently making decisions regarding surgery rely primarily on diagnostic imaging and intra-articular hip joint injection techniques of unknown accuracy.

- **Purpose**: Summarize and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of various imaging modalities and injection techniques relevant to hip FAI/ALT.

- **Study design**: Systematic review with meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: A computer-assisted literature search was conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases using keywords related to diagnostic accuracy of hip joint pathologic changes. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used for the search and reporting phases of the study. Quality assessment of bias and applicability was conducted using the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool. Random effects models were used to summarize sensitivities (SN), specificities (SP), likelihood ratios (+LR and -LR), diagnostic odds ratios (DOR), and respective confidence intervals (CI).

- **Results**: The search strategy and assessment for risk of bias revealed 25 articles scoring above 10/14 on the items of the QUADAS. Four studies investigated FAI; the data were not pooled. Twenty articles on ALT qualified for meta-analysis. The pretest probability of ALT in the studies in this review was 81% (72%-88%), while the pretest probability of FAI diagnosis was 74% (95% CI, 51%-91%). The meta-analysis showed that computed tomography arthrography (CTA) demonstrated the strongest o

### Normal anatomical variants of the labrum of the hip at magnetic resonance imaging: A systematic review [^111AQcrA]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the literature regarding normal labral variants at MRI.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase. Information regarding normal labral variants and findings in asymptomatic subjects was extracted from each included study.

- **Results**: There were 24 studies in symptomatic patients, evaluating 822 hips. The presence of a sublabral sulcus was reported by four studies in 41 hips (5% of all evaluated hips), occurring at all anatomical locations. There were three cadaver studies, investigating 32 hips and reporting no normal labral variants. Eight studies on asymptomatic subjects evaluated 1,096 hips. Labral tears were reported in 213 hips (19%); no sublabral sulci were reported. Labral shape was most commonly triangular (59–89%), whereas rounded (11–16%), flattened (13–37%), and teardrop (41%) shapes were less frequently seen. The overall methodological quality of included studies was moderate, with median total quality scores of 43% (symptomatic patients), 71% (cadavers), and 70% (asymptomatic subjects).

- **Conclusion**: At MRI, a sublabral sulcus can be found at any anatomical location. Our results suggest that its prevalence is at least 5% in symptomatic patients. The most common labral shape is triangular. Rounded, flattened, and teardrop shapes are less frequent but are also encountered in asymptomatic subjects.

- **Key points**
- A sublabral sulcus can be detected by MRI at any anatomical site.
- Its prevalence is estimated to be at least 5% in symptomatic patients.
- The most common shape of the hip labrum is triangular.

### Why do you focus on the acetabular labral tear? You can't see the forest for the trees [^115LXXQK]. Arthroscopy (2025). Low credibility.

The advent of higher-quality imaging has brought increased attention to the understanding and implications of commonly observed hip morphology and pathology. Many patients and even physicians like to focus on the presence of an acetabular labral tear when one is present on magnetic resonance imaging, despite the limitations of magnetic resonance imaging in identifying labral tears. Furthermore, recent studies have shown normal variations of the acetabular labrum, as well as a high prevalence of labral tears in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. For patients electing to undergo surgical treatment of a labral tear, addressing the underlying pathology is imperative. Ignoring the primary pathology (e.g. femoroacetabular impingement or hip dysplasia) risks the formation of a new labral tear after initial surgical management. This comprehensive approach ensures that the primary cause of the labral tear is treated, thereby reducing the likelihood of recurrence and improving patient outcomes.

Although the labrum is highly innervated, making labral tears a direct cause of hip pain in affected patients, we should not be setting our focus on the labral tear itself. Focusing solely on the labral pathology may set up our patients for failure by overlooking the underlying anatomic issues that precipitate these tears. Addressing the root cause, such as correcting femoroacetabular impingement and/or hip dysplasia, is crucial for effective treatment. By correcting these anatomic factors, we can prevent future labral damage and provide more comprehensive and lasting relief for patients.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for the detection of hip effusion and septic arthritis in adult patients with hip pain and negative initial imaging [^112PgwTN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Acute hip pain in adults can be a challenging presentation in the emergency department. While ultrasound is routinely used in the evaluation of pediatric patients with hip pain and a new limp, it is not commonly used for this purpose in adult emergency medicine. This case series demonstrates the clinical utility of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in adult patients with acute hip pain, as the performance of POCUS was the critical action that led to the identification of pathologic hip effusions in this series of adults.

- **Case series**: This case series includes five patients in whom clinical suspicion existed for the presence of a hip effusion and possible septic arthritis, despite nondiagnostic radiographic findings. Ultrasound was used to detect the effusion and guide subsequent arthrocentesis, imaging, or surgical intervention. In all patients, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans were later used to confirm the presence of effusion. In all five patients (two women and three men, with a mean age of 47.4 years), POCUS accurately detected the presence of hip effusion. Two of the five synovial collections were caused by septic arthritis as confirmed by synovial fluid microbiologic examination.

- **Clinical implication**: This case series emphasizes the clinical utility of POCUS in adult patients with acute hip pain to detect a hip effusion, particularly in patients with significant risk factors for septic arthritis. POCUS can also be used to guide further imaging, arthrocentesis, and surgical consultation.

### The diagnostic value of ultrasound in anterosuperior acetabular labral tear [^1148Kjat]. Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

To investigate the diagnostic value of ultrasound in acetabular labral tears compared with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, we used arthroscopic surgery as the gold standard in a relatively large sample size.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively evaluated patients who attended the sports medicine clinic of our department and underwent arthroscopic surgery for the diagnosis of an anterosuperior acetabular labral tear between June 2014 and April 2018. All the patients received a hip joint ultrasound examination and MR imaging evaluation before arthroscopic surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound and MR imaging were calculated and compared.

- **Results**: A total of 195 patients were enrolled in this study. Out of these, 184 had arthroscopically confirmed anterosuperior acetabular labral tear. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, and accuracy by ultrasound were, respectively, 68.5%, 81.8%, 98.4%, 13.4%, and 69.2%. For MR imaging, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, negative predictive value, and accuracy were 84.8%, 63.6%, 97.5%, 20.0%, and 83.6%, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Although ultrasound had a slightly lower sensitivity for detecting anterosuperior acetabular labral tear, it had a higher specificity and PPV than MR imaging. With the advantages of being inexpensive, relatively quick, noninvasive, and having dynamic evaluation, ultrasound could be used as a feasible method to evaluate anterosuperior acetabular labral tear.

- **Level of evidence**: Level IV, case series.

### Identification of acetabular labral pathological changes in asymptomatic volunteers using optimized, noncontrast 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging [^116tkUe7]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acetabular labral tears as a source of potential hip pain have received significant attention in recent literature. The gold standard for identifying acetabular labral tears is hip arthroscopy. However, recent advances in optimized, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have proven effective in identifying intra-articular hip pathological changes without the invasive nature of hip arthroscopy or gadolinium-enhanced arthrography. There is limited data in the literature on imaging results within an asymptomatic population.

The objective of this study was to use an optimized, noncontrast 1.5-T MRI protocol to identify hip abnormalities, including paralabral cysts, in asymptomatic volunteers.

In this study, 42 hips in asymptomatic patients with an average age of 34 years (range 27–43 years) were prospectively imaged using optimized, noncontrast 1.5-T MRI scans. Two fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists interpreted the scans at two different points in time and evaluated the presence of labral abnormalities, including paralabral cysts. The results were analyzed for both interobserver and intraobserver reliability.

Acetabular paralabral cysts were identified in 11 of 42 (26.2%) and 9 of 42 (21.4%) hips by the two respective radiologists, with an interobserver reliability of 90.5% (κ = .74) and intraobserver reliability of 95.2% (κ = .87). Additionally, acetabular labral tears were identified in 36 of 42 (85.7%) and 34 of 42 (80.9%) hips, demonstrating high reliability.

### Hip pain in adults: Evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113bw672]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Adults commonly present to their family physicians with hip pain, and diagnosing the cause is important for prescribing effective therapy. Hip pain is usually located anteriorly, laterally, or posteriorly. Anterior hip pain includes referred pain from intra-abdominal or intrapelvic causes; extra-articular etiologies, such as hip flexor injuries; and intra-articular etiologies. Intra-articular pain is often caused by a labral tear or femoroacetabular impingement in younger adults or osteoarthritis in older adults. Lateral hip pain is most commonly caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome, which includes gluteus medius tendinopathy or tear, bursitis, and iliotibial band friction. Posterior hip pain includes referred pain such as lumbar spinal pathology, deep gluteal syndrome with sciatic nerve entrapment, ischiofemoral impingement, and hamstring tendinopathy.

In addition to the history and physical examination, radiography, ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed for a definitive diagnosis. Radiography of the hip and pelvis should be the initial imaging test. Ultrasound-guided anesthetic injections can aid in the diagnosis of an intra-articular cause of pain. Because femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, and gluteus medius tendon tears typically have good surgical outcomes, advanced imaging and/or early referral may improve patient outcomes.

### Arthroscopy after traumatic hip dislocation: A systematic review of intra-articular findings, correlation with magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, treatments, and outcomes [^115VWjwu]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe the literature concerning patient demographic characteristics and intra-articular injury seen at arthroscopy after traumatic hip dislocation. It aims to describe the reported computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance findings with arthroscopic correlation, and to describe the reported arthroscopic treatments performed with complications and outcomes.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for assessment of arthroscopy after hip dislocation. Three databases were searched, and study screening and data abstraction were performed in duplicate.

- **Results**: Thirty-one heterogeneous case series and case reports were included in the analysis from the initial search yielding 780 results, including reports of 151 patients who underwent arthroscopy after traumatic hip dislocation. A wide spectrum of intra-articular injury was reported, with a high prevalence of labral tears, intra-articular bodies, ligamentum teres injuries, and chondral damage. CT had a sensitivity of 87.3% for detecting intra-articular fragments; however, 43.3% of patients who had a preoperative CT scan with negative findings for intra-articular fragments did show fragments at arthroscopy. Magnetic resonance had a sensitivity of 95.0% for detecting labral tears. There were no major complications directly attributed to arthroscopic surgery. A total of 75 of 151 patients were followed up for a median of 2 years after surgery, with osteoarthritis reported in 4.0% and avascular necrosis in 2.7%.

- **Conclusions**: The study provides a comprehensive overview of intra-articular findings and imaging correlations associated with traumatic hip dislocation.

### Magnetic resonance arthrography versus arthroscopy in the evaluation of articular hip pathology [^111YPSjz]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared magnetic resonance arthrography results with hip arthroscopy findings to assess the diagnostic value of this imaging technique in evaluating acetabular labral tears and other articular hip pathology. One hundred one consecutive patients (102 hips) with a clinical diagnosis of acetabular labral tear were assessed using magnetic resonance arthrography and subsequently underwent hip arthroscopy after failing to improve with nonoperative treatment.

Magnetic resonance arthrography detected 71 out of 93 (76%) acetabular labral tears in 92 patients, with five false-positive studies in five patients (4.9%). Articular cartilage findings diagnosed by magnetic resonance arthrography were confirmed by arthroscopy in 64 hips of 64 patients (62.7%).

- **Labral pathology**: Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 44%, positive predictive value of 93%, negative predictive value of 13%, and an accuracy of 69%.

- **Articular cartilage pathology**: Magnetic resonance arthrography had a sensitivity of 47%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 84%, negative predictive value of 59%, and an accuracy of 67%.

Although magnetic resonance arthrography is an excellent positive predictor in diagnosing acetabular labral tears and articular cartilage abnormalities, it has limited sensitivity. A negative imaging study does not exclude important intra-articular pathology that can be identified and treated arthroscopically.

### Deep learning and conventional hip MRI for the detection of labral and cartilage abnormalities using arthroscopy as standard of reference [^114sY9bJ]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Recent advancements in imaging technology, including deep learning algorithms and compressed sense sequences, have enhanced image quality and facilitated the identification of abnormalities by radiologists. For instance, Dratsch et al. demonstrated the efficacy of deep learning-enhanced MR imaging of the shoulder, indicating potential applications for other joints, such as the hip. Similarly, 3D MR imaging has been shown to improve the visualization of anatomical structures by providing isotropic resolution and high-quality multiplanar reconstructions. This capability is particularly beneficial for complex joints like the hip, where intricate spatial relationships are critical. Additionally, 3D MR imaging improves the detection of subtle labral and cartilage abnormalities. However, its clinical application is limited by motion artifacts, which remain a significant challenge.

Complementary imaging techniques, such as traction MR imaging and MR arthrography, are often employed for the preoperative evaluation of patients with FAIS. Schmaranzer et al. reported that readers achieved an accuracy of 92% in detecting femoroacetabular cartilage defects when interpreting traction MR images. MR arthrography has been shown to improve the detection of labral and cartilage abnormalities. However, a meta-analysis demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance between non-arthrographic MR imaging and MR arthrography, with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 59% and 94% for non-arthrographic MR imaging in detecting cartilage lesions, compared to 62% and 86% for MR arthrography.

### The prevalence of acetabular labral tears and associated pathology in a young asymptomatic population [^114MFrZ5]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Acetabular labral tears and associated intra-articular pathology of the hip have been recognized as a source of symptoms. However, it is now appreciated that there is a relatively high prevalence of asymptomatic labral tears. In this study, 70 young asymptomatic adult volunteers with a mean age of 26 years (19 to 41) were recruited and underwent three-tesla non-arthrographic MR scans. There were 47 women (67.1%) and 23 men (32.9%). Labral tears were found in 27 volunteers (38.6%); these were an isolated finding in 16 (22.9%) and were associated with other intra-articular pathology in the remaining 11 (15.7%) volunteers. Furthermore, five (7.1%) had intra-articular pathology without an associated labral tear. Given the high prevalence of labral pathology in the asymptomatic population, it is important to confirm that a patient's symptoms are due to the demonstrated abnormalities when considering surgery.

### Magnetic resonance arthrography of the hip: Technique and spectrum of findings in younger patients [^112joLsZ]. Insights into Imaging (2010). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the reference imaging technique for evaluating hip abnormalities. However, in some pathological conditions — such as lesions of the labrum, cartilaginous lesions, femoroacetabular impingement, intra-articular foreign bodies, or in the pre-operative work-up of developmental dysplasia of the hip — intra-articular injection of a contrast medium is required to obtain a precise diagnosis. This article reviews the technical aspects, contraindications, normal appearance, and potential pitfalls of MR arthrography, and illustrates the radiological appearance of commonly encountered conditions.

### Evaluation of the patient with hip pain [^115JTzsG]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Hip pain is a common and disabling condition that affects patients of all ages. The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad, presenting a diagnostic challenge. Patients often express that their hip pain is localized to one of three anatomic regions: the anterior hip and groin, the posterior hip and buttock, or the lateral hip. Anterior hip and groin pain is commonly associated with intra-articular pathology, such as osteoarthritis and hip labral tears. Posterior hip pain is associated with piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, lumbar radiculopathy, and less commonly, ischiofemoral impingement and vascular claudication. Lateral hip pain occurs with greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

Clinical examination tests, although helpful, are not highly sensitive or specific for most diagnoses; however, a rational approach to the hip examination can be used. Radiography should be performed if acute fractures, dislocations, or stress fractures are suspected. Initial plain radiography of the hip should include an anteroposterior view of the pelvis and a frog-leg lateral view of the symptomatic hip. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed if the history and plain radiograph results are not diagnostic. MRI is valuable for the detection of occult traumatic fractures, stress fractures, and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Magnetic resonance arthrography is the diagnostic test of choice for labral tears.

### Pathogenesis and contemporary diagnoses for lateral hip pain: A scoping review [^1151Yrr2]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

A scoping review was conducted to identify relevant studies. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, covering articles from inception to June 30, 2020, using various keywords. Studies that reported on the anatomy and diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome, trochanteric bursitis, gluteus medius tears, and external snapping hip syndrome (ESHS) were included for analysis. Additionally, studies focusing solely on the anatomy and diagnosis of lateral hip pain were included. However, narrative reviews, case reports, and studies focusing on treatment or outcomes were excluded from the analysis.

### Evaluating hip labral tears using magnetic resonance arthrography: a prospective study comparing hip arthroscopy and magnetic resonance arthrography diagnosis [^116Q3trB]. Arthroscopy (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) with true sagittal scout image mapped radial reformation in localizing hip labral tears, a case series was conducted. Thirty patients with suspected labral tears underwent hip MRA. Each patient received normal hip arthrography and MR examinations using a 1.5-T scanner with a 3D-FLASH pulse sequence. Radial reformatted rotation images with 10-degree increments on the acetabular rim were produced using multiplanar reformation and a double oblique technique. Labral tears were identified in the anterior-superior (AS), anterior-inferior (AI), posterior-superior (PS), and posterior-inferior (PI) quadrants based on the cranial-caudal axis in the true sagittal reformatted scout localizing image. Patients with positive MRA findings were advised to undergo arthroscopic hip procedures.

Results indicated that five patients showed no MRA indication of a labral tear. Of the 25 patients with MRA evidence of labral tears, 17 underwent arthroscopic hip surgery. One patient revealed only a synovial process near the suspected MRA area, while the remaining 16 operated patients had labral tears with a total of 21 quadrant lesions observed during arthroscopy (distributed as AS, 14; AI, 3; PS, 2; and PI, 2). Radial reformatted images accurately mapped to arthroscopic findings in 21 of the 22 quadrant lesions. The sensitivity and accuracy of MRA for diagnosing hip labral tears were 100% and 94%, respectively.

### Comparative reliability and diagnostic performance of conventional 3T magnetic resonance imaging and 1.5T magnetic resonance arthrography for the evaluation of internal derangement of the hip [^117Dk5UG]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

A total of 68 participants underwent imaging with both 1.5T MRA and 3T MRI, with a median age of 32 years (interquartile range (IQR) 25.5–40.5) and 56% were female. From this group, 39 participants underwent surgery, with a median age of 34 years (IQR 25–40) and 59% were female. The results were used to compare the diagnostic accuracy between 1.5T MRA and 3T MRI.

The HOOS questionnaire scores of symptomatic patients proceeding to surgery and those treated non-surgically showed a statistically significant difference, with patients proceeding to surgery having higher HOOS pain, activity, recreation (and sport), and symptom scores (p < 0.05). The MMH questionnaires showed no significant difference between the two groups.

At surgery, partial labrum tears were observed in nine individuals (23%), and full thickness tears in 30 (77%). Twelve (31%) patients were found to have cartilage delamination and a total of 38 (97%) patients had acetabular cartilage defects. In addition, one ligamentum teres tear and 14 femoral head bump morphologies were recorded. No transverse ligament tears were present. The majority of acetabular pathology scored at surgery involved the anterosuperior quadrant, with no abnormality scored in the antero- or posteroinferior quadrants. In all cases where pathology was scored in the posterosuperior quadrant, the same pathology was also scored in the anterosuperior quadrant.

### Hip pain in adults: MR imaging appearance of common causes [^113HSVg7]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Determining the exact origin of hip pain can be challenging. Symptoms that seem to originate from the hip may actually arise from areas such as the pelvis, sacroiliac joint, lumbar spine, or periarticular structures like muscles and bursae. Additionally, unexpected sites such as the abdominal wall, genitourinary tract, or retroperitoneal space can also be sources of hip pain. This article reviews the differential diagnosis of hip pain originating from the hip and surrounding structures, emphasizing the role of various imaging methods, with a focus on magnetic resonance imaging where the most recent advances have occurred.

### MRI for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^113qUi1E]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) refers to a condition characterized by impingement of the femoral head–neck junction against the acetabular rim, often due to underlying osseous and/or soft tissue morphological abnormalities. It is a common cause of hip pain and limited range of motion in young and middle-aged adults. Hip preservation surgery aims to correct the morphological variants seen in FAI, thereby relieving pain, improving function, and potentially preventing early osteoarthritis. This article reviews the mechanisms of chondral and labral injury in FAI to facilitate an understanding of patterns of chondrolabral injury seen on MRI. Preoperative MRI evaluation of FAI should include assessment of osseous morphologic abnormalities, labral tears, cartilage status, and other associated compensatory injuries of the pelvis. As advanced chondral wear is the major relative contraindication for hip preservation surgery, MRI is useful in selecting patients likely to benefit from surgery.

- **Teaching points**:
	- The most common anatomical osseous abnormalities predisposing to FAI include cam and pincer lesions.
	- Morphological abnormalities, labral lesions, and cartilage status should be assessed.
	- In cam impingement, chondral wear most commonly occurs anterosuperiorly.
	- Pre-existing advanced osteoarthritis is the strongest predictor of poor outcomes after FAI surgery.
	- Injury to muscles, tendons, or other pelvic structures can coexist with FAI.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in symptomatic children with hereditary multiple exostoses of the hip [^113PBAVq]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2018). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in evaluating nontraumatic hip pain, as it provides information about associated injuries like labral/chondral tears or ischiofemoral impingement (IFI). However, in hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), there has been no report about MRI findings in symptomatic children with hip involvement.

- **Methods**: Records of children with HME and hip osteochondromas, who had hip MRI/magnetic resonance arthrography, were reviewed. The presence of chondral lesions and labral tears, as well as the presence of IFI, was recorded. IFI was defined as edema or fatty replacement/atrophy in the quadratus femoris muscle or decrease of the space for this muscle between the ischium and the proximal femur. The measurements used to determine the space included the ischiofemoral space, the quadratus femoris space, and the minimum ischiofemoral space (MIFS). All measurements were performed on axial T1-weighted images.

- **Results**: Ten children were included (4 males, 6 females). In 2 patients, MRI was unilateral, therefore a total of 18 hips were analyzed. The indication for MRI was hip pain. The mean age, when MRI was performed, was 11.7 years. Labral tears were found in 44% (8/18) and chondral lesions in 33% (6/18) of the hips. The mean ischiofemoral space was 17.2 mm (SD, 7.3), the mean quadratus femoris space was 14.9 mm (SD, 5.3), and the mean MIFS was 12.8 mm (SD, 5.9). IFI was seen in 44% (8/18) of hips, with two patients having bilateral IFI. MIFS was < 10 mm in all hips with IFI (8/8). Of these hips, 88% (7/8) had edema of the quadratus femoris muscle and 38% had further complications.

### Differential diagnosis of pain around the hip joint [^117HR4ca]. Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of hip pain is broad and includes intra-articular pathology, extra-articular pathology, and mimickers, including the joints of the pelvic ring. With the advancements in hip arthroscopy, more patients are being evaluated for hip pain. In recent years, our understanding of the functional anatomy around the hip has improved. In addition, because of advancements in magnetic resonance imaging, the diagnosis of soft tissue causes of hip pain has improved. All of these advances have broadened the differential diagnosis of pain around the hip joint and improved the treatment of these problems.

In this review, we discuss the causes of intra-articular hip pain that can be addressed arthroscopically: labral tears, loose bodies, femoroacetabular impingement, capsular laxity, tears of the ligamentum teres, and chondral damage. Extra-articular diagnoses that can be managed arthroscopically are also discussed, including iliopsoas tendonitis, "internal" snapping hip, "external" snapping hip, iliotibial band and greater trochanteric bursitis, and gluteal tendon injury.

Finally, we discuss extra-articular causes of hip pain that are often managed nonoperatively or in an open fashion: femoral neck stress fracture, adductor strain, piriformis syndrome, sacroiliac joint pain, athletic pubalgia, "sports hernia", "Gilmore's groin", and osteitis pubis.

### MRI for the preoperative evaluation of femoroacetabular impingement [^116QQSwX]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Variable accuracy has been reported for non-contrast MRI regarding the detection of labral tears, depending on the magnetic field strength, slice thickness, and field of view. Three studies using high-resolution MRI at 1.5T and a small field of view demonstrated a sensitivity of 77–97% for detecting labral tears compared with a surgical reference standard.

Direct MR arthrography involves the intra-articular injection of diluted gadolinium contrast into the hip joint, benefiting from joint distention and an improved contrast-to-noise ratio. A recent review of 19 studies evaluating MR arthrography demonstrated a sensitivity of 69–100% for detecting labral tears with a surgical reference standard, with 12 of these studies showing sensitivity greater than 90%.

A meta-analysis found that MR arthrography had higher sensitivity but lower specificity than conventional MRI for detecting labral tears. For the evaluation of chondral lesions, MRI has shown higher diagnostic accuracy. Another meta-analysis demonstrated pooled sensitivity and specificity of 59% and 94% for MRI compared to 62% and 86% for MR arthrography. MR arthrography has the disadvantage of being more time-consuming and invasive, with some patients experiencing post-procedural pain. The choice between conventional MRI and MRA will vary by institution and will depend on the ability to optimize the MRI scanning protocol with each technique.

At the authors' institution, MRI of the hip is performed using a cardiac or small body coil on a 1.5T or 3.0T scanner.
