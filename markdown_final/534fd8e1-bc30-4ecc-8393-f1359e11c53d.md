## Question

Labetalol good starting Iv dose for patient with bp 200/100. 10 mg?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an appropriate starting IV labetalol dose is for an adult with severe hypertension at BP 200/100 mmHg, specifically whether 10 mg is appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how severe hypertension is managed acutely and what the immediate BP reduction strategy should be. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled IV labetalol dosing and onset, including whether 20 mg is the standard initial bolus. Next, I will check alternative SPL entries or clinical scenarios that suggest 10 mg could be used and in whom. After that, I need to confirm administration details, infusion options, and monitoring requirements. Finally, I will review safety, contraindications, and provide a clear recommendation with exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and immediate goals of therapy in severe hypertension at 200/100 mmHg; this level warrants urgent, controlled reduction with close monitoring while avoiding rapid or excessive BP falls that could precipitate cerebral, coronary, or renal ischemia, and the labetalol labeling repeatedly emphasizes avoiding precipitous drops and monitoring supine BP during and after IV dosing. I should confirm that the intent here is BP control in a monitored setting with cautious titration rather than normalization in minutes, which aligns with label cautions to reduce BP judiciously rather than abruptly.

> I need to verify the indication and setting for IV labetalol; the FDA labeling indicates labetalol injection is indicated for control of BP in severe hypertension and is intended for IV use in hospitalized patients with individualized dosing based on response. I should confirm we keep the patient supine during administration and for a period after dosing to reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, which the label explicitly instructs.

> Next, I should review the primary FDA-labeled bolus dosing and kinetics; the standard initial dose is 20 mg IV given over 2 minutes, with subsequent 40–80 mg doses at 10-minute intervals as needed to a usual maximum total dose of 300 mg per day, and this 20 mg corresponds to 0.25 mg/kg for an 80 kg adult with onset of effect generally within 5 minutes. Wait, let me verify monitoring details; the SPL specifies measuring supine BP immediately before, and then at 5 and 10 minutes after each injection to titrate safely, and to maintain supine positioning during and up to several hours after IV dosing.

> Hold on, I should check for alternative SPL or scenario-based dosing ranges that start lower; some FDA SPL entries list a 10–20 mg IV bolus over about 1 minute as an acceptable loading range with options to repeat or begin a controlled infusion, indicating there is some flexibility depending on patient factors and clinical context. This means a 10 mg starting dose appears in certain labeled sources, but I need to ensure when that is appropriate and when 20 mg remains preferable.

> Now, I will examine efficacy expectations at low versus standard starting doses; in pharmacologic studies and labeled clinical use, an initial 0.25 mg/kg dose, which is 20 mg in an 80 kg adult, produced an average BP reduction of about 11/7 mmHg within 5 minutes, supporting 20 mg as a pragmatic starting point to achieve a predictable early decrement at 200/100 mmHg. At first glance, I thought a 10 mg dose might be adequate because some SPLs list 10–20 mg as a loading range; wait, that would likely yield a smaller and potentially subtherapeutic initial response in severe hypertension at this level, and the dominant FDA dosing language and clinical pharmacology support 20 mg as the standard initial bolus with subsequent titration.

> But wait, what if the patient is in a clinical subgroup where lower bolus dosing is safer or customary; for acute ischemic stroke before thrombolysis, the labeled recommendation is 10–20 mg IV over 2 minutes and may repeat once, and after alteplase a cautious bolus followed by a low-rate infusion is used, reflecting cerebrovascular vulnerability and the need to avoid abrupt BP drops. I should also review pregnancy and postpartum guidance; for severe hypertension in pregnancy, multiple authoritative sources endorse IV labetalol and often start at 20 mg with stepwise escalation, although some SPLs allow a 10–20 mg range, and major society guidance supports labetalol as a first-line agent in preeclampsia/eclampsia crises. In frail, elderly, or very low body weight adults, a lower initial bolus such as 10 mg may be reasonable as a cautious approach with tight monitoring, even though 20 mg remains the usual standard in most adults with severe hypertension.

> I will now examine administration mechanics and monitoring; each bolus should be given slowly over 2 minutes with the patient kept supine, and supine BP should be checked immediately pre-dose and at 5 and 10 minutes post-dose to guide further increments. If sustained control is needed, a continuous infusion can be used either at a fixed rate such as 1–2 mg/min with labeled dilution and pump guidance or via weight-based rates like 0.4–1 mg/kg/h in certain SPLs, and pregnancy-specific protocols also allow 1–2 mg/min infusions to a total daily maximum of 300 mg. Let me double-check dilution and pump guidance; the label provides explicit dilution recipes yielding approximately 1–2 mg/mL with recommended pump rates to deliver 2 mg/min, which should be titrated to response.

> I should quantify the expected early BP change to set clinical expectations; a 20 mg bolus typically lowers BP by around 11/7 mmHg within about 5 minutes in severe hypertension, so from 200/100 mmHg one might expect roughly 189/93 mmHg after the first dose, with additional 40–80 mg boluses titrated toward the desired range while avoiding excessive early reductions. Hold on, I should verify target-setting guidance; while practice commonly aims for controlled reduction over hours rather than rapid normalization, the labeling repeatedly warns against rapid or excessive BP falls and emphasizes careful titration and monitoring rather than rigid numeric targets in the first hour, so my plan should prioritize gradual, observed dose-response rather than fixed decrements.

> Next, I should review safety, contraindications, and interactions; I need to exercise caution in patients with bradycardia or conduction disease, decompensated heart failure, bronchospastic disease where beta-blockade may blunt bronchodilator response, diabetes where hypoglycemia warning signs may be masked, and hepatic injury risk given rare hepatocellular injury, and to be alert to paradoxical responses in pheochromocytoma. I also need to consider drug and procedural interactions, including synergism with halothane anesthesia and interactions with tricyclic antidepressants and beta-agonists, and I should avoid abrupt withdrawal of chronic beta blockers around surgery. Let me reconsider monitoring posture and ambulation; patients should remain supine during and for up to several hours after IV dosing and be observed at first ambulation due to orthostatic hypotension risk.

> Putting this together, I should state the clear answer; for an adult with severe hypertension at 200/100 mmHg, the appropriate evidence-based starting IV labetalol dose is 20 mg administered over 2 minutes with supine monitoring, not 10 mg, with subsequent 40–80 mg boluses at 10-minute intervals as needed to a usual total maximum of 300 mg per day. Exceptions where a 10 mg initial bolus may be considered include acute ischemic stroke settings where 10–20 mg is recommended prior to thrombolysis, very low body weight or frail patients where a cautious test dose is prudent, and certain pregnancy protocols that allow a 10–20 mg range even though many obstetric protocols start at 20 mg, all with close hemodynamic monitoring and readiness to titrate. If ongoing control is required, a carefully titrated infusion (for example 1–2 mg/min or 0.4–1 mg/kg/h depending on the protocol) can be used with label-directed dilution and pump delivery, transitioning to oral therapy once stable.

No, **10 mg IV labetalol** is not the recommended starting dose for a patient with BP 200/100 mm Hg. The recommended initial IV bolus is **20 mg over 2 minutes** [^113PN74W], with additional 40–80 mg doses every 10 minutes as needed, up to 300 mg total [^116Vgtiw]. A 10 mg dose is **subtherapeutic** and may not achieve adequate BP reduction [^notfound]. Monitor **BP and heart rate** closely [^114dF8sA], and titrate dosing to avoid hypotension or bradycardia [^1125GVAS].

---

## Recommended intravenous labetalol dosing

According to FDA labeling, the recommended initial IV labetalol dose for severe hypertension is **20 mg administered over 2 minutes** [^113PN74W]. If BP reduction is inadequate, additional 40 mg or 80 mg doses may be given at 10-minute intervals [^116Vgtiw], up to a cumulative total of 300 mg [^113PN74W].

| **Dose** | **Administration** | **Interval** | **Maximum cumulative dose** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 20 mg IV bolus | Over 2 minutes | ∅ |
| Subsequent doses | 40–80 mg IV bolus | Every 10 minutes as needed | 300 mg |

---

Alternatively, labetalol may be administered as a **continuous IV infusion**, starting at 2 mg/min [^111KG83V] and titrated to the desired BP reduction, with a maximum cumulative dose of 300 mg [^113PN74W].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended dosing

Clinical pharmacologic studies show that an initial intravenous bolus of **labetalol 20 mg** effectively reduces BP in patients with severe hypertension [^114d9gfG]. Additional 40 mg or 80 mg doses at 10-minute intervals further reduce BP, with maximal effect typically within 5 minutes of each injection [^113PN74W]. A 10 mg IV bolus is **not commonly recommended** [^116Vgtiw] or studied [^114VwAX1] for initial management of severe hypertension because such a low dose may be insufficient, potentially delaying treatment and increasing the risk of complications.

---

## Risks and benefits of different initial dosing strategies

### 10 mg IV bolus dose

A 10 mg IV bolus offers **benefits** such as a lower risk of hypotension or bradycardia [^1125GVAS] and potential suitability for frail patients or those with significant comorbidities; however, **risks** include insufficient BP reduction, treatment delays, and a higher risk of complications from uncontrolled hypertension.

---

### 20 mg IV bolus dose (recommended)

A 20 mg IV bolus (recommended) provides **benefits** of effective BP reduction, rapid onset [^114d9gfG], and a well-established safety profile; the **risks** include potential hypotension or bradycardia, particularly in sensitive patients [^1125GVAS].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing decisions

Several **patient-specific factors** should be considered when determining the appropriate initial IV labetalol dose:

- **Age**: Elderly patients may be more sensitive to labetalol and may require lower initial doses.
- **Comorbidities**: Patients with heart failure, bradycardia, or hepatic impairment may require dose adjustments and careful monitoring [^1125GVAS].
- **Concurrent medications**: Medications such as digoxin, nitroglycerin, or other antihypertensives may interact with labetalol, necessitating dose adjustments and close monitoring [^1125GVAS] [^1148tm5D].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of labetalol therapy

During IV labetalol administration, **continuous BP and heart rate monitoring** is essential [^114dF8sA]. Avoid rapid or excessive BP drops and adjust dosing accordingly [^114kf7Vw]. If hypotension or bradycardia occurs, temporarily discontinue labetalol or reduce the dose [^113PN74W].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations consistently support an initial IV labetalol dose of **20 mg** [^113PN74W] for severe hypertension [^114VwAX1], with subsequent 40–80 mg doses as needed [^116Vgtiw]. A 10 mg initial dose is not recommended or supported by clinical evidence [^114d9gfG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The recommended initial IV labetalol dose for a patient with BP 200/100 mm Hg is **20 mg administered over 2 minutes** [^113PN74W], with subsequent 40–80 mg doses as needed [^116Vgtiw]. A 10 mg initial dose is generally insufficient and not recommended for severe hypertension [^114VwAX1].

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^114dF8sA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure monitoring is crucial during and after the completion of infusion or intravenous injections. It is important to avoid rapid or excessive falls in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure during intravenous treatment. In patients with excessive systolic hypertension, the decrease in systolic pressure serves as an indicator of effectiveness in addition to the response of the diastolic pressure.

- **Initiation of dosing with labetalol hydrochloride tablets**: Subsequent oral dosing with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should begin when it is established that the supine diastolic blood pressure has started to rise. The recommended initial dose is 200 mg, followed by an additional dose of 200 or 400 mg in 6 to 12 hours, depending on the blood pressure response. Thereafter, inpatient titration with labetalol hydrochloride tablets may proceed as follows:
	- If needed, the total daily dose may be given in three divided doses.
	- While in the hospital, the dosage of labetalol hydrochloride tablets may be increased at 1-day intervals to achieve the desired blood pressure reduction.
	- For subsequent outpatient titration or maintenance dosing, refer to labetalol hydrochloride tablets product information in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for additional recommendations.

- **Compatibility with commonly used intravenous fluids**: Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration, whenever the solution and container permit. Labetalol hydrochloride injection was tested for compatibility with common intravenous fluids.

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^113PN74W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Labetalol hydrochloride injection is intended for intravenous use in hospitalized patients. Dosage must be individualized depending upon the severity of hypertension and the response of the patient during dosing. Patients should always be kept in a supine position during the period of intravenous drug administration. A substantial fall in blood pressure on standing should be expected in these patients. It is important to establish the patient's ability to tolerate an upright position before permitting any ambulation, such as using toilet facilities.

- **Methods of administration**: Either of two methods of administration of labetalol hydrochloride injection may be used: repeated intravenous injections or slow continuous infusion.

	- **Repeated intravenous injection**: Initially, labetalol hydrochloride injection should be given in a dose of 20 mg labetalol HCl (which corresponds to 0.25 mg/kg for an 80 kg patient) by slow intravenous injection over a 2-minute period. Supine blood pressure should be measured immediately before the injection and at 5 and 10 minutes after injection to evaluate the response. Additional injections of 40 mg or 80 mg can be given at 10-minute intervals until a desired supine blood pressure is achieved or a total of 300 mg labetalol HCl has been injected. The maximum effect usually occurs within 5 minutes of each injection.

	- **Slow continuous infusion**: Labetalol hydrochloride injection is prepared for continuous intravenous infusion by diluting the contents with commonly used intravenous fluids.

### Short-acting oral nifedipine versus intravenous labetalol for the control of severe hypertension in the postpartum period: A retrospective cohort study [^112sPQ6D]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of oral short-acting (SA) nifedipine with intravenous (IV) labetalol for the treatment of postpartum (PP) severe hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women who delivered at a tertiary care facility between January and December 2018, had not previously received antihypertensive medication, and required treatment for PP severe hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 110 mm Hg. Exposure groups were defined by the receipt of either oral SA nifedipine or IV labetalol.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was the time (in minutes) to BP control (SBP < 160 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg).
- **Secondary outcomes**: These included the number of doses required to achieve BP control, crossover to the alternative medication, and recurrence of severe BP after achieving BP control. T-tests and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze continuous variables, while chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. Multivariable linear regression models were conducted for the primary outcome, controlling for potential confounders in a sequential fashion across three models. A Kaplan-Meier plot was also created.

Of the 99 women included, 74 received oral SA nifedipine and 25 received IV labetalol. There was no significant difference in minutes to initial BP control between groups (30.5 minutes [interquartile range, IQR: 20.0–45.0] vs. 25.0 minutes [IQR: 14.0–50.0]; p = 0.82) or in the rate of severe BP recurrence. However, patients who received nifedipine required fewer doses overall.

The dosage of labetalol hydrochloride IV for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies in adults is as follows:

- **Loading**: 0.4–1 mg/kg/h IV continuous infusion, repeated every 4–6 hours if necessary
- **Maximum**: 300 mg per day

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^111KG83V]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The contents of either two 20 mL vials (40 mL) or one 40 mL vial are added to 160 mL of a commonly used intravenous fluid so that the resultant 200 mL solution contains 200 mg of labetalol hydrochloride, 1 mg/mL. The diluted solution should be administered at a rate of 2 mL/min to deliver 2 mg/min.

Alternatively, the contents of either two 20 mL vials (40 mL) or one 40 mL vial of labetalol hydrochloride injection are added to 250 mL of a commonly used intravenous fluid. The resultant solution will contain 200 mg of labetalol hydrochloride, approximately 2 mg/3 mL. The diluted solution should be administered at a rate of 3 mL/min to deliver approximately 2 mg/min.

The rate of infusion of the diluted solution may be adjusted according to the blood pressure response, at the discretion of the physician. To facilitate a desired rate of infusion, the diluted solution can be infused using a controlled administration mechanism, e.g. a graduated burette or mechanically driven infusion pump.

Since the half-life of labetalol is 5 to 8 hours, steady-state blood levels (in the face of a constant rate of infusion) would not be reached during the usual infusion time period. The infusion should be continued until a satisfactory response is obtained and should then be stopped to start oral labetalol hydrochloride. The effective intravenous dose is usually in the range of 50 to 200 mg. A total dose of up to 300 mg may be required in some patients.

### Thalitone [^116fY1pB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

- **Dosage and administration**: Initiate therapy with the lowest possible dose, then titrate according to individual patient response.

- **Hypertension**: The initial recommended dose is 15 mg daily with food. If additional blood pressure reduction is needed, increase the dose to 25 mg.

- **Edema**: Recommended initial dose is 50 mg to 100 mg daily or 100 mg on alternate days. Depending on response, dosage can be decreased or increased up to a maximum of 200 mg daily.

- **General considerations**: Thalitone cannot be substituted with other formulations of chlorthalidone. Therapy should be initiated with the lowest possible dose and then titrated according to individual patient response.

- **Hypertension**: The initial recommended dose is 15 mg once daily with food. After 2 weeks, the dosage may be increased to a single daily dose of 25 mg if additional blood pressure reduction is needed. Doses above 25 mg are not expected to result in increased blood pressure reduction.

- **Edema**: The recommended initial dosage is 50 to 100 mg daily or 100 mg on alternate days. Depending on the response, the dosage can be decreased or increased up to a maximum of 200 mg daily.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^116LNqtc]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypertension in pregnancy is defined by a systolic blood pressure of at least 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mm Hg. Either of these clinical signs is considered an obstetric emergency for both mother and fetus; therefore, urgent antihypertensive treatment is recommended. Management of severe hypertension primarily aims to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.

There is no consensus on the relative efficacy and safety of the medications to treat severe hypertension in pregnancy. The most recent Cochrane review found insufficient data to recommend a specific drug, concluding that the choice of antihypertensive should be guided by clinicians' experience and familiarity with the drug, known adverse effects, and women's experiences.

Clinical trials have typically evaluated medications that are administered intravenously (such as hydralazine or labetalol). Although these regimens are effective in lowering blood pressure, they require intravenous access, have the potential to reduce blood pressure precipitously, and require careful fetal monitoring. However, oral medications can be provided in several healthcare settings, do not require cold storage, do not require special equipment, and can be administered without a provider trained in intravenous drug administration. They are available in most low-income and middle-income countries.

Three oral antihypertensive drugs (nifedipine [a calcium-channel blocker], labetalol [a combined α blocker and β blocker], and methyldopa [a CNS α agonist]) have been used extensively in pregnancy and have shown a low incidence of adverse effects.

### Initial angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/calcium channel blocker combination therapy achieves superior blood pressure control compared with calcium channel blocker monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension [^116oPjqk]. American Journal of Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends initial combination therapy for patients whose blood pressure (BP) is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy versus that of monotherapy in patients with stage 2 hypertension, who by definition meet the JNC 7 recommendation for initial combination antihypertensive therapy.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, double-blind, 12-week study randomized 364 patients with stage 2 hypertension to fixed-dose combination therapy with amlodipine besylate/benazepril HCl (5/20 mg/d titrated to 10/20 mg/d) or amlodipine besylate monotherapy (5 mg/d titrated to 10 mg/d).

- **Results**: Significantly more patients randomized to combination therapy (74.2%) compared with those randomized to monotherapy (53.9%) achieved target blood pressure reductions (P ≤ .001). For patients with baseline systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, combination therapy was particularly effective, with significantly greater reductions in systolic BP compared with monotherapy (-42.3 vs. -30.4 mm Hg; p = 0.001). More than 90% of patients in each group were titrated to the higher dose. Both treatments were well tolerated.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: An open-label, randomised controlled trial [^11542Gtd]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Between April 1, 2015, and August 21, 2017, 2307 women were screened at the two study sites for inclusion in the study. We excluded 1413 (61%) women who were ineligible, declined to participate, had impending eclampsia, were in active labour, or had a combination of these factors. Women with impending eclampsia or in active labour were excluded by enrolling providers because they required immediate delivery, and it was therefore assumed that they would not complete the 6-hour study period.

A total of 894 (39%) women were randomly assigned to a treatment group and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 298 (33%) women received nifedipine, 295 (33%) women received labetalol, and 301 (33%) women received methyldopa. Of those randomised, three (1%) women in the nifedipine group, one (< 1%) woman in the labetalol group, and three (1%) women in the methyldopa group only had one qualifying blood pressure measurement, specifically, a systolic blood pressure measurement of ≥ 160 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure measurement of ≥ 110 mm Hg at the time of enrolment, rendering them ineligible for treatment.

Eight (3%) women in the nifedipine group, nine (3%) women in the labetalol group, and eight (3%) women in the methyldopa group stopped treatment before the end of the study period (6 hours) due to delivery or transfer to another facility. For these women, we used the last blood pressure recorded before transfer or delivery for the primary outcome analysis. We were missing data on the mode or outcome of delivery for 14 women.

### β-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension [^1138YWP5]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

Are β-blockers associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events when used as initial treatment in individuals with hypertension compared with placebo, no treatment, or other drugs?

Initial therapy of hypertension with β-blockers is not associated with reduced all-cause mortality but is associated with modest reductions in cardiovascular events compared with placebo or no treatment. Calcium channel blockers and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are associated with greater reductions in cardiovascular event rates than β-blockers. This evidence derives from trials of traditional β-blockers (e.g. atenolol and propranolol) because there are currently no mortality and cardiovascular event data on the new vasodilating β-blockers (e.g. carvedilol and nebivolol).

### A comparison of nicardipine and labetalol for acute hypertension management following stroke [^115MYYpo]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ease of use and tolerability of labetalol and nicardipine for hypertension management in patients with acute stroke.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, non-randomized study involved consecutive adults within 24 hours of hospital admission who received intravenous bolus labetalol or nicardipine infusion as first-line antihypertensive therapy. Hemodynamic data were collected through 24 hours of therapy.

- **Results**: Ninety patients received either labetalol (N = 64) or nicardipine (N = 26) initially for blood pressure management. Stroke types were 54% intracerebral hemorrhage, 22% subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 23% ischemic stroke, and were similar between the two drug groups. Baseline patient characteristics and disease severity (APACHE II and GCS) were similar between groups. The average total daily labetalol dose was 40 (10–340) mg, and nicardipine infusion was 5 (1–14) mg/h. Initial blood pressure was similar in the two groups. The nicardipine group had less blood pressure variability (N 8.19 vs. L 10.78 mmHg; p = 0.003), fewer dosage adjustments [L 4 (1–17), N 2 (0–5); p < 0.001], and fewer additional antihypertensive agents (L 33%, N 8%; p = 0.013) administered during the 24-hour observation period. In patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, 33% of nicardipine-treated patients achieved target blood pressure within the first 60 minutes versus 6% of the labetalol group (p = 0.02). Overall, the incidence of hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) (L 3%; N 0%) and bradycardia (HR < 60 beats per min) (L 20.6%; N 12%) were comparable between the groups.

- **Conclusions**: Nicardipine offers an alternative to labetalol with similar tolerability for the management of acute hypertension following stroke.

### Diovan [^114AMwYo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adult hypertension**: The recommended starting dose of Diovan is 80 mg or 160 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not volume-depleted. Patients requiring greater reductions may be started at the higher dose. Diovan may be used over a dose range of 80 mg to 320 mg daily, administered once a day. The antihypertensive effect is substantially present within 2 weeks, and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. If additional antihypertensive effect is required over the starting dose range, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 320 mg or a diuretic may be added. Addition of a diuretic has a greater effect than dose increases beyond 80 mg. Diovan may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

- **Pediatric hypertension 1 to 16 years of age**: The usual recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg once daily (up to 40 mg total). A higher starting dose of 2 mg/kg may be considered in selected cases when a greater reduction of blood pressure is needed. The dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response and tolerability, up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg once daily (maximum daily dose 160 mg). No data are available in pediatric patients either undergoing dialysis or with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Use of Diovan is not recommended in children less than 1 year of age [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Pediatric Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

- **Heart failure**: The recommended starting dose of Diovan is 40 mg twice daily.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality.

Data from trials clearly indicate that for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy.

Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Cleviprex [^1149z4xh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Cleviprex was evaluated in an open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial (VELOCITY) involving 126 patients with severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > 115 mmHg). The infusion of Cleviprex was initiated at a rate of 2 mg/hour and was up-titrated every 3 minutes, with the possibility of doubling the dose up to a maximum of 32 mg/hour, as necessary to reach a predetermined target blood pressure range within 30 minutes, the study's primary endpoint. The transition to oral antihypertensive therapy was evaluated for up to 6 hours following the cessation of the Cleviprex infusion.

- **Blood pressure effect and study results**: The effect of blood pressure in this study is depicted in Figure 5. The average infusion rate recorded was 9.5 mg/hour, and the mean duration of Cleviprex exposure was 21 hours.

Figure 5. Mean percent change in SBP (%) during the first 30 minutes of infusion, VELOCITY (severe hypertension).

Oral antihypertensive therapy was instituted 1 hour before the expected cessation of the Cleviprex infusion. Transition to oral antihypertensive therapy within 6 hours after discontinuing Cleviprex infusion was successful in 91% (115 out of 126) of patients. No patients required the reinstitution of intravenous antihypertensive therapy following the transition to oral therapy.

Cleviprex was also evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel 72-hour continuous infusion study in 61 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. The mean baseline blood pressure of subjects was 151/86 mmHg. Subjects were randomized to receive placebo or 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg/hour doses. Doses above 2 mg/hour were started at 2 mg/hour and force-titrated in 2-fold increments at 3-minute intervals.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: An open-label, randomised controlled trial [^117DNbtK]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

The primary outcome was blood pressure control, defined as 120–150 mm Hg systolic blood pressure and 70–100 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure, within 6 hours with no adverse outcomes. These adverse outcomes included hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure < 70 mm Hg, or both, and fetal distress), caesarean section for fetal distress up to 2 hours after the end of the study period, severe headache requiring discontinuation of the drug, or eclampsia.

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- The need to change drug regimen or provide additional medications; placental abruption; and maternal side-effects associated with worsening maternal pre-eclampsia. These side-effects include chest pain, dyspnoea, headache that resulted in a change in treatment, visual symptoms such as flashes or diplopia, epigastric or right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and nausea or vomiting. Additional outcomes include maternal morbidity (eclampsia or seizure, adverse CNS outcomes such as stroke or cortical blindness, HELLP syndrome, pulmonary oedema indicated by oxygen saturation < 90% and abnormal chest x-ray, oliguria < 25 mL/h for 2 hours, and disseminated intravascular coagulation), maternal death, caesarean delivery, and enrolment-to-delivery interval.

As prespecified maternal endpoints, we also assessed the duration of hospital stay, admission to an intensive care unit or high-dependency unit, and any use of dialysis or mechanical ventilation. Fetal or neonatal complications were also assessed, including neonatal morbidity such as respiratory distress syndrome requiring oxygen supplementation and abnormal cerebral ultrasound results.

### Effect of intravenous antihypertensives on outcomes of severe hypertension in hospitalized patients without acute target organ damage [^1111H2pJ]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

Characteristics between treated and untreated severe hypertensive patients were presented as median and interquartile range or proportions. To account for confounders between treated and untreated patients, overlap propensity score weighting was used. This method is more statistically efficient than inverse probability weighting and more robust than extreme propensity scores. A propensity score represents the probability that each patient will receive antihypertensive treatment, considering the measured covariates.

We calculated the propensity score for antihypertensive treatment using a multivariable logistic regression model. This model contained demographics, comorbidities, laboratory measures on admission, medications besides antihypertensives that affect blood pressure given before severe inpatient hypertension development (e.g. NSAIDs, corticosteroids, intravenous crystalloid fluid), vitals on admission, and blood pressure at the time of severe hypertension development. Each patient was then weighted by the overlap weights, corresponding to the probability of being assigned to the opposite group. Treated patients are weighted by the probability of not receiving treatment (1 − propensity score), and untreated patients are weighted by the probability of receiving treatment (propensity score).

We further assessed covariate balance between treated and untreated groups using the full cohort and the overlap propensity score weighted cohort. A standardized mean difference of 0 served as evidence of balance. Finally, a complete case analysis was used.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually aim to achieve a specific target. This target represents the blood pressure value below which optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. The "lower the better" approach that guided treatment for many years was challenged over the last decade due to a lack of evidence from randomized trials supporting this strategy. Consequently, the standard target in clinical practice in recent years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the concept of achieving lower targets. Therefore, it is important to assess whether the benefits outweigh the harms when aiming for targets lower than the standard.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine if lower targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with standard targets (less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for treating patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Secondary objectives included determining if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with "lower targets" compared to "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension.

### Trandate [^111BjyUa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Dosage and administration

Dosage must be individualized. The recommended initial dosage is 100 mg twice daily, whether used alone or added to a diuretic regimen. After 2 or 3 days, using standing blood pressure as an indicator, the dosage may be titrated in increments of 100 mg b.i.d. every 2 or 3 days. The usual maintenance dosage of labetalol HCl is between 200 and 400 mg twice daily.

Since the full antihypertensive effect of labetalol HCl is usually seen within the first 1 to 3 hours of the initial dose or dose increment, the assurance of a lack of an exaggerated hypotensive response can be clinically established in the office setting. The antihypertensive effects of continued dosing can be measured at subsequent visits, approximately 12 hours following a dose, to determine whether further titration is necessary.

Patients with severe hypertension may require from 1,200 to 2,400 mg per day, with or without thiazide diuretics. Should side effects (principally nausea or dizziness) occur with these doses administered twice daily, the same total daily dose administered three times daily may improve tolerability and facilitate further titration. Titration increments should not exceed 200 mg twice daily.

When a diuretic is added, an additive antihypertensive effect can be expected. In some cases, this may necessitate a labetalol HCl dosage adjustment. As with most antihypertensive drugs, optimal dosages of Trandate tablets are usually lower in patients also receiving a diuretic.

When transferring patients from other antihypertensive drugs, Trandate tablets should be introduced as re…

### Lopressor [^114VApzn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Hypertension**: Individualize the dosage of Lopressor tablets. These tablets should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, taken in single or divided doses. Dosage adjustments should be made at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimal blood pressure reduction is achieved. Generally, the maximum effect of a given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective dosage range for Lopressor tablets is 100 mg to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. While once-daily dosing can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses, especially 100 mg, may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period. Larger or more frequent daily doses may be required. It is advisable to measure blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the day.

- **Angina pectoris**: The dosage of Lopressor tablets should be individualized. They should be taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Dosage should be gradually increased at weekly intervals until optimum clinical response has been obtained or if there is a pronounced slowing of the heart rate. The effective dosage range for Lopressor tablets is 100 mg to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, the dosage should be reduced gradually over a period of 1 to 2 weeks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Myocardial infarction**: See prescribing information for dosage guidelines.

### SPL drug information for labetalol hydrochloride [^1125GVAS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Year not provided). High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of labetalol hydrochloride IV (also known as Trandate) include several important considerations:

- **Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmia**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period. Taper the dose gradually over 1–2 weeks. Do not routinely discontinue chronic β-blocker therapy before major surgery.

- **Bradycardia**: Use caution in patients taking digoxin.

- **Exacerbation of heart failure (HF)**: Use caution in patients with compensated HF.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as labetalol has rarely been associated with hepatocellular injury, including hepatic necrosis.

- **Hypertensive crisis**: Use caution in patients with untreated pheochromocytoma.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients receiving nitroglycerin.

- **Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome**: Use caution in patients undergoing cataract surgery.

- **Mask symptoms of hypoglycemia**: Use caution in patients with diabetes.

- **Rapid decrease of blood pressure (BP)**: Use caution in patients with severe hypertension.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^1134Dzfk]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

A 2018 network meta-analysis suggested a similar efficacy of nifedipine, hydralazine, and labetalol in the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Our results indicate that all three oral medications are viable initial options for treating severe hypertension in pregnancy where additional antihypertensive options are available. Our trial also provides additional information on the relative effectiveness of methyldopa, an oral medication that is widely available in many settings. However, if only a single drug were available, nifedipine or labetalol would be preferable to methyldopa. The findings should reassure providers to use the drugs available in their own settings, especially given supply chain and licensing variability between clinical settings.

Our study has some limitations. It was not masked because of the ethical and logistical difficulties in a placebo-controlled trial, which increases the risk of bias. Providers might have had established opinions as to the relative efficacy of different medications, and their opinions could have affected decision making about the administration of an additional dose of the assigned medication or a second medication, especially in the case of methyldopa. Our analysis found that, in most cases, providers complied with the study protocol, and women were not in the target blood pressure range when an additional dose was given. Thus, we believe that the open-label design did not unduly affect the outcomes. The decision to increase the sample size after the start of the trial resulted in an increased proportion of women assigned.

### Impact of initial blood pressure on antihypertensive response in patients with acute hypertension [^1117YFGo]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The effect profile of differing antihypertensive agents is well studied, but minimal data exist regarding the interaction between hemodynamic response and presenting blood pressure (BP).

Achievement of target BP is hypothesized to be less likely in patients with higher initial BPs. This study is a substudy of the multicenter safety and efficacy evaluation of intravenous Cardene (nicardipine) and labetalol use in the emergency department (CLUE) trial. Patients were randomized to FDA-recommended intravenous dosing of nicardipine or labetalol to reach a physician predefined systolic BP (SBP) and target range (TR) of ± 20 mm Hg within 30 minutes. The proportion achieving TR was assessed as a function of initial SBP, and dichotomized comparisons were made using median SBP. The likelihood of a final BP within TR was modeled using logistic regression with forced inclusion of initial BP as a categorical variable.

A total of 223 patients were enrolled; 115 (51.6%) had an initial SBP greater than the median 202 mm Hg. The median SBP (interquartile range) of the high BP group was 218 (210–228) mm Hg compared to the low BP group at 190 (182–197) mm Hg (P < 0.0001). No groupwise differences existed except that the high group had a higher mean (SD) serum creatinine level at baseline (3.1 [3.9] vs 1.9 [2.3], P = 0.008). The proportion of patients achieving SBP within TR at 30 minutes did not differ significantly (85.2% [98 of 115] vs 88.9% [96 of 108], P = 0.42). Randomization to nicardipine (odds ratio = 2.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–7.01), but not initial SBP (odds ratio = …

### Hypertension severity as quantified by hypertension daily dose and blood pressure with risk of stroke in REGARDS [^115H3dRH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most prevalent health conditions in the United States, with an estimated prevalence of 47% among US adults. It is a modifiable risk factor for stroke, coronary heart disease, kidney disease, and cognitive decline, which makes blood pressure (BP) an important target for multiple disease prevention. Among the various sequelae of hypertension, stroke is an especially detrimental complication. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and the second most common cause of mortality worldwide.

In adults with hypertension, antihypertensive medications are the most effective approach to reducing the risk of first or recurrent strokes. Residual risks of stroke persist even if BP is controlled with antihypertensive medication, and stroke risk appears to increase with more intensive hypertension treatment regimens defined by the number of unique antihypertensive classes. However, using only counts of antihypertensive drug classes fails to account for increasing doses of individual medications.

Hypertension daily dose (HDD) quantifies an aggregated dose intensity of individual antihypertensive medications across multiple classes of antihypertensive agents. A standardized HDD unit of 1 is defined as 50% of the dose of an antihypertensive medication needed to provide a fully beneficial effect. For example, amlodipine's full beneficial dose is 10 mg per day; a dose of 5 mg per day equals an HDD of 1. Similarly, lisinopril's full beneficial dose is 40 mg per day, with a dose of 20 mg per day equating to an HDD of 1.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertensive urgency in the outpatient setting: A systematic review [^117GD8on]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

- **Beta-blockers**: There were five trials of beta-blockers (three prospective cohorts and two RCTs). Labetalol was studied in doses ranging from 20 to 300 mg in both IV and PO formulations. Blood pressure values were reduced after 0.33–24 hours of labetalol administration in all studies. Labetalol PO was investigated in only one small RCT (n = 10), which found that the mean PO dose of 221 mg reduced SBP from 195 to 154 at 4 hours. Side effects reported with labetalol were dizziness, drowsiness, headache, bradycardia, and pain at the injection site.

- **Centrally acting antihypertensives**: Two centrally acting agents, clonidine and ketanserin, were studied in seven trials. Clonidine was investigated in six trials (one prospective cohort, one retrospective cohort, four RCTs), which found that PO doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mg reduced SBP from 204–196 to 165–155 at 2 hours. Side effects reported with the use of clonidine were hypotension, orthostasis, impotence, sedation, dry mouth, mild transient drowsiness, and lower heart rate (average 6.2 beats/min).

	- **Ketanserin**: Ketanserin (unavailable in the U.S.) was studied in one RCT, also reducing BP after IV and SL administration. Somnolence was reported.

### Labetalol versus nifedipine as antihypertensive treatment for chronic hypertension in pregnancy: A randomized controlled trial [^114veR9B]. Hypertension (2017). High credibility.

Data from randomized controlled trials guiding antihypertensive agent choice for chronic hypertension in pregnancy are limited. This study aimed to compare labetalol and nifedipine, additionally assessing the impact of ethnicity on treatment efficacy. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension (12+0 to 12+6 weeks' gestation) were enrolled at four UK centers from August 2014 to October 2015. Open-label first-line antihypertensive treatment was randomly assigned as either labetalol (200–1800 mg/d) or nifedipine-modified release (20–80 mg/d).

The analysis included 112 women (98%) who completed the study (labetalol n = 55, nifedipine n = 57). Maximum blood pressure after randomization was 161/101 mm Hg with labetalol versus 163/105 mm Hg with nifedipine. The mean difference in systolic pressure was 1.2 mm Hg [-4.9 to 7.2 mm Hg], and in diastolic pressure, it was 3.3 mm Hg [-0.6 to 7.3 mm Hg]. Mean blood pressure was 134/84 mm Hg with labetalol and 134/85 mm Hg with nifedipine, with a mean difference in systolic pressure of 0.3 mm Hg [-2.8 to 3.4 mm Hg] and in diastolic pressure of -1.9 mm Hg [-4.1 to 0.3 mm Hg].

Nifedipine use was associated with a 7.4-mm Hg reduction [-14.4 to -0.4 mm Hg] in central aortic pressure, measured by pulse wave analysis. No difference in treatment effect was observed in black women (n = 63), but a mean 4 mm Hg reduction [-6.6 to -0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.015] in brachial diastolic blood pressure was observed with labetalol compared to nifedipine in non-black women (n = 49).

Labetalol and nifedipine effectively control mean blood pressure to target levels in pregnant women with chronic hypertension. This study provides support for a larger definitive trial to further scrutinize these benefits.

### False-positive amphetamine toxicology screen results in three pregnant women using labetalol [^116juxd2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Labetalol is commonly used for control of hypertension in pregnancy. A component of the workup for new-onset hypertension in pregnancy often includes a urine drug screen. A labetalol metabolite is structurally similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine, thus causing potential cross-reactivity in drug immunoassays.

- **Cases**: We present one case of cocaine-induced hypertensive crisis superimposed on chronic hypertension and two cases of severe preeclampsia for which patients required escalating doses of labetalol for hypertension, with subsequent false-positive amphetamine urine drug screen results.

- **Conclusion**: In pregnant women requiring labetalol for treatment of hypertensive disease, a urine drug screen may be falsely positive for amphetamines and methamphetamines. Providers should be cognizant of this possibility when interpreting the results of urine drug screens.

### Oral nifedipine or intravenous labetalol for hypertensive emergency in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial [^114VwAX1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). High credibility.

The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of orally administered nifedipine and intravenously administered labetalol for acute blood pressure control in hypertensive emergencies during pregnancy.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, pregnant women with sustained increases in systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or higher were randomized. Participants received nifedipine (10 mg tablet orally, up to five doses) with an intravenous placebo saline injection or intravenous labetalol injection in escalating doses of 20, 40, 80, 80, and 80 mg with a placebo tablet every 20 minutes until achieving the target blood pressure of 150 mm Hg systolic and 100 mm Hg diastolic, or lower. Crossover treatment was administered if the initial treatment failed. The primary endpoint of the study was the time necessary to achieve the target blood pressure. Secondary endpoints included the number of dosages required, adverse maternal and neonatal effects, side effect profiles, and perinatal outcomes.

- **Results**: From October 2012 to April 2013, 60 patients were enrolled. The median time taken to achieve target blood pressure was 40 minutes (interquartile range, 20–60 minutes), compared with 60 minutes (interquartile range, 40–85 minutes) for nifedipine and labetalol, respectively (P = 0.008). The median dose required was two (interquartile range, 1–3) compared with three (interquartile range, 2–4.25) for nifedipine and labetalol, respectively (P = 0.008). No serious adverse maternal or perinatal side effects were witnessed in either group.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112mNnxT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

A limitation of our study is that, although it was larger and longer than most studies comparing combination therapy to monotherapy, results are limited to 1 year and cannot address the impact on morbidity and mortality. In the VALUE study, a 3.8-mm Hg lower clinic systolic BP in the first 3 months of the study translated into a significant increase in the primary endpoint driven mainly by mortality and stroke, and was borderline for increased myocardial infarction. In our study, clinic systolic BP was 10.1 mm Hg lower in the first 2 months and 6.8 mm Hg on average lower over the first 4 months with combination therapy versus sequential monotherapy. It is likely that such differences, applied to a large population, would be clinically important, especially for those with similar cardiovascular risk as participants in morbidity–mortality studies. The BP Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration found that the relative risk reduction of BP lowering was similar for low- and higher-risk individuals. It is likely that significant proportional reductions in cardiovascular events would accrue from treating all hypertensive patients with initial combination therapy.

Some reviewers argued that more powerful ARBs have been identified since our study was initiated, citing a meta-analysis of azilsartan, or that HCTZ 25 mg is a paltry and unacceptable diuretic because, in combination with this same ARB, it reduced systolic BP by 5.6 mm Hg less than a combination with chlortalidone, affecting a meta-analysis of thiazide-like versus thiazide-type diuretics. There is a paucity of outcome data for these comparisons.

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^111S2wcp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The following information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. During and immediately following (for up to 3 hours) labetalol hydrochloride injection, the patient should remain supine. Subsequently, the patient should be advised on how to proceed gradually to become ambulatory and should be observed at the time of first ambulation.

When the patient is started on labetalol hydrochloride tablets following adequate control of blood pressure with labetalol hydrochloride injection, appropriate directions for titration of dosage should be provided (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

As with all drugs with beta-blocking activity, certain advice to patients being treated with labetalol is warranted: While no incident of the abrupt withdrawal phenomenon (exacerbation of angina pectoris) has been reported with labetalol, dosing with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should not be interrupted or discontinued without a physician's advice. Patients being treated with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should consult a physician at any signs or symptoms of impending cardiac failure or hepatic dysfunction (see WARNINGS). Also, transient scalp tingling may occur, usually when treatment with labetalol hydrochloride tablets is initiated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

- **Laboratory tests**: Routine laboratory tests are ordinarily not required before or after intravenous labetalol. In patients with concomitant illnesses, such as impaired renal function, appropriate tests should be done.

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^114kf7Vw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous labetalol has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and relieving symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma; however, higher than usual doses may be required. It is important to note that paradoxical hypertensive responses have been reported in a few patients with this tumor. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering labetalol to patients with pheochromocytoma.

Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g. tachycardia) of acute hypoglycemia. This is especially important with labile diabetics. Beta-blockade also reduces the release of insulin in response to hyperglycemia; it may therefore be necessary to adjust the dose of antidiabetic drugs.

Do not routinely withdraw chronic beta blocker therapy prior to surgery. The effect of labetalol's alpha adrenergic activity has not been evaluated in this setting. Several deaths have occurred when labetalol hydrochloride injection was used during surgery, including when used in cases to control bleeding. A synergism between labetalol and halothane anesthesia has been shown [see PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions].

Caution must be observed when reducing severely elevated blood pressure. A number of adverse reactions, including cerebral infarction, optic nerve infarction, angina, and ischemic changes in the electrocardiogram, have been reported with other agents when severely elevated blood pressure was reduced over time courses of several hours to as long as 1 or 2 days.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^114BqB1V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

A sample size of 268 in each group was determined to have 90% power to detect a difference in HSBP means of 4 mm Hg, assuming a common SD of 12 mm Hg using a two-group t-test with α = 0.01. The hypothesized 4 mm Hg difference was based on the systolic BP difference between arms in the VALUE study at three months, which was associated with significant excess mortality.

All analyses followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan. We calculated home BP using the arithmetic mean of the last 18 home BP measurements before a study visit. If more than 18 measurements were obtained, the earliest recorded readings were discarded. Most patients had all readings taken on days 1 to 3 before the visit; if any were missing, readings from day 4 were added. A minimum of six measurements was required for a valid home BP assessment. If fewer than six readings were available, the observation was considered missing.

We employed mixed-effect models with unstructured covariances for repeated measures within a patient. These models provide valid hypothesis tests when observations are missing at random. Adjustments were made for prespecified baseline covariates such as sex, age, height, weight, smoking history, prior hypertension treatment, and the baseline value of the outcome analyzed. Least squares means estimated from these models are presented. BP control and response rates were analyzed using logistic regression models, which also included the baseline covariates. Comparisons of adverse event rates between treatments were conducted using similar methodologies.

Antihypertensive management

- **When/where**: In LMICs, there is consensus on the immediate hospital treatment of severe arterial hypertension when systolic blood pressure (SBP) exceeds 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) exceeds 110 mmHg. In Indonesia, consider antihypertensive medication for outpatient treatment if blood pressure consistently exceeds 140/90 mmHg.

- **First-line treatment**: In severe hypertension, there is a consensus that LMICs support immediate stabilization with recommended agents, including intravenous hydralazine, labetalol, and oral nifedipine, particularly in scenarios where venous access poses a challenge. An analysis of 91 EMLs from 144 LMICs revealed a wide range of antihypertensive therapies, whose selection factors include physician familiarity, availability, adverse effects, and teratogenic potential. During the antepartum period, nifedipine and Alpha-methyldopa are often chosen to maintain arterial pressure; transitioning to amlodipine or an ACE inhibitor is recommended in the postpartum period.

- **South African guidelines**: These guidelines recommend using 10 mg of rapid-acting oral nifedipine or intravenous labetalol, followed by a maintenance regimen of 1 g of oral alpha-methyldopa. Nitroglycerin is preferred for hypertension complicated by pulmonary edema. The recommended treatment for mild preeclampsia involves the administration of alpha-methyldopa at a dosage of 500 mg three times a day. In Latin America and the Philippines, additional cross-sectional studies guide treatment protocols and highlight regional variations.

### Severe labetalol overdose in an 8-month-old infant [^113qgqdj]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

We report a case of a large labetalol overdose in an eight-month-old infant that was being treated for hypertension following surgery for coarctation of the aorta. Labetalol, both an alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agent, was used for treating postoperative hypertension. By mistake, the patient was given an extremely high dose of labetalol intravenously (17.2 mg/kg). Remarkably, the medication error had a surprisingly limited clinical effect on the infant who survived the incident. We discuss the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and possible explanations for this fortunate turn of events.

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^1148tm5D]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Drug interactions with labetalol hydrochloride require careful monitoring, especially for patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents. It is essential to promptly detect and treat any undesired effects from concomitant administration.

In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol orally in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor, compared to 0.7% with labetalol alone. The contribution of each treatment to this adverse reaction is unknown, but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded.

Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm. Therefore, doses greater than the normal antiasthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required.

Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol when administered orally. Since this could be due to enhanced absorption or an alteration of the hepatic metabolism of labetalol, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients.

Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol. During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol in association with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased, and there is a possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure.

### Low-dose alpha/beta blockade in the treatment of essential hypertension [^11292d13]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Despite the recent emphasis on combination drug therapy for hypertension, little attention has been given to alpha/beta blockade using agents other than labetalol. The purpose of this study was to:

- **Compare efficacy**: To compare the efficacy of low-dose alpha/beta blockade using doxazosin + betaxolol versus monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ]).
- **Assess efficacy**: To assess the efficacy of low-dose doxazosin.

In a crossover study, 21 hypertensive subjects were treated for 3 weeks each with HCTZ, 12.5 to 25 mg/day; quinapril, 10 to 40 mg/day; and a combination of doxazosin, 1 to 4 mg + betaxolol, 5 to 10 mg daily. Doses were titrated to achieve a systolic pressure of < 130 mm Hg, as assessed by self-recorded home measurements. Home blood pressure decreased 11.5/7.5 mm Hg after HCTZ, 12.9/8.8 mm Hg after quinapril, and 21.2/16.5 mm Hg after doxazosin + betaxolol (P < .001/ < .001 vs. HCTZ and P < .002/ < .001 vs. quinapril). The target systolic pressure was achieved by 33%, 43%, and 71% of subjects, respectively (P = 0.04 vs. HCTZ and .03 vs. quinapril). Among the 8 subjects in whom doxazosin dosage was increased to the maximum of 4 mg, the mean blood pressure achieved at 4 mg did not differ from that achieved at 2 mg (136/87 vs. 136/88 mm Hg).

We conclude that oral alpha/beta blockade is superior to monotherapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or a diuretic and that maximal or near-maximal efficacy can be achieved at a 2-mg dose of doxazosin. Low-dose oral alpha/beta blockade merits greater consideration in the drug therapy of essential hypertension.

### Central versus peripheral blood pressure in malignant hypertension; effects of antihypertensive treatment [^113qsvm2]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and labetalol are recommended for the immediate treatment of malignant hypertension. Both are intravenous agents; however, they have different effects on systemic hemodynamics and may have differential effects on pulse-wave reflection and pulse-pressure amplification, with consequences for peripheral versus central blood pressures (BPs).

- **Methods**: We conducted a nonrandomized, open-label study of 8 patients treated with sodium nitroprusside (mean age ± SD, 44 ± 14 years; 6 males; diastolic/systolic BP, 225 ± 22/135 ± 8 mm Hg) and 6 patients treated with intravenous labetalol (mean age, 39 ± 15 years; 4 males; systolic/diastolic BP, 232 ± 22/138 ± 17 mm Hg). This was done before and after treatment for malignant hypertension, aiming at a 25% reduction in mean arterial pressure. Peripheral pressures were measured with an intra-arterial catheter in the radial artery, and central pressures were derived with a generalized transfer filter.

- **Results**: Mean arterial pressure was similarly reduced with sodium nitroprusside and labetalol (by 27% and 30%, respectively; P = 0.76). There was a nonsignificantly greater reduction in peripheral systolic blood pressure (SBP) with labetalol than with sodium nitroprusside (29 ± 11% vs. 18 ± 7%; P = 0.08). The decline in peripheral diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with the two agents was comparable. However, the reduction in peripheral pulse pressure was 8 ± 16% with SNP and 33 ± 17% with labetalol (P = 0.01). The decline in reflection magnitude was greater with SNP than with labetalol. There were no significant differences in the reduction of central BP with SNP.

### Low-dose combination therapy: The rationalization for an ACE inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker in higher risk patients [^116nxBY7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

As more high-risk hypertensive individuals are treated and the need for more intensive antihypertensive therapy is recognized, combination therapies are increasingly used. For initial therapy, particularly for relatively low-risk patients, low-dose combinations are often appropriate. For those requiring additional therapy, higher doses of combinations may provide further efficacy while minimizing dose-dependent side effects of monotherapy, thereby improving adherence to therapy. These combination agents should provide 24-hour control with a single daily dose, ensuring protection during the early morning hours. Combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker is a rational approach to treating hypertension. Not only does this combination provide significantly better blood pressure control than when the individual components are used as monotherapy, but it also minimizes dose-dependent side effects. Additionally, combining agents from different classes results in complementary mechanisms of action, providing other cardiovascular protective benefits.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^112JcTS9]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Women who were randomly assigned to receive nifedipine were given an initial dose of 10 mg oral nifedipine (10 mg Nicardia retard [JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Mumbai, India]); if their systolic blood pressure exceeded 155 mm Hg or their diastolic blood pressure exceeded 105 mm Hg after 1 hour, an additional 10 mg dose could be provided each hour for two additional doses (to a total of 30 mg). Women who were randomly assigned to receive labetalol were given an initial dose of 200 mg oral labetalol (100 mg Labetet [Sun Pharma Laboratories, Mumbai, India]); if their systolic blood pressure exceeded 155 mm Hg or their diastolic blood pressure exceeded 105 mm Hg after 1 hour, an additional 200 mg dose could be provided each hour for two additional doses (to a total of 600 mg). Women who were randomly assigned to receive methyldopa were given a single dose of 1000 mg methyldopa (500 mg Alphadopa [Wockhardt, Mumbai, India]) without dose escalation for the 6-hour study period.

For women in all three groups, we monitored and recorded pulse and blood pressure every 20 minutes with an automatic digital blood pressure cuff. The blood pressure measurements were confirmed with a mercury sphygmomanometer whenever an automated reading indicated a trial-qualifying blood pressure. Oxygen saturation was measured and recorded at baseline and at 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours. The Glasgow Coma Scale assessment was administered by a research clinician at baseline, 2 hours, and 6 hours. Aspartate transaminase, platelet count, and serum creatinine concentration were measured at baseline and 6 hours.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment for hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful, and the actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We also searched in clinical study repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared a combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and other outcomes.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-1 selective beta blockers for primary hypertension [^112Y12zp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Beta blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension. The blood pressure reading is the primary tool for physicians and patients to assess the efficacy of the treatment. However, the blood pressure-lowering effect of beta-1 selective blockers is not well known.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the dose-related effects of various doses and types of beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blockers on systolic and diastolic blood pressure versus placebo in people with primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) for related reviews. We also searched the following databases for primary studies: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register (all years to 15 October 2015), CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (2015, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 15 October 2015), and Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 15 October 2015).

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^114A3tBp]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

We found a significant increase in the proportion of admissions to the intensive care unit among neonates born to women assigned to receive nifedipine. The gestational age at delivery, the strongest determinant of birth weight, was similar between groups. Reassuringly, no differences in intubation, survival rates, or lengths of stay among admitted neonates were observed. Although this finding should not be completely discounted, it should probably be the subject of additional investigation before directing care.

We enrolled 894 pregnant women with severe hypertension in low-resource settings. Across the cohort, independent of treatment group, maternal outcomes were very good and better than expected. There were no maternal deaths, adverse CNS outcomes, maternal admissions for critical care, or need for dialysis. There was only one (< 1%) woman with eclampsia, despite the use of magnesium sulphate in 12% of women (which halves the risk of eclampsia). In our opinion, the organised structure for the frequent assessment and prompt management of severe hypertension, including retreatment to achieve adequate blood pressure control, was key. Identifying women with severe hypertension and providing them with available oral antihypertensive drugs in an adequate dose, along with close monitoring for control of blood pressure, established an effective standard for care. Additionally, our trial provided resources to support the protocol while emphasising the role of timely and tight blood pressure control to optimise maternal outcomes.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^113ffjut]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

The sample size was estimated a priori based on the primary outcome, assuming a prevalence of 75% with nifedipine, 62.5% with labetalol, and 50% with methyldopa, as indicated by published data. The participants in the nifedipine group served as the comparison group for both the labetalol and methyldopa regimens. The comparison of labetalol and nifedipine required a sample size of 261 patients in each group, given a two-tailed test, α = 0.05, and a power of 80%, using a simple Bonferroni correction. Under the same statistical assumptions, the methyldopa group required 59 patients with a nifedipine sample size of 261.

To account for loss to follow-up, the initial sample size included 671 women: nifedipine, 298 women; labetalol, 298 women; and methyldopa, 75 women. In October 2015, following 6 months of enrolment, the Trial Steering Committee requested an increase in the size of the methyldopa group. This decision was influenced by a large cohort study suggesting methyldopa was more effective than estimated. The Trial Steering Committee concluded the original sample size was underpowered to provide useful evidence of methyldopa's effectiveness. Consequently, the sample size in the methyldopa arm increased from 75 to 298 women. The new sample size thus included 298 women in each treatment group.

In January 2016, a new randomisation sequence was implemented, altering the enrolment ratio (nifedipine: labetalol: methyldopa) over two phases: from 4:4:1 in phase 1 (patients 1–265) to 3:3:4 in phase 2 (patients 266–894).

### Safety and efficacy of intravenous labetalol for hypertensive crisis in infants and small children [^111q4AwW]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy and safety of labetalol for hypertensive crisis in children ≤ 24 months of age, a retrospective chart review was conducted. Statistical analysis utilized analysis of variance for continuous data, chi-square tests for nominal data, and linear regression.

This study was conducted at a 737-bed pediatric teaching institution. Twenty-seven patients aged ≤ 24 months were treated with 37 intravenous infusions of labetalol, nicardipine, or nitroprusside for hypertensive crisis or hypertensive urgency. No interventions were administered beyond these treatments.

The primary endpoint involved the time to a 20% reduction in systolic blood pressure. Primary safety endpoints measured the prevalence of deleterious effects of labetalol. Continuous infusion of labetalol reduced mean systolic blood pressure by at least 20% in less than 8 hours. This effect was similar to nicardipine and nitroprusside infusions. The reported side effects were similar across each group. Patients receiving labetalol and presenting with ischemic or traumatic brain injury were likely to develop hypotension requiring infusion discontinuation.

In conclusion, continuous intravenous labetalol infusion is efficacious for the treatment of hypertensive crisis in children ≤ 24 months of age. Aside from patients presenting with ischemic or traumatic brain injury, labetalol was safe to use in this population for hypertensive emergencies and had a satisfactory adverse effect profile. Labetalol may reach dose saturation at a much lower dose in young children compared to adults. Clinicians should exercise caution when initiating treatment.

### Postpartum medical management of hypertension and risk of readmission for hypertensive complications [^117WkuZn]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to compare the risk of readmission in patients receiving no treatment, labetalol, nifedipine, or both at hospital discharge following delivery complicated by the presence of hypertension.

- **Study design**: This retrospective study was conducted at a single tertiary care center over a 4-year period (2017–2020). Participants included those with peripartum hypertension (pHTN), defined as any systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg on two occasions 4 hours apart during their admission for delivery. The primary outcome was postpartum readmission due to hypertensive complications. Analysis was stratified by medication prescribed at discharge: no treatment, labetalol, nifedipine, or both. The risks of readmission for managing pHTN were estimated using logistic regression and adjusted for confounding variables.

- **Results**: During the study period, 19,425 women gave birth, and 4,660 (24.0%) met the definition of pHTN. Of those, 1,232 (26.4%) were discharged on antihypertensive medication(s). There were 217 (4.7%) readmissions for hypertensive complications after discharge. Compared to patients who did not receive antihypertensive medication at discharge, any nifedipine prescription significantly decreased the risk of readmission: monotherapy [aOR 0.27 (0.15–0.48)], and nifedipine with labetalol [aOR 0.35 (0.16–0.77)]. Labetalol monotherapy was associated with an increased risk of readmission [aOR 1.66 (1.06–2.61)].

The risk of postpartum readmission for hypertensive complications was reduced by 65% when nifedipine was prescribed.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^116QKbkV]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most common medical disorder in pregnancy, complicating one in ten pregnancies. Treatment of severely increased blood pressure is widely recommended to reduce the risk for maternal complications. Regimens for the acute treatment of severe hypertension typically include intravenous medications. Although effective, these drugs require venous access and careful fetal monitoring and might not be feasible in busy or low-resource environments. We therefore aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of three oral drugs: labetalol, nifedipine retard, and methyldopa for the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we compared these oral antihypertensives in two public hospitals in Nagpur, India. Pregnant women were eligible for the trial if they were aged at least 18 years; they were pregnant with fetuses that had reached a gestational age of at least 28 weeks; they required pharmacological blood pressure control for severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg); and were able to swallow oral medications. Women were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg oral nifedipine, 200 mg oral labetalol (hourly, in both of which the dose could be escalated if hypertension was maintained), or 1000 mg methyldopa (a single dose, without dose escalation). Masking of participants, study investigators, and care providers to group allocation was not possible because of different escalation protocols in the study groups.

### Effectiveness and safety of nicardipine and labetalol infusion for blood pressure management in patients with intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114aXtsQ]. Neurocritical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Nicardipine and labetalol are two commonly used antihypertensives for treating elevated blood pressures in the setting of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There are no studies comparing these two agents as continuous infusions.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted between November 2009 and January 2011 with ICH and SAH to compare effectiveness and safety between both agents. Percent time spent at goal was set as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes included blood pressure variability, time to goal, incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, and hypotension.

- **Results**: A total of 81 patients were available for analysis, 10 initiated on labetalol (LAB), 57 on nicardipine (NIC), and 14 required the combination of these agents (COMB) to reach goal. We found no difference between NIC, LAB, and the COMB groups in the median percent time at goal [88% (61–98); 93% (51–99); 66% (25–95), (p = NS)]. Median percentage of blood pressure variability, hypotension, and bradycardia were also comparable between groups; however, more tachycardia was observed in the COMB group versus both LAB and NIC groups (45% vs. 0% vs. 3%; p < 0.001). Mean time to goal SBP in 24 patients who had BP readings available at the first hour of initiation was 32 ± 34 minutes in the NIC group and 53 ± 42 minutes in the LAB group (p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Both agents appear equally effective and safe for blood pressure control in SAH and ICH during the initial admission hours. A prospective study is needed to validate these findings.

### Labetalol hydrochloride [^114d9gfG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In a clinical pharmacologic study involving patients with severe hypertension, an initial injection of labetalol at 0.25 mg/kg administered in the supine position resulted in an average blood pressure decrease of 11/7 mmHg. Additional injections of 0.5 mg/kg at 15-minute intervals, up to a cumulative dose of 1.75 mg/kg of labetalol, induced further dose-related blood pressure reductions. Some patients required cumulative doses as high as 3.25 mg/kg. The maximal effect of each dose level occurred within 5 minutes. Upon the discontinuation of intravenous labetalol, blood pressure gradually rose, approaching pretreatment baseline values within an average of 16 to 18 hours in most patients.

Similar results were observed in the treatment of patients with severe hypertension requiring urgent blood pressure reduction. An initial dose of 20 mg (equivalent to 0.25 mg/kg for an 80 kg patient) was followed by additional doses of either 40 or 80 mg at 10-minute intervals to achieve the desired effect, with a total cumulative dose not exceeding 300 mg.

Labetalol, when administered as a continuous intravenous infusion at a mean dose of 136 mg (ranging from 27 to 300 mg) over 2 to 3 hours (with an average of 2 hours and 39 minutes), lowered blood pressure by an average of 60/35 mmHg.
