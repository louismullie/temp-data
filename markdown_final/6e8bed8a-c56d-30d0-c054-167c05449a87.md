## Question

why is fasting glucose high when a1c is good

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why fasting glucose can be high while HbA1c remains normal, and what that means clinically and diagnostically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what each test actually measures and how they differ. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic mechanisms that produce isolated fasting hyperglycemia. Next, I will examine population-level discordance data and risk implications. After that, I need to check for non-glycemic factors that can widen the gap. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical actions, including when to add OGTT or CGM, and how to interpret combined results for prognosis and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental difference between the two tests, because that frames everything else. Fasting plasma glucose captures a single time-point snapshot of hepatic glucose output and basal insulin sensitivity, whereas HbA1c reflects a weighted average of glycemia over roughly 2–3 months and is influenced by both fasting and postprandial components, so discordance is biologically plausible and expected in some individuals [^11683ts9] [^115BnvBr].

> Now, I need to think about the pathophysiology of isolated impaired fasting glucose. Wait, let me verify the mechanism: hepatic insulin resistance with impaired early-phase insulin secretion drives increased hepatic glucose production overnight, raising fasting glucose, while postprandial handling may remain intact enough to keep the 2–3 month average (HbA1c) within normal limits, especially early in the dysglycemia continuum [^1132DUGg] [^114dkxDC]. Hold on, I should also consider that as glycemic control worsens, the relative contribution of fasting glucose to HbA1c rises, which is why discordance tends to diminish at higher HbA1c levels [^113fTksp].

> Next, I should review how common this discordant pattern is in real-world data. I will now examine large-scale syntheses: among adults with newly detected diabetes, about 7% have isolated elevated fasting glucose with normal HbA1c, and among those with prediabetes, isolated impaired fasting glucose accounts for roughly 17% of cases, underscoring that this is not rare and reflects real biological heterogeneity rather than just lab error [^113nCeoA] [^114AQzJN]. But wait, what if regional or assay factors change this? Indeed, concordance varies by geography and methodology, yet isolated fasting hyperglycemia remains a consistent minority phenotype across datasets [^115BnvBr].

> I should confirm the prognostic implications, because that guides how aggressively we act. Individuals with isolated impaired fasting glucose still carry an increased risk of progressing to diabetes compared with normoglycemia, though the risk is lower than in those with combined IFG plus elevated HbA1c; pooled estimates suggest an approximately 4–5 fold higher diabetes risk for IFG 5.6–6.9 mmol/L versus normoglycemia, with risk rising further when both IFG and elevated HbA1c coexist [^112TSrMD] [^113fYU4G]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about complications; while some studies suggest postchallenge glycemia may track more closely with cardiovascular risk, both IFG and elevated HbA1c are associated with adverse outcomes, so isolated IFG is not benign and warrants surveillance and risk reduction [^116SdLGV] [^112TSrMD].

> Next, I should review non-glycemic factors that can widen the fasting glucose–HbA1c gap, because I need to ensure we are not missing an artifact. Variability in red blood cell lifespan and hemoglobin glycation index can shift HbA1c relative to mean glucose; older adults, Black individuals, and those with certain hemoglobinopathies or iron deficiency may show higher HbA1c at a given glucose level, while anemia or kidney disease can distort HbA1c in either direction, so discordance may reflect biology rather than imprecision alone [^117BCYoE] [^111TrPfh] [^115UQikT]. I should double-check that guidelines advise using glucose-based criteria when HbA1c is unreliable, which aligns with this concern [^115UQikT].

> Let me consider the clinical approach when fasting glucose is high but HbA1c is normal. First, I should confirm the results with repeat testing on a different day, because both FPG and HbA1c have biological variability and preanalytical pitfalls, and ADA recommends confirming abnormal results before labeling someone with prediabetes or diabetes [^114kB3Pu] [^113RXHy2]. Then, I need to check for conditions that affect HbA1c accuracy; if present, I should prioritize FPG, OGTT, or CGM-based assessment rather than relying on HbA1c alone [^115UQikT]. Next, I should review risk factors and symptoms; if suspicion remains high, an OGTT can unmask impaired glucose tolerance that fasting tests miss, and in select high-risk scenarios, CGM can characterize diurnal patterns and postprandial excursions that better explain the glycemic profile [^113yiD4Q] [^114rspAd].

> I will now examine how to interpret combined results for prognosis and follow-up. Individuals with both IFG and elevated HbA1c have markedly higher progression risk than either alone, so when both are abnormal, I should intensify lifestyle intervention and consider pharmacotherapy in those at highest risk, whereas isolated IFG still merits structured lifestyle modification and periodic reassessment of both markers to detect evolution [^113B6vsg] [^112V18qs]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines endorse repeating screening every 2–3 years in high-risk adults; yes, ADA and USPSTF support periodic reassessment with FPG, HbA1c, or OGTT as appropriate [^113RXHy2] [^112V18qs].

> Let me reconsider the original question to ensure internal consistency. Fasting glucose can be high while HbA1c is normal because fasting hyperglycemia reflects hepatic insulin resistance and early beta-cell dysfunction that may not yet raise the 2–3 month average enough to cross HbA1c thresholds, and because HbA1c integrates both fasting and postprandial glycemia, so early disease can manifest as isolated IFG with discordant HbA1c, particularly in younger or metabolically heterogeneous populations [^1132DUGg] [^115BnvBr]. I should confirm that this pattern is clinically meaningful and not just noise; indeed, it identifies a high-risk state that warrants confirmation, evaluation of non-glycemic modifiers, and proactive risk reduction with follow-up testing to catch progression early [^114kB3Pu] [^112V18qs].

Fasting glucose can be high while A1c is normal because **fasting glucose reflects a single time-point** and is sensitive to dawn phenomenon, stress, or acute illness, whereas **A1c reflects a 2–3 month average** and may be normal if postprandial glucose is controlled or if red cell turnover is altered [^11683ts9] [^115BnvBr]. This discordance is common in early diabetes or prediabetes, and **confirm with repeat fasting glucose, OGTT, or CGM** if suspicion remains [^113RXHy2] [^114rspAd].

---

## Physiological differences between fasting glucose and A1c

Fasting glucose and A1c measure different aspects of glycemia, so discordance is expected in some cases [^115BnvBr]:

| **Parameter** | **Fasting glucose** | **A1c** |
|-|-|-|
| Measurement | Single time-point | 2–3 month average |
| Reflects | Hepatic glucose output; dawn phenomenon; stress; acute illness | Average glycemia; postprandial contributions |
| Variability | High day-to-day | Low; less biologic variability |
| Limitations | Sensitive to recent intake, stress, illness | Altered by anemia, hemoglobinopathies, kidney/liver disease |

---

## Pathophysiological explanations for discordance

Several mechanisms can raise fasting glucose while keeping A1c normal:

- **Dawn phenomenon**: Early morning hepatic glucose release raises fasting glucose but may not significantly affect A1c if daytime/postprandial levels are normal [^notfound].
- **Early beta-cell dysfunction**: Impaired first-phase insulin secretion causes fasting hyperglycemia before postprandial control worsens and A1c rises [^1132DUGg].
- **Stress or acute illness**: Transient hyperglycemia elevates fasting glucose without changing A1c [^notfound].
- **Altered red cell turnover**: Shorter RBC lifespan or hemoglobinopathies can lower A1c relative to true glycemia [^115UQikT].

---

## Clinical significance of discordance

Discordance signals **early dysglycemia** and increased diabetes risk, even when A1c is normal [^112TSrMD]. Isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is common and carries a higher risk of progression to diabetes than normoglycemia [^112TSrMD]. Cardiovascular risk may also be elevated in this phenotype, particularly when other risk factors are present [^1132DUGg].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise confirming discordant results and using **alternative tests** when appropriate:

- **Confirm discordance**: Repeat fasting glucose, use OGTT, or consider CGM if suspicion persists [^113RXHy2] [^1167jh24].
- **Use OGTT**: More sensitive than fasting glucose or A1c for detecting early diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance [^113yiD4Q].
- **Consider non-glycemic factors**: Evaluate for anemia, hemoglobinopathies, or conditions affecting A1c accuracy [^115UQikT].

---

## Clinical management strategies

Management should be **individualized** based on risk, comorbidities, and patient preference:

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and physical activity reduce progression risk [^112V18qs].
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Consider metformin in high-risk patients (e.g. age < 60, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m², or prior gestational diabetes) [^112V18qs].
- **Monitoring**: Periodic reassessment with fasting glucose, A1c, or OGTT to detect progression [^113RXHy2].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Fasting glucose and A1c measure different aspects** of glycemia, so discordance is expected [^115BnvBr].
- **Early beta-cell dysfunction, dawn phenomenon, stress, and altered RBC turnover** can raise fasting glucose while A1c remains normal [^1132DUGg] [^115UQikT].
- **Discordance signals increased diabetes risk** and warrants confirmation and risk stratification [^112TSrMD].
- **Confirm with repeat testing, OGTT, or CGM**, and tailor management to risk and patient factors [^113RXHy2] [^1167jh24].

---

Fasting glucose can be high while A1c is normal because fasting glucose reflects a single time-point and is sensitive to dawn phenomenon, stress, or acute illness, whereas A1c reflects a 2–3 month average and may be normal if postprandial glucose is controlled or if red cell turnover is altered. This discordance is common in early diabetes or prediabetes, and **confirm with repeat fasting glucose, OGTT, or CGM** if suspicion remains [^113RXHy2] [^1167jh24].

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^1168sZ2n]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, we found that IFG and elevated HbA 1c are associated with increased odds for subsequent diabetes in older adults. Obtaining both tests improves the ability to predict diabetes occurrence. Older adults with both IFG and elevated HbA 1c are at very high risk for diabetes, whereas those with two normal tests are unlikely to develop the disease over the next 7 years. Future studies of new-onset diabetes in older adults are needed to better understand the natural history of this condition and to document the effect of diabetes screening on clinical outcomes in the elderly.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^113FddiG]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine which measures-impaired fasting glucose (IFG), elevated HbA1c, or both-best predict incident diabetes in older adults.

Research Design and Methods

From the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study, we selected individuals without diabetes, and we defined IFG (100–125 mg/dL) and elevated HbA1c (5.7–6.4%) per American Diabetes Association guidelines. Incident diabetes was based on self-report, use of antihyperglycemic medicines, or HbA1c ≥ 6.5% during 7 years of follow-up. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, site, BMI, smoking, blood pressure, and physical activity. Discrimination and calibration were assessed for models with IFG and with both IFG and elevated HbA1c.

Results

Among 1,690 adults (mean age 76.5, 46% men, 32% black), 183 (10.8%) developed diabetes over 7 years. Adjusted odds ratios of diabetes were 6.2 (95% CI 4.4–8.8) in those with IFG (versus those with fasting plasma glucose [FPG] < 100 mg/dL) and 11.3 (7.8–16.4) in those with elevated HbA1c (versus those with HbA1c < 5.7%). When FPG and HbA1c were considered together, odds ratios were 3.5 (1.9–6.3) in those with IFG only, 8.0 (4.8–13.2) in those with elevated HbA1c only, and 26.2 (16.3–42.1) in those with both IFG and elevated HbA1c (versus those with normal FPG and HbA1c). Addition of elevated HbA1c to the model with IFG resulted in improved discrimination and calibration.

Conclusions

Older adults with both IFG and elevated HbA1c have a substantially increased odds of developing diabetes over 7 years. Combined screening with FPG and HbA1c may identify older adults at very high risk for diabetes.

### Prediabetes [^113MwR1P]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes or intermediate hyperglycaemia represents a preliminary stage in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition to an increased likelihood of developing T2DM, individuals with prediabetes have an elevated risk of various vascular and non-vascular complications. No consensus has been achieved on the ideal screening strategy for prediabetes, with fasting plasma glucose concentration, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and the oral glucose tolerance test being the most frequently measured parameters. The two major phenotypes of prediabetes, that is, impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, may represent different pathophysiologies with varying natural history, risk of adverse outcomes and responsiveness to treatment. Most of the evidence for managing prediabetes focuses on lifestyle modification with or without medications in individuals with overweight or obesity and impaired glucose tolerance. Whether these interventions are beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose and those of normal body weight is unclear, as is the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of pharmacotherapy for treating prediabetes. Large-scale national T2DM prevention programmes are currently under way to assess whether the benefits of interventions for prediabetes can be translated to the community setting.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is a growing global public health concern, affecting over 537 million individuals worldwide — over 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Even more people are affected by pre‐diabetes, an intermediate stage between normoglycaemia and diabetes, although the introduction of this term has caused some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. Detection of diabetes and pre‐diabetes aims to identify individuals at increased risk of macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (e.g. retinopathy) and inform subsequent interventions, including pharmacological treatment. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have been revised several times over the past few decades. Two‐hour post‐load glucose (2hPG) was first used to diagnose diabetes, and then fasting blood glucose (FPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were added to the diagnostic criteria. Likewise, the criteria for diagnosing pre‐diabetes include impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and elevated HbA1c. According to the latest guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes or pre‐diabetes can be made when any of these glycaemic indicators exceed their respective thresholds. Although diagnostic practice in other countries or populations may vary in terms of the more commonly used diagnostic measures (e.g. whether HbA1c testing is preferred), the cutoffs adopted (e.g. the lower thresholds of FPG and HbA1c for diagnosing pre‐diabetes) and diagnostic rigour (e.g. whether repeat testing is required if the first testing is positive), most countries' guidelines recommend that 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c can all be used for the diagnosis of diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The increase in the number of diagnostic measures would inevitably increase the number of new cases and prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, because the test results of different diagnostic measures do not align with each other perfectly. For example, in the case of isolated FPG elevation, the FPG level exceeds the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, while 2hPG and HbA1c are 'normal'

### Reframing prediabetes: a call for better risk stratification and intervention [^111VxgLJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose homeostasis whereby plasma glucose concentrations are above normal but below the threshold of diagnosis for diabetes. Over the last several decades, criteria for prediabetes have changed as the cut points for normal glucose concentration and diagnosis of diabetes have shifted. Global consensus does not exist for prediabetes criteria; as a result, the clinical course and risk for type 2 diabetes vary. At present, we can identify individuals with prediabetes based on three glycemic tests (hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test). The majority of individuals diagnosed with prediabetes meet only one of these criteria. Meeting one, two, or all glycemic criteria changes risk for type 2 diabetes, but this information is not widely known and does not currently guide intervention strategies for individuals with prediabetes. This review summarizes current epidemiology, prognosis, and intervention strategies for individuals diagnosed with prediabetes and suggests a call for more precise risk stratification of individuals with prediabetes as elevated (one prediabetes criterion), high risk (two prediabetes criteria), and very high risk (three prediabetes criteria). In addition, the roles of oral glucose tolerance testing and continuous glucose monitoring in the diagnostic criteria for prediabetes need reassessment. Finally, we must reframe our goals for prediabetes and prioritize intensive interventions for those at high and very high risk for type 2 diabetes.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^116h8fK2]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Few data on the actual incidence of new-onset diabetes in elderly individuals exist in the prior literature. In our study of older adults, 10.8% of participants developed diabetes over 7 years (roughly approximating an annual incidence of ∼1.5% per year), which is similar to the annual incidence of diabetes among persons ≥ 65 years old in the U.S. (1.5% in 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control estimates). The effect of elevated HbA 1c and IFG on the odds of diabetes was comparable in our study with the effect observed in younger populations, although elevated HbA 1c appeared to be a stronger predictor in our study. Proportions of Health ABC participants who developed diabetes over 7 years were 10.6, 21.3, 47.9, and 3.4% in those with IFG alone, elevated HbA 1c alone, both IFG and elevated HbA 1c, and normal parameters at baseline, respectively (compared with the incidence of diabetes over 5 years of 8.5, 7.3, 37.6, and 1.1%, respectively, in the Japanese study) (mean age of 49.9 years).

The ADA guidelines recommend the use of either test, HbA 1c or FPG, to identify individuals at risk for diabetes. Another option is to measure both tests, either simultaneously or in sequence, but this strategy is more costly. Several investigators have specifically evaluated whether obtaining two tests is better than either one alone in predominantly younger populations. In studies conducted in Japan and China, the ability to predict diabetes with both FPG and HbA 1c was significantly better than with either one alone. In a U.S. study, the incidence of diabetes was substantially increased in those with elevated FPG and HbA 1c compared with those with only one elevated test, but more detailed analyses of combined testing were not performed.

In the Health ABC study, over 7 years, diabetes developed in roughly one of four participants with IFG and one of three participants with elevated HbA 1c — when only one of these tests was considered. When both tests were considered together, the probability of diabetes was only 1–2 in 10 for participants with one elevated value (HbA 1c or FPG) and close to 1 in 2 for those with both elevated values. Interestingly, when the WHO definition of IFG was applied (FPG 110 to < 126 mg/dL), participants with this type of IFG had a similar 1 in 2 probability of developing diabetes over time.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^115q9jH7]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100–125 mg/dL) has been traditionally used for identifying persons at high risk for the subsequent development of diabetes in the U.S. Recent guidelines have additionally endorsed the use of HbA 1c 5.7–6.4% to identify those at risk. However, multiple studies, including one conducted among older persons, suggest that HbA 1c may identify different individuals at risk for diabetes than traditional glucose measures. Although several recent investigations confirm that HbA 1c is strongly predictive of future diabetes in predominantly middle-aged populations, less is known about how well HbA 1c identifies older persons at risk for diabetes.

Despite the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the elderly (10.9 million Americans in 2010) and the high incidence (390,000 new cases in 2010) of late-onset type 2 diabetes (> 65 years), there are few specific studies on prediction of diabetes in this group. One such study, based on an earlier Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) analysis, developed a prediction rule for diabetes development, which included several factors: advanced age, female sex, elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglyceride levels. However, HbA 1c was not examined as a potential predictor. In the Cardiovascular Health Study of men and women ≥ 65 years of age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and weight gain were associated with a higher risk of diabetes, but the impact of glycemic measures on diabetes was not specifically examined. An Italian study of older adults (age 65–84 years) found that the combination of abnormal FPG (defined using World Health Organization [WHO] criteria: 110 to < 126 mg/dL), increased waist circumference, and HbA 1c ≥ 7.0% increased the probability of incident diabetes roughly 14-fold. However, neither a direct comparison of current prediabetes categories (based upon FPG and HbA 1c) for prediction of diabetes nor an analysis of the utility of combined testing has previously been conducted in this population.

We therefore evaluated the odds for diabetes based upon baseline IFG and elevated HbA 1c among the participants of the longitudinal Health ABC study. We directly compared FPG- and HbA 1c -based criteria for predicting the eventual development of diabetes, and we evaluated the utility of combined testing for identifying older persons who develop diabetes. Since HbA 1c values are consistently higher in blacks compared with whites, we additionally explored race differences in diabetes prediction.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^116AM82n]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

Sensitivity analyses

When we used diabetes definition based solely on 1) self-report; 2) self-report or use of diabetes medications only; 3) self-report, use of diabetes medications, FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, or HbA 1c ≥ 6.5%; or 4) self-report, use of medications, or FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL, 95, 107, 199, and 141 individuals were identified as having incident diabetes, respectively. Logistic regression analyses using these definitions yielded qualitatively similar results to those of the primary analysis; however, IFG was a stronger predictor in models that used FPG-based outcomes. Results based on these definitions are shown in the, with detailed results presented for the outcome based on self-report, use of medications, FPG, or HbA 1c. Cox proportional hazards regression based on the primary outcome (self-report, use of medications, or HbA 1c ≥ 6.5%) showed the following fully adjusted hazard ratios (HRs): 3.4 (95% CI 1.9–6.0), 7.6 (4.8–12.0), and 21.2 (14.0–32.3) for IFG only, elevated HbA 1c only, and both IFG and elevated HbA 1c, respectively. Fine and Gray analysis to account for competing risk of death yielded essentially the same HRs.

When we used the WHO definition of IFG (FPG 110 to < 126 mg/dL), diabetes developed in 48% of those with the WHO definition of IFG (48 of 100). However, of 183 participants who developed diabetes, 135 did not have IFG according to WHO. The odds ratio for diabetes in the fully adjusted model was 11.4 (95% CI 7.1–18.4) in those with a WHO IFG (c index 0.72 [0.68–0.77]). When both WHO IFG and elevated HbA 1c were considered together, diabetes developed in 3.6% (46 of 1,279) of those with both normal tests, 34.3% (12 of 35) of those with WHO-defined IFG only, 28.6% (89 of 311) of those with elevated HbA 1c only, and 55.4% (36 of 65) of those with both abnormal tests.

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^113Rqai3]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are both used to diagnose diabetes, but these measurements can identify different people as having diabetes. We used data from 117 population-based studies and quantified, in different world regions, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, and whether those who were previously undiagnosed and detected as having diabetes in survey screening, had elevated FPG, HbA1c or both. We developed prediction equations for estimating the probability that a person without previously diagnosed diabetes, and at a specific level of FPG, had elevated HbA1c, and vice versa. The age-standardized proportion of diabetes that was previously undiagnosed and detected in survey screening ranged from 30% in the high-income western region to 66% in south Asia. Among those with screen-detected diabetes with either test, the age-standardized proportion who had elevated levels of both FPG and HbA1c was 29–39% across regions; the remainder had discordant elevation of FPG or HbA1c. In most low- and middle-income regions, isolated elevated HbA1c was more common than isolated elevated FPG. In these regions, the use of FPG alone may delay diabetes diagnosis and underestimate diabetes prevalence. Our prediction equations help allocate finite resources for measuring HbA1c to reduce the global shortfall in diabetes diagnosis and surveillance.

Development of diabetes

From baseline to year 7, 183 (10.8%) participants developed diabetes based upon self-report, medication use, or HbA 1c ≥ 6.5%. Among the 183 participants with incident diabetes, 102 (55.7%) were white and 83 (45.4%) were men (Table 2). Black race and BMI were significantly associated with development of diabetes in bivariate analyses.

Table 2
Characteristics of participants who did and did not develop diabetes during follow-up

Among individuals with IFG (irrespective of HbA 1c) and elevated HbA 1c (irrespective of FPG) at baseline, 28.2 and 33.2% developed diabetes, respectively. In fully adjusted logistic regression models, the odds ratios for diabetes were 6.2 (95% CI 4.4–8.8) and 11.3 (7.8–16.4) in those with IFG and elevated HbA 1c, respectively. The c indices (for the two fully adjusted models with IFG and elevated HbA 1c) were 0.76 (95% CI 0.72–0.79) and 0.81 (0.77–0.84), respectively.

When categorized into four mutually exclusive groups, diabetes developed in 3.4% of those with normal FPG and HbA 1c, 10.6% of those with IFG only, 21.3% of those with elevated HbA 1c only, and 47.9% of those with both IFG and elevated HbA 1c (P value for comparison across categories < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, the odds ratios for diabetes were 3.5 (95% CI 1.9–6.3) in those with IFG only, 8.0 (4.8–13.2) in those with elevated HbA 1c only, and 26.2 (16.3–42.1) in those with both IFG and elevated HbA 1c.

### The relationship of postprandial glucose to HbA1c [^111ytkPL]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

The gold standard for the assessment of the overall glycemic control is the determination of HbA1c. There are, however, insufficient data to determine reliably the relative contribution of fasting and postprandial plasma glucose to HbA1c. Increasing evidence suggests that excessive excursions of postprandial glucose might be important for the development of micro- and macroangiopathic complications. With respect to the treatment options, one important question to be answered is whether premeal, postmeal or fasting plasma glucose, alone or in combination, will be necessary in adjusting the therapy to achieve optimal HbA1c levels while minimizing hypoglycemia. HbA1c is difficult to predict from fasting plasma glucose. There are indications that there is a shift in the relative contribution from postprandial glucose at good to fair HbA1c levels (< 7.3% to < 9.2%) to fasting plasma glucose at high HbA1c (> 9.3%). There is also a better correlation of afternoon and evening plasma glucose with HbA1c than with prebreakfast and prelunch plasma glucose values. Since the definition on how to define postprandial glucose is still a matter of debate and since postprandial glucose depends on the premeal blood glucose level and, on the time of the meal, its size and composition and the therapeutic strategy, the data so far available are inconclusive and the best correlation of HbA1c is with the area under the glucose profiles. Continuous glucose monitoring under daily life conditions will be the key to definitely unravel the relationship among HbA1c and fasting, premeal, postprandial and postabsorptive plasma glucose.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^113nCeoA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2-h post-load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over-diagnosis and over-treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost-effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g., 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre-diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre-diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross-sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross-sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre-diabetes. A 10-item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta-analysed across eligible studies with the random-effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta-analyses were conducted for pre-diabetes.

Results

Thirty-two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289094) and 15 on pre-diabetes (n = 221988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty-four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre-diabetes (n = 133621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre-diabetes.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^1146F9Wo]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

It is unclear why nondiabetic non-Hispanic blacks have consistently higher A1C values even in the setting of normal fasting glucose levels and after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics. Further research should be conducted to determine whether this disparity stems from racial differences in postprandial glycemia or from racial differences in the tendency of hemoglobin to undergo glycosylation.

This study has several strengths including the large, nationally representative sample of healthy, nondiabetic individuals. We benefited from the rigorous measurement of risk factors using standardized protocols and strict quality control data collection and laboratory procedures in NHANES. Important limitations include the cross-sectional design, which limits our conclusions regarding the temporality of the observed associations. In addition, we had only a single measurement of fasting glucose. The American Diabetes Association recommends repeating an elevated fasting glucose measurement to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. The use of a single measurement of fasting glucose rather than two will overestimate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Nonetheless, interpretation of single measurements of fasting glucose and A1C as analyzed in this study reflects a common clinical decision-making setting. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of laboratory differences over time, calibration of A1C to account for the change in laboratories in 2005–2006 using a published equation did not appreciably alter our results. The lack of OGTT data in the fasting glucose subsample for all survey years is an important limitation of this study. Nonetheless, similar results were obtained in multivariable models using the OGTT measurements in the subgroup from the 2005–2006 NHANES.

To date, the diagnostic utility of A1C has largely been assessed by its accuracy (as measured by its sensitivity and specificity) to detect glucose-defined cases of diabetes. The concordance of A1C with fasting glucose is important and, as confirmed by our data, an A1C ≥ 6.5% is specific for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes defined by a single fasting glucose level. Thus, it seems reasonable to adopt a single elevated A1C value as being diagnostic for diabetes. However, the real test of utility for A1C as a screening or diagnostic test of diabetes is its association with long-term clinical outcomes in an initially nondiabetic population specifically in comparison with fasting glucose levels. To address this question we need large, observational studies of A1C in populations of individuals without diabetes.

### Development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with intermediate hyperglycaemia [^112TSrMD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intermediate hyperglycaemia (IH) is characterised by one or more measurements of elevated blood glucose concentrations, such as impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These levels are higher than normal but below the diagnostic threshold for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The reduced threshold of 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for defining IFG, introduced by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) in 2003, substantially increased the prevalence of IFG. Likewise, the lowering of the HbA1c threshold from 6.0% to 5.7% by the ADA in 2010 could potentially have significant medical, public health and socioeconomic impacts.

Objectives

To assess the overall prognosis of people with IH for developing T2DM, regression from IH to normoglycaemia and the difference in T2DM incidence in people with IH versus people with normoglycaemia.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, ClincialTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal up to December 2016 and updated the MEDLINE search in February 2018. We used several complementary search methods in addition to a Boolean search based on analytical text mining.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective cohort studies investigating the development of T2DM in people with IH. We used standard definitions of IH as described by the ADA or World Health Organization (WHO). We excluded intervention trials and studies on cohorts with additional comorbidities at baseline, studies with missing data on the transition from IH to T2DM, and studies where T2DM incidence was evaluated by documents or self-report only.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author extracted study characteristics, and a second author checked the extracted data. We used a tailored version of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for assessing risk of bias. We pooled incidence and incidence rate ratios (IRR) using a random-effects model to account for between-study heterogeneity. To meta-analyse incidence data, we used a method for pooling proportions. For hazard ratios (HR) and odds ratios (OR) of IH versus normoglycaemia, reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI), we obtained standard errors from these CIs and performed random-effects meta-analyses using the generic inverse-variance method. We used multivariable HRs and the model with the greatest number of covariates. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework.

Main Results

We included 103 prospective cohort studies. The studies mainly defined IH by IFG 5.6 (FPG mmol/L 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L or 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IFG 6.1 (FPG 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L or 110 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL), IGT (plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L to 11.1 mmol/L or 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL two hours after a 75 g glucose load on the oral glucose tolerance test, combined IFG and IGT (IFG/IGT), and elevated HbA1c (HbA1c 5.7: HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4% or 39 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol; HbA1c 6.0: HbA1c 6.0% to 6.4% or 42 mmol/mol to 46 mmol/mol). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 24 years. Ninety-three studies evaluated the overall prognosis of people with IH measured by cumulative T2DM incidence, and 52 studies evaluated glycaemic status as a prognostic factor for T2DM by comparing a cohort with IH to a cohort with normoglycaemia. Participants were of Australian, European or North American origin in 41 studies; Latin American in 7; Asian or Middle Eastern in 50; and Islanders or American Indians in 5. Six studies included children and/or adolescents. Cumulative incidence of T2DM associated with IFG 5.6, IFG 6.1, IGT and the combination of IFG/IGT increased with length of follow-up. Cumulative incidence was highest with IFG/IGT, followed by IGT, IFG 6.1 and IFG 5.6. Limited data showed a higher T2DM incidence associated with HbA1c 6.0 compared to HbA1c 5.7. We rated the evidence for overall prognosis as of moderate certainty because of imprecision (wide CIs in most studies). In the 47 studies reporting restitution of normoglycaemia, regression ranged from 33% to 59% within one to five years follow-up, and from 17% to 42% for 6 to 11 years of follow-up (moderate-certainty evidence). Studies evaluating the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia reported different effect measures (HRs, IRRs and ORs). Overall, the effect measures all indicated an elevated risk of T2DM at 1 to 24 years of follow-up. Taking into account the long-term follow-up of cohort studies, estimation of HRs for time-dependent events like T2DM incidence appeared most reliable. The pooled HR and the number of studies and participants for different IH definitions as compared to normoglycaemia were: IFG 5.6: HR 4.32 (95% CI 2.61 to 7.12), 8 studies, 9017 participants; IFG 6.1: HR 5.47 (95% CI 3.50 to 8.54), 9 studies, 2818 participants; IGT: HR 3.61 (95% CI 2.31 to 5.64), 5 studies, 4010 participants; IFG and IGT: HR 6.90 (95% CI 4.15 to 11.45), 5 studies, 1038 participants; HbA1c 5.7: HR 5.55 (95% CI 2.77 to 11.12), 4 studies, 5223 participants; HbA1c 6.0: HR 10.10 (95% CI 3.59 to 28.43), 6 studies, 4532 participants. In subgroup analyses, there was no clear pattern of differences between geographic regions. We downgraded the evidence for the prognostic effect of IH versus normoglycaemia to low-certainty evidence due to study limitations because many studies did not adequately adjust for confounders. Imprecision and inconsistency required further downgrading due to wide 95% CIs and wide 95% prediction intervals (sometimes ranging from negative to positive prognostic factor to outcome associations), respectively. This evidence is up to date as of 26 February 2018.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall prognosis of people with IH worsened over time. T2DM cumulative incidence generally increased over the course of follow-up but varied with IH definition. Regression from IH to normoglycaemia decreased over time but was observed even after 11 years of follow-up. The risk of developing T2DM when comparing IH with normoglycaemia at baseline varied by IH definition. Taking into consideration the uncertainty of the available evidence, as well as the fluctuating stages of normoglycaemia, IH and T2DM, which may transition from one stage to another in both directions even after years of follow-up, practitioners should be careful about the potential implications of any active intervention for people 'diagnosed' with IH.

### Cost-effectiveness of alternative thresholds of the fasting plasma glucose test to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention in adults aged ≥ 45 years [^1115J3No]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is an intermediate state of hyperglycemia in which fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels do not meet the criteria for diabetes but are consistently elevated above what is considered normal. The concept of IFG has been endorsed by leading professional organizations and adopted as one measure for identifying the high-risk population for type 2 diabetes preventive interventions in clinical settings and large-scale, community-based prevention programs.

Despite the increasing use of FPG testing to identify the high-risk state, the appropriate threshold for the lower limit of IFG remains unclear. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) currently uses 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) as the threshold to define IFG, while the World Health Organization and the European Diabetes Epidemiology Group recommends using 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). Varying standards exist in large part because there is no clear threshold at which an FPG value can be associated with a sharp increase in the risk of future diabetes and its complications. Recent ADA guidelines also recommend glycated hemoglobin (A1C) as a blood test to identify people at high risk for type 2 diabetes and such a continuous relationship with the incidence of diabetes and its complications also has been observed for A1C.

When FPG is used to identify the target population for type 2 diabetes prevention, the choice of the IFG-defining FPG threshold ultimately affects the intervention's cost-effectiveness. A lower FPG threshold would result in more people being eligible for intervention, which would likely lead to more cases of diabetes being prevented or delayed. However, a lower threshold might be less cost-effective because it incurs costs for intervening in a population with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. To better understand the potential cost implications, major clinical and public health organizations called for systematic economic analyses of the FPG thresholds. Our study sought to estimate and compare the long-term cost-effectiveness of alternative FPG thresholds for identifying high-risk adults for inclusion in type 2 diabetes prevention programs.

### Effect of biological variation in HbA1c and blood glucose on the diagnosis of prediabetes [^114bbupQ]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 The diagnostic dilemma

Diabetes can be clinically diagnosed based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2‐hour plasma glucose following a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (2hOGTT) or glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). All three metrics are continuous variables in human populations with no inflection points that differentiate between normal glucose metabolism and chronic hyperglycaemia. Marked overlap in what's normal and what's abnormal led to the use of 'prediabetes' as a clinical diagnosis for individuals with inconclusive test results. Normal, prediabetic and diabetic reference ranges recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) represent the medical community's best estimate of what can be expected in metabolically normal people compared to those with Type 2 diabetes. Periodic prediabetes screening is now recommended for all people between 35 and 70 years of age based on FPG, 2hOGTT or HbA1c. The problem with this multimetric approach is that prediabetes diagnoses based on these three common clinical tests often disagree.,

1.2 Are two metrics better than one?

In an effort to develop a more specific, timely and unambiguous approach to diabetes diagnosis, Selvin et al.proposed a two‐dimensional, single‐sample definition of confirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having both FPG and HbA1c levels above their respective ADA diabetes cutpoints. The investigators used this confirmation‐by‐agreement approach to analyse data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and found that 'A single‐sample confirmatory definition of diabetes had a high positive predictive value for subsequent diagnosis and was strongly associated with clinical end points'. The authors defined unconfirmed undiagnosed diabetes as having either FPG or HbA1c but not both above their respective cutpoints and suggested that diagnostic ambiguity should be addressed by monitoring FPG and HbA1c over time.

### Pitfalls of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes [^1167jh24]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Many health care providers screen high-risk individuals exclusively with an HbA1c despite its insensitivity for detecting dysglycemia. The 2 cases presented describe the inherent caveats of interpreting HbA1c without performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The first case reflects the risk of overdiagnosing type 2 diabetes (T2D) in an older African American male in whom HbA1c levels, although variable, were primarily in the mid-prediabetes range (5.7–6.4% [39–46 mmol/mol]) for many years although the initial OGTT demonstrated borderline impaired fasting glucose with a fasting plasma glucose of 102 mg/dL [5.7 mmol/L]) without evidence for impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose ≥ 140–199 mg/dl ([7.8–11.1 mmol/L]). Because subsequent HbA1c levels were diagnostic of T2D (6.5%-6.6% [48–49 mmol/mol]), a second OGTT performed was normal. The second case illustrates the risk of underdiagnosing T2D in a male with HIV having normal HbA1c levels over many years who underwent an OGTT when mild prediabetes (HbA1c = 5.7% [39 mmol/mol]) developed that was diagnostic of T2D. To avoid inadvertent mistreatment, it is therefore essential to perform an OGTT, despite its limitations, in high-risk individuals, particularly when glucose or fructosamine and HbA1c values are discordant. Innate differences in the relationship between fructosamine or fasting glucose to HbA1c are demonstrated by the glycation gap or hemoglobin glycation index.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^117RVmWh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

Some studies found that the association of fasting blood glucose (FPG) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) elevation with diabetic complications was not statistically significant after controlling for the confounding caused by 2‐h post‐load glucose (2hPG) elevation. Furthermore, inclusion of HbA1c as a diagnostic measure for diabetes has raised some concerns about over‐diagnosis and over‐treatment. This study aimed to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes respectively, by synthesising global data, which can serve as essential parameters in cost‐effectiveness analysis and inform updates of practice guidelines about prevention and control of diabetes.

Materials and Methods

The levels of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c were classified as either 'elevated' or 'normal' Each distinct combination of these markers (e.g. 'elevated 2hPG, normal FPG and normal HbA1c') defined a unique subgroup, resulting in a total of seven subgroups for both diabetes and pre‐diabetes. The contribution of 2hPG elevation to diabetes prevalence was calculated as its proportion among all diabetes cases; the same approach was applied to FPG and HbA1c elevations, as well as to pre‐diabetes prevalence. To retrieve global data, five electronic databases (i.e. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang) were searched from their inception to February 2024. Studies that fulfilled the following criteria were considered eligible: (1) were conducted in adults without previously diagnosed diabetes; (2) were cross‐sectional studies or baseline surveys of cohort studies (which can be regarded as a special type of cross‐sectional studies); and (3) reported directly or allowed for calculation of the proportion of each subgroup out of all diabetes and/or the proportion of each subgroup out of all pre‐diabetes. A 10‐item tool selected from literature was used to appraise the quality of included data. The proportions of each subgroup among all diabetes cases were meta‐analysed across eligible studies with the random‐effects model using the MetaXL software. Similar meta‐analyses were conducted for pre‐diabetes.

Results

Thirty‐two eligible studies were identified, with 25 reporting on newly detected diabetes (n = 289 094) and 15 on pre‐diabetes (n = 221 988) and the majority of them using identical diagnostic cutoffs proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). The mean age of participants ranged from 24 to 68 years (median of mean ages: 51). Twenty‐four studies (75%) were assessed as at low risk for ≥ 7 out of the 10 quality items. In the general population, based on the ADA criteria, the weighted prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes was 15% and 69%, respectively. Among those with newly detected diabetes (n = 24 214), 69% had elevated 2hPG, 44% elevated FPG and 61% elevated HbA1c; 7% had isolated FPG elevation; 20% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Among those with newly detected pre‐diabetes (n = 133 621), 33% had elevated 2hPG, 51% elevated FPG and 68% elevated HbA1c; 17% had isolated FPG elevation; 34% had isolated HbA1c elevation. Sensitivity analyses stratified by participant comorbidities and study quality produced results consistent with the main findings.

Conclusions

The largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre‐diabetes.

### Elevated HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in predicting diabetes incidence among older adults: are two better than one? [^115RAjjQ]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Among the 1,690 participants during the baseline visit, the mean (SD) FPG was 92.8 mg/dL (9.5), and the median was 92.0 mg/dL (interquartile range 86–98). Respective values for HbA 1c were 5.3% (0.4) and 5.3% (5.1–5.6). The baseline characteristics of study participants are presented in Table 1. There were 779 (46.1%) men and 1,152 (68.2%) white participants in the present analysis. Of the study participants, 358 (21.2%) were identified as having IFG at baseline, 376 (22.2%) as having elevated HbA 1c, and 1,125 (66.6%) as having normal glucose tolerance (i.e. neither elevated FPG nor elevated HbA 1c). Among participants with dysglycemia, 189 (33.5%) had IFG only, 207 (36.6%) had elevated HbA 1c only, and 169 (29.9%) had both abnormalities.

### Redefining the diagnosis of diabetes using glycated hemoglobin [^1174PUGe]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Importantly, the relation of A1C to average glucose levels, while good, is not perfect. On the other hand, it is conceivable that this "glycation gap" may actually offer an advantage in that it might better predict the risk of complications in individuals more susceptible to nonenzymatic glycation of a variety of proteins, including those fundamentally important to vascular biology. Nevertheless, we expect a significant amount of controversy in this regard.

Cost and lack of standardization of the A1C test in some countries are likely to be additional contentious issues following the recommendations of the committee. The experts do, however, recognize the difficulty and therefore envision a reasonably balanced approach: for those unable to obtain a standardized A1C test (or an affordable one), to continue to use the well-established methods of glucose testing — fasting and postchallenge glucose — the older diagnostic criteria of which will remain in place. A similar approach should apply to individuals with hemoglobinopathies or other disorders of red cell life span, particularly common in certain ethnic groups, because A1C measurement here may be unreliable.

There is likely to be some initial debate concerning the cut point — A1C of 6.5% — chosen to define diabetes. This is, of course, a problem whenever one coerces a diagnosis, which by definition must be dichotomous, from a continuous variable. Yet, one might argue that even the fasting glucose threshold of 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l), while not entirely arbitrary, represents a point along a continuum of metabolic derangement. Concern will be compounded by the fact that the upper limit of normal for A1C is 6.0%, leaving something of a gray zone between this value and the 6.5% cut point for diabetes. Values herein are not quite normal and yet not high enough to qualify as diabetes. This will predictably create the same confusion that may have arisen in individuals in the categories of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance using the current guidelines. Moreover, the sensitivity of the A1C test in this specific range may be less than optimal. (In this context, it is also very important to recognize that point-of-care testing is not recommended; the standardized assay, which makes the new recommendations feasible, is only available through a clinical laboratory.)

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112ecvmz]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Testing methodology and confirmation — footnotes to criteria: Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least eight hours. FPG is the preferred diagnostic test, but either of the two listed is acceptable; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation, one of these tests should be done on different days. HbA1c should use a clinical laboratory (not a point-of-care) methodology standardized to the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The VA/DoD DM CPG recommends that when HbA1c values between 6.5% and 7.0% suggest diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, this observation should be confirmed with fasting plasma glucose levels to improve diagnostic specificity.

### Can HbA1c replace OGTT for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus among Chinese patients with impaired fasting glucose? [^1117xzUN]. Family Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Background

HbA1c ≥ 6.5% has been recommended as a diagnostic criterion for the detection of diabetes mellitus (DM) since 2010 because of its convenience, stability and significant correlation with diabetic complications. Nevertheless, the accuracy of HbA1c compared to glucose-based diagnostic criteria varies among subjects of different ethnicity and risk profile.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of HbA1c for diagnosing DM compared to the diagnosis by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the optimal HbA1c level to diagnose DM in primary care Chinese patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG).

Methods

A cross-sectional study was carried out in three public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. About 1128 Chinese adults with IFG (i.e. FG level between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/l in the past 18 months) were recruited to receive paired OGTT and HbA1c tests. Sensitivities and specificities of HbA1c at different threshold levels for predicting DM compared to the diagnosis by OGTT were evaluated. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off level.

Results

Among the 1128 subjects (mean age 64.2 ± 8.9 year, 48.8% male), 229 (20.3%) were diagnosed to have DM by OGTT. The sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c ≥ 6.5% were 33.2% and 93.5%, respectively, for predicting DM diagnosed by OGTT. The area under the ROC curve was 0.770, indicating HbA1c had fair discriminatory power. The optimal cut-off threshold of HbA1c was 6.3% for discriminating DM from non-DM, with sensitivity and specificity of 56.3% and 85.5%, respectively. HbA1c ≥ 5.6% has the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value of 96.1% and 94.5%, respectively.

Conclusions

HbA1c ≥ 6.5% is highly specific in identifying people with DM, but it may miss the majority (66.8%) of the DM cases. An HbA1c threshold of < 5.6% is more appropriate to be used for the exclusion of DM. OGTT should be performed for the confirmation of DM among Chinese patients with IFG who have an HbA1c between 5.6% and 6.4%.

### Can' personalized diagnostics' promote earlier intervention for dysglycaemia? Hypothesis ready for testing [^114Jt8NH]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

The risk associated with progression to diabetes as well as for cardiovascular complications increases along a continuum, rather than being threshold-dependent. How can we identify those with glucose levels in the upper reaches of normal who are most in need of a preventive intervention? With present criteria, we are likely excluding many individuals who have heightened risk. We introduce here the possibility of using a "personalized" glucose profile to encourage early intervention in subjects in whom glucose metabolism is deteriorating (on an individual level) but not yet abnormal on a population-based norm. We further suggest that "personalized profiles" of hemoglobin A1c and basal plasma insulin may also help encourage appropriately early intervention. That the first line therapies are so effective, safe and simple make these more sensitive approaches very attractive.

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^112eGoGW]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis of pooled global data showed that the use of either FPG or HbA1c alone might substantially underestimate the burden of diabetes relative to the number of people who would have elevated levels of either glycemic measure, especially in low- and middle-income countries where diagnosis rates are currently low. We also presented prediction equations to help allocate finite resources for measurement of HbA1c in settings where FPG (but not HbA1c) is routinely measured due to logistic or cost constraints. The prediction equations can also be used to enhance diabetes surveillance, to adjust the estimated prevalence in the majority of population-based health surveys which measure only one biomarker.

Our results, based on a large number of studies from different regions of the world, are consistent with a previous smaller study with data from mostly high-income western countriesand with the collective results from studies done in individual countries – in identifying substantial variation in diabetes classified by FPG versus HbA1c across regions. None of the previous studies had sufficient geographical coverage or participants to robustly quantify regional differences in how those with previously undiagnosed diabetes that were identified based on elevation of FPG and HbA1c, in isolation or together, as we did. A study using baseline data from the ORIGIN trial, which covered people with diabetes or prediabetes from 40 countries, did not quantify the concordance and discordance of diabetes based on different biomarkers but its graphical results indicated smaller differences in FPG-HbA1c relationship between Europe and north America than between these regions and Asia or south America. We found that sex, age and BMI were predictors of having concordant versus discordant elevated FPG and elevated HbA1c, which is consistent with results from studies in individual countries. Finally, to our knowledge, our prediction equations are the only global and generalizable tool for predicting the probability of being classified as having diabetes based on one glycemic biomarker based on measurement of another. A previous regression related HbA1c to average glucose(but not fasting glucose). This relationship is currently used by the American Diabetes Association for assessing glycemic controland not for inferring new diagnosis of diabetes. It used data from only 507 individuals, 422 of whom were non-Hispanic White. The data came from ten centers, of which nine were in the United States and Europe. Over half (268) had type 1 diabetes, which is the less common form of diabetes in adults. The conversions did not account for other traits such as BMI and age, nor was the performance of the prediction equation validated in data that were not used in its derivation.

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^111bidT7]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

A1C does reflect the phenomenon of greater hemoglobin glycation at higher mean glycemia and is certainly useful as an objective measure of long-term glycemia in subjects with diabetes. The related concepts that A1C can be used rather than the results of actual patient glucose measurements in accurately ascertaining mean glycemia and that A1C might be useful in the diagnosis of diabetes are therefore highly appealing. One should not, however, expect all subjects to glycate hemoglobin to the same degree for a given level of glycemia, given that a number of lines of evidence indicate that in clinical populations there is heterogeneity in the degree to which this occurs. A1C may not, then, be sufficiently accurate to allow its clinical use in the diagnosis of diabetes in populations of varying age and ethnic background and with illnesses affecting erythrocyte turnover. Moreover, caution appears reasonable before adoption of terminology such as eAG. We need to develop and validate new approaches to understanding glycemic exposure of subjects with diabetes and to develop better approaches to assessment of glycemia among subjects at risk of diabetes. As an example, individuals with increasing fasting glucose when monitored over time appear to be at particularly high risk of developing diabetes, and this may be a promising approach to diagnosis.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^115VDFZQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

More importantly, not all of the newly identified patients are at increased risk of diabetic complications. For example, previous studies consistently found that 2hPG was independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease after adjustment for FPG, HbA1c and non‐glycaemic risk factors, whereas FPG was often not associated with risk of cardiovascular disease after adjusting for 2hPG and HbA1c. These findings suggest that some patients (e.g. those with isolated FPG elevation) may derive little benefit from glucose‐lowering drug treatment in terms of preventing diabetic complications as their baseline risk is low in the first place. Thus, it would be of interest to know the contribution of each glycaemic measure to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, for instance, the proportions of 'individuals with isolated FPG elevation' and 'individuals with abnormal values for two or three diagnostic measures' (who are at different risks of complications), out of all patients detected by the three glycaemic measures. This information can serve as essential parameters in cost‐effective analysis and development of clinical guidelines about diabetes management.

Against this background, we conducted a systematic review to quantify the contributions of 2hPG, FPG and HbA1c to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes, respectively, and to examine how the patients identified by one glycaemic measure overlap with those identified by other measures.

### Tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^11117rvm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This paper discusses tests of glycemia for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, with particular reference to the 1997 diagnostic criteria of the American Diabetes Association. The potential benefits of the lower diagnostic threshold for fasting plasma glucose are not well defined. However, the change in the diagnostic cut-off for diabetes mellitus affects as many as 1.9 million persons in the United States; therefore, the medical and social costs of the lower threshold may be considerable. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is defined by a threshold imposed on the continuous distribution of glycemic levels, typically with respect to risk for microvascular complications. However, the burden of type 2 diabetes relates more to macrovascular than microvascular complications. Because no clear threshold exists for macrovascular complications, a formal balancing of direct and indirect costs with both microvascular and macrovascular complications may be appropriate to establish glycemic thresholds. Because fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and the oral glucose tolerance test all predict diabetic complications yet test reliability is better for fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c than for the oral glucose tolerance test, we suggest an alternative diagnostic approach: If random plasma glucose is elevated (≥ 11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]) and the hemoglobin A1c level is more than 2 SDs above the laboratory mean, then diabetes mellitus should be diagnosed, and management should be based on the hemoglobin A1c level. If the result of only one of these tests is positive, then fasting plasma glucose should be tested to evaluate the patient for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes mellitus. The glycemic threshold for type 2 diabetes should be established by cost-effectiveness analysis. The clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could be streamlined by incorporation of hemoglobin A1c into established criteria.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^1159FJ6e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This study shows that the largest contributors to the prevalence of diabetes and pre‐diabetes are 2hPG and HbA1c, respectively. FPG and HbA1c measurements identify a large number of new cases, with isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations accounting for over a quarter of all diabetes and more than half of all pre‐diabetes. However, not all of the new cases, particularly those with isolated FPG or HbA1c elevation, are at higher risk of diabetic complications or could benefit from treatment. While FPG and HbA1c are convenient to measure, current evidence shows that 2hPG could better stratify the risk of macrovascular complications, and those with 2hPG elevation have been consistently demonstrated to be able to benefit from treatment. Thus, refinement of the diagnostic algorithms for diabetes and pre‐diabetes may be warranted, for instance, through modifying the strategy of joint use of different glycaemic measures or reducing the number of diagnostic measures. To better inform clinical decision‐making and policy development, more longitudinal studies focusing on the prognostic validity of each glycaemic measure and the treatment benefit in individuals identified by them, particularly FPG and HbA1c, are needed, and both macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes should be examined as important outcomes in such studies.

3.4 The proportions of different combinations of, andamong participants newly detected with diabetes

Of the 25 studies reporting data on newly detected diabetes,15 were conducted in the general population and all of these adopted the ADA diagnostic criteria. Meta‐analysis of the 15 studies showed that the weighted prevalence of diabetes was 15% (see Table S4 for results of other scenarios). As shown in Figures 2A and S1, among adults with newly detected diabetes (n = 24 214), 69% (95% CI, 61%–75%; I² = 99%) had elevated 2hPG, 44% (95% CI, 41%–51%; I² = 97%) elevated FPG, and 61% (95% CI, 52%–69%; I² = 99%) elevated HbA1c; 11% (95% CI, 7%–16%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG but elevated FPG (regardless of their HbA1c levels); 7% (95% CI, 3%–11%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG and HbA1c but elevated FPG (i.e. isolated FPG elevation); 20% (95% CI, 12%–24%; I² = 99%) had normal 2hPG and normal FPG but elevated HbA1c (i.e. isolated HbA1c elevation).

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113RXHy2]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^115BnvBr]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Diabetes is associated with debilitating complications such as amputation, vision loss and renal failure, and with increased risk of cardiovascular events, dementia, some cancers and infectious diseases such as severe COVID-19 and tuberculosis –. The diagnostic criteria for diabetes have evolved over time to incorporate hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which is a measure of long-term glycemic status and more convenient to measure for patients than fasting glucose or the 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) –. In contemporary guidelines, any one or the combination of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), OGTT and HbA1c may be used to diagnose diabetes –. With the exception of diagnosis of gestational diabetes, OGTT is now rarely used in clinical practice or population surveillance because of the inconvenience related to the glucose load, 2-h time frame and the two blood draws required for the test. FPG and HbA1c, which are both used in clinical practice and epidemiological research and surveillance, measure different glycemic features, namely basal glucose level (FPG) and average glucose level in the previous 2–3 months (HbA1c). Therefore, individuals may have elevated levels of one or both biomarkers, and FPG and HbA1c may classify different people as having diabetes. Diabetes also has a long subclinical period defined by hyperglycemia and can remain undiagnosed without screening or other mechanisms for early identification.

Some studies have assessed sensitivity and specificity of diabetes diagnosis using either FPG or HbA1c relative to the OGTT or have compared diabetes prevalence based on these different glycemic biomarkers, but most did not provide a direct comparison of HbA1c and FPG –. Most population-based studies on the concordance and discordance of diabetes diagnosis using FPG versus HbA1c have been conducted in a single country or region,– and the only multi-country studyused data largely from high-income western countries. Therefore, there are scant data on how the concordance and discordance of FPG and HbA1c in classifying diabetes vary across regions in the world, and on the factors associated with this variation. The lack of data on the regional variation in diabetes identified based on FPG versus HbA1c means that we cannot quantify the full extent of the global diabetes epidemic and its regional variation, because diabetes prevalence is measured and reported using a single glycemic biomarker in most population-based surveys and analyses –. For example, in the latest global analysis, only ~15% of surveys had measured both FPG and HbA1c.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^117U5J1X]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This analysis suggests that elevated A1C (> 6%) is common in the general population of nondiabetic adults. The overall prevalence of A1C > 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1 million individuals in the U.S. population. Approximately 45% of these individuals have IFG and 45% have fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl. Elevated A1C levels were particularly common among older adults, non-Hispanic blacks, and obese individuals. We found that demographic characteristics and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and its complications including older age, male sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity, lower attained education level, adiposity, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with elevated A1C even in the presence of normal fasting glucose.

Significant advantages of adopting A1C for the screening and diagnosis of diabetes are the high repeatability of the measurement and the high specificity of elevated values for detecting undiagnosed diabetes. Recent recommendations have stated that diagnosis based on A1C should be confirmed using a glucose-dependent test (FPG or OGTT) or by a second A1C. However, glucose-dependent tests are less reliable (repeatable) than A1C. Requiring confirmation of a highly reliable test by one that is less reliable poses problems for the interpretation of any discrepancy between the two values. In a previous study, we analyzed repeated measurements taken ∼2 weeks apart on an unselected sample of individuals without diabetes and found that 100% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7% had a second A1C measurement of ≥ 7% ∼2 weeks later and 80% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5 had an A1C level ≥ 6.5% 2 weeks later (Pearson's r = 0.95). There is little marginal gain to repeating the A1C test within a short (several week) time period. Furthermore, we show in the present study that 92% of individuals with A1C ≥ 7.0% also had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and 77% of individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5% had FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl. At the population level, elevated A1C is rare in the absence of elevated fasting glucose. Additional advantages to using A1C for screening and/or diagnosis of diabetes include national standardization of the assay, the low analytic variability (high methodological quality of the assay, even when compared with glucose), the widespread availability of the A1C test and its current use in the management and treatment of diabetes, and the fact that the patient does not need to fast.

AACE 2022 diabetes guideline — glucose testing and hemoglobin A1C (A1C) interpretation defines normal, prediabetes, and diabetes thresholds using fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG), random plasma glucose (PG), and A1C. Normal: FPG < 100 mg/dL, 2-h PG < 140 mg/dL, and A1C < 5.5%. Prediabetes: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) with FPG ≥ 100 to 125 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with 2-h PG ≥ 140 to 199 mg/dL, and A1C 5.7% to 6.4% for screening of prediabetes. Diabetes: FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL; 2-h PG ≥ 200 mg/dL or random PG ≥ 200 mg/dL + symptoms; and A1C ≥ 6.5% (secondary). A1C should be used only for screening prediabetes and diagnosis should be confirmed with glucose testing; for diabetes, glucose criteria are preferred, the same test should be repeated on a different day, two abnormal test results from the same sample confirm diagnosis, and a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) symptoms does not need confirmation.

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^115DAMq4]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

We assembled a global database of population-based studies that had measured both FPG and HbA1c. Using these data, we quantified the regional variation in the extent of diabetes diagnosis, with diabetes defined as in the Methods. We also quantified, among those who were previously undiagnosed and were detected as having diabetes through screening in the survey, the concordance and discordance of having FPG and HbA1c above common diagnostic thresholds (7.0 mmol l −1 for FPG and 6.5% for HbA1c). We refer to this group as screen-detected diabetes, which is an epidemiological definition, because many clinical guidelines recommend two measurements for diabetes diagnosis –. We then used regression analysis to examine what individual and study-level factors were associated with whether participants with screen-detected diabetes were identified by elevated FPG, elevated HbA1c or elevated levels of both. It has been shown that having elevated levels of both biomarkers has high positive predictive value for subsequent clinical diagnosis and risk of complications, and hence this group is similar to clinically diagnosed diabetes.

Finally, we leveraged the global coverage of the dataset and its large sample size to develop prediction equations that estimate, for any given FPG level, the probability that a person without previously diagnosed diabetes would have HbA1c above the clinical threshold for diabetes had it been measured, and vice versa. We aimed to develop and validate global and generalizable prediction equations that account for both personal characteristics and regional differences. These equations serve three purposes. First, they allow more efficient use of finite diagnostic resources, by identifying some people with below- or near-threshold level for one biomarker (for example, FPG) for measurement of another (for example, HbA1c). Second, they allow the estimation of the probability that a person with a screen-detected elevated level of one biomarker would also have an elevated level of the other, as a confirmation of diabetes status. Finally, the prediction equations could improve diabetes surveillance by allowing estimation of prevalence of diabetes based on both FPG and HbA1c in health surveys that have measured only one of these biomarkers.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115UQikT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic tests for identifying elevated glycemia — Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and/or HbA1c can be used; the FPG test is automated and inexpensive but reflects only a single time point, the OGTT is more sensitive but more time-consuming, costly, and variable than FPG, and some evidence suggests the OGTT is a better predictor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than FPG. HbA1c is a more long-term measure of glycemia with less sensitivity and less variability than glucose tests and can be performed in the nonfasting state; marked discrepancies between HbA1c and plasma glucose may indicate Hb variant assay interference, for which an assay without analytic interference should be used. In conditions with increased red blood cell turnover (e.g., sickle cell disease or hemodialysis), plasma blood glucose criteria should be used to diagnose diabetes; emerging data suggest that genetic variants such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can significantly impact HbA1c levels. There is a strong, continuous association between HbA1c and subsequent diabetes risk, and within the HbA1c spectrum of prediabetes the yearly incidence of diabetes increases from ~3% with an HbA1c of 5.7% to ~9.5% with an HbA1c of 6.5%.

Screening for diabetes and prediabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older without known diabetes, we recommend fasting plasma glucose and/or HbA1c screening to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕). Technical remark: The measurement of HbA1c may be inaccurate in some people in this age group because of comorbidities that can affect the lifespan of red blood cells in the circulation. Although the optimal screening frequency for patients whose initial screening test is normal remains unclear, the writing committee advocates repeat screening every 2 years thereafter, and such screening may not be appropriate for an older patient with end-stage cancer or organ system failure.

### Recommendations… [^1113n6ox]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD. The ADA now states that an A1C of ≥ 6. 5% or previous criteria for fasting glucose or two-hour glucose may be used for diagnosing diabetes. BLOOD GLUCOSE Some studies indicate that the possible risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh the benefits in certain populations, including those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, and a shorter life expectancy because of older age, frailty, or comorbidities. Less strict A1C goals can be used in these persons.

Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Stricter goals might be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those without significant heart disease, shorter disease duration, or longer life expectancy; however, these should be implemented only if they do not cause significant hypoglycemia or adverse effects. The benefits of statins in persons younger than 40 years, or older than 75 years, should be assessed.

All persons with fasting triglyceride levels greater than 500 mg per dL should be evaluated and provided with treatment. Available at: http: //circ. ahajournals. org/content/132/8/691. full.

### Cardiometabolic risk profiles and carotid atherosclerosis in individuals with prediabetes identified by fasting glucose, postchallenge glucose, and hemoglobin A1c criteria [^1132DUGg]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The discordance in the identification of individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes using different metabolic parameters is not entirely unexpected given that measurements of FPG, 2-h postchallenge glucose, and A1C are likely to reflect different aspects of glucose metabolism, and a diagnosis of prediabetes based on IFG, IGT, and A1C highlights the different pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying abnormal glucose homeostasis. In fact, IFG is characterized by a combination of hepatic insulin resistance and defective early-phase insulin secretion resulting in excessive fasting hepatic glucose production that accounts for fasting hyperglycemia. By contrast, IGT is characterized by nearly normal hepatic insulin sensitivity and marked muscle insulin resistance combined with defective late insulin secretion thus resulting in prolonged hyperglycemia after a glucose load. In contrast to the daily glucose picture offered by IFG and IGT, A1C is an indicator of the average blood glucose concentrations over the preceding 2–3 months, accounting for chronic exposure to both basal and postprandial hyperglycemia and, therefore, may reflect a combination of pathophysiologic defects underlying both IFG and IGT. Taken together, the different pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying each glycemic marker help explain the discordant diagnoses of prediabetes based on FPG, 2-h postchallenge glucose, and A1C. However, it is likely that as overt diabetes develops, each underlying mechanism is active, which may help explain the fair concordance between FPG, 2-h postchallenge, and A1C tests to diagnose diabetes.

A central question is whether individuals with prediabetes diagnosed by FPG, 2-h postchallenge glucose, and A1C are at equivalent risk of cardiovascular disease. Elevation in plasma glucose at the prediabetic levels has been shown to be associated with increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease. Longitudinal data on cardiovascular risk comparing FPG, 2-h postchallenge glucose, and A1C in the prediabetic range are sparse, have been focused on mortality, and have reached controversial results. In this study, we observed no differences in cardiometabolic risk profile among the three groups with prediabetes diagnosed by FPG only, A1C only, and both A1C and FPG. By contrast, compared with individuals with prediabetes by A1C only, prediabetic individuals identified by 2-h postchallenge glucose (IGT only and combined IGT/A1C) had a worse cardiovascular risk profile, resulting in a higher Framingham score for 10-year CHD risk and subclinical atherosclerosis as determined by IMT. The latter differences remained significant after adjusting for age and sex using a general linear model with the conservative post hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

### Fasting versus postprandial hyperglycemia as a treatment target to lower elevated hemoglobin A1c [^113z3H7e]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) may need addressing when glycemic control cannot be maintained in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We investigated whether glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels ≥ 7.0% can indicate postprandial defects warranting prandial therapy after optimized basal insulin therapy.

Methods

From 6 clinical trials of insulin glargine treatment, data were pooled from 496 patients with A1c ≥ 7.0% after 24 weeks. Patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were summarized according to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target achievement (< 130 mg/dL), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels, and PPBG increments (ΔPPBG). Basal and postprandial contributions to hyperglycemia were determined.

Results

After 24 weeks of insulin glargine titration, A1c change from baseline was greater in patients with FPG < 130 mg/dL versus ≥ 130 mg/dL (-1.35% versus -1.11%, respectively; P = 0.0275), but with increased confirmed hypoglycemia rates (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL; 4.06 events/patient-year versus 3.31 events/patient-year; P = 0.0170). However, increased severe hypoglycemia rates were observed in patients with FPG ≥ 130 mg/dL. At week 24, postprandial contributions to hyperglycemia increased (> 60% regardless of PPBG). Patients with high FPG had lower, but substantial, relative postprandial contributions versus patients achieving FPG target. A similar pattern was observed according to whether patients had a ΔPPBG ≥ 50 mg/dL after any meal.

Conclusion

After optimized basal insulin therapy, elevated A1c is the most effective indicator of residual PPHG, regardless of existent FPG or PPBG. When confronted with an uncontrolled A1c after reasonable titration of basal insulin, clinicians should be aware of probable postprandial contributions to hyperglycemia and consider prandial therapy.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^116Q5Ha7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The management of pre‐diabetes is more controversial than that of diabetes, both because the huge number of people labelled as having this condition (two‐thirds of which being FPG and HbA1c elevations, as shown by this study) and because of the uncertainty around the causal relation between FPG and HbA1c and diabetic complications. Like the case of diabetes, a large body of evidence shows that the three glycaemic measures, when used individually, were each associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality, but few studies examined their 'independent effects' on the outcomes after controlling for the confounding caused by the other two glycaemic measures. One of the few studies that did so was Lind et al. which found that the 2hPG level in people with IGT was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease after adjusting for FPG, 1‐h post‐load glucose, HbA1c and other major risk factors, whereas FPG and HbA1c were not associated with the outcome when analysed in the same model. However, a limitation of that study was its relatively small sample size (n = 504) and number of outcome events (n = 34). Other studies conducted in people with pre‐diabetes were mostly focused on one or two glycaemic measures only and thus were not able to clarify whether the observed association with outcomes (if any) resulted from confounding caused by other glycaemic measures. Because of this, whether it is justifiable to intervene with or 'manage' pre‐diabetes defined by FPG and HbA1c is open to question. Indeed, several randomised controlled trials have shown that lifestyle interventions and even some pharmacological treatment in people with pre‐diabetes did not lead to reductions in cardiovascular disease or mortality, although the progression to diabetes was slowed down to some extent. Thus, further prospective studies evaluating the independent effects of FPG and HbA1c levels on future diabetic complications among the pre‐diabetes population are warranted.

### Divergence between HbA1c and fasting glucose through childhood: implications for diagnosis of impaired fasting glucose (early bird 52) [^113yyS2R]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

An HbA1c threshold of ≥ 6.5% has recently been adopted for the diagnosis of diabetes in adults, and of ≥ 5.7% to identify adults at risk. Little, however, is known of HbA1c's behaviour or diagnostic value in youth. Our aim was to describe the course of HbA1c during childhood, and its association with fasting glucose.

Research Design and Methods

HbA1c and glucose were measured every year in a cohort of 326 healthy children (162 boys) from 5 to 15 years. Mixed effects modelling was used to establish the determinants of HbA1c and its development over time. ROC analysis was used to determine the diagnostic value of HbA1c in the 55 individuals who showed impaired fasting glucose(IFG – glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol/L).

Results

Glucose rose progressively from 4.3 mmol/L at 5 years to 5.1 mmol/Lat 15 years, and although there were positive associations between HbA1c and glucose, from 10 to 13 years, HbA1c fell while glucose continued to rise. IFG developed in 55 children, but HbA1c exceeded 5.7% in only 16 of them. The maximum area under the ROC curve was 0.71 at the age of 14 (p < 0.001), and the sensitivity and specificity were optimal at 50 and 80% respectively, corresponding to HbA1c of 5.4%.

Conclusions

Although HbA1c retains a positive association with glucose throughout childhood, it is weak, and their trends diverge from 10 years, suggesting that factors other than glycaemia systematically influence the variance of HbA1c in youth. These findings therefore limit the interpretation of HbA1c for the diagnosis of IFG during childhood.

### Glucose metabolism and hyperglycemia [^113B3T4Y]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Islet dysfunction and peripheral insulin resistance are both present in type 2 diabetes and are both necessary for the development of hyperglycemia. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, large, prospective clinical studies have shown a strong relation between time-averaged mean values of glycemia, measured as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and vascular diabetic complications. These studies are the basis for the American Diabetes Association's current recommended treatment goal that HbA1c should be < 7%. The measurement of the HbA1c concentration is considered the gold standard for assessing long-term glycemia; however, it does not reveal any information on the extent or frequency of blood glucose excursions, but provides an overall mean value only. Postprandial hyperglycemia occurs frequently in patients with diabetes receiving active treatment and can occur even when metabolic control is apparently good. Interventional studies indicate that reducing postmeal glucose excursions is as important as controlling fasting plasma glucose in persons with diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. Evidence exists for a causal relation between postmeal glucose increases and microvascular and macrovascular outcomes; therefore, it is not surprising that treatment with different compounds that have specific effects on postprandial glucose regulation is accompanied by a significant improvement of many pathways supposed to be involved in diabetic complications, including oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and nuclear factor-kappaB activation. The goal of therapy should be to achieve glycemic status as near to normal as safely possible in all 3 components of glycemic control: HbA1c, fasting glucose, and postmeal glucose peak.

Patients with a history of well-controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus may require intensified anti-hyperglycemic treatment and close monitoring of fasting glucose levels.

For patients who experience hyperglycemia during treatment with TRUQAP, monitor fasting glucose at least twice weekly, on days on and off TRUQAP, until fasting glucose decreases to baseline levels. During treatment with anti-diabetic medications, monitor fasting glucose at least once a week for 2 months, followed by once every 2 weeks, or as clinically indicated.

Consider consultation with a healthcare practitioner with expertise in the treatment of hyperglycemia and initiation of fasting glucose monitoring at home for patients who have risk factors for hyperglycemia or who experience hyperglycemia. Advise patients of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and counsel patients on lifestyle changes.

Withhold TRUQAP immediately when ketoacidosis is suspected. If ketoacidosis is confirmed, permanently discontinue TRUQAP.

Based on the severity of the hyperglycemia, withhold, reduce dose, or permanently discontinue TRUQAP [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Contributions of fasting and postprandial glucose to hemoglobin A1c [^113fTksp]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the respective contributions of fasting and postprandial plasma glucose to hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Previous studies of diurnal glycemic profiles are reviewed, and glucose values for predicting successful treatment of diabetes are suggested.

Results

By analyzing the results from prior studies of diurnal glycemic profiles, we found that the relative contribution of postprandial plasma glucose was high (70%) in patients with fairly good control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7.3%) and decreased progressively (30%) with worsening diabetes (HbA1c > 10.2%). In contrast, the contribution of fasting plasma glucose showed a gradual increase with increasing levels of HbA1c. By using the same model (the diurnal glycemic profile), we established that post-meal glycemia was a better predictor of good or satisfactory control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7%) than was fasting glucose. The best cutoff values that ensured the optimal balance between high sensitivity and specificity were approximately 200 mg/dL at 11 AM and 160 mg/dL at 2 PM. The cut-point values for predicting treatment success (specificity (3) 90%) were 162 mg/dL at 11 AM and 126 mg/dL at 2 PM.

Conclusion

Postprandial plasma glucose is the predominant contributor in patients with satisfactory to good control of diabetes, whereas the contribution of fasting plasma glucose increases with worsening diabetes. Postmeal thresholds for predicting good or satisfactory control of diabetes are dependent on the timing of the meals.

### Contributions of 2-h post-load glucose, fasting blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin elevations to the prevalence of diabetes and pre-diabetes in adults: a systematic analysis of global data [^114AQzJN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review showed that 2hPG elevation is the largest contributor (69%) to the prevalence of diabetes, followed by HbA1c (61%) elevation and then FPG elevation (44%). Inclusion of FPG as a diagnostic measure increases the number of cases by 11% relatively on top of those already identified by 2hPG, and inclusion of HbA1c further increases it by 20% on top of those already identified by 2hPG and FPG. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for 7% and 20% of all diabetes, respectively. For pre‐diabetes, HbA1c elevation is the largest contributor (68%) to the prevalence, followed by FPG elevation and then 2hPG elevation. Isolated FPG and HbA1c elevations account for 17% and 34% of all pre‐diabetes, respectively. According to the estimate of the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 589 million people are currently living with diabetes. Based on this number and the findings of this systematic review, the numbers of cases with diabetes or pre‐diabetes newly identified by FPG and HbA1c were estimated and shown in Table 3. However, it should be noted that these were extrapolations based on data from multiple sources, with inherent assumptions and potential for overestimation, and should therefore be interpreted as rough approximations with appropriate caution.

### Elevation of fasting morning glucose relative to hemoglobin A1c in normoglycemic patients treated with niacin and with statins [^115P9JZA]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Niacin increases fasting glucose levels, and statins modestly increase the rate of new-onset diabetes. The clinical importance and mechanisms of these effects are not fully explored.

Objective

On the basis of anecdotal observations, we hypothesized that elevated morning fasting glucose may be accompanied by relatively normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients treated with niacin and other lipid-modifying drugs. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis to test this hypothesis.

Methods

The Duke Lipid Clinic database (1994–2007) was screened for simultaneous determinations of fasting morning glucose and HbA1c, yielding 1483 data pairs among 554 subjects. Subjects with diabetes, by clinical diagnosis, medication, or any HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, or nondiabetes were analyzed separately. Repeated-measures linear regression featured glucose as dependent variable and included terms for HbA1c, drug(s), and their interaction.

Results

Regression lines for glucose on HbA1c had altered slopes in the presence of niacin and/or statin use in normoglycemic subjects. The corresponding interaction terms (drug and HbA1c) were significant (niacin P = 0.026, statin P = 0.013). Fibrate use had no effect (interaction P = 0.49). When modeled together, niacin and statin effects were independent. Regression curves in diabetic patients were not affected by lipid medications.

Conclusion

Elevated fasting glucose may be accompanied by relatively normal HbA1c in niacin- and statin-treated patients. HbA1c reflects average daily glucose levels and is likely a better measure of the glycemic effect of lipid medications. Because our data were retrospective, confirmation from randomized trials is needed.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to HbA1c and blood glucose, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to evaluate for the possibility of a problem or interference with either test when there is consistent and substantial discordance between blood glucose values and A1C test results.

### Variation in the relationship between fasting glucose and HbA1c: implications for the diagnosis of diabetes in different age and ethnic groups [^114rspAd]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Our findings have implications for clinical practice as data indicate that HbA1c measurement alone is not sufficient to accurately make the diagnosis of diabetes. Careful attention should be given to older adults of black origin who are at higher risk of incorrect diagnosis of diabetes with the sole use of HbA1c. While combining HbA1c with FPG will improve diagnostic accuracy, there will be cases of discrepancy between these two measures, which is currently resolved by a glucose tolerance test. A potential alternative is CGM that gives a more global assessment of glycemia while also facilitating the calculation of personalized AGR, using both fasting and mean glucose levels, thus further improving diagnostic accuracy. In addition to refining the diagnosis of diabetes, establishing AGR will help with the long-term management of diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism.

Taken together, future work is required to develop additional criteria for the accurate diagnosis of diabetes, particularly in some ethnic groups and older individuals. Moreover, studies are required to explore the role of CGM in diabetes diagnosis, given the wealth of glycemic data provided by these systems and the opportunity to calculate person-specific AGR, which can increase diagnostic accuracy and subsequent management of those confirmed to have diabetes.

### Performance of A1c for the classification and prediction of diabetes [^1151UDpc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

An A1C cut point of 6.5% is highly specific but has low sensitivity for the identification of prevalent undiagnosed diabetes by these definitions. The low sensitivity of A1C does not necessarily mean that A1C has poor test performance; it may be that A1C is more appropriately distinguishing those individuals at risk for subsequent complications. Recommendations for use of A1C for diagnosis, monitoring glycemic control, and guiding therapy in diabetes are largely based on the association of A1C with long-term microvascular outcomes. Epidemiological studies have also demonstrated associations among A1C and risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality in nondiabetic individuals, with substantial increases in risk observed at A1C values ≥ 6.0%. Prospective epidemiological data demonstrate that A1C is a stronger predictor of vascular complications than fasting glucose.

As has been shown in previous studies, blacks were substantially more likely to have elevated A1C values than whites. Nonetheless, we did not observe substantial racial differences in the overall performance of A1C for the identification or prediction of diabetes.

This study highlights a weakness in the literature related to diabetes diagnosis: the lack of confirmatory glucose testing to replicate the typical clinical scenario in which multiple tests are conducted before a diagnosis is made. In studies with no confirmatory testing, A1C will seem to miss a proportion of fasting glucose-defined cases of diabetes. This is partly a function of the short-term variability in fasting glucose. When repeat testing is used, this discordance is reduced. We have shown previously that A1C has substantially lower within-person variability compared with fasting and 2-h glucose. Whereas repeating fasting glucose tests can substantially reduce misclassification, the high reliability of A1C suggests that a single measurement is sufficient for diagnostic classification unless laboratory error or interference is suspected.

For diabetes and other asymptomatic conditions that are clinically defined, diagnostic testing studies should use multiple reference standards, ideally emphasizing those that most closely replicate the clinical setting. Previous studies have highlighted the low sensitivity of A1C for detecting diabetes defined by a single fasting or 2-h glucose measurement. Our data demonstrated improved performance of A1C compared with stronger gold standards that relied on repeated glucose determinations on different days.

### Use of HbA1c in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in the UK. the implementation of World Health Organization guidance 2011 [^113uAs29]. Diabetic Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The WHO was very clear that an HbA(1c) of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) and above is diagnostic of diabetes. They were less clear regarding results that fell below 48 mmol/mol. The WHO recognize that individuals with HbA(1c) values below the cut-off point may still have diabetes, but give no guidance on how to investigate further. It is important that these individuals, who may be at increased risk of developing diabetes, are monitored correctly; a recommended scheme is given in Fig. 2; following these recommendations will ensure at-risk people are not overlooked and will be monitored closely. Even although it is not recommended to combine HbA(1c) with glucose measurement for diagnosis, the WHO did not discount the value of a fasting glucose and an oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose diabetes in selected individuals; it is the responsibility of the investigating doctor to choose how best to diagnose on an individual basis. This new method of diagnosing diabetes will identify a different cohort as having diabetes than is currently being diagnosed; but the process of investigation that does not require a fasting sample makes investigation easier, allowing more people to be investigated.

### Brazilian guideline for screening and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: a position statement from the Brazilian diabetes society [^1142Z7Qk]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

R7. In individuals with normal FPG and HbA1c, with three or more risk factors for T2D, or with a high/very high FINDRISC score, the OGTT IS RECOMMENDED to further investigate for diabetes and prediabetes.

Summary of evidence:
OGTT has a higher sensitivity than FPG and HbA1c and therefore can detect additional cases of T2D in high-risk individuals.
Performing OGTT in individuals with normal FPG and HbA1c but multiple risk factors allows the identification of those who would benefit most from diabetes prevention measures, such as nutritional guidance and physical activity. This can be useful for individual actions or government preventive programs. The accuracy of fasting, 1-hour and 2-hour plasma glucose in Oral Glucose Tolerance Test for identification of diabetes and prediabetes are described in Table 6.

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^112qpLeh]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The strengths of our study include the amount, quality and geographical diversity of data, with studies from seven of eight major world regions. We carefully checked that data on biomarkers of diabetes and previous diagnosis were of high quality and consistent across studies as stated in detail in the Methods. The scale, quality and consistency of data allowed the characterization of the relationship between these glycemic biomarkers and the development of prediction equations that can inform the allocation of resources toward closing the global diagnosis and monitoring gaps.

Our study is also affected by limitations that apply to data pooling analyses, especially those that use data collected in different countries and time periods. Despite our extensive efforts to identify and access data, we had limited data in some regions and none from Pacific island nations in the Oceania region. We did not analyze concordance and discordance with OGTT because few studies, mostly from high-income countries, had data on all three glycemic biomarkers and because the use of OGTT in clinical settings is largely for diagnosis of gestational diabetes and not for population surveillance. The use of OGTT would identify additional people as having diabetes above and beyond those identified with FPG and HbA1c. We did not analyze time trends of diagnosed and screen-detected diabetes, which should be the subject of future work, as conducted for hypertension. Although we checked all data sources and their characteristics thoroughly, and accounted for whether a study had measured FPG and HbA1c in a laboratory or using a portable device, other unobserved differences might remain due to differing methods. Examples include differences in assays used for measuring FPG and HbA1c. We attempted to mitigate these differences by limiting our data to studies with mid-year of 2000 and later, a period over which HbA1c assays were more likely to be standardized, and by including the study-level random effects in our models, which remove the influence of unobserved differences across studies. Beyond our finding that the results were not sensitive to exclusion of studies that used a portable device (Extended Data Table 7), studies that have tested different devices on the same set of samples have found high correlations (> 0.97) among their measurements and between these devices and reference laboratory methods. We did not have consistent data from all studies on other potential determinants of concordant versus discordant elevated levels of FPG and HbA1c, such as genetics, fasting duration, time between puncture and centrifuge, measures of insulin resistance and pre-existing disease status and comorbidities (for example, liver disease, hemoglobinopathies and anemia) that might have differential influence on FPG and HbA1c. These variables should ideally be the subject of coordinated multicenter studies with consistent data collection methods in different regions and populations; however, such studies would be very costly especially as the number of outcomes and variables increases. There is intraindividual variation in FPG, and to a lesser extent HbA1c, which could reduce the concordance between FPG and HbA1c, and repeated measurements of FPG may improve its concordance with HbA1c. Finally, while the studies that were used to define the diagnostic cutoff points were all based on single measurements of glycemia, as are epidemiological and surveillance studies. many clinical guidelines recommend using a second confirmatory test for diabetes diagnosis and initiating treatment – (we note that there is variation in this guidance, for example while the American Diabetes Association requires two above-threshold tests for diagnosing diabetes in most cases, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes only advises doing so, the World Health Organization only recommends repeated testing for asymptomatic patients, and the International Diabetes Federation further limits repeated testing to when the first measurement is close to the threshold for diagnosis). A key reason for clinical guidelines recommending a confirmatory test is to minimize risks of erroneous results, for example, due to mis-recording of laboratory results or large intraindividual variability (which is more relevant for FPG than HbA1c), potentially leading to a lifelong (mis-)diagnosis for an individual patient. This is not a relevant issue in prevalence studies in a population, as random measurement error and fluctuations in one direction are approximately balanced by those in the opposite direction. Reflecting the difference between the clinical and epidemiological approaches to diabetes definition, we referred to those without a previous diagnosis who had biomarker levels above the clinical thresholds as screen-detected diagnosis, and our prediction equations should be considered a tool for triaging some people at specific levels of FPG for measurement of HbA1c, and possibly vice versa, rather than a tool for conferring a diagnosis.

### Prediabetes and risk of heart failure: the link grows stronger [^116JpLdK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Prediabetes, also termed "intermediate hyperglycemia", is an intermediate metabolic state between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and normoglycemia and includes patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IFG is defined as an elevated fasting glucose concentration, and IGT is defined as a high 2-h plasma glucose concentration during an oral glucose tolerance test that does not reach the diagnostic cut-off point for diabetes. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)-based definitions of prediabetes have also recently been advocated. Although individuals in all three of these categories have been shown to have an increased risk of progression to T2DM, each condition has a different pathophysiology that does not completely overlap with the others. Furthermore, the cut-off points for diagnosing prediabetes using the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c concentrations remain controversial. Great debate has surrounded the lower cut-off point proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline, which recommends using an FPG concentration of 100 to 125 mg/dL or HbA1c concentration of 5.7–6.4% to define prediabetes. The counterargument is that the definition of prediabetes proposed by the ADA guideline significantly increases the prevalence of blood glucose dysregulation with no clear association with diabetic complications. Although meta-analyses of observational studies have provided solid evidence that prediabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, controversy remains.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114kB3Pu]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose diabetes based on HbA1c or plasma glucose criteria, using either the fasting plasma glucose value, 2-hour plasma glucose value during a 75-g OGTT, or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria:

- HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay

- fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) with no caloric intake for at least 8 hours

- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT, performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water

- a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, obtained at any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal.

### A new look at screening and diagnosing diabetes mellitus [^116Edjgu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Diabetes is underdiagnosed. About one third of people with diabetes do not know they have it, and the average lag between onset and diagnosis is 7 yr. This report reconsiders the criteria for diagnosing diabetes and recommends screening criteria to make case finding easier for clinicians and patients.

Participants

R.M.B. invited experts in the area of diagnosis, monitoring, and management of diabetes to form a panel to review the literature and develop consensus regarding the screening and diagnosis of diabetes with particular reference to the use of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Participants met in open session and by E-mail thereafter. Metrika, Inc. sponsored the meeting.

Evidence

A literature search was performed using standard search engines.

Consensus Process

The panel heard each member's discussion of the issues, reviewing evidence prior to drafting conclusions. Principal conclusions were agreed on, and then specific cut points were discussed in an iterative consensus process.

Conclusions

The main factors in support of using HbA1c as a screening and diagnostic test include: 1) HbA1c does not require patients to be fasting; 2) HbA1c reflects longer-term glycemia than does plasma glucose; 3) HbA1c laboratory methods are now well standardized and reliable; and 4) errors caused by nonglycemic factors affecting HbA1c such as hemoglobinopathies are infrequent and can be minimized by confirming the diagnosis of diabetes with a plasma glucose (PG)-specific test. Specific recommendations include: 1) screening standards should be established that prompt further testing and closer follow-up, including fasting PG of 100 mg/dl or greater, random PG of 130 mg/dl or greater, or HbA1c greater than 6.0%; 2) HbA1c of 6.5–6.9% or greater, confirmed by a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test), should establish the diagnosis of diabetes; and 3) HbA1c of 7% or greater, confirmed by another HbA1c- or a PG-specific test (fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test) should establish the diagnosis of diabetes. The recommendations are offered for consideration of the clinical community and interested associations and societies.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113yiD4Q]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose testing — In individuals without symptoms, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, while measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes when symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis are present plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L]. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol diagnoses more diabetes than the other two tests and is preferentially recommended for screening for some conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status, and glycolysis and sample handling can affect results; people should follow a mixed eating pattern with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT, and antecedent carbohydrate restriction in the days prior to OGTT can falsely elevate postchallenge glucose levels, potentially resulting in a false-positive OGTT.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^11683ts9]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Standards of Care in Diabetes-2025 — A1C clinical characteristics note that "A1C has several advantages compared with FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (fasting is not required), greater preanalytical stability, and fewer day-to-day perturbations during stress, changes in nutrition, or illness", yet there is "lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point compared with an FPG of 126 mg/dL". A1C reflects erythrocyte life span "(~120 days)" yielding a weighted average, and "clinically meaningful changes in A1C can be seen in < 120 days".

### Global variation in diabetes diagnosis and prevalence based on fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c [^111TrPfh]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The observed variation in the composition of screen-detected diabetes across regions may be due to a number of factors. Some genetic and phenotypic factors that affect fasting glucose and glucose metabolism through their effects on β-cell function and insulin sensitivity may be more common in some regions or ethnic groups –. Other non-glycemic factors, including anemia due to iron deficiency or malaria, certain hemoglobin variants (for example, HbS and HbF), other hemoglobinopathies, polycythemia due to living in high altitude, liver and kidney diseases, HIV and certain drugs such as antiretroviral therapy for HIV, can also affect HbA1c and FPG differently –. Some of these factors, including malaria-induced and iron deficiency anemia, hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, and antiretroviral therapy, are more prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa –, and may have shifted the population distribution of HbA1c or affected its measurement. One study from South Africa found that the impact of these factors on HbA1c were small. Guidelines recommend the use of a glucose test for diabetes diagnosis in those with such conditions. Smoking and alcohol use, which vary geographically, may differentially affect HbA1c and FPG. Finally, the composition of diabetes that was detected through screening in the survey depends on whether those with a previous diagnosis were identified based on FPG or HbA1c. For example, with increasing use of HbA1c in clinical settings in high-income countries, a smaller proportion of people with screen-detected diabetes would have elevated HbA1c.

### Baseline fasting glucose level, age, sex, and body mass index and the development of diabetes in US adults [^114EPACK]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

With regard to choice of diagnostic test, measuring the FPG level has the advantage of being widely available and inexpensive, but the associated fasting requirement is burdensome, and the test is associated with significant biological variation. There is an increasing move toward the use of HbA 1c level, or a combination of FPG level and HbA 1c level for diagnosis of diabetes. Using the HbA 1c level overcomes many of the disadvantages of using the FPG level, but it is more expensive, not as widely available, and may be influenced by factors other than glucose, including race and ethnicity and change in erythrocyte life span. Discriminating based on FPG level vs HbA 1c level will detect different populations, and these tests individually and combined are less sensitive and specific than the criterion standard oral glucose tolerance test. In a study using data from 117 worldwide studies, 29% participants with screening-detected diabetes had elevated FPG levels, 37% had isolated elevated HbA 1c levels, and 31% had an elevation in both parameters. However, 55% of those with screening-detected diabetes in central and eastern Europe and 45% in high-income Western regions had isolated abnormal FPG levels. Both abnormal FPG and HbA 1c levels are associated with increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease, and there are effective approaches for delaying type 2 diabetes across both categories, with more intensive approaches advised for those at highest risk. Based on this evidence, by relying on serial FPG measurements, we will have missed some individuals with diabetes in our cohort and possibly overestimated diabetes among individuals who erroneously did not fast for the test. However, our approach was in keeping with prior studies, and congruent with our study population demographics and the overall practice across REP clinical sites throughout the study period.

### Variation in the relationship between fasting glucose and HbA1c: implications for the diagnosis of diabetes in different age and ethnic groups [^114SFhgf]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

One criticism of the current study is the use of fasting, rather than mean glucose, to calculate AGR and evaluate the relationship with HbA1c. It can be argued that our findings of elevated HbA1c in the black population, particularly women, are due to higher postprandial glucose in this population. However, this is unlikely given previous work showing lower postprandial glucose in black females compared with whites matched for age and body mass index. Moreover, Bergenstal and colleaguespreviously used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to measure mean glucose in 104 black and 104 white individuals with type 1 diabetes and correlated mean glucose to HbA1c in these cohorts. Their findings showed a 0.4% (4.4 mmol/mol) increase in HbA1c of black individuals for a given mean glucose compared with those of white origin. Despite the use of FPG and a population without a previous diabetes diagnosis, our data of 5 mmol/mol (0.46%) increase in the HbA1c at FPG DDC of black females > 50 years compared with Hispanic (or white) males < 21 years old, closely mirror these results. Moreover, these findings are consistent with reports of females requiring more aggressive hypoglycemic therapies to bring their HbA1c to similar levels of male counterparts and may also explains their higher hypoglycemic exposure.

The current findings suggest that non-glycemic factors affect the relationship between glucose and HbA1c regardless of whether mean or fasting glucose is used for the analysis (eg, mean glucose via BGM/CGM or FPG). However, we acknowledge that the population studied will have limited postprandial glucose fluctuations compared with an established diabetes group. Therefore, it remains unclear whether relying on FPG to calculate AGR is valid in a diabetes population on hypoglycemic therapies and future work in this area is required. A large population-based study with high definition HbA1c and regular/consistent glucose readings is needed to deconstruct AGR in subgroups of individuals into its components in order to determine whether observed differences are due to altered glucose uptake and/or variations in RBC lifespan. Moreover, it would be valuable to study how variability in the glucose–A1c relationship impacts long-term diabetes outcomes.

### Confirming glycemic status in the diabetes prevention program: implications for diagnosing diabetes in high risk adults [^112HTxHf]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the ability of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and/or 2-h glucose to confirm diabetes and to determine the proportion of participants with HbA1c ≥ 6.5%.

Methods

Diabetes confirmation rates were calculated after a single elevated FPG and/or 2-h glucose on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using a confirmatory OGTT performed within 6 weeks.

Results

772 (24%) participants had elevated FPG or 2-h glucose on an OGTT that triggered a confirmation visit. There were 101 triggers on FPG alone, 574 on 2-h glucose alone, and 97 on both. Only 47% of participants who triggered had confirmed diabetes. While the confirmation rate for FPG was higher than that for 2-h glucose, the larger number of 2-h glucose triggers resulted in 87% of confirmed cases triggering on 2-h glucose. Confirmation rates increased to 75% among persons with FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and HbA1c ≥ 6.5%.

Conclusions

Only half of the persons with elevated FPG and IGT were subsequently confirmed to have diabetes. At current diagnostic levels, more persons trigger on 2-h glucose than on FPG, but fewer of these persons have their diagnoses confirmed. In individuals with FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl and HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, the confirmation rate was increased.

### Diagnostic criteria for diabetes revisited: making use of combined criteria [^1166NxnU]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Existing cut-offs for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and post-load glucose (2hPG) criteria are not equivalent in the diagnosis of diabetes and glucose intolerance. Adjusting cut-offs of single measurements have not helped so we undertook this project to see if they could be complementary. METHODS: We performed oral glucose tolerance tests and mean levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements on 43 patients referred to a diabetes clinic for possible diabetes. Results of single and combined use of the FPG and 2hPG criteria were evaluated against the levels of HbA1c and results re-interpreted in the light of existing reports in the literature. RESULTS: Our results confirm that the FPG and the 2hPG, being specific and sensitive respectively for the presence of glucose intolerance or diabetes, are not equivalent. They are shown to be indeed complementary and a re-definition of diagnostic criteria based on their combined use is proposed. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that altering single measurement cut-offs for the diagnosis of diabetes and altered glucose tolerance will not result in better outcomes. We present the case for a combined criteria in the diagnosis and definition of diabetes with a FPG ≥ 7 mmol/L AND 2-hour glucose ≥ 7.8 mmol/L being used to define diabetes while a FPG < 7 mmol/L AND 2-hour glucose < 7.8 mmol/L being used to define normality. Discordant values will define impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). This proposal requires prospective evaluation in a large cohort.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^113YzXwF]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of elevated A1C in a large, nationally representative sample of adults without diabetes in the U.S.

Research Design and Methods

We analyzed data from 15,934 participants aged ≥ 20 years without diagnosed diabetes who had A1C measurements in the 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional and nationally representative sample of the U.S. population.

Results

The overall prevalence of A1C > 6% was 3.8%, corresponding to 7.1 million adults without diabetes in the U.S. population. Approximately 90% of these individuals had fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl. Older age, male sex, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, hypercholesterolemia, higher BMI, and lower attained education were significantly associated with having a higher A1C level even among individuals with normal fasting glucose (< 100 mg/dl) and after multivariable adjustment.

Conclusions

A single elevated A1C level (A1C > 6%) is common in the general population of adults without a history of diabetes and is highly reliable for the detection of elevated fasting glucose. Nondiabetic adults with elevated A1C are likely to have impaired fasting glucose and an array of other risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### Fasting plasma glucose concentrations for specified HbA1c goals in Korean populations: data from the fifth Korea national health and nutrition examination survey (KNHANES V-2, 2011) [^113e6iiD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of type 2 diabetes is becoming an emergency worldwide, particularly in East Asia, potentially reaching a pandemic level in the very near future. Although a significant progress has been made in reducing cardiovascular risk factors among Korean patients with diabetes, type 2 diabetes creates a considerable amount of economic and social burdens in Korea due to its long-term and wide-ranging multiple chronic complications. Therefore, it is important to prevent these complications through its early diagnosis and prevention.

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) should be measured for the purpose of screening or diagnosis for impaired fasting glucose and diabetes (hyperglycemic states). However, there are certain limitations with it: patients must fast more than 8 h before getting screened for diabetes and there are numerous factors (e.g. stress, acute illness) that can alter glucose concentrations. Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) is a standard monitoring test for long-term glycemic control and was recently recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes as well although the generalization of the A1C diagnostic level compared with a glucose-based diagnosis may still be debated across ethnic groups. In 2010, The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended the A1C as a diagnostic tool for diabetes and in 2011, Korean Diabetes Association (kDa) has recommend the A1C as a diagnostic criterion for diabetes in clinical practice guidelines for type 2 diabetes. Recent study and recommendation showed average fasting glucose concentrations associated with specific A1C levels. This result can help the clinicians explain the relationship between fasting glucose concentrations and specific A1C levels more easily to the patients, but no study on this relationship has been made in Korea. Although there have been several hospital-based studies that have evaluated appropriate FPG and A1C cutoff levels for identifying patients with hyperglycemic states, it is thought that larger epidemiological studies are required to confirm the correlation between A1C and FPG for the diagnosis of diabetes in Korean population. We conducted this study to examine the relationship between the FPG and A1C for diabetes diagnosis (using the regression equation) and to access the average FPG concentrations associated with specific A1C levels in diabetic patients (using each A1c-based and FPG-based diagnostic criteria) in the recent national representative sample of the Korean adult population.

### Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia: the current status on definition and intervention [^114dkxDC]. Diabetic Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A workshop was convened by the International Diabetes Federation to review the latest information relating to the risks associated with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) for future diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The workshop sought to address three questions: (i) are the current definitions of IGT and IFG appropriate; (ii) are IFG and IGT risk factors, risk markers or diseases; (iii) what interventions (if any) should be recommended for people with IFG and IGT? The determinants of elevated fasting glucose and 2-h plasma glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test (2-HPG) levels differ. Raised hepatic glucose output and a defect in early insulin secretion are characteristic of the former, and peripheral insulin resistance is most characteristic of the latter. Therefore, it is not surprising that the concordance between the categories of IFG and IGT is limited. In all prevalence studies to date only half or less of people with IFG have IGT, and even a lower proportion (20–30%) with IGT also have IFG. In the majority of populations studied, IGT is more prevalent than IFG, and there is a difference in phenotype and gender distribution between the two categories. IFG is substantially more common amongst men and IGT slightly more common amongst women. The prevalence of IFG tends to plateau in middle age whereas the prevalence of IGT rises into old age. Both IFG and IGT are associated with a substantially increased risk of developing diabetes, with the highest risk in people with combined IFG and IGT. Because IGT is commoner than IFG in most populations it is more sensitive (but slightly less specific) for identifying people who will develop diabetes. In most populations studied, 60% of people who develop diabetes have either IGT or IFG 5 years or so before, with the other 40% having normal glucose tolerance at that time. The limited published data suggest that both isolated IFG (I-IFG) and isolated IGT (I-IGT) are similarly associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia, with the highest risk in those with combined IFG and IGT. However, some data have suggested that I-IGT is more strongly associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia (features of the metabolic syndrome) than I-IFG. In unadjusted analyses both IFG and IGT are associated with CVD and total mortality. In separate analyses for fasting and 2-HPG adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors (from the DECODE study) there remains a continuous relationship between 2-HPG and mortality, but an independent relationship with fasting glucose is only found above 7.0 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are continuously and positively associated with CVD and total mortality independent of other CVD risk factors. Life style interventions, including weight loss and increased physical activity, are highly effective in preventing or delaying the onset of diabetes in people with IGT. Two randomized controlled trials of individuals with IGT found that life style intervention studies reduce the risk of progressing to diabetes by 58%. The oral hypoglycaemic drugs metformin and acarbose have also been shown to be effective, but less so than the life style measures. Similar data do not yet exist for the effectiveness of such interventions in people with I-IFG. Larger studies are required to evaluate the effects of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in people with IGT. Cost effective strategies to identify people with IGT for intervention should be developed and evaluated. The use of simple risk scores to assess who should undergo an oral glucose tolerance test is one promising approach, although these will need to be population-specific. In conclusion, IGT and IFG differ in their prevalence, population distribution, phenotype, and risk of total mortality and CVD. The consensus of the workshop was: 1. The diagnostic thresholds for all categories of glucose intolerance should be revisited in the light of the latest evidence. There was no clear consensus (with current evidence) on whether IFG and IGT should be classified as diseases, but they clearly represent risk factors and risk markers for diabetes and CVD, respectively. 2. Both IGT and IFG are similarly associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but IGT is more strongly associated with CVD outcomes. 3. Risks are higher when IGT and IFG coexist. 4. Life style interventions are highly effective in delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes in people with IGT and may reduce CVD and total mortality, but the latter requires formal testing.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic implications of relationships between fasting, 2-hour postchallenge plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c values… [^116rdbND]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Correlation between fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour postchallenge plasma glucose levels in individuals with hemoglobin A1c values of less than 7%. To convert glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.
0555. © 2024 Background Increased fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour postchallenge plasma glucose levels with normal hemoglobin A1c levels are recognized as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. We undertook this study to determine the relationships between FPG and 2-hour PCPG levels over the normal HbA1c range and to assess the need to control FPG and 2-hour PCPG levels to achieve HbA1c targets recommended by the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation, and American College of Endocrinology. Both FPG and 2-hour PCPG levels increased as HbA1c increased and were significantly correlated, but the 2-hour PCPG level increased at a rate 4 times greater than FPG and accounted for a greater proportion of HbA1c. People who met the IDF and ACE HbA1c targets had significantly lower 2-hour PCPG levels than those who met the ADA target, whereas FPG levels were similar. Data from both epidemiological studies6, 7 and controlled clinical trials3-5 indicate that lower HbA1c levels are associated with reduced risks for both microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications. The American Diabetes Association currently recommends an HbA1c treatment target of 7. 0% or less primarily to reduce microvascular complications. 8 The International Diabetes Federation 9 and the American College of Endocrinology, 10 taking into consideration cardiovascular disease, both recommend a treatment target of 6. 5% or less.

The key findings of this study are that with the reference range for HbA1c, FPG and 2-hour PCPG levels are significantly correlated and both increase as HbA1c increases, but 2-hour PCPG levels increase at a much greater rate than FPG levels and.

### Long-term follow-up guidelines for survivors of childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers [^115B14Wo]. PES (2023). High credibility.

Radiation — impaired glucose metabolism/Diabetes mellitus: Screening is Fasting blood glucose OR HbA1c every 2 years. Health links include Nutrition and Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Risk Factors, with counseling on obesity-related health risks. Potential considerations for further testing and intervention are Endocrine consultation, evaluation for other co-morbid conditions including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and overweight/obesity, and referral to a dietitian for blood sugar management. Impaired glucose metabolism may occur as part of metabolic syndrome, whose definitions generally include central (abdominal) obesity and ≥ 2 of elevated blood pressure, atherogenic dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol), and abnormal glucose metabolism; patients who received TBI may develop features of metabolic syndrome without associated obesity. Risk assessment should consider patient factors (family history of diabetes mellitus, pregnancy), cancer/treatment factors (prolonged corticosteroid therapy, e.g., for cGVHD), and pre-morbid/co-morbid medical conditions (obesity).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to screening for diabetes mellitus, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining screening for diabetes mellitus with testing of fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test in all patients after AIS. Guide the choice of test and timing by clinical judgment and recognition that acute illness may temporarily perturb measures of plasma glucose. Recognize that HbA1c may be more accurate than other screening tests in the immediate post-event period.

### Variation in the relationship between fasting glucose and HbA1c: implications for the diagnosis of diabetes in different age and ethnic groups [^117BCYoE]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

In addition to HbA1c at FPG DDC, the current analysis used AGR as an indicator of individual and subpopulation-based differences in the relationship between HbA1c and glucose. AGR is the product of RBC lifespan and glucose uptake into RBCs considering apparent hemoglobin glycation rate constant. Average RBC lifespan affects individual cell exposure to circulating glucose levels. While the average lifespan of RBCs is thought to be approximately 105 days, experimental studies have recorded a 20% variation in mean RBC lifespan between healthy individuals with no pathological hemoglobin abnormalities. This explains the AGR variation observed in the NHANES population, which can be further impacted by cellular glucose uptake.

Among black females > 50 years and Hispanic males < 21 years old, a difference of 5.45 units in AGR corresponded to a 0.47% (5.1 mmol/mol) difference in HbA1c at FPG DDC. In total, 35% of subjects who self-identified as not having diabetes had an FPG DDC that was > 0.5% (5.4 mmol/mol) HbA1c points different from 47.5 mmol/mol (6.5%). While 7.49% had ≥ 1% (11 mmol/mol) discrepancy from 47.5 mmol/mol HbA1c at mean FPG DDC. This indicates that up to a third of individuals can be misdiagnosed as having impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes (when their glucose levels are normal) while others incorrectly labeled as having normal glucose metabolism (when they have abnormal levels). Therefore, characterizing the effects of non-glycemic factors such as race, gender, and age on the relationship between plasma glucose and HbA1c allows clinicians to account for these factors when diagnosing diabetes.

We also compared black females > 50 years and white males < 21 years in a scatter plot of HbA1c versus FPG. Data were divided into four quadrants based on an HbA1c of 39 mmol/mol (5.7%) and an FPG of 5.6 mmol/L (pre-diabetes or diabetes). Among the individuals with an HbA1c that incorrectly leads to a diagnosis of deranged glucose metabolism, these were primarily the older black women. In contrast, individuals with an HbA1c leading to a missed diagnosis of diabetes tended to be the younger white males. These observations correlated with AGR values, consistent with the concept that higher AGR increases hemoglobin glycation for a given plasma glucose level, whereas the opposite would hold true for lower AGR values. Thus, the ability to calculate an individual's AGR could potentially refine the HbA1c–glucose relationship at the personalized level.

### Prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^112V18qs]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Prediabetes is not a diagnosis but rather an opportunity to prevent or delay a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
- Intensive lifestyle programs are the most effective intervention for preventing or delaying a diagnosis of diabetes in patients with prediabetes.
- In patients with prediabetes, metformin therapy will slow the progression to type 2 diabetes, although less effectively than lifestyle programs over time.
- In patients who have had gestational diabetes, the benefits of metformin therapy are similar to those of lifestyle programs. From the AFP Editors. Screening high-risk individuals for diabetes mellitus is essential because approximately one-fourth of Americans with diabetes are undiagnosed. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening all adults 45 years and older for diabetes every three years using A1C, fasting glucose, or two-hour glucose tolerance testing.

Classifying screening test results as indicative of prediabetes shows an increased risk of a future diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and provides an opportunity for prevention. Criteria for prediabetes, including A1C levels of 5. 7 to
6. 4, fasting plasma glucose of 100 to 125 mg per dL, or two-hour glucose of 140 to 199 mg per dL after a 75-mg oral glucose load, identify individuals for whom diabetes prevention will be beneficial. Medications Medications can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes but are less effective than lifestyle programs. Metformin has the strongest evidence, whereas liraglutide, insulin, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, orlistat, and phentermine/topiramate all have some evidence of benefit. Initially, metformin is nearly as effective as lifestyle modification; however, over time, lifestyle interventions demonstrate clear superiority.

In patients with previous gestational diabetes, metformin reduces diabetes incidence by 50%, equivalent to lifestyle changes. Because long-term use of metformin can lead to vitamin B 12 deficiency, monitoring vitamin B 12 levels should be considered. The USPSTF and ADA suggest three-year screening intervals and lifestyle interventions, metformin, or both for patients with prediabetes. This ADA guideline adds more specifics to these recommendations. — Michael J. Arnold, MD, Contributing Editor.

### Letter to the editor regarding "Time in range estimation in patients with type 2 diabetes is improved by incorporating fasting and postprandial glucose levels" [^111xkteP]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We are writing in response to the article "Time in Range Estimation in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes is Improved by Incorporating Fasting and Postprandial Glucose Levels" by Sun et al. published on June 16, 2023. Firstly, I would like to commend the authors for their insightful research on the incorporation of fasting and postprandial glucose levels in estimating the time in range (TIR) for patients with type 2 diabetes. Their study sheds light on an important aspect of diabetes management and offers valuable contributions to the field.

Maintaining stable blood glucose levels is essential in diabetes management. TIR refers to the amount of time an individual spends within their target glucose range (usually 3.9–10.0 mmol/L), making it a relevant parameter for monitoring glucose homeostasis. While HbA1c was previously believed to be the sole criterion for evaluating long-term glucose balance in the body, many researchers have shown its unreliability among people with different ethnic and bodily characteristics. Consequently, measures such as glycemic variability (GV), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) have gained attention in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The article published by Sun et al. provides a well-organized and systematic approach to comparing FPG and PPG with HbA1c in terms of glycemic control, highlighting the nonlinear relationship between TIR and glycemic parameters. The study mentions that previous research has shown severe cardiovascular symptoms even in individuals with normal HbA1c levels, yet the underlying cause of this effect remains unresolved. Although a significant correlation between HbA1c and TIR values is observed, there are still variations when considering HbA1c as a diabetes monitoring parameter. Furthermore, a recent study has demonstrated the unreliability of HbA1c in patients with anemia, hemoglobinopathies, iron deficiency, and pregnancy. Therefore, the cause–effect relationship behind these results has not been fully elucidated by previous studies. The variations observed can be attributed to the diverse characteristics and ethnicities of individuals, as well as factors such as age and sex.

### Elevated A1c in adults without a history of diabetes in the U.S [^115395iu]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Count in millions (95% CI) of persons at different A1C cut points in the U.S. 2000 Census population aged ≥ 20 years without diabetes.

Figure 2 displays the distributions of A1C in individuals with normal fasting glucose (fasting glucose < 100 mg/dl), IFG (fasting glucose 100– < 126 mg/dl), and undiagnosed diabetes (fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl), revealing substantially overlapping distributions in individuals with normal glucose and IFG but a right-skewed distribution in individuals with undiagnosed diabetes. The mean A1C levels in individuals with normal fasting glucose, IFG, and undiagnosed diabetes were 5.2 ± 0.01, 5.5 ± 0.01, and 6.9 ± 0.16%, respectively (not shown). Similarly, the distribution of individuals in the fasting glucose categories (< 100, 100–125, and ≥ 126 mg/dl) varied substantially, depending on the A1C cut point. For instance, among individuals with A1C > 6.0%, 45.6% had undiagnosed diabetes, 45.3% had IFG, and 9.1% had normal fasting glucose. In contrast, among individuals with an A1C ≥ 7.0%, 91.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 6.6% had IFG, and only 1.7% had normal glucose levels. A comparison of the distribution of fasting glucose categories among individuals with A1C > 6.1% and A1C ≥ 6.5% yielded intermediate results. Among individuals with A1C > 6%, 53.3% had undiagnosed diabetes, 38.6% had IFG, and 8.1% had normal fasting glucose. Among individuals with A1C ≥ 6.5%, 76.7% had undiagnosed diabetes, 19.6% had IFG, and 1.7% had normal fasting glucose (supplementary Figure A, available in an online appendix at).

### Fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c as risk factors for type 2 diabetes [^113fYU4G]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

We examined the value of combining fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) as a predictor of diabetes, using the new American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria of FPG and lower cut-off point of HbA(1c).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 1998 to 2006, inclusive, in 10 042 persons (55 884 person-years), with a mean age of 53.0 years at baseline. The cumulative incidence of diabetes (defined either as an FPG ≥ 7.0 mmol/l or as clinically diagnosed diabetes) was measured.

Results

The cumulative incidence and incidence density of diabetes were 3.7% (368 cases) and 6.6/1000 person-years over a mean follow-up period of 5.5 years. The cumulative incidence of diabetes in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and HbA(1c) 5.5–6.4% was 24.8% (172/694 persons) compared with 0.4% (25/6698 persons), 2.5% (15/605 persons), 7.6% (156/2045 persons) in those with normal fasting glucose (NFG) and HbA(1c) < 5.5%, NFG and HbA(1c) 5.5–6.4% and IFG and HbA(1c) < 5.5%, respectively. The hazard ratio for diabetes, adjusted for possible confounders, was 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 4.70 to 11.74) for those with NFG and HbA(1c) 5.5–6.4%, 14.4 (11.93 to 27.79) for those with IFG and HbA(1c) < 5.5% and 38.4 (24.63 to 59.88) for those with IFG and HbA(1c) 5.5–6.4%.

Conclusions

The combination of FPG and HbA(1c) identifies individuals who are at risk of progression to Type 2 diabetes at the new ADA criteria of FPG and a lower cut-off point of HbA(1c) than previous studies.

### Hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, and cardiovascular risk in a population with high prevalence of diabetes: the strong heart study [^111Vs61P]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In summary, increases in A1C were associated with an adverse CVD risk profile, but adjusted models showed a minimal relation between A1C and CVD risk in individuals without diabetes. A1C > 6.5% and FPG > 126 mg/dL both identify individuals with increased independent risk for CVD, and the HR for newly diagnosed individuals is smaller than that for individuals with established diabetes. Although A1C identifies a smaller group of individuals with diabetes, A1C and FPG show similar relations with CVD. A1C concentrations of 6–6.5% can help identify individuals at risk for diabetes and individuals with elevated CVD risk factors that warrant immediate treatment. Thus, in high-risk and underserved populations, such as American Indians, the more convenient A1C measure can be useful clinically. More work is needed to identify the mechanisms of the CVD that progresses with hyperglycemia.

Standards of Care in Diabetes — 2025: A1C-based identification of high-risk states — An A1C range of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) identifies a group of individuals at high risk for diabetes and cardiovascular complications; these individuals should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies to lower their risk, and aggressive intervention and vigilant follow-up should be pursued for those considered at very high risk, such as those with A1C ≥ 6.0% [≥ 42 mmol/mol] and individuals with both impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Analyses also note that A1C of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or higher is associated with a diabetes risk similar to that of high-risk Diabetes Prevention Program participants.

B. Diagnosis of diabetes

Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 2. Three ways to diagnose diabetes are recommended at the time of this statement, and each must be confirmed on a subsequent day unless unequivocal symptoms of hyperglycemia are present. Although the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is more sensitive and modestly more specific than the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to diagnose diabetes, it is poorly reproducible and difficult to perform in practice. Because of ease of use, acceptability to patients, and lower cost, the FPG has been the preferred diagnostic test. Though FPG is less sensitive than the OGTT, the vast majority of people who do not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes by FPG but would by OGTT will have an A1C value well under 7.0%.

Though the OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use, it may be useful for further evaluation of patients in whom diabetes is still strongly suspected but who have normal FPG or IFG (see Section I.C).

The use of the A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes has previously not been recommended due to lack of global standardization and uncertainty about diagnostic thresholds. However, with a world-wide move toward a standardized assay and with increasing observational evidence about the prognostic significance of A1C, an Expert Committee on the Diagnosis of Diabetes was convened in 2008. This joint committee of ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation will likely recommend that the A1C become the preferred diagnostic test for diabetes. Diagnostic cut-points are being discussed at the time of publication of this statement. Updated recommendations will be published in Diabetes Care and will be available at diabetes.org.

C. Diagnosis of pre-diabetes

Hyperglycemia not sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes is categorized as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), depending on whether it is identified through the FPG or the OGTT:
IFG = FPG 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)
IGT = 2-h plasma glucose 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)

IFG and IGT have been officially termed "pre-diabetes". Both categories of pre-diabetes are risk factors for future diabetes and for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Screening for diabetes and prediabetes [^114A23Hd]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is preceded by prediabetes and latent diabetes (lasts 9–12 years). Key dysglycemia screening tests are fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A 1C. Screen-detected T2DM benefits from multifactorial management of cardiovascular risk beyond glycemia. Prediabetes is best addressed by lifestyle modification, with the goal of preventing T2DM. Although there is no trial evidence of prediabetes/T2DM screening effectiveness, simulations suggest that clinic-based opportunistic screening of high-risk individuals is cost-effective. The most rigorous extant recommendations are those of the American Diabetes Association and US Preventive Services Task Force, which advise opportunistic 3-yearly screening.

Section 1 — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) — Diagnosis can be made by any of the following: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (after ≥ 8 h or overnight fast), plasma glucose (PG) concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load following an overnight fast, a random PG concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or hemoglobin A1c (A1c) level ≥ 6.5%. Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or on different days; however, a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms confirms DM.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113bX5nS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society metabolic risk — screening components and interval in adults 40 to 75 years: In individuals aged 40 to 75 years in the office setting, we suggest providers screen for all five components of metabolic risk at the clinical visit, and the finding of at least three components should specifically alert the clinician to a patient at metabolic risk; the main components are elevated blood pressure, increased waist circumference, elevated fasting triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated glycemia, which should be determined either by HbA1c, fasting glucose, or 2-hour glucose with a second test for confirmation using a new blood sample; testing for additional biological markers associated with metabolic risk should be limited to subpopulations; and in individuals aged 40 to 75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus who already have at least one risk factor, we advise screening every 3 years for all five components of metabolic risk as part of the routine clinical examination (Ungraded Good Practice Statement).

### A1c: recommendations, debates, and questions [^1155KHmu]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Several studies presented at the ADA Scientific Sessions added further relevant information. Kim et al. (abstract 991) reported confirmatory information from analysis of the 1999–2006 NHANES data for 10,296 women, 14.4% with iron deficiency and 4.1% with iron deficiency anemia; iron deficiency reduced the prevalence of A1C < 5.5%, and the investigators suggested that it may affect the structure of the hemoglobin molecule, making it easier to glycate and hence elevating A1C in a glucose-independent fashion. Davidson and Schriger (abstract 965) studied the effects of age and race/ethnicity on A1C levels in 2,712 white, Mexican American, and black subjects from the NHANES III population. Among those who did not meet fasting and 2-h glucose criteria for diabetes, 22% of non-Hispanic white and 22% of Hispanic subjects, but 68% of non-Hispanic black subjects, had A1C of 6.5–6.9% with 5, 0, and 10%, respectively, having A1C > 7%. A1C increased by 7 and 10% per decade of age in subjects with normal glucose tolerance and IGT/IFG, respectively.

Gong et al. (abstract 981) presented data from a longitudinal study of 1,838 adult Pima Indians who did not have diabetes at baseline. Diabetes, as defined by fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, 2-h glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl, A1C ≥ 6.5%, or drug treatment for diabetes, developed in 454 subjects over a mean of 7.3 years; the researchers reported no difference among A1C, fasting glucose, and 2-h glucose in predicting subsequent diabetes development, although none had high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 0.68 for A1C, 0.68 for fasting plasma glucose, and 0.71 for 2-h plasma glucose. Thus, in a homogeneous population and one in which A1C is included in the criteria for diabetes, A1C may be as useful as indexes of glycemia in assessment of subsequent diabetes risk. Whether such information can be extrapolated to populations of varying ethnicity and other clinical characteristics is, of course, an important concern.

### Hemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, and cardiovascular risk in a population with high prevalence of diabetes: the strong heart study [^112zmnaN]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) has been the standard measure for diagnosing diabetes. Hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) ≥ 6.5% has been offered as an alternative diagnostic criterion on the basis of the relationship between A1C and microvascular complications. A1C and FPG measure differing aspects of glucose metabolism; A1C measures chronic glycemia (during the previous 2–3 months), while FPG primarily reflects hepatic glucose output at the time of sampling. As expected, A1C identifies different individuals as diabetic than does FPG. Additionally, it was reported in a predominantly white cohort with low prevalence of obesity or diabetes that increments of A1C > 5.5% predict significantly increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, whereas FPG of 100–126 mg/dL does not.

Many U.S. minority populations have high rates of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. We recently reported that A1C alone identifies fewer diabetes cases than FPG, and neither FPG nor A1C alone can identify all diabetes cases. Because the Strong Heart Study (SHS) cohort had a high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes > 20 years ago, it serves as a model for other minority populations experiencing epidemics of these disorders. In this article, cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence by A1C category will be examined, and the value of A1C and FPG in predicting CVD will be compared.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115YEmVW]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (screening), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain screening for early abnormal glucose metabolism with dysglycemia using fasting glucose 110–125 mg/dL (6.1–6.9 mmol/L) or HbA1c 5.9–6.4% (41–47 mmol/mol).

### Performance of A1c for the classification and prediction of diabetes [^117NuHB7]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

Although A1C is now recommended to diagnose diabetes, its test performance for diagnosis and prognosis is uncertain. Our objective was to assess the test performance of A1C against single and repeat glucose measurements for diagnosis of prevalent diabetes and for prediction of incident diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We conducted population-based analyses of 12,485 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and a subpopulation of 691 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) with repeat test results.

RESULTS

Against a single fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, the sensitivity and specificity of A1C ≥ 6.5% for detection of prevalent diabetes were 47 and 98%, respectively (area under the curve 0.892). Against repeated fasting glucose (3 years apart) ≥ 126 mg/dl, sensitivity improved to 67% and specificity remained high (97%) (AUC 0.936). Similar results were obtained in NHANES III against repeated fasting glucose 2 weeks apart. The accuracy of A1C was consistent across age, BMI, and race groups. For individuals with fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl and A1C ≥ 6.5% at baseline, the 10-year risk of diagnosed diabetes was 88% compared with 55% among those individuals with fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl and A1C 5.7– < 6.5%.

CONCLUSIONS

A1C performs well as a diagnostic tool when diabetes definitions that most closely resemble those used in clinical practice are used as the "gold standard". The high risk of diabetes among individuals with both elevated fasting glucose and A1C suggests a dual role for fasting glucose and A1C for prediction of diabetes.

### Impaired glucose metabolism in patients with diabetes, prediabetes, and obesity is associated with severe COVID-19 [^116uUWLc]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Identification of risk factors of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for improving therapies and understanding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis. We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. The majority of patients with COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), or a body mass index > 30 with normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared with non-diabetics. Severe COVID-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, preDM, and obesity. COVID-19 is associated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe COVID-19 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism. Exploration of pathways by which SARS-CoV-2 interacts glucose metabolism is critical for understanding disease pathogenesis and developing therapies.

### Postchallenge glucose, A1c, and fasting glucose as predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a 10-year prospective cohort study [^116SdLGV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Early detection of high risk for type 2 diabetes is fundamental for prevention of diabetes and associated cardiovascular complications. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are currently used for diagnosis of high-risk glucose levels below the diabetic range. The International Expert Committee proposed A1C ≥ 6.5% as a diagnostic tool for diabetes in 2009 and in January 2010 an intermediate range of A1C 5.7–6.4% (elevated A1C) was proposed by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to detect individuals at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

To date, however, limited data exist to support the use of A1C in predicting type 2 diabetes. Importantly, the long-term predictive power of elevated A1C as defined above has not yet been investigated. Previous data on the association between A1C and incident type 2 diabetes in unselected populations have relied on self-reporting, fasting glucose measurements, and use of antidiabetes medication to determine the outcomes. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has not been used to determine the outcome.

Deterioration of glucose homeostasis reflects a continuum of glycemia, some of which is reversible if detected early. Importantly, the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased already before glycemia reaches the levels of diabetes, and 2-h glucose appears to be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than fasting glucose. Recently, A1C was shown to be a better predictor of CVD than fasting glucose.

Data directly comparing 2-h glucose and A1C as long-term predictors of new-onset cardiovascular disease are scarce, and results are controversial. Therefore, we compared A1C, 2-h glucose, and fasting glucose as predictors of type 2 diabetes, CVD, and CVD mortality during a prospective population-based study with a 10-year follow-up.

### Recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of diabetes: a comprehensive review [^112nkdKM]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

T2DM is the most common type of diabetes so that it develops in more than 90% of all cases. The main reason for developing T2DM is the impaired secretion of insulin by pancreatic β‑cells, generally because of insulin resistance in adipose tissue 1 (BOX 1), liver, skeletal muscle, and liver.

Prediabetes occurs before hyperglycemia, which is a high-risk situation that predisposes subjects to the development of T2DM. Prediabetes can be determined by one of the following conditions: elevated glycated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) levels, and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT). Cases with IFG levels are specified by Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) measures greater than normal. IGT is characterized by impaired late insulin secretion after a meal and insulin resistance in muscles. People with prediabetes have HbA1c amounts between 5.7 and 6.4%. The rates of annual conversion of prediabetes to T2DM are from 3 to 11% per year.

T2DM is heritable and the probable risk of getting T2DM is higher among siblings of a T2DM patient than in families without any T2DM patient. The risk of getting T2DM is higher when the mother has this disease in comparison with when the father has it. Also, the risk of T2DM is noticeably elevated with a non‑normal fasting glucose concentration of > 5.5 mmol.l –1 or a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30. The genetic studies revealed a Single‑Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in TCF7L2, CDKAL1, SLC30A8, CDKN2A, FTO, HHEX, CDKN2B, GCKR, IGF2BP2, and many others in T2DM cases. However, these genetic variants only elevate the risk by 10–20%. T2DM detection can be assessed based on FPG levels, increased plasma glucose test, 2‑hour post‑glucose‑load glucose level, or HbA1c. Moreover, there is a linear correlation between cardiovascular disease and glycemia with no obvious threshold. The risk of developing distal symmetric peripheral polyneuropathy and diabetic nephropathy is raised with hyperglycemia lower than those accompanied by diabetic retinopathy.

### Postchallenge glucose, A1c, and fasting glucose as predictors of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease: a 10-year prospective cohort study [^113JrgX1]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We compared A1C, a recently proposed indicator for high risk of diabetes, with the currently used 2-h and fasting glucose as predictors of incident type 2 diabetes and CVD during 10 years. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the recently proposed range of elevated A1C (5.7–6.4%) with both 2-h and fasting glucose, measuring the outcome with an OGTT. Furthermore, data comparing A1C and 2-h glucose regarding future cardiovascular risk are scarce and have been focused on mortality and yielded controversial results. Here, we examined outcome of individuals with new CVD presenting to a tertiary care center, thereby adding important evidence to the use of A1C as a predictor of incident macrovascular complications in those without a history of diabetes.

Different markers detected different individuals at risk of diabetes. Importantly, a marked amount of diabetes was preceded by elevation in one of the glycemic markers only, with limited overlap among the three. Fasting and 2-h glucose reflect different pathophysiological mechanisms of abnormal glucose homeostasis. The pathophysiology of isolated IFG includes reduced hepatic insulin sensitivity, β-cell dysfunction, and reduced β-cell mass. With isolated IGT, peripheral insulin sensitivity is reduced with a near-normal hepatic insulin sensitivity and progressive loss of β-cell function. In contrast with acute-phase markers, A1C is a widely used marker of chronic glycemia, reflecting average blood glucose levels over 2–3 months.

Our results lend support to the recent suggestion that an intermediate range of A1C may indicate high risk for type 2 diabetes, particularly if combined with fasting glucose. The range of A1C used in previous studies assessing the risk of future diabetes has varied, and elevated risk has been shown in ranges between 5.5 and 6.5%. A1C of 5.6–6.4% carried a hazard ratio of 13.7 for use of antidiabetes drug treatment at 3 years in Japanese, lending support to our findings in a similar range, but with a markedly longer follow-up period in our study. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of the nondiabetic A1C range and incident type 2 diabetes, as measured by an OGTT, in which the recently proposed A1C range of 5.7–6.4% has been evaluated.
